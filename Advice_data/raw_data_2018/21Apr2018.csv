0,"I live in a mid-low income neighborhood, just to be near my university’s campus. All year I’ve had two kids that have came to my door, and would ask if I had work for them to do. At first I gave them some chores like picking up sticks around the yard, rake leaves, nothing too major. 

The kids started trying to up their price on me, I originally gave them $5 each, when in reality they both had a $2.50 level of effort in the chores, that’s being generous too. Recently, the kids have been coming to my house late all around the clock, around 12 AM or 10 AM. They keep trying to get rides off of me. The worse part is, they even window peek. 

Now in this house it’s just me and my girlfriend, so we were in the middle of having sex. The kids started knocking on the door, and we ignored them, they went to the window and peeked in where there was a crease in the blinds. They no doubt saw us, and I noticed the movement on the other side of the window. I went out and asked the kids what they wanted. 

“Can we get a ride, sir?” I asked them a general why/where question. “We just want a ride back home” I asked them where “home” is for them. Basically the directions they gave was in walking distance from my house. I feel kinda bad, but I told them no. I wasn’t going to give them a ride, and at the time, I was pissed at them because they killed the intimacy of the moment with me and the girlfriend. 

Anyways, skip ahead a few weeks later, and they’re back. Looking for work, I told them no, they wanted a ride, and I got irritated and asked them why they keep asking for rides, and work. They told me that I’m “white and privileged” and that I likely “have money”. 

I set the record straight and said that I hardly have any money, as I’m a double major, and time as well. I also pointed out to them that I’m not trying to be egregious with expenses towards consumables, such as gas. I also pointed out to them that they’re cutting in on my privacy. 

They acted very rude about when I told them that I’m not giving rides to anyone I’m not familiar with. I also told them to stop coming to my house. 

A week and a half later, the kids were back, and woke me up when they pounded violently on my door, and tried turning the knob. This freaked the hell out of the girlfriend’s dog. My immediate reaction when waking up from my deep sleep was “we’re being robbed!”

I pulled my shotgun out of the closet, loaded the magazine, and went out of my room to investigate. The kids saw me with the gun, and flipped shit and ran. One of them, when running, screamed “HELP, somebody call the police we’re going to be murdered!” 

Now the police never arrived. The kids haven’t shown up to the house yet, but I can’t help but feel like these kids are going to retaliate. For the record, they’re teenagers. I also never pointed the gun at them, just an LED light. Also in my state, simply having a gun in plain sight isn’t considered brandishing, nor illegal. 

I just can’t help but feel like an ass, despite being in the right, on this situation. I guess they haven’t been back, so I guess that’s a plus.

1,"Since I was little I was always told how smart I am. My mother and father have always supported me with anything I've wanted to do in life, regardless of what it may be. Although I have never really been able to accept this, I always feel like people are telling me this because its something they say to kids. With my current girlfriend I always feel like I don't deserve her and she should be dating someone else, that is much better than I could ever be. Does anyone else feel like they are just worthless and not good enough for anyone or anything? or do I just lack self confidence? ",21Apr2018,1
2,"I am a student. A student who is  very confused and curious about many subjects. I constantly am pondering about how things are and why they are that way.

It was a few weeks ago when I saw something that stood out to me. I was goofing around with my online friends and they wanted to raid a discord group, I thought that I might as well join in since there is no reason I should be a sore thumb. I was surprised by what I saw next; there was gore filling up every channel in the discord group. Now I was thinking that this is probably a common thing for discord raids and shrugged it off. It was only after a week or so that I had brought the thoughts back up into my head and it was because of a project we were doing in research. It made me think back to all the gore I saw that one week ago and wonder to myself..... Why? It led to more questions that filled up in my head ultimately ending up being ""What reason do people have for doing messed up things like this?"" I thought hard on that question and it led me to another topic : Mental illnesses. I was wondering why anyone sane would choose to just do something so.... Inhumane to someone who breathed the same air or saw the same things that they did. Then it dawned on me. What if the person who did this wasn't sane? What if it Was a tiny voice in their heads that were telling them to do something like this and feel no remorse for it. Then I was lead into a chains of ideas that were similar to the topic that was mentioned before. I know that although people do stupid things that lead to regret and self hatred. I do want to know however what lead them to do this type of thing. Why they would do it if they were going to regret it later. Why they thought it was a good idea to not think of the other person and what it would be like if they were put into the same position before they did what they did. Ultimately just..... Why?",21Apr2018,2
3,"I get phone calls from an ‘unknown caller’ almost daily , when I answer it’s always just silence on the other end. I have stopped answering but I still get calls all of the time. I can’t block the number because no caller ID shows up. About a month ago I would regularly receive wrong number phone calls from a homeless shelter , the man would always ask for someone else and then apologize when I said that he had the wrong number. The frequency of the calls makes me wonder if it’s the same man, but I’m confused because I could always see which number he was calling from and he would always speak to me.  Is there any way I can figure out / stop whoever is calling me? ",21Apr2018,1
4,"So, I'm at a school that's too big to meld in with a totally different crowd, but too small to not know anyone. 


To give you some idea, I've been here for about 2 years now. I can't drink, I don't and have never had a reason to have a fake ID, and I don't trust anyone who says that they want to smoke weed, mostly because they aren't trustworthy people. I've been assaulted twice, shunned for my political choices, had drinks spilt on me at parties on purpose, and made to feel unwelcome by the majority of the people I live with outside of small talk or basic interactions. I have friends, but mainly they're in their 20s or 30s. 


The fact is I'm just out of my element by miles. Am I socially awkward? yes. Did I grow up around people whose only motivations were getting pussy and drinking like they had iron livers? Nope. I don't mind that that's their MO, but it's not mine and by and large that's just the kind of people I'm living around. I had a woman not talk to me for months only to iirc confess her love for me (bullshit) and say she was ""transferring"".. only to then go to a party a few dorms down. I've been told I can go to parties **by the people hosting**, but then refused a ride to go with people in a group because ""they don't know you"".

7,"I'm a 24 year old male, a virgin, I don't have any friends anymore and I'm generally a quiet person, the sort that only talks to somebody they don't know unless they absolutely have to.

Anyway I've probably been like this for about 10 years and I just feel like a socially inept creep, whenever I come across anyone particularly people of the opposite sex I can immediately sense their apprehension and I just don't know how I'm supposed to behave.

As soon as I see that familiar look in their eyes which normally comes after the first sentence I utter my heart sinks and I just want to disappear, I think my way of thinking has worsened over the last few years as expectations of me with regards to relationships/income rise due to my age.

""You're nearly 25?"" I've heard someone say to me, what else am I supposed to read into that other than shock that someone with: no social skills, no home of their own, no partner, no children, poor career prospects and seemingly nothing interesting about them is that far into their 20s while living in a first world country.

I haven't considered suicide but I just feel terrible knowing that I have no reason to feel like this because they are people in this world that have had a far less fortunate start to life than me.

Has anyone else here felt like this?",21Apr2018,2

9,"This is going to be long and I’m on mobile so sorry in advance. So where do i start? Ill start by saying that I’m 21 [m]. In the fall of this year i became friends with a girl, we’ll call her kim. I instantly had a crush on her from when we first hung out, but she has a boyfriend so i never acted on any feelings, just stayed friends. We grew pretty close after a month or two, one night we cuddled and flirted a lot. After that my roommate had a talk with her not to mess with my feelings because I’m a sweet guy and he figured she wouldn’t actually do anything with me. So she backed off and it was smooth sailing besides an occasional flirty joke or slightly revealing snapchat. Later this year she started dropping a lot of hints, i tried to ignore them or brush them off. But one night we were cuddling on the couch and finally she looked at me and bit her lip and i went for it. Fast forward to this week, we have been have a ton of sex for about 4 weeks now, and this week we both admitted we love each other. Sounds good right but remember kim has a boyfriend that she sees ever few weeks and still loves. We never meant to catch feeling for each other, she just wanted to take my virginity and move on after a week. So now we’re here, I’m at a total loss right now because i have never been in love before. She has already made plans with her current boyfriend to move in together next fall. Right now we plan on “breaking up” this summer when we move apart but she has already mentioned making excuses to see me all summer. I honestly don’t know what I’m asking here but has anyone been in mine or her situation? Cheating on someone and loving both of them or loving someone and having to break up with them anyways? The anticipated heartbreak is killing me right now. Part of me wants to end it but i feel like I’m in too deep. Theres also a very small chance she would leave him but I’m not counting on it, nor should i get my hopes up. Had anyone been in love and had to break up and then moved on? Will i be able to? I have honestly never really been interested in anyone else. I even downloaded some dating apps but I instantly compare everyone else to her and in dont think i could even think about being with anyone else for a long time. If anyone has any similar stories or suggestions that would be great. Obviously we’re both shitty for doing this to the boyfriend I don’t need judgement at this point, and this guy will never know about any of this. Thanks for hearing me out.",21Apr2018,1
10,"I am 16 years old, going to highschool, living in Canada, Ontario, using public transit, thinking about going to closer school once school finishes for the year.

My sister is currently 19 years old, working part-time jobs, using my father's car and eating/sleeping at our house. 

As far as I know, she quit school, does no chores, does not listen to our parents and talks back is close to all conversations. When she wants something, she yells.

My parents are caring people, once my sister turned 18 and increased the trouble she is giving our parents, I suggest the idea of kicking her out. My father's mentality is, ""keep giving until you are basically dead"". My mother's mentality is, ""its your father's decision"".

The dog is a loving 5-month old, close to 6 Labrador-husky mix. I don't know anything else after that. He does not aggressively bite (just chews your hand) and bark at strangers. His main goal is to eat and play, just like most dogs. His daily schedule is to wait for me to wake up at 6am, let him out in the backyard to do his business while I eat, feed him and back in the crate. Once I get home, I let him outside while I eat, feed him after and back into the crate.

I did not ask to take care of the dog and I am not willing to change my entire lifestyle to care for a dog. I am trying to save it's life the way I can, by taking him to a better place, a better home, a better family.

Approximately 3 months ago, my sister brought home a dog from a breeder (she does not tell us the location) without parental consent, no such discussion. The entire day she was talking about a dog, I am stressed in school and after it. During the evening, she comes home with a Labrador-Husky puppy. Immediately, I utter ""no"" multiple times and think that it is impossible to take care of it. A few months later, the dog does not receive much attention from her. It is just a few quick hello's, no such schedule for walking. She only buys him food and takes him to the veterinarian. I expressed multiple times that she is ruining the dog's life by not properly taking care of it. My parents and I all agree that she cannot even take care of herself, so why a dog. She refuses to give the necessary information to be able to give the dog to a shelter. She asks for the full price of the dog if it was to be taken there, but you can't even get to this step.

Should I compile the necessary evidence needed to go to court? If my parents were to kick my sister out, what would be the process? I need help with looking through Canadian Ontario Law.

Edit: added more dog schedule and paragraph after it.",21Apr2018,1
12,"Hi. I currently am an assistant manager of a shoe store. It's not doing too great. It stresses me out a lot. I work 12-9 3 days a week and 3-9 the other 2. I'm always tired and stressed about how the store is doing. I've been eating poorly and gaining weight and feeling gross. Idk. I just can't go 20 minutes without thinking of the store.

I make $10 an hour.

There is a janitor job at the local university for $10.89 an hour. I applied. Idk. Being a janitor sounds terrible, but I think it would be low stress (in the sense that if I do my job well that's it and I won't have to like stress about the future of my job). It would be 2:30-11. Classes end at 5 most the time. I think I would be able to listen to music and just do my job and my stress would go down a lot. But being a janitor has a very bad stigma.

13,"Background story:
I'm a person that does not have a lot of friends but I really care about the ones I have. I'm the one you can call anytime and I will always be there for my friends.


Throwback to my younger years: I had some ""friends"" I used to meet a lot. We had fun togehter and enjoyed each others company (at least I think so). The things is that it felt like it was always on THEIR condition. They never initiated anything, I was always  the one who asked if they wanted to hang out - and we did have fun every time we met. I got sick of that the relationsship we had wasn't mutal so I stopped asking them, we stopped talk and haven't talked since then.


Today: I've gotten to know new friends at University and I really feel that they are amazing persons and I deeply care about them. In this writing moment I would like to say that our relationsship are somewhat mutal. Especially one of them, he has been there for me during my ""unhappy moments"". We talked a lot and I felt like we got to know each other at a whole other level. I really don't want this realationship to end and I'm afraid that it would. 
We will ""go apart"" when school ends this semester, and I would like to maintain and still be able to see them afterwards. 


I don't wanna feel like a burden and like constantly asking them if they want to do something. But I'm afraid that if I don't - the relationsship will face the same destiny as those earlier in my life. I guess that I need some advice on how to handle this.

I, now, realize how hard it was for people to watch me going through these thoughts but I don't know how to care for him anymore. What can I do for him?

19,"Hi y'all.

So I am thinking of taking out a loan to pay for off-campus residence for my last year. I commute 1.5-2 hours each way via the MTA (and everyone knows how notorious it is for delays/problems) in NYC, and it's been killing me. The biggest source of stress for me is commuting, and I just don't know how I will be able to enjoy my senior year studying for a major I love while getting anxious riding the train not knowing if it's gonna arrive at my stop on time. In addition, most classes I'm taking are in the evening (only available option), and riding the train home late at night is crazy. Plus it messes up with my sleeping schedule. 

I have lived abroad for a year in Japan where the commute to school was only 10-15 minutes, and I also took classes at a local CUNY community college for a semester after I came back. I have considered transferring to a CUNY that's 30-40 minutes away from my home, but:

1) If I do so, I'm guaranteed to spend an extra semester or two. That school has different requirements, and I would have to take more credits for my major over there based on their syllabi. I'm already on the path to graduating on time at my current school.
2) I would lose my scholarship. The main reason why I commute is because I'm part of an honors program and I get offered a scholarship every year that covers 2/3rd of the tuition. My parents pay for the rest, and it's a huge relief for them to receive financial aid from the scholarship. 
3) I would have to keep living at home. I don't have the best living situation due to toxic relationships and family issues here. I feel incredibly stuck living here. I never relax especially on the weekends (shit with my father happens every weekend). When I was abroad, it felt so good to finally just focus on myself and not worry about my family's troubles. I do understand that there's a possibility of me needing to live with my parents after graduation, but that depends on the job salary I receive after school. (My major is Environmental Science) Plus I don't have intentions of living in NYC after graduation. I am interested in moving, or doing PeaceCorps.
4) I would have to adapt to a whole new different environment. I love my campus community and the friends I've made there, too. 

So, is it worth taking out a loan? I'm looking at a 10k MAX. I have been applying to various summer programs that offer pay, and could try to save up money from the summer to help me pay. I am already looking for roommates. I just want to keep my sanity in tact and to finally enjoy a commute-less year, but debt is just scary to encounter in general. Note: I have a 1.4k~ loan, it was 4k when I took it out as a safety net for study abroad.

21,"This isn't a place where I want to be criticized because i have already gone through my whole self-pitying and down on myself phase. Now I just want to move on.

Here is my situation:
I am 23 and I live with my parents with an older sibling. I tried sneaking my boyfriend into my room (they know about him) and they caught me. My dad threatened me with a sword to bring him to my dad and they told my boyfriend to go home and they yelled at me. My dad took it personally saying I stabbed him in the back, he can't trust me again, he sacrificed for me and this is how i repay him, yada yada yada. My mom was more questioning why I would do that when they always let him inside the house. I apologized to them but obviously it didn't matter. They were mad. They blamed me more than they blamed my boyfriend. 
A week later, I apologized to them very vulnerably and maturely. Said that i'm sorry for taking advantage of the home they gave me and I should see everything they give me as a luxury as opposed to a necessity. I said I was sorry and i'll work hard to get their trust back even if they don't believe me. They didn't say anything after, they just looked back at their laptops and I left.
Fast forward: It's been 3 weeks since it happened and now my dad puts a bar (something we've always had) on the door whenever i come home so I have to ring the doorbell to be LET IN whenever I want to enter the house coming home from work. This is the 3rd day he's done it and I think it's a passive aggressive way for him to imply that he doesn't want me to freely enter this house on my own, I always have to be let in like a guest. 
My mom talks to me now and she said she'll talk to my dad to see why he does that, but I'm just getting so fed up. I know I fucked up but I'm his daughter and he's completely ignoring my existence. Seems like he deaded me tbh. 
I'm asian so this is an asian household with a VERY prideful and stubborn dad who holds grudges like nobody's business. 
Honestly, I've been contemplating leaving home and just crashing at a friend's but I don't want to make the situation any worse, but it seems like it's not getting better and I should just get out of their hair. ",21Apr2018,3
22,"So I want to start this off by saying that I'm not trying to use any of these girls. I was totally honest with all of them. They all know that I'm talking to other girls, and they all know that they aren't going to date me. I guess they think they can change me? I told them up front that I wasn't interested in anything serious. I'm also about to be super fucking shallow, so if that bothers you don't read on. 
So girl #1 is my ex. She's probably one of the most attractive girls I've ever met in my whole life. Amazing personality. We vibe VERY well. I broke up with her because she needed to get her shit together, and I felt like I was a distraction. We've talked about getting back together at some point, and I think I'm still in love with her. 
Girl #2 is a psych student. Again, probably one of the most attractive girls I've ever met in my whole life. She spends a lot of time trying to psychoanalyze me, which I hate because I deal with some severe mental illnesses (bipolar). I feel like she wants to fix me and it's really annoying. She's cancelled on me 4 times now, but maintains that she's still interested. It's way too much bullshit to deal with honestly and I kind of want to drop her but I don't know how. She's also mute, and I don't sign, so I don't know how we would communicate if we were to date.
Girl #3 is a girl I met on a dating app. We vibe really well actually, spent like 2 hours on the phone a couple days ago. Her personality is great but I found her instagram and she's just...well, I'll just say it. She's flat out ugly. I can't bring myself to go from a 10 to a 4. Call me an asshole. I can't do it. She is also a psych student (funny how I attract those) but doesn't try to act as a therapist, thankfully. I'd like to maybe keep her on as a friend but if I'm being real she's too unattractive for me to date.
Girl #4 is also a girl I met on a dating app. She is bland, uninteresting, and we do not vibe at all. She is moderately attractive but nowhere near girls #1 or #2. I actually deleted her number but she texted me and I replied to it, not knowing who it was, so I'm stuck talking to her again. We have plans for Saturday night, unfortunately. We've only talked for a couple days and she's already gotten super clingy, she hits me up multiple times a day while I'm at work. I'm trying to communicate disinterest but she's not really picking up on it. I think she's just lonely.
I should mention that bipolar-wise, I've been pretty unstable lately, which probably has a lot to do with this. I have no idea what to do. I need to drop most, if not all of them, but I don't know how to do that without being a dick. Help.",21Apr2018,0

24,"So I've been saving up during my undergrad by living at home and working part time. My original plan was to use all the money to pay for my grad school tuition which should be around $25k plus living expenses etc. I don't have any loans cause my family has been helping out, but they've kinda said it's going to stop after I finish undergrad. 

I've been toying with moving south for grad school since I'm on my wits end with my parents and I hate all the snow where I live now. I generally just need a new start. Houses where I'm looking are dirt cheap. I could get a really nice house for $150k. Even if I got a condo that'd be fine. I just hate the idea of all my money going to rent.

My dilemma is should I use $25k to go to school debt free, or put a down payment on a house? I originally just really wanted to get grad school over with, but they do suggest a few years of work experience first. I just know that if I stop, it'll be hard to go back.

Anyway, at the beginning of this week, she knew i really wanted to go to the beach w her (when we hang all we do is get food and eat/talk in the car, nothing else). She said if she didn’t have volleyball practice on saturday, we will go to the beach together. I got happy but, of course, she had practice.

Today, after school, her and her friend goes to the beach. Like she can’t plan to go to the beach with me ever, but she can suddenly go with her friend? I’ve been asking forever. Not only that, she told me she’s going to skip practice tomorrow to go to a pool party. So she’d skip practice for a pool party (it isnt a birthday or anything just a random party), but she wouldn’t do it for a day at the beach with me. It just bothered me a lot and i’m pissed rn. Last week, i said “lets see a movie” and she instantly responded with “no” even though i didnt even say a movie. The next day, she goes to a movie with one of her friends.

Me: Awww it's so cute when kids try so hard (I call anyone kid who texts like that for some reason)

&lt;they keep replying with similar things as before&gt;

Me: Want some fuck?

Me: Wanna be top or bottom?

There was more, but as I said this is what led to the awkwardness.

I don't know what to do, I feel that since this kid doesn't know boundaries and decided to show my manager and boss the convo thinking it was funny makes me feel awkward because I feel like they must think I'm some kind of pedo or something. I don't know how to explain to them that I'm not (they are older than me by the way and don't find what find humorous to be funny).

What should I do?

29,"At this point I'm actually desperate. My country is in danger and the police forces and local gangs hired by the government are killing tons of people. I don't know how to contact either international media or countries in general to expose the situation to them and actually make a call for help.

People are dying everywhere in the capital at the moment, people who were pacifically protesting to make their own voices heard. Protesters who were aggresively attacked by the forces and they went to where they were taking refuge to finish them off.

I don't know what to do, I don't know how to call for help. Media is completely controlled (using a vpn atm) and phone calls are probably being monitored so I can't risk making one. The media who were actually doing reports were censored and only the fake news are coming to light on a national level. I need guidance, I want to ask for help outside, this is a direct violation not only to this country's constitutional rights, but also to human rights.

I'm not asking for you to get involved directly, I'm not asking for donations, I just need a way to get immediate contact to international media.",21Apr2018,1
30,"Not sure if there is a better sub for this. If so, please feel free to direct me to the right place.

Anyway, I work at a research company and we are currently running an outdoor plant producing activated carbon in a giant multiple hearth furnace. My job as feed operator is to ride a man lift up to the top of the furnace and dump coal into the feed hopper. I am wearing a CO monitor to measure CO. Our furnace is quite old (build in the 30s) and is not exactly air tight and it is putting out quite a bit of CO. The first two times I have gone up to feed the hopper my monitor is alarming at 260-340ppm CO. It takes me about 5-7 minutes to finish my job up there meaning I am being exposed to 260-340ppm CO for 5-7 minutes every hour.

My question is simply this... Is this safe? I haven't begun to show any symptoms yet but its the beginning of my 12hr night shift and I am worried that repeated hourly exposures to CO that high could be a problem. Could anyone qualified to assess this situation please advise?

31,"So my dad recently moved to another city (10 hours away), I didn't really care much because I and my dad aren't very close (I'm 15). But I went to visit him like a month ago and I really liked the environment of the city and I've been thinking of moving over there a lot because of some reasons:

1st: I'm sick of where I'm currently living in: It's not a bad place or anything but it's just that my social life will probably never improve here. I have friends and I get invited to things and stuff but everyone I know looks at me like if I were an idiot or just as someone that they can take advantage of, and I'm pretty sick of it. Now, most people will probably tell me to look for new friends but the problem is that I live in a place where everyone knows each other. No joke whatever you do everyone will know. And everyone is already taken me as an idiot who doesn't play sports or does other things like that. And since he lives in a bigger city it's most likely that there are tons of people living there. Not only that but there are twice the things to do there than there are here.

Not only that but I think I could deal with leaving all of my friends behind, I've done it many times because I'm someone who has studied in a lot of different schools and lived in two cities already, so I'm used to it.

2nd: I could learn how to drive a car: Since my mom is too busy and can't afford a car my dad would pretty much encourage me to drive if I lived with him.
3rd: The environment of the city: I live in Mexico and all of my life I've wanted to live in a place like the U.S (or the U.S), and the place where my dad lives is exactly like it, It's like a 2-hour drive to Houston and we could also set a plan to California. The apartment also has a gym so I'd be doing something.

4th: I want to meet new people: One of my childhood friends lives there which would be great because my apartment is literally beside his school, and I think I want to meet new people, it's not that the people here aren't great, I've met some great guys and gals around here but I just feel like I'm a tool to them sometimes.

And these are the reasons why I'm thinking of staying:
1st: My dad is an overprotecting bomb: That's bad because I like going out a lot.
2nd: My dad will have to be the only economic resource I have, which will probably anger him (It's not like I look at him like if he was a bank or anything but it's just the fact that I like to keep in touch with watching movies on the cinema, so in a worst case scenario I'd watch more than two movies a week, and in the best case scenario I'd watch a movie every 1 to 2 months).
3rd: I like a girl here and I honestly don't know what to do if I didn't see her, she became one of my best friends and she's pretty chill. The only problem is that she has a boyfriend and she has insinuated me that I'm like a brother to her so that's why I'm deciding to take my distance.

So there say whatever you want to I don't care.",21Apr2018,1

35,"Back story: I met a girl at work two and a half years ago and we became SUPER CLOSE. I’m 30 and she is 22. I love this girl to death (still). We both got pregnant at the same exact time and she had her son 4 days before me. Our kids would hang out a lot (they’re one now) and we would do a lot of things together. We were always really close and talked a lot at work about our lives. Truly my best friend. 
So two weeks ago, I walk into work and it stinks. Like rotting food/ dead animal stink. I call the maintenance people and they say they will have someone come check it out when they can (large company so not that many people available right away) so it stinks like allllll day. We end up going to a different cubie so we don’t have to smell it. Well after lunch someone figured out it was my friends broccoli in her garbage can. I laughed SO HARD because I thought it was hilarious. (I was NOT laughing at my friend or making fun of her at all) I thought the whole situation was funny. Well, since then she will not talk to me. At all. We have talked (only about work) twice in the past two and a half weeks. Like what. The. Hell?! I’ve texted her twice apologizing for laughing so hard and I may have taken it too far. Then the second text telling her look I care about you and NEED to know you’re okay and I really hope nothing else bad is going on in your life but again, nothing. My heart hurts. I miss her. But I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m honestly giving up at his point. I feel like if the issue she has with me was because I laughed then she needs to come out and tell me that. I didn’t think it was a big deal and I feel this is childish and petty. Am I wrong? Am I a bad person?

However, more often than not, they begin to stop talking to me. its ok, ill let them have their space if they need it. However, whenever i confront them later and try to start a conversation, they become really hostile and rude. for example, there is a guy i know, lets name him ian. ian used to tell me i was one of his favorite people. now when i tell him i like his shirt he says ""great now i cant wear this shirt anymore."" ok, he's probably just messing with me. i start to ask how his day was, and he interrupts me to tell me that ""nobody wants to talk to you."" Oh. That really hit me. Im not typically rude nor do i know how to be rude. so i just leave them alone and talk to my one or two real friends. This is happening with almost everyone i know. I really need to know why this is happening. i asked ian why he hates me and he said ""because You're [u/trainer_orange]"" and no matter how hard i pry nobody tells me.

37,"TL;DR: Should I ask a previous partner who I have stopped talking to if they have an STD?

I have been sick a lot recently and am scared I have an STD.  Last time I hooked up with someone was 2 months ago and we have since stopped talking completely \(mutual decision but it was awkward because she did want to continue seeing me afterwards \- we only slept together twice\).  I'm getting tested anyways, but I want to ask her if she was clean at the time because we didn't discuss it in detail properly.

I want to say: ""Hi \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I'm really sorry to bug you again but I really need the peace of mind.  I have been sick a lot recently and I went to see a doctor and he referred me to get STD screened and suggested I ask partners as well.  I know I'm being very paranoid and despite this being awkward as fuck, when was the last time you were tested and were you negative for everything at the time?""

38,"my boyfriend is very sweet, and we love each other very much. he is very caring and honest, and i am glad i am in a relationship with him. 

however i have recently noticed that he is rude to other people. he goes out of his way to belittle them, challenge their self-worth and intelligence, degrade them, etc. in my opinion, this behavior isn’t necessary, and it honestly annoys/hurts me to see him talk to people like that. 

i have talked to other people about this and they have told me that i make a big deal out of it. 

i confronted him today and he said he was sorry and told me that making fun of others was his only way of interaction. he told me that he doesn’t make fun of others unless he knows it’s “good fun”. that he doesn’t make fun of those who “don’t appreciate it”. he likes to think that he is “aware of other people’s boundaries”. i think this sounds pathetic in all honesty. why joke around in the first place? why assume that everyone is alright with it? even if they were, why use belittlement as your *only* method of interaction? (this may be because of his self esteem issues. but does that really excuse his actions? he is also very smart and likes to rub that in other people’s faces. maybe he wants to feel more superior than others?) i have had people tell me that his statements have hurt them. 

in the end, i ended up telling him that i understood that i was the one to blame. that my perspective on the matter wasn’t the best and that i was sorry. 

i am not the one receiving the hate, but it hurts me nonetheless. but am i making a big deal out of it? should i be the one apologizing? sigh. i honestly don’t know what to do about this. i love him but this really bothers me.",21Apr2018,1

41,"I'm a college student right now looking for some good advice on how to handle a situation.  I'm a devoted Christian and have grown up in a very conservative, Christian area my whole life.  Most of the people I've ever had as friends or hung out with are also Christian.  I've been in a class this semester with a girl who moved to my state recently and isn't that familiar with my area.  I've had the chance to socialize (to a limited extent) with her and a few other people in this class over the last few months, and we got around to talking about church and other things like that.  

Apparently, she went to a Catholic high school in the area, but says that she doesn't usually go to church with her family on Sundays because they're Catholic and she's Christian.  Please understand that I'm in no way intending to cast judgment on her.  She seems like a very nice person, but sometimes from what I see, she doesn't always act the way a believer should.  I honestly don't know much of anything about growing up with a Catholic background since my area is predominantly Christian Reformed.  

In short, I took advantage of an opportunity to invite her to a good church in my area if she ever wanted to go.  Honestly, I'm not interested in this person on a relationship level or anything like that (mostly because of lifestyle differences), so what is a good way to not lead her on to thinking that I have any type of interest like that.  I want to be kind and take advantage of an opportunity to reach out to people who need that kind of support, but at the same time, I don't want things to potentially go wrong.  Would it be wise to just come straight out and speak your intentions about this kind of thing, or if not, what would be a good way to just keep things more casual and not get her hopes up?  I've been praying for wisdom in how to deal with this, but if anyone has had experience with this kind of thing, I would appreciate your advice!

Thanks, and God Bless!

I didn't know this was a lol activity but I went along and they had a lot in common with me. We became immediate friends. And I stopped worrying about being trapped with a creepy group and started making friends. My friend Alyssa calls again and come to another event. I go again and I start to really merge into the group and want to keep going.

I start going every week, then every other day, and then every day. Eventually, I start participating in communal activities like managing soccer teams and fundraisers for lol. Fast forward and I caught the attention of the leader of the group.  He asked what I was looking for. I said I didn't know. He told me that he could I was lost and only find my way to a healthier life through the group. He asked if I want to be happy. I embraced this offer of happiness and really felt a connection between me and the leader (Anthony). He invited me to a ceremony and told me to wear a white dress and a white lingerie. I didn't want to wear only this but I didn't want to be difficult so I complied

I arrive at the ceremony I am invited to sit down. One by one he calls us to sit down and admit sins. When it was my turn I sat down and released everything. I was purged of my transgressions and then I knew the only way to achieve bliss was through the Anthony. I know Anthony is the way to bliss so I took up his next offer to join his commune. I live here now and don't have to worry about the daily son of wearing unholy clothes or eating the wrong food. 

My new life is full of complete bliss. I only have four sets of the right clothes of a white dress with a white lingerie. So I get to wear my ceremony clothes of a red revealing lingerie. 

Last week I was told to participate in active recruitment. I was my ceremony clothes for the monthly camping weekend and we show them the way to Anthony and the bliss of the leaders of love. Just yesterday I gave one of the male new members his gift of love after his initiation ceremony.

Anyway, three days ago I saw my sister and invited her to a regular recruitment session. Anthony saw her immediately and wanted to go into special recruitment sessions. I embraced the idea of Eveveen joining us and achieving bliss with us. she was worried about me saying I had changed but she went with Anthony and is saying she would like to come back. My mother is deeply worried about me and Eveveen but we are trying to convince her it's not a cult, but I worry for her and I want to listen to Anthony and get away from her sinful callings.

56,"Hello , 
My story is long and I really need a help .. If you think you can advice me please read it .
I am 22 years old  living in syria .. medical student and this my story ..
I have  stammer "" like  The king in King's Speech movie "" , living in syria with stammer is not good .. most people think you can't speak because you are scare and we know that is not true .
just to make this thing clear : a lot of people think if you have stammer  that mean you have a problem in your brain and thats make you stupid .. I am not stupid ( my friends and family say I am clever ) But I cant judge my self if I am clever or  not  .. anyway I know I am not stupid .. maybe you should know I won first place in chess tournament every time I participated  ( I just say that to make it clear that stammer have no link to I.Q . )
NOTE : I tried a lot to solve stammer problem but its like something temporarily and partially recoverable , not completely and permanently cured .
Being stammer  make me concern about my future .. always asking myself what I should work ? when I was 18 I finished the baccalaureate at a rate of 99.5% which mean here in syria I can study medicine ( in syria in that time you should get about 98.8% to study medicine ) because medicine here is  the most work make money and it has  a special kind of social value  (  I'm talking about The syrian culture ) , so I think a lot , then I said ok anyway  I have no desire to study anything else also no desire  to study medicine but its the best here so why not ?
Not a long time after I  realized that is no way for me to be a doctor .. I tried to think ( noo this is stupid you are smart and you can ) but let be honest I have no chance in this .. talking is a major thing in being a doctor cause you need to  rest assured the patient and  speak, cooperate and consult  with other doctors .. and maybe you will not have enogh time ! maybe it's an  emergency  !  when you intend to be a doctor you cant look like scare or you dont have the reliable answear for  your  patients .. you cant go to the  operations room and then start to talk stammering . 
you can't work in hospital and if you have your own clinic 90% of patients will not feel good to come to you 
I know that because I know people dont understand stammer and mostly will never do !
Conclusion : a person who have stammer like me have no chance to be a doctor (  take into consideration  that stammer vary from person to person and in my case it's bad enough  to prevent me to be a doctor .
I made my decsion I will not move back , I will get the graduation certificate and I will work in something else .. its not bad idea , in the end I am a doctor no one care if I am work as a doctor or not !
During that I fall in love with one of my colleagues , and we intend to marry when we get 23 , I swore that I will do anything to marry her so I will start working now , and that's what happened ,
 I got a great job opportunity  ( which I knew it will not last long ) so I started work hard with my study .. study medicine with full time work is not easy especially when living in syria where war is  in full swing , but I was ready to  Make the effort that it takes .. 3 years and I barely sleep barely  have a rest and I was ok with that because I was know this work will not last long .
After 3 years the work is over , I got some good cash cause I was trying to save as much as possible ( about 40k usd )
yeah it's a very good money in 3 years here in syria .
After that I intended to buy a shop and start my own work  .. 40k is not enough so I requested a debt from my old boss and because he worked with me for 3 years which make him know me good enough , he said yes and gave me 20k , He said I should pay back in 1 year and I agreed .
I bought a shop and found a supplier who accept to get paid after I start selling , he bring me goods worth about 3k .. work was very good so it took less than month to pay the 3k back , so he accept to raise the limit to 5k .. and in 3 months he suggested That  I should take large quantities and I can pay later , and I did ( about 10k ) . During this time I  saved 3k .
Not a long time later , an Explosion happend near my shop and I lost my shop and my goods .
I sold everything I can sell , I got about 4k + 3k I already saved , I paid them to the Supplier  and he tell he could wait sometime for the rest ( 3k ) but not a lot , my old boss told me will can't wait after the year end .
I AM NOT ASKING FOR MONEY , I Ask to advice me what should I do now after lost my work , my stock  and also have to pay 23k in 8 months ,  Taking into consideration normal jobs here pay 100-200$ monthly . Also I have no one  to lend me , banks here dont lend (they do but its not for me at least ) .
so let me make it clear :
1-  I have to pay 23k but I dont have a piaster of them + I dont have work + I dont have stock to start a work + any normal work here will pay 100-200$ monthly no more + my sweety stammer never allow me to work with 70% of works .
2- I have a lover who I promised her to merry her after 1 year ( and if you think this is not a real problem , let me tell you : it's most what I concern about and this love and promise mean to me a lot , and ofcurse it mean to her too ) , Last think I like to do in this world is to let down this girl .
3- Althought I am studying medecine but I cant work as a doctor .. and when you cant work using your university degree you have 2 choices : start your own work ( which need stock and I dont have it ) or work as worker which mean ( low Salary , no more than 200$ a month ) .
is there anything in the world I can do to save what rest of my life ?

57,"Hello Reddit, I'm using a throwaway account for privacy reasons. I've been receiving hate mail on my phone from somebody for the last couple of weeks. I'm trying to figure out who this person might be and I already have have some suspicions. 

This person has gotten sloppy in one of the photos they've sent me since I can quite clearly see their hand and the phone, and I've included a cropped version [here](https://imgur.com/a/3qR6eBv). Would anyone be able to help identify the brand or model for the phone? ",21Apr2018,1
58,Awhile ago I added this girl on Facebook. I was just going through the “People you may know” section and came across her. Very pretty and we had friends in common so I requested and she accepted. Never talked to her. Would like pics she posted or memes she’d upload. A couple of days ago she popped up on my tinder. I obviously swiped right. Nothing happened. Whether that’s because she didn’t swipe right on me or maybe she isn’t on there often? Who knows. Basically I’m debating as to whether I should say something to her now that I know she is presumably single. Thoughts?,21Apr2018,1
59,"In need of some advice. Been with my girlfriend for 6 years, lots of ups and downs. She’s great, been with me through a lot and is like my best friend. She would do anything for me and I know she loves me.

I’ve never been able to say to her that I love her, to me it’s something I say when I feel it, not a word i like to just throw around.

I’ve been on a trip in USA, went to coachella and met a girl I instantly felt strong feelings for, feelings I’ve never felt. We caught up a few times after chella and now I’m still thinking of her. We didn’t do anything that would betray my relationship and none of my thoughts about her are sexual. Usually when I see a pretty girl it’s just sex, like any normal guy. When I think of her I feel a rush, my heart beats, I struggle sleeping. I think of holding her, kissing her cheek, smelling her hair. These feelings are so strong.

What my next step. Do I tell my girlfriend how I’m feeling and pursue the girl I have feeling for? Do I see her again?

Thanks",21Apr2018,1
60,"I have really bad teeth. They are yellow (and yes, I do brush)because I have never been taken to the dentist before, since my dad said that its unnecessary. And it's not a money problem either. But the worse thing about them is that they are crooked.

REALLY CROOKED.

My top AND bottom rows are crowded and I have a slight overbite. I have two teeth in the top (one is a front tooth and the other is the one next to it; it is before the canine) that are really slanted. Just imagine, the top of my thumb could fit in the gap! I hate smiling for pictures, since, because they are so slanted, it makes me look like I am missing teeth. And I am constantly teased by this.

I am now a sophomore to-be junior in high school. I really want to get braces done and over with before entering college. I have begged my father since middle school. I even GAVE him my own money to get my teeth done. But its been 3 years since, and no progress. Every time I bring it up, he puts it off for later. He isn't busy either. He doesn't need to work and stays at home, spending his days sleeping and watching TV. 

What can I do? (P.S. Asking my mom is not an option. Asking relatives is also not an option. Reason? I don't have any).",21Apr2018,1
61,"I’m not a wimp, nor do I consider myself one. I weightlift 3-5 times a week. Out of high school. I’m decently muscular.But I find myself constantly getting disrespected at work.

I get that you should be able to laugh at yourself and I’m an absolute pro at it, but there comes a point where I get disrespected so many times that it becomes mentally draining. It’s almost constant. We make fun of each other at work, but I know for sure I get it more often. I only make fun of someone if Im made fun of first. I also get that some people don’t mean harm by it, but there are a few people that join in that I know mean harm. It’s kinda like a friend making fun of you vs an asshole you hate(and they hate you too) making fun of you.

Some examples is I absolutely hate being touched, so a few people constantly hug the shit out of me. I don’t like my nipples getting touched, yet they constantly try to purple nurple me.(sounds funny when typing it) I constantly get told they think my mother and sister are hot. I’m constantly told i’m fat (in shape with a small guy)I’m constantly made fun of being a virgin. Made fun of for driving a “mom vehicle.” They always call me gay(i’m not) saying I probably take dick in my ass. They draw dicks in my books. Say I have no friends. Called a nazi because I have blond hair and blue eyes. Worst of all they constantly make fun of how I fuck up my sentences a lot, and it gets annoying every time they correct me.

62,"After a bad breakup in October I met a girl on a dating app in December, let's call her J, and we began a friends with benefits situation.  We see each other about once a week and I genuinely enjoy her company, the sex is great, we like a lot of similar music and TV shows, her cat loves me, etc...  Although we see each other once a week, we text pretty frequently throughout the day and I'm sure there have only been a few days since we ""matched"" that I have not texted with her.  As I've gotten to know her better, I have realized that she needs some help and I am a very empathetic person and care about her, so I am wondering what options there are for her and how I can help.  
She has basically no support system, at all.  Her parents are both drug addicts and not involved in her life although they sometimes send her money.  She grew up poor and never went to camp or anything like that, and got her 2-year associates degree while working full time so she did not meet people in college either.  She literally has 50 Facebook friends.  Like some people complain that they have no friends but this girl actually has no friends.  
Because of her abusive drug-addict parents she obviously had a messed-up upbringing and has diagnosed CPTSD.  Her insurance through her job (that she actually got fired from today) does not cover therapy and she cannot afford to pay out of pocket for that.  
That brings me to my next point, she lost her (good, decent-paying, salaried) job today.  She is very smart, she knows a lot of code languages and has a computer science associates degree, but we live in a very competitive major metropolitan area where most people have masters degrees.  
She is also an alcoholic, and told me a few weeks ago that she drinks until she blacks out basically every night of the week including work nights.  
Because of her shitty upbringing she just like, doesn't know things. She doesn't know like how to use credit cards, she doesn't think that saving for retirement is important, she doesn't know how to drink responsibly, she has never taken one of her pets to the vet because she can't afford it. I know it's not my job to teach her but I want to be her friend and I don't want her to like fail in life.  I feel like I'm the only person who gives a shit about her, and we've known each other for like 4 months!  I know her, but in a much more real sense I barely know her at all!  Just wondering if there are any suggestions of how I can help or services I can recommend.  ",21Apr2018,1

64,"First off let me say that I am madly in love with this man and from what I get back from him I'm feeling like he is just as crazy about me. He is absolutely amazing to me and I'm extremely happy with him , I do have one hang up tho...... he talks about his ex wife all the time! My man and I have been together for only 7 months but we fit and are planning on getting married next year. So man and his ex wife split up for the first time almost 2 years ago bc she had an affair and was in love with someone else. Fast forward to a year after there separation ex wife breaks up with new boyfriend and now wants man to come back and try to make things work for the kids (3 kids). He decides to try to give it a go so he has no regrets on the fact that he didnt try and at the time he said he was still in love with her. They get a place together , 3 weeks into them living at the new place exwife decides that she want to move her last boyfriend into the house that man and her just moved into and she kicks man out.  So with this all being said my man and I met 3 months after all this happened and we just clicked . Our kids get along and we are head over heals in love . This is where things are odd to me tho, so obviously he has contact with his ex because they have children together but he trys to keep it to a minimum and only talk about the kids because they dont get a long most of the time. I know she did some messed up things and broke his heart but he hates her with a passion. Talks shut about her all the time ( not around the kids) and talks about how he wants her to be miserable because she drug him through the dirt more than once. I get it he is upset and hates her but then he will say things like he did tonight.  I'm 5 foot 9inc. Tall and weigh around 140 , I work out 3 times a week and eat healthy 95% of the time. This is what he say "" we should both get really fit and you should dress in a really sexy baiting suit and have exwife come over so she can see how amazing you look so she feels even worse about herself"". Hmmmmm no, I got defensive about it and he said I took it the wrong way but he seems to be focusing alot of energy on hating her and trying to make her jealous witch makes me feel like there may still be somthing there. I dont want to be used as a fucking tool to make his exwife jealous,  that's a waste of my time and I dont care enough about her to do anything like that. So the question is , am I overreacting? Am I looking to deep into this? Or is this literally how someone who has been fucked over so many times reacts towards an ex??",21Apr2018,1

68,"I'm in the market for buying a new car. This would be my first car. I booked an appointment with a dealer and had a test drive. I spoke to a few dealers in my area and found this dealer with the least price. He gave me a price of $19,800 on the phone and I thought there would be more room for negotiation at the dealership. I tried negotiating after the test drive and the salesman said $19,750 is the best he could do. When I tried asking for a lower price, he brought in his manager.

This is where things started getting rough. The manager asked me why did I come to his dealership as there were many others nearby and said it's because I know that this is the best price. I told him I was hoping there would be more room for negotiation. He asked me to give him a number and I avoided doing that because that is the car buying advice everyone gave me and I'm new to this. He kept pressing me for a number and I gave him $18,500. I intentionally low balled and I thought that would be just a starting point for negotiation and not an actual price. He started telling me about how not everyone can afford an expensive car and that's ok and I should probably look at lower models.(I don't have any problem with affording it and actually have a pre-approved loan from my bank for $22,000)

Honestly, that pissed me off a little bit.(Am I being an egoistic a**hole here?) I told him this is the model I want. He said I look like an intelligent guy and I already know there is no way he can lower the price by $1300. I told him he asked for a number and I gave him and now he should give me his number and he went back to $19,750. It had been 45 minutes by now and maybe I'm wrong in the way I said this but, I said 'There is nothing stopping me from going to another dealership and asking for a lower price'. He said if I ask for the same price he offered me, they'll tell me to have a nice day. And he said if I come back to him, he'll go to $20,000 and I'm basically gambling off the $250 difference.  

That just made me lose all interest and I told him I would actually like to gamble that $250.He extended his hand and I shook it and he just almost threw it away and walked away. The salesman tried to talk to me a bit more but I just was in no mood at that point. I thanked him for his time and I walked out of the store.Now, he was actually giving me a good price and even a bit less than Truecar and KBB. Maybe no other dealership will give me a lower price and I might end up paying more. I was just hoping for a little bit of negotiation and I would have happily signed it had he even offered me $19,600.

I just felt like he was being unnecessarily hostile. And after a few hours, now I'm wondering if I was being a dick to him and so he responded that way? Did I lose a good deal just because I was too proud?

69,"I am the best-man to my friends wedding. So far this has all been a nightmare. He has 7 groomsman, including myself. He hinted to me that he’d like to rent a house for the bachelor party. He wanted me to invite 5 extra people on top of the 7, making it 12. So for weeks I’ve been searching and pricing and looking at dates. l for a rental house that sleeps 12 people. I figured a price of $200.00 each from everyone going (besides the groom). In order to rent the house you must first put a NON-REFUNDABLE deposit OF $800.00 on it. So I requested 100.00 of the said 200.00 from each person going. I also made sure everyone was available for the dates(3 months in advance). I go to ask the groom about the dates (3 months I advance) and he goes “not sure I have to check with my school director to see if I have conferences”....it’s on a fucking weekend...I asked him again and he responds with “I’m 99% sure I can go”.....in other words there’s a 1% chance I can spend $100.00 of 12 people...and not get it back... when he decides not to go....is this fair? Iv been killing my self over this for weeks! And he can’t give me a strait yes or no? I have people’s money and time on the line here.

73,"I'm a gay male teenager, and I'm accepting of my sexuality. I'm asking this question because I used to be passably masculine but I feel as if I've lost it.

I was never a big macho man in any way (I'm actually really skinny and kind of short, but my personality wasn't feminine). But ever since I've gotten closer to some of my girl friends, I've adopted more effeminate mannerisms, to the point at which people ask if I'm gay.      

I admit it's childish to do this, but I asked a few of my friends how they'd rate me on a feminity scale from 1-10 and average answer is 5/6. 

I want to be more masculine again, but I feel like the only reason is because I'm self-conscious and I don't want to be a stereotype of a feminine gay boy. I'm split; on one end, I know it's not necessary to change myself. But on the other, I feel like I'd be happier ""faking it until I make it"", it's just I don't know if it's for the wrong reasons.

74,"Hey guys, I'm starting to pull my hair out and I'm getting more and more anxious to interact socially, to go out, etc. Because of my ex girlfriend. - For clarification I am 21 almost 22, and 5+ years ago in high school I dated someone for roughly 9 months. She was extremely sexual and (as I later discovered) mentally unwell (depression, self diagnosed pathological liar and psychopath). She would pressure me into sexual acts in public, and want to sleep together excessively throughout the day. When I refused she would belittle me and guilt trip me into doing things I didn't want to.

When we broke up, it was a couple of days after Valentines Day, on Valentines Day we spent the day doing all the usual couple things, and made a nice dinner. We went up to bed and started doing the deed that most couples do which she initiated, half way through I noticed her acting off and then suddenly she was very upset. I stopped what I was doing immediately and starting comforting her and trying to make things better, we put our clothes back on and she rolled over and gave me the cold shoulder for the rest of the night. - I thought this was really strange because this hadn't happened before, especially from someone that was a self-described sex addict and initiated the act. I asked her about it the next day and she said that we shouldn't be together anymore, something that upset me greatly, but I took it decently well and started to go on with my life after a couple weeks. 

Until people started coming up to me and calling me a rapist, saying that I'm an abuser and a piece of shit. etc. Then all of a sudden it was like my world was spinning, this came out of nowhere and I suddenly felt very small in such a big world. I tried to talk to my ex to see what was going on and she would loudly yell at me to stay away from her and that I was a rapist. My next 2 years of College were destroyed by this reputation that I had amassed.

My ex's best friend (and mutual friend) told me that my ex had gone with her to the local police station to report my accused rape, and that they asked her to come back the next day and take a rape kit (?) and make an official statement so that they could investigate. She didn't go back, to the grace of god. Which I hope was because a rape kit wouldn't have produced results in her favor (??) and that the official statement would have been inconsistent and untrue. Nothing further ever came from this. 

This all however hasn't stopped her from blasting me on social media 5+ years later, she messages women that I start seeing to 'warn' them about the monster that I am, and I have to preemptively tell any romantic interest that I have an ex-girlfriend that is trying to destroy my reputation. This is driving me insane, I have no control over what she says on social media, or what she says to locals in our small city. I feel trapped all the time, I want to pursue music and have a career doing the things I love but I'm horrified at the impact of her words and accusations. I have her blocked on every outlet possible so she can't see the things I do or the people I see, but she is a very outgoing person and has a lot of mutual acquaintances with me which I imagine report things back to her. 

Is there anything I can do? because this is wearing me down so much in every sense, I start having more and more suicidal thoughts because I feel like a trapped mouse at her mercy. If I go to the police they will be more likely to believe the person claiming to be raped, I can't use later girlfriends as evidence that I'm not a rapist because unfortunately those breakups were ugly for their own individual reasons and we're no longer on good terms, I couldn't imagine they would support me in that regard. - I can't ignore her however because this keeps coming up 5 years later. 

I am just struggling, I'm really really struggling. Any advice, support, ideas would be beyond appreciated. It's killing me that just the accusation of this is enough to destroy my reputation, my future career &amp; romantic ventures. I just want to move on with my life, but this is looming over me so constantly. 

I can clarify anymore more in the comments below if need be.",21Apr2018,8
75,"Some background information:

I grew up in an abusive household. Me and my brother were subject to physical and verbal abuse by our father. He would hit us, threaten us, scream at us... and every time it happened I would tell my mom who would comfort us and talk to my father about it but ultimately would change nothing. I even remember writing a letter asking for a divorce when I was about eight but my father found it, and he screamed ""IS THIS HOW YOU REALLY FEEL?"" and I said no because I had no other choice. It was either deny it or say yes and risk being hurt again.

I have so much resentment and hatred for my mother because she didn't do anything to prevent her own children from being hurt. The point I knew it was hopeless and gave up was when my father kicked my brother out of the house when we were eight and pretended to call the police on him to take him away. My mother found him crying in the woods near our house and was terrified to go inside. Now, most people would consider that the Moral Event Horizon and get their children away from the hostile environment, but not her. Nope. Once again, she did nothing.

Fast forward to the present day. I am in my early twenties and I guess I'm too old to be hit. Instead, I'm ignored. My father ignores me for days or even weeks on end, except if it's to yell at me for something. It's like living with a ticking time bomb and you never know when it's going to go off. I hate being afraid and agitated all the time because I'm forced to live with the source of my trauma. My mother knows this. She's annoyed with him too. Again, she does nothing. The days when he's inexplicably in a good mood and actually does try to converse with me about TV shows or whatever are the worst ones because they convince me that maybe things will be fine but they never are. I know that it won't last.

My mother seems to be under the delusion that just because she had a good relationship with her father, it means I will too. That just because my father loved raising us when we were little, that means that he ""loves"" us now. Doing the bare minimum of being a parent and loving your kid when it's convenient isn't love. She seems to believe that if she ignores the problem then it'll magically go away. I'm sick of this.

And I know she is too because she's having an affair. I can see her text messages and her e-mails whenever she gives me her phone to fix whatever issue she's having that can be easily solved. She stays late after work. She gets antsy and anxious whenever I ask to see her phone because she knows I'll see her little texts and poems that she writes to the man she's cheating with. Her marriage has deteriorated to the point where they not only barely speak, but they don't even sleep in the same room. Not the same bed, the same room. Or even the same floor in the house. It's honestly pathetic. As much as I hate my mother and will never forgive her for letting her own children suffer because she was too spineless and passive to actually fucking speak up and leave her husband, she deserves better.

She hasn't spilled that she's having an affair, but she's told me about him, and she's told him about me. He got me books, and I'm trying to nudge her towards him and she even suggested that me and her and the man all get dinner one night and meet.

I don't know what the fuck is keeping her from getting a divorce but I'm sick of living in this hellhole, especially when there's a solution RIGHT THERE and she won't take it. I have to do everything for her because she won't do it otherwise, like calling an ambulance to go to the hospital because she was in tears from stomach pain and it turned out that she had a hole in her stomach. She could've died if I hadn't called 911 for her and FORCED her to go to the ER. It's beyond pathetic.

I'm not here by choice. If she doesn't do something soon I'm leaving and not coming back. Maybe then she'll see that I was serious because she never listens to me. Whenever I bring up my grievances she pats me on the shoulder and says ""I know"". I know she KNOWS, the problem is she doesn't CARE or LISTEN to a single goddamn thing I say.

What can I do or say to convince her to leave him once and for all? I'm planning to have a private conversation with her today.",21Apr2018,1
76,"let’s consider this post serious, please read and comment. 

I’m considering cutting all contact with my family. I have tried everything to make my relationship better with them even though it was never any of my fault why it got to this point but they just don’t seem interested. Let’s start from the beginning. 

My family is Mexican. But I was born very uhhh.. “white” I don’t look like my family at all. I’m pale and more often than not I’m mistaken for being white rather than Mexican which has caused resentment from my family and extended family. 

Long story short I was bullied when I was young by my brother in school I told mom and she slapped me told me to never say such lies aka she had favoritism. Ever since my life has been hell. I have always been their last choice etc I developed a really bad depression and social anxiety from this. 

I started changing fast about a year ago. I changed my name to a white name. Ive always hated my birth name I fixed my body up I lost all th weight and I’m doing pretty good at weightlifting. I’m taking care of my skin hair clothes etc basically I’m metrosexual. Here’s where my parents had enough.. 

My family is stuck in 1600s where they think males should look like drunk no lifes homeless etc. then they’re all obese and think I’m being “fake” by losing the weight and weightlifting and about the name? Well they didn’t take it so well..  at all..  and at no point doing all of this have they been supportive

So why am I doing all of this? Well I never identified with them or their ethnicity. Mexicans have always hated me for something I couldn’t control. And I’ve kinda grew a little resentment towards the ethnicity for it so I’ve been doing anything I could to distance myself from that. If they don’t want me so be it. I’m not going to cry over it. So yeah. Changed my name etc but then that’s not all. They’ve never been good parents or even fair parents. But I know they somewhat care about me so. 

I have tried fixing my relationship with them countless times. I’m not that boy who used to cry over not being liked anymore. I’m not going to beg them to like me 🤷‍♂️ I’m done with that. My father said I should be ashamed and feel embarrassed for changing my name. Well. Dude? You kicked me out of my ethnicity what the fuck did you expect me to do? Beg you to accept me as Mexican? No. Honestly they criticize me for everything I do. I’m not even sure if I should even try to salvage this “relationship “ with them at all.. they have plainly just said they will never call me by my new name. And most likely won’t ever accept me either being Mexican or while 🤷‍♂️ 

Here’s my plan. 

Plan A: finish my community college keep trying to fix my relationship with them transfer to a 4 year and yeah go on with my life with them in it.

Plan B: finish my community college, talk to a military recruiter. See if I get accepted. Join. Talk to them about being stationed in another part of the us/Asia/ Europe. All while never telling them anything, just drop everything I own and go. Basically disappear. 

To be honest I’ve been considering plan b. What’s your take on this? For those of you who just read without commenting please give advice.. I need it.. even if you think it’s useless it’s most likely not.

77,"I have depression, and also had a traumatic event last year that caused me to constantly have anxiety and panic attacks, which has caused me to do very poorly in school this semester. I am also an extremely compulsive liar, to the point where I have to lie even if I want to tell the truth. My parents are extremely overbearing on grades and school, so I have lied to them and told them everything is fine. This has all come to a boiling point tonight when they tried to view my grades online, where I changed the password so they couldn’t access it, and told them the website was down. They believe it for now but I know they’ll stop believing tomorrow or Sunday. I know I can fix my grades if they gave me more time, but I know as soon as they find out they’ll take me home where I can’t finish what I need to do to get my grades back up. Therefore, tomorrow, I’m writing a letter explaining the entire situation, sending it to them, and running away, hiding for a few weeks until I can get my grades back up. I need advice on how to stay hidden. Is there any way o can tell authorities I am safe and do not want to return to my parents (I am 18 so if they find me and I say I don’t consent to returning to my parents I can do that right)?

79,"About a year ago, a friend of mine was threatened with eviction because her cat was fighting with her landlord's son's cat \(next door neighbour.\) To avoid her family being uprooted or having to give the cat to strangers, she asked if I would look after him. No time frame was discussed on how long I'd keep him, the entire thing happened within a matter of hours as the landlord is infamously impatient.

I brought the cat home and he had a hard time adjusting to my other cat and my dog, but after about a week, he settled in. He needed an expensive treatment for urinary crystals, as I noticed something was wrong as soon as he arrived. Fast forward to the present day and my little demon has transformed into a cuddly and curious furball with enormous personality and whose purr is about as loud as a jet engine. I'm extremely closely bonded with all of my animals and I view them as immediate family.

My friend is now moving to another pet\-friendly place, this time without landlord relatives for neighbours, and has been dropping hints about wanting the cat back. This has been giving me a little bit of anxiety and dread, because I've become attached and so used to the presence of this kitty in my home. Am I being shitty if I say no if/when the question is asked about giving him back? Am I being selfish?

84,"I'm 20 years old and I've had the worst past few days of my life. I'll try to keep this short.

A few years ago when I was in high school, my dad cheated on my mom. I have a relatively small family (only parents, an older brother, and a grandmother who is broke). This really affected me academically. I was always a good student in school, but I just couldn't focus anymore. Domestic violence sucks.

I graduated high school in 2016. I felt like such an underperformed compared to the friends I had left at the time. I never really had any friends either because many of the people I grew up with moved away before high school. This makes me fearful of trying to make any.

I'm in college now and I'm majoring n economics. I'm on track to graduate next spring but I'm thinking of getting a 2nd bachelor's degree in IT and to hopefully become a CCNP and maybe a network engineer or other talented IT professional. I was originally attending an in-store school until last summer when I transferred back home for this past fall. (I'll explain why in a moment)

I know life could certainly be a lot worse, but I've kind if lost faith in society at this point. There's a few reasons why. The first seems to do with education. I was always a good student and my parents were both educated too. My dad has an MBA and my mom has a BA. Neither really seems to have found what they like. They both had good jobs during my childhood until the recession. My mom got sick from her job in 2007 and was laid off shortly after, then she started another job and got laid off again in 2009 and then again was laid off in 2012. My dad was laid off in 2012 and again in January 2017. The 2017 layoff made me transfer schools and change my major from IT to economics because i had to take 3 jobs while going to school to subsidize some of my parents' bills. My dad was put of work until November. However, my parents didn't really save money, so now I subsidize more of their expenses. My grandma also retired broke and so my parents also subsidize her expenses since she doesn't qualify for Medicaid.

I really just don't feel happy anymore. I'm trying to switch my major back to IT now and my school is giving me a difficult time doing that. I don't really spend time around any of my family anymore because I just don't really care about them and I've been extremely repulsed by my parents' arguing all the time. At times, I feel like just giving up on life and living poor because many institutions have failed me and I'm so tired of unintended consequences and me dealing with my family's problems that they should have taken care of.

Earlier tonight, one of my friends made a joke or two about me and I think I took it too seriously. Earlier today, I had a couple people at my job treat me fairly poorly too and I felt like quitting right then and going home.

I really have thought about abandoning my family if I am ever able to get my IT degree. I would have it by 2020. However, my parents seem like they'd really do something bad. They just don't understand how poorly I have suffered overall from their instability. I understand I've probably grown up with more than most and I'm certainly grateful for that, but I haven't been able to excel academically for a few years now, and it's getting to the point where I'm ready to just say fuck education and go live in some small town.

Any advice would be appreciated. Sorry if I couldn't keep this short enough.",21Apr2018,1

**TL;DR:** Please give me an idea of how to pick a college.  Just want the hindsight of someone who’s already been through this.

My choices of college and their pros and cons  

**UAB** - Digital Forensics  
+ Could basically go here for free  
+ Would have an alternative school to go to for my masters  
+ 2 hours away from home  
-	Program isn't nearly as strong as RIT's  

**RIT** - Major in Computer  Security, Minor in Web Dev  
+ Better programs for what I'm interested in  
+ Strong co-op program, better chance of job after graduation  
-	1000 miles away from  home
-	expensive  

With my financial aid package from RIT, I'd be dropping a little under $20k per year.  I'm fortunate enough to have some funds set up by my grandfather and would likely come out of everything debt free.  

What would you do in my shoes?  

Sorry if this question isn't really appropriate for here...I'm just stressed and have no idea what to do.

I also don't want to go to UAB for 4 years and have difficulty actually getting a job afterwards.

89,"Hi reddit,

I'm posting to hopefully get some good advice from people who have been where I am currently or can maybe direct me to a helpful path..

Basically, over the last 2 years I've became an extremely angry and paranoid person. What I mean is little things frustrate me all the time. I also can't help but think about the worst possibility of all my situations (paranoia regularly). I don't know why this has started.. I use to be such a care-free kid when I was in college and was delivering pizzas and getting high with friends - being a kid. Now I'm 23, I make great money, I have a great girlfriend who I've been with for almost 2 years, and I'm on a good path towards success. But I'm so angry. I'm angry when people talk back to me. I'm angry when I don't get my way. I'm angry over minuscule things such as coworkers slacking more than me. I'm also always paranoid my boss wants to fire me, or my girlfriend is planning on leaving me, or I'll get arrested for something (although I do nothing illegal). I even stopped drinking and smoking because of this paranoia too. I work out 5 days a week and work 40 hours and have a healthy social life, so I have no idea what has caused my mental changes..

The only thing I can think of is I went through seriously deep depression about a year ago because I had no direction in life after college and was drinking myself to sleep every night for months. I was sucidial to the point where I needed to get on antidepressants. I'm currently still on them. But they make me feel really ""normal"". I actually don't have my anger issues when I've first taken them it seems. I do however have the paranoia all the time, no matter what.

Please someone, anyone, give me some helpful advice. I'd really appreciate it... I just hope I'm not going crazy.",21Apr2018,2

While I'm ready and flexible to make out and/or have sex almost all the time, my girlfriend only seems truly interested in sex in the middle of the day when it's not always easy to get to her. She also has a few kinks, but they require a substantial amount of prep and maintenance that I don't think she's interested in assisting with. 

It's been difficult adapting from a very active sex life into a relationship where a partner is either not interested or too sleepy to be engaged intimately most of the time. Talking about the problem seems to do nothing or only trigger anxiety about her not being as good in bed as my past partners. 

I'm used to my partners getting turned on by my advances and foreplay at least some of the time and reciprocating, or sometimes initiating themselves, but this dynamic doesn't really seem to exist in this relationship and I feel shut down and frustrated sometimes by it.  

It's disheartening because there's so many other things I love about this woman and our relationship. And part of me wants to accept that this is a part of getting older (but we're not *that* old yet, still early 30s). Any tips/advice for maybe helping this situation out?

I talked to a maintenance guy at the complex and he said that the only people using our water heater are me and my 3 roommates, so the only explanation is that someone must be secretly using all the hot water... all day... Didn’t make sense to me but I’m not confident arguing with this guy because he should clearly know more about this stuff than me. I figured I’d just put up with it because its not every day, but I’ve noticed that I *never* have hot water on weekends, which is frustrating because my roommates go to their hometowns every weekend (we’re all in college), so I am literally (supposedly) the only one using our hot water, which isn’t present for literally all day.

After years of wanting a German Shepherd, I got Romeo today. today was so surreal like, we went to one shelter and I couldn't get the dog I had been looking at for awhile, which resulted in me breaking down infront of everyone and crying the entire car ride to another animal shelter my grandpa wanted me to ""atleast look at"", which I really didn't want to go to, after looking on their site and not being interested in anyone, I just wanted to go home and sleep. But when I got there, my grandpa went up and asked if they had any Shepherds and to my surprise they just got one in last night. I. was. ecstatic. I was so happy. And even happier after finding out he was good with cats and every thing. Romeo was perfect. When we got into the meet and greet room he jumped up on my grandpa and smothered him in kisses. I wanted him so bad. And I cried when they said I could take him home ahhHh asghfmfkgl just writing this is making me cry. I wanted a dog as a sort of emotional support I guess. I'm not well right now and I haven't been for awhile, I've got severe clinical depression and anxiety, I struggle with panic attacks every day and I'm not even enrolled in school right now because I had to be taken out of it cause of how bad i was doing. 
Just. Long story short. I can't do this. I realize I didn't think it through. I actually will not be responsible enough to care for him and it breaks my heart. Its so obvious that he loves me and believe me i love him so much but I don't think him living with me is best for him. I can't even take care of myself. And I have no help either. I live alone with my grandpa, taking care of a dog is too much for him, especially Romeo because he is so hyper... I'm only 14 by the way. Idk. There's a lot of detail im leaving out but I don't want this to be too long. I've pretty much made up my mind that I need to take him back to the shelter and let a new family who can give him what I can't take care of him. But I read a lot about taking dogs back to shelters and how terrible it is for them and how I pretty much can be called 'evil' for it. But.. I really don't think he will have trouble finding a home. He's so perfect. Someone would be stupid not to take him l o l. I can't even walk him on a leash, not because he misbehaves, he's just such a big boy and very heavy he almost takes me off my feet. Im 5'0 and about 95 pounds and he's 80 pounds. We asked a family memeber if he would like to take him and God I pray he will be able to (he needs to contact his mom first since Romeo would be staying with her I guess?) because I don't want to take him back and have him be sad and afraid. It will break my heart even more than realising I can't take care of him has. I wouldn't even be able to face the people there because I would feel so ashamed. In my mind I genuinely didn't think it would be that bad for him. It's a very, very nice shelter and they take good care of their dogs. But admittedly im very ignorant about this whole thing. Ive never even had a dog. I've been afraid of them all my life (large dogs, i mean). I've only had cats, I have 5 currently... And they are all absoultley terrified of him and it hurts me so much. Especially my baby Sasha who I've had for 7 years. She didn't seem comfortable in her own home and I don't want to put her through that, I'm also very afraid she will run away out of fear because I've had a cat do that before. This is her house. Her safe place. I don't wanna ruin it for her. I've been crying all day. I feel like a terrible person. If the guy who said he may be able to take her cannot than I have no idea what to do with myself. It's gonna destroy me to have to take him back to the shelter. absoultley destroy me. All my fears of dogs is started to come back as well. He makes me feel unsafe even though I don't want to admit it. I was attacked by a dog when i was younger and its very much traumatized me if I'm being honest. I'm always on edge when I'm at a friends house who owns a dog. I remember how happy the workers at the shelter were to see Romeo adopted so fast. I feel like I'm letting everyone down. My friends who are more than excited to meet him, my grandpa, e v e r y o n e, and most importantly, Romeo. can any one understand what I'm going through or reasure me that I'm not a terrible person ?? sorry.",21Apr2018,0

The thing is we have been getting more and more physical and the past week or so even more but I just can't last cus after an hour and a half of making out and touching when she tries to go beneath my clothes I just finish right on the spot and it has been a real shame to me.

She has been very understanding but it still hurts me and I don't know what to do, I have tried edging and the clenching for nearly two weeks now and it isn't helping does someone know what to do? ",21Apr2018,0
115,"Just to keep it short and sweet I didn't have much of a good upbringing and it's really tearing me apart especially in the romance department. I was brought up in an Asian household where I was beat a lot and had parents that solely prioritized grades. I would bring back a report card that had all As and one B and my parents would focus on the B and tell me it wasn'tnt good enough. I didn't receive love from them at all throughout my childhood, early teen years, late teen years or early adulthood. I was motivated by a fear of getting beat and guilt trips given to me by my parents.


This shit is seriously impacting me now that I'm 22. The stupid thing is I don't have low self esteem in all aspects of my life. I'm 22 and have a great full time job making 75k a year, I play guitar and sing and I speak 5 languages, three of them fluently and two above conversational. I'm very confident in the things I know I'm good at so my career and hobbies keep me going.


However when I was in middle school girls pretended to like me and then would make fun of me for liking them back, nowadays girls hit me with ""ew you're brown"" or you're too short even tho I'm 5ft 9in. Due to those experiences, always being told I wasn't good enough by my parents, and never having experienced love even from my parents I've really developed bad self esteem issues when it comes to women. I'm an interesting person and my friends have said I'm above average in terms of attractiveness but I can't believe them. A girl approached me at the supermarket earlier this month and said she loved my hair because it's long. I stared at her, said ""ok"" and walked away because I couldn't logically believe she was interested in me in any way. So I guess I'm not terrible looking and I know girls would love to know and see that I play guitar, sing, have a steady job and speak five languages but I can't get over the fact anyone could ever like me.


Is there anything you guys can recommend to help me get over this dumb shit? If you need more information about my upbringing just PM me and I'll go a bit more in depth.",21Apr2018,5
116,I’m currently travelling and am in need of a job. I’ve applied to a lot of places and heard back from a pedi cab company.

The bike rental costs $220 the thing is I don’t know if it’s worth it to pay the $220 and then possibly not make much and then be stuck in this contract.

117,"So...Back story...I work nights in retail and I babysit my little brother during the day. My night job doesn’t offer as much hours as I would like so I decided to start applying for a day job. 

I got offered a job last week. It’s a desk job (not in the field I would pursue). However, I think it would look good on my resumé. Also, I want that extra cash. 

My mom is struggling to find a babysitter. She has asked friends in which they said they would, but turned around and asked for a monthly rate. I babysit for free seeing as it’s my sibling and I don’t pay rent in the house. 

Before I took the job I specifically asked my mom if it was ok. She told me if I wanted it, to go for it. I expressed how I felt about her not having a babysitter in place, but she continued to say “don’t let me or your brother get in the way of you take that job if you really wanted it.” 

So I called to confirm about the offer. After doing so, my mother made a comment about having to quit her job to stay and watch my brother Because she can’t afford a babysitter. 

It’s putting a really bad taste in my mouth. I don’t know what to do. I need the money because I will be leaving soon to another state and that money would help with getting a place to stay, a new car, etc. 

How do I choose between a job that pays or babysitting my little brother to help out my mom? 

TL; DR : I work nights and babysit little brother in the day. Got offered a new day job. Accepted said offer. Now mom wants me to decline because she can’t find anyone else to babysit. ",21Apr2018,1
119,"I live with a dude who lives and works in the same house (his boss lives next door, formal company, they're technicians). He's Chinese with limited English.

About 6 months ago he had the amazing idea to buy 2 cats despite the fact we live in a house where 5 people share 1 bathroom. He got a small cute kitty (call her A) and an adult cat from an abusive home (B).

A was sweet as possible, very cuddly very playful, B was aggressive all the time but we were patient with him. B never ever got along with my housemate, he was friendly with me most of the time since I waited for him to be comfortable with me whereas housemate would try and physically force himself on B. About 2 months later B went missing one night, he often explored at night but always came back just not this time. Housemate couldn't care less.

Around Christmas time, I had A come into my room and cuddle up to me, housemate came looking for him and found him, i let him out and then started hearing BANG BANG BANG like something hitting the floor over and over. I open the door to look and housemate has pinned A down on the ground and slamming his thong next to his ear over and over. I went off at him and A escaped, housemate brokenly explained he was only scaring him so he wouldn't go into my room again. I told him if I ever saw him doing that again I would call the RSPCA. 

Now tonight I came home from the gym and found A with rope attached to a small zip-tie around his neck with i estimate about 1.5cm of play in the tightness, I could still hear him struggling to breath. I ran and got my clippers and cut it off, housemate comes down at this point and i go off at him again. Nothing im saying is getting through the language barrier, his wife comes down and they start speaking in Chinese. They take the cat into their room and close the door.

I tend to overthink when i'm high, and i end up being like this : '' Why are you guys putting girly songs all the time, it makes me anxious''. And of course it makes me anxious, because:

A few weeks ago when i was  sober, my friend started showing me how gay people drive a car, like in a funny way.

When i was high, i was SO HIGH i barely could even drive, and while driving i realized i did the same moves what he showed me a few weeks ago.

Why do i always have manipulative friends who try to change me into something i'm really not &gt;.&lt; i'm tall and good looking, but i'm also a little bit nerdy.. not the coolest good looking guy :( 

I'm telling this because i've had many jealous friends before, and jealous people is a BAD thing, friends start manipulating you, using you, start doing bad things to you without you seeing it.

EDIT: I told my childhood friend to drive for me, he ended up driving so bad, like there was the biggest pit i've ever seen, he drove to it and i felt like the tire is going off soon. I told my friend '' wtf man, you keep talking about how good you can drive a car, how good you can control your high and stuff, you still can't see the biggest fucking pit in front of you ''

Like i've told my friend a million times, this is my parents car, drive slow and nicely, keep it clean and do not fucking do anything illegal, because you lost your '' driving license '' that you have never shown to me and because of that, it's illegal to drive a car without license.

He obviously didn't want to appreciate anything i told him, especially my parents because this is my parents car.

EDIT 2 : I told my friend yesterday that i can buy you something from the store, but don't take anything expensive because i need to save up a little bit, i'm having money issues right now, when we entered the store, why does he have to take 2 big chocolate bars and a bottle of cola &gt;.&lt; like take 1 dude, you know i have money issues..

Then he asked me if i want 1 chocolate bar, i told him no thanks, after that he gave it to his other friend who was sitting on the backseat, the backseat friend told him '' thanks a lot dude '', my friend said '' no problem man ''

Like he was taking credit of something i bought ! Then 5 sec later he said '' thank this dude here, he bought it anyways ''

I find writing out what I'm going through to be really difficult, I start writing and the post spirals out and I lose my head a bit so I'll try to keep it short as possible.

I am defenitly not a functional person.
5 years ago I moved to the Netherlands, Amsterdam - my main reason being that I like weed (yes I know how stupid that sounds) and that my home country of Israel feels more like a prison.

Over the course of the 5 years I've returned twice, both times due to breakdowns and temporary situations dissolving.

The second time I got into a relationship which led me back here and to a more stable situation where I could support myself as an immigrant and try and settle.
I found a job as an icecream store manager which I've been doing for 3 years and I despise and generally managed to find more permanent living situations.

Eventually though we broke up and I spiraled into depression for a year... I worked out, kept at my job and a while after (almost a year and a half) met another girl.

The second relationship was shrouded by remnants of my first relationship and I was not a good boyfriend, even though I did love and appreciate her company I ended up taking it for granted and fell into doubts and depression again and she left me too.

Now I'm facing an eviction notice until the 1st of July, a job which feels pointless and depressing and the crippling anxiety and stress following a breakup.


I'll be turning 30 in 4 months and I honestly feel like a big big mess.
I can barely function at work and get by  because the owner of the business is absent.
I am seriously lonely and have troubles communicating with other people and feel very dull emotinally.


But the worst of all is that every option I have is causing me dread.
I could go back home, a process which would take a lot of effort and mean stating over again in a country I dislike..

I could stay here and suffer through this like I did last time but for some reason this feels worse, even when the relationship felt less intense.

I have obligations, like anyone. I have problems, like anyone. More and more I am noticing that I have an issue with actually DOING things. We'll start with sleep. I don't like to sleep, and if I didn't have to I wouldn't, since I'd rather do other things(anything really). But I'm sure that's most of us. I also understand that I NEED sleep, and that it allows me to do anything at all. However, I seem to procrastinate sleep. I'll go to bed anytime between 2am to 5am and have to get up at 8am or 9am. it doesn't help that when I DO sleep I end up sleeping for longer than I would hope and miss classes. creating a new problem entirely. When it's a day off, I tend to sleep for as long as my body will let me, assuming that's the sleep I need. but I find that I can(probably shouldn't) sleep for 12+ hours. that's not normal. And the whole reason I even stay up late is to get things done. What kind of things? School work, Work-Work, Gaming, Hobbies, Etc.

Unsurprisingly, I procrastinate doing the School-work and work related tasks as well, mainly by playing games or watching videos on YouTube or browsing this damned site. Fuck, I even procrastinate my own hobbies. ""I wanna write a song!"" Nope, you're just going to watch more videos and fantasize about it.

Procrastinating homework and sleep and missing class is kind of a viscous cycle. I'll not want to miss class so I'll want to go to bed, but I want to finish school work, so I'll stay up to do so, but I'll procrastinate that so I might as well go to bed, but I'm afraid I won't wake up for class, I'll just pull an all nighter, but then I'll fall ASLEEP in class, so I'll go to bed and do shit in the morning, but then I won't have enough time so I'll do the work now, etc, etc. I've experienced all these scenarios that I've reasoned myself with. I'm pretty sure procrastination is my problem, and I know/have known this. I have an issue actually ACTING on the reasonable thoughts I have to NOT be a shitty person.

I say shitty because not only is this affecting my school life/work life, but the fact that it's a problem at all is damaging my relationship with my SO.

I asked 2 of my close (if not best) friends if I could join them for lunch. They aren't romantically involved, just friends. They both said it was fine and gave me a weird location to meet up. They didn't show and I left after around 15 minutes of the area being completely empty. 

I called and text them thinking that I must be late or that this wasn't the right spot and my memory got messed up. The girl told me that they waited in that spot half of lunch for me, and that it was my fault for leaving to go get food after a while. She said she felt bad.

It turns out that they met at a different location across campus and went to McDonald's by themselves. 

The guy blames that he was so high that he forgot I was coming, and that the girl said he wasn't forgetting anything and to just stop worrying. He didn't have his phone with him. 

The girl says it was all the guys idea, and that she only ditched me because it was what he wanted. She then changed her story to say that she decided to send me to a different location and ditch me because of a headache.

158,"I'm a college student in my last semester of college.  My instructor recommended me to a local employer for what I thought was a contract job that I would be able to work from home on while I finish the semester.  It's probably worth mentioning that I'm studying to be a 3D artist, so jobs aren't always super easy to find.

During the interview, I was constantly reminded about how they need someone ""reliable and punctual"", which for some reason seemed odd.  It wouldn't have been strange if they mentioned it once, but they reminded me of that fact multiple times.  The head of the company even specifically wanted the person who informed me that I got the job to remind me that I need to be reliable and punctual.  They also spent a good portion of the interview telling me about all of the reasons I could be fired.  

Additionally, I thought the job would just be making some models and textures for a project they are working on, and my instructor mentioned they said they would be willing to let me work from home which would be good as I am very busy with school.

159,"kinda long text here, so please dont mind

so when i joined my school 8 years ago, i made friends with a few, and we got along really well. now back then, i was a massive nerd, kinda introverted, and could only talk about lame shit like video games. now they went on to make a stronger ""squad"" than me, and they would talk to girls and all that crap, me being excluded majorly, but at the time i didnt really understand it and went along with it. until 3 years ago, i didnt change much (we were kids), but when i did and came out of the shell, i became more extroverted, banter, etc. all was well, i was more recognized than before. thought that was it, everythings good now. fast forward to this year, i notice some shit. which is that im not treated as equally by this friend group as they treat each other, still excluded and shit. i end up finding out about things they did through one friend or the other, and i find out they know shit i dont, which pisses me off because im their friend too. so this goes on for a while, stuff like this increasingly happening, and me getting seperated more, so i just try to focus on my exams for now. the one thing which ticked me off the most was this: when a friend of mine left during our winter holidays, every little thing we did they would mention how it wouldve been so cool if he was here, they skyped with him every day and all the good stuff, and when he came back from the trip, we woke up at literally 6am after having drank the night before till 2 to go to the airport and surprise him when he came back. so couple months later, i travel during a 2 week holiday we were given. not a single call, text, or how are you. on the flight back i thought surely they mustnt forget me entirely, and was excited to see if theyd be waiting to surprise me in the airport. nothing.

this was the last fucking straw, i cannot explain how much this got on my nerves. im heavily considering cutting all ties with them and telling them to fuck themselves for the rest of time. any advice?

(note: i make them seem like assholes here, but we did have a lot of great times, its just that the way i get treated ""less"" annoys me. im more worthy than that)",21Apr2018,1

This happened over a week ago and we aren't together anymore but I am wondering if I should let him know that I was on my period or just leave it since it's been almost two weeks since the incident occured.

166,"Hi all. 

I have a friend who told me that they were depressed in the past, but are in a better place now. They didn’t seem like they were lying or anything. For context we are both about 15. 

A few months ago I showed this person Reddit, and they started to use it, but told me their username. They haven’t switched accounts at all as well. When I joked about stalking them on Reddit a few weeks ago (was not being creepy, the joke was understood in the context) they suddenly started to act weird and told me to not look on their account. I know I really shouldn’t have, but I got curious. 

They are mainly posting on depression subs. Saying things like “I’m depressed but nobody knows”.  And also commenting on things that must have been *very* deep down the rabbit hole of the depression sub. 

My question is how do I help my friend? Should I admit to snooping on their Reddit account? Tell their parents? Talk to them directly?

Thank you for any help. ",21Apr2018,1

169,"So my boyfriend and I just recently moved in with a good friend into a 2 bedroom apartment. We’ve never had problems with each other in the past, but the friend (I’ll call her F) has a dog. Now the reason this is a problem is because my boyfriend (I’ll call him B) and I were pretty set on not having pets in this apartment, but we agreed to let her keep her dog when moving in (she knew we didn’t want pets and told us months before move in that she thought her dog wouldn’t live this long (as she’s family old for her breed), but low and behold the dog lives. Since we thought the dog wouldn’t live this long we didn’t think we’d have pets).
 
So anyway, the reason this is a problem is because the dog’s kennel is outside of our bedroom. Our bedroom faces the dining room, which is open to the kitchen, and the living room, which are connected (meaning the dog’s kennel is effectively in the entire living area of the apartment). Now this causes problems as the dog whines often in the morning (and I work nights) and, due to age, has problems controlling her bladder. Our entire apartment now smells like dog and dog pee, and I get woken up every morning at 7 am when F leaves for work. The dog has to be kenneled when F isn’t home because she eats paper when she’s nervous, and of course there’s the peeing issue. This greatly annoys B, because he feels like we can’t enjoy most of the space of our apartment because of the smell and the noise from the dog. B feels as though F should have had the dog put down due to her health and bladder issues, but F seems to think the dog isn’t anywhere near that point (which is strange, because 8 months ago she didn’t think the dog would be alive right now, so I don’t know what changed her mind). F is making plans involving the dog living as long as possible (buying a ramp for her to get up on the bed, buying new water and food bowls, etc), but B was hoping the dog would be gone in the next month or so. 

This has become even more of a problem in the past day because the dog recently peed while walking from the living room to kitchen, which led to B yelling at F. Now F is asking us to start walking the dog for her, but we didn’t want a pet of our own so we don’t want to care for someone else’s. What should I do? B has been arguing with F a *lot* over this and I’m kind of caught in the middle. I don’t want the dog either, but I also don’t think it’s my place to tell F to have her put down. I agree the smell is a problem but I don’t know where else we can put her kennel so I haven’t brought this up to F. We’re all signed on the lease, too, and I don’t want to have to have anyone break the lease. I like living with F and I really hope B doesn’t make it impossible for us to get along.

However, when I (or another one of our hometown friends) organize something like a birthday get together where we go out dancing with only a couple of us etc., she always asks if she can bring her other friends. Either this, or she will somehow try to coordinate where we are going so we will see her other friends (i.e. she does it knowing they will be there).

Again, I have no problem with them, but sometimes we just want to have our own celebration and it feels disrespectful and inconsiderate to impose that on us, particularly for something like a birthday where we don't know these people that well. 

It feels super uncomfortable and I don't really know how to handle it well. I don't know if I should tell her or somehow try to mitigate the chances of it from happening. Any advice?

174,"So this is going to be somewhat of a long story, but I'm pretty conflicted on what I should do. Please keep in mind that I'm currently a senior in high school. Basically there's this girl (Lets call her x) and this other guy (Lets call him y). So I've liked this girl x since the end of middle school since we used to go to the library after school along with a lot of other people randomly popping up. Although I liked her, I wasn't really aware of it during those days, and never really said anything / got her number. Unfortunately after coming to high school we didn't have any classes together and weren't really friends anymore because I didn't see her during the day at all. Now let's talk about y. Basically I had this friend group and we used to start hanging out after high school. I was also friends with y since 9th grade. Introduced them, and eventually y was in the friend group. We all got pretty close because of this. Now, fast forward to 12th grade. I hear that y asked x to prom, and they kind of hooked up after it (nothing really serious though). Apparently they got close by being drinking buddies, and that's how it happened. Now this was when I sort of had a weird feeling of, do I feel happy for y and x, or am I actually mad? However, at the time I just didn't think much of it. Thought I would get over it. After all, I didn't talk much to x until recently. But as we all started hanging out a lot more and doing stuff together, I realized that I still like x. Like a lot. It's just something about her personality that matches with me. Another thing that really hurts me even more is the fact that they don't act like they are together in public. Everyone knows they do things, but when we are hanging out, there's like no affection shown at all. She kind of treats everyone including y the same way. But she always keeps staring &amp; smiling at me and touches me a lot. I don't really know what it means. We also both speak another language while y does not, so when we talk in that language, it feels really close. Even yesterday, 5 of us got together (3 from our friend group including y and x and her friend) to have some drinks (soju), and we were on the bed just hanging out. She was lying on my lap and kept giving me looks and now I feel really bad because y was next to me. However, we were just chilling so I don't think it was a really big deal since he didn't say or show anything. So after we were all done and was driving home was when I felt conflicted. I couldn't decide if I should tell x or y that I've liked x, or just keep it to myself. What's even worse is that we actually did promposals yesterday and I asked x's friend. Originally I was planning to ask x to prom since y asked someone else last year, so that's why I just asked x's friend. So if I tell x or y, not only could our friendship get pretty weird, but it's a dick move to x's friend too. However, not telling anyone about this is killing me. If I don't come clean to someone I feel like I'll regret it when it's too late, just like how I didn't have enough courage to get closer to x somehow before the past few weeks. So what I am imagining is a lot of scenarios that could happen. One could be that y says ""I already knew that"" or something, but still says since he's the one whos going to prom with her and hooked up just don't do anything. But hopefully that wouldn't ruin our friendship. Or, y could get really mad that I could say that I liked x even though I knew they were kind of together, and our friendship would be ruined. Secondly, if I tell x, she might just say she doesn't like me at all and we might not be as close as we are getting. I still don't know her feelings towards me, so that's why this is so hard. If I knew she's just being friendly and fun, then I would not be as conflicted. Even if x does actually like me, what am I going to do anyway? X is still going with y to prom and I'm still going with x's friend. Also, school is almost over in a a month and a half, so it wouldn't even matter anyway, unless there was a long distance thing going on in the same state (which honestly I would do for her). I don't know if our ""relationship"" makes y uncomfortable. Maybe he just hasn't noticed the small things. Or, maybe I'm just over thinking it, and it means nothing. Should I just keep it to myself and not make anything weird because of prom and stuff but suffer through not being able to speak up about it, or just tell one of them and accept the outcome? I was going to tell him in the car once we dropped off the other friends since x was sleeping too, but since they have a ""date"" tomorrow, I didn't want to ruin that for him by saying something weird. Honestly, I really need a way to decide on this. My story sounds like some dramatic teen tv show and it feels so stupid, but at the same time, it means a lot to me. Please help me on what I should do. ",21Apr2018,1
176,"Last night the neighbors had a party at their house, and the party guests were drinking outside on their patio.

“Sounds relaxing?” I’ll say. 

“No, I should have done something productive” he’ll say

Soon I'm going to be moving and taking a new job, I'm really excited to be going but the issue of work is the big question mark.

I also completed a phone interview with another one that is much higher pay, and given the choice I would like that one. (Money isn't a huge deal to me personally, but it is would be quite nice to have that little bit of pay bump).

Problem is that when I was scheduled to go down and do the in person interview they said that they wouldn't be filling the 2 available positions for about a month (or two weeks from this post). I interviewed for the same position about a year ago in the city I live in now, and the recruiter said they liked me, but wanted me to get a little more customer experience before they'd be comfortable hiring me, so when I saw the same position open in the new spot I emailed that same recruiter and she remembered me and seemed positive about it. 

Now, this is the job I want the most. But theres no guarantee I'll get it. Next week if I get offered one of the other jobs should I just take it? Or is there a tactful way to say ""I'll take the job if this better one doesn't work out.""

She and I are so alike that we are able to just know what the other is thinking and reference silly things like dumb movie things or anime memes etc however through the years she's gotten more and more depressed. I've tried everything from listening to her vent for 8\+ hours and missing work from lack of sleep to trying to look up resources and contacts she could rely on if I wasn't enough. I've sent her so many gifts to try and cheer her up both physical gifts and in game gifts. she's had a rough life growing up and I know most of it. Recently more she's become more possessive of me to the point where she gets upset and lashes out when I don't tell her minor things. Another thing you should know is we dated 6 years ago for a month but both decided we were better as friends so now however when any guy or girl gets close to me she gets into this weird mode where she hates them but when she dates she acts like its nothing. So recently I got a boyfriend and I decided to wait a while before telling anyone because when people get involved it seems to make a mess so when I did tell her she lashed out saying why I didn't tell her asap and when I told her I was not comfortable saying anything so soon she basically demand I do so next time and i said ""no...I told you i'm not comfortable with that"" and she said we needed to figure it out then because she has to know because I guess it gives her anxiety so I apologized but then she keeps her life a secret like I just found out shes had a boyfriend for 3 weeks and when I asked her why she didn't tell me she replied with I didn't think you cared since you didn't ask but how am I supposed to ask something I don't know about? There's also the fact when I hang out with other friends they get mad and send messages out of the blue like ""hope you're having fun"" and when I say ""thanks :\)"" they ask ""...can I join?"" so I invite them or like when I'm in a game they say ""gl""\(good luck\) but it just seems off.Or when we have a team on overwatch they message ""what about me?"" or when I ask a friend to play a game they lash out at me and say ""I WANNA PLAY THAT GAME YOU ASK THEM BUT NOT ME?"" then they go quiet in call and just groan in displeasure for like 5 hours then when I talk to the others in the call she goes ""\-sigh\- i'm just gonna go"" There is also minor things like before she started acting more off than before, I would always include her in anything I did even if that meant leaving so she could join a game with our friends let's say like a game of overwatch so I guess that's my fault though for always including her so maybe now she feels left out but it's still bothering me. Or for the past 3 years every day when I wake up I message her and ask her how her day is but I already know the answer is going to be ""it's bad because my friends said we were going to hang and we didn't"" or ""my friends didn't want to sit at a table with me after class and instead went to get lunch so I feel like betrayed"" And recently they've been rejected by a potential love interest and every time someone denies her she rebounds on me without noticing. I ask her to stop a lot but she just says lewd things to me and tries to force me to say that I am interested in the same sex/all genders but i've said that I am straight but she wont accept that as an answer because I dabbled in the thought and tried dating same sex etc but it wasn't for me so I guess that's my fault too.

While visiting home for spring break March 13th, a tree fell on my car, crushed it, and totaled it. I was in utter shock and disbelief. I borrowed a family members car only for the tire to explode on my way back to college, and since then my father and I have been looking for a vehicle for me, with my insurance check from the totaled 05.

193,"Basically I feel that in the beggining we were very affectionate with eachother and showed a lot of love. We have been dating for almost two years. Unfortunately now it feels like that ""spark"" has faded, and I feel that whenever I try to be affectionate with her it feels like she does not give any back, or she gives very little back and it makes me sad because I know that she use to be much better back then.

I understand the ""honeymoon phase"" and I feel this is similar. Whenever I try to bring it to her attention she always makes me feel like I am just the clingy one, but I am just upset because things have changed so much and it just felt like she actually cared more when the relationship was still new.

I'm just very sad and do not know how to deal, sometimes I want to tell her that I feel that she may be too comfortable with the idea that she has a hold on me because I care about her so much and have been with her for so long that she does not feel the need to put as much effort in as when she first had to when we first began dating. I hope that made sense because I want to tell it to her in a way that she understands but haven't been able to.

The first time I work til 4 everyday so they scheduled my appointment for 4:45 on their later hours days. The secretary calls me at 1:30 pm the same day and asks me to come in earlier (at 4)  because the appointment before me canceled. I was working and ignored the call until I left. When I got there the dentist wasn’t even in a rush to get me out of there. He was actually talking to their tech guy that apparently came in for 15 minutes before seeing me. 

Now I have an appointment in two weeks and they have called me twice now (while I was working) to see if I can move my appointment back an hour because they want to go out to lunch for my dentists birthday.

Idk why but I’m irritated! I schedule these appointments to fit my schedule. I don’t know if they think because I know my dentist personally I can move my schedule around or what but I’m sick of this.

I had a mental breakdown a few weeks ago due to my breakup and intense loneliness. I was paralyzed and couldn't function at work. Left my career job in IT in hopes of finding something outside of a desk job. Any trade. 

I literally have no idea what to do. A few months ago I was on my way to potentially purchasing a house and having a stable job for once. Now I'm emotional wreck from my breakup and the loneliness is unbearable. My past relationship isolated me from majority of my friends and support network. I have have a couple of months to find income again or I'll be basically homeless.

This is some serious pain and I've set myself up for a way where I can no longer escape from it. I'm trying to not go the self destructive ways with drugs or shit relationships but I feel backed into a corner and it's crippling.

208,"LOOOOONG post but I definitely need the insight so I would deeply appreciate if anyone gives this a read.  
Bit of background,
I've been with my boyfriend for about 4 months now. We met on tinder so we didn't know any of each others friends or friend groups. I've gotten decently close to his friends tho, seeing them fairly regularly. 
When we first started dating of course he brought her up when we where talking about our relationship experience. I didn't think much of it, he told me she basically hates him so I didn't think I'd have a problem. I already knew that he'd known his friends since elementary, I didn't know he'd known her that long as well tho. Or that his friends knew her well too. I heard her name for the first time in the car with him and his friends about a week ago, when they brought her up. He will also bring her up here and there out of the blue and it always startles me and makes me nervous. He recently ran into her too, she made a show of ignoring him because she vowed never to speak to him again. I trust him, but it worries me that she's still making a big deal about it, she's clearly holding onto it. And I didn't realize that they'd known each other since childhood, meaning she has YEARS of more time with him than I do. And years more experience with his friends as well, and is even still close to one of his friends. In other words she's still technically in the picture and it's giving me massive anxiety. 
I know it's dumb and that as long as I trust him it's all that matters, but the idea of her just upsets me in a really petty way. I hate that she ever had his affection, and from what little info I have of her she sounds kinda awful. But that is most likely just me being jealous for no reason. 
Regardless it still deeply upsets me when she's mentioned and I don't know wether to tell my boyfriend or not. We promised we'd be super open with each other about insecurities and such, but it's not like he brings her up an excessive amount. And I don't want him to think he has to sensor himself around me, not to mention that his friends will still be bringing her up from time to time anyways. 
But I have such an awful physical reaction to the mention of her, I think my boyfriend maybe has noticed this because when time when bringing her up I got pretty down and he was quick to change the subject. ",21Apr2018,1

My family has been shuffling me around to doctors appointments and and keeping my secret but I know they want me to tell people, especially because I won't let them tell our family yet. 
I don't want things to change and I feel like this is my coping mechanism, to be able to finish my first high school year without people treating me weird, I want people to treat me as though I'm the same person I was three weeks ago before the fateful news. 
I just want to feel normal for just a little while longer 
I feel guilt for being sick, which sounds awful but I have so many amazing friends and I know so many people lean on me just to make it through the day I don't know how I could tell them that I might have cancer 
Don't get me wrong I'm not leaving people in the dark, I do have a heart disorder which I have had no problem telling them about and they have been taking that news fairly well, I just don't want to have to look into my best friend's eye (F15) and tell her I have brain cancer, which is what the doctors are suspecting and looking for. 
I just don't want to do this to my parents and talking about it makes it too real, I feel like its some how my fault that if I hadn't said anything this wouldn't have happened.
I asked my doctor if the tests come back positive to with hold treatment until the summer, if I've been sick for this long what's a few more weeks gonna do. 
They already pulled me out of Physical Education and gave me a hall pass to take the elevator, I basically sit and do nothing for two hours everyday at school while I watch my team do what I love

However, they treat me decently when we do hang out and don't seem to outwardly dislike me. We laugh at each other's jokes and get along well so I don't understand why this is happening. I really wish I could either a) become more a part of these groups so I do get invited to stuff and actually feel like I belong or b) find new friends. I have tried both options but neither are easy.

219,"I have a very negative view of society and humanity when it comes to the big picture, so I choose to focus only on my own life because that's where I still see value and hope.  But it's only natural that I still sometimes encounter people expressing thoughts on this and trying to offer productive advice for people.   Be they written thoughts, comics, videos, or other audio/visual work, I always instantly find myself feeling just as down looking at those as when I stumble upon people reflecting on the more negative aspects of their own life or broader, more wide-reaching grievances (Be they for the sake of dark humor, some genuine expression of grief, or both).

I'm trying to figure out why, but other than maybe it being because I think encouragement and good efforts are still futile, I'm not 100% sure because the feelings are more generalized pessimism than specific reasons.  I've had people tell me that maybe it's because the people writing these things seem happy so I'd think they're BSing, but I've never paid attention to flourishing people like that and only see stuff apparently made by super troubled and sad people, so I don't think that's it.

The only other thing that sticks out to me is that comments and replies on the negative expressions always tend to be mainly stuff along the lines of ""THANK YOU!  I experience this too and I'm so happy to know I'm not alone, this is the most meaningful post ever.""  That has never meant anything to me, at least not positively, because thinking about how many people must feel so bad just makes me sadder.

As in the title. I've worked as a part-time contractor for a relatively unknown social network plus several minor gigs since I left school, but I've been unemployed for more than one year now. I am twenty and my former job paid for my family's expenses. Now no one in my house has a job, I have two little sisters and I am the only one that can or is willing to handle the situation. 

It's not like I am unskilled. I have worked in both programming and computer security. I know several programming languages (from x86 assembly all the way up to Javascript, passing through C, Python and PHP). I am competent enough to develop good software and perform security audits on other people's software and networks. I regularly check job offers, and I have all the requisites, minus one: a degree. It's not even like I am applying to jobs at NASA, I am literally desperate and would take any decent paying job, but nowadays they are asking for degrees even to manage Wordpress installs (sorry for the non-technical people here. For reference, it's a thing anyone can learn to do in a week, if he's particularly slow). 

I searched for local job postings, too. It's a small city and the job offers are either for: people with degrees, welders and women (most of them are actually only for women, even though I have no idea why being a woman would be a requisite to be a cashier...).

Wonderful my mother thinks I am at fault for the following: I got up in my pajamas and wanted to take a shower for that I wanted to take out fresh clothing from my drawer which is located in the room that used to be my room and which now functions as a guest room for my brother, his wife and 1 year old son when they come over. So I hear my brother talking to his son and hear my nephew blabbering and clearly being active .my sister in law is out of the picture since she is chatting downstairs with my mother and I can hear them. So no one in that room is asleep. I gently knock before I enter because it seems rude to me to enter without announcing ones intention to enter to the people inside. I hear my brother saying “(Tobias)is sleeping.while I clearly hear that my nephew is talking. I knock gently again and say “he is not I can hear him talking”. No answer this time. I still hear my nephew talking. I enter my brother is laying in bed with his son who is awake and playing on the bed while my brother is watching. My brother turns around and gives me the stare while I grab fresh cloth in less then a minute with minimal noise. On my way out l he tells me people shouldn’t knock in the first place. I call him out on his lying and bullshit attitude and end my sentence with that I think he is an ass. He points at his child and gives me the death stare. My brother and I do not have the best relationship I would even say there is no relationship at all. I think he cannot really stand me and I have to admit neither can I. But I would not lie to prevent someone from starting with their morning routine.
I mean what should I have done? Even if he was in the middle of putting his son to sleep that doesn’t justify Imo lying to me with the intention of preventing me from entering just because he cannot stand me.

I know children need rituals and structures but me being in that room for less then a minute without being much of a distraction while the ritual would have been fine IMO.

234,"All my life I’ve struggled with the idea of picking one thing and sticking with it. I have a passion for music and science. I wanted to go to school for music but my parents advised me not to because they thought it was a waste of a degree. So At  18 years old I went to university for biology and failed because I was partying smoking pot and being lazy. Two years later, I enrolled again, but this time in economics. I like economics and I find it interesting but not something I’m passionate about, nor do the careers sound stimulating for me. Needless to say, my marks aren’t that great and I’m having a quarter life crisis. I’m currently deciding, should I just stick with economics? I feel like I’m dying inside. Now I’m thinking about oceanography because of my love for the ocean, or aviation training to become a pilot. I wanted to do music, but I don’t have the money for it now and at this point in my life (after quitting jazz drums for 4 years) I feel like I’ve missed the train on that. ",21Apr2018,2

236,"I am an American citizen and my girlfriend is a Chinese citizen. We met in college and dated for over 2 years before she had to go back to China after graduating. I love her dearly, and would like to continue our relationship together.

In the past 2 years, I have traveled to China in my free time for visits, as well as she has come here on a tourist visa for a week/so at a time. However this is not sustainable. 

Outside of applying for marriage are there any options for her to come here to America? As far as going to China, I have a high paying job in America that I enjoy- and all of the job opportunities in China are fractional to the salary I make now. 

We have thought about her visiting for 6 months on a tourist visa and possibly getting married after then. However, I've seen online this can be problematic as this is not looked highly upon with her being on a tourist visa. 

Any other legal ways to get her to America?

237,"I (21F) spent the last 2 years of my life in Omaha, NE to work at my company's main office as a condition for a job, the original plan was to move back to Portland, OR when I was done with the 2 years and able to work from home so I could be back in the area where I grew up with friends and family, however last month I made a last minute decision to move to North Carolina instead.

240,"I don't know how to get this started or how to put to words what I feel, but I shall try anyway.

I've stayed with my classmates in a 2BHK flat for 10 months, and I haven't really had an amazing time with them. Before I go into the specifics of my stay with them, let me give you a little bit of background. I'm 21, two and three years older than my two roommates. One hails from a second tier town \(as do I\) while the other comes from a village. They both have different worldviews from me, and I don't really enjoy spending time with them. While I understand that nobody ever enjoys spending time with their housemates, I find conversations with them super draining. They're mild anxiety inducers. I'm a mild neat\-freak and a very organized person; they are anything but. They're also behind the curve in things that I really care about.

They also have absolutely no regard for my time. They force me into hanging out with them despite my telling them that I have tonnes of work to do.

They offer nothing to the table. They borrow my scooter, chair and table, among other things and I don't really like sharing my stuff, especially those I use daily. I can't set boundaries with them, as they clearly don't get the concept of boundaries. Plus, they're some of the most irresponsible persons I've ever known. You can find clothes lying around everywhere in the house and, unless I point it out, the clothes won't go anywhere until they do their monthly laundry \(using my detergent, mind you\).

Talking about detergents reminds me of the things they never buy but use anyway. They eat my fruits without ever asking me \(and I follow a fruitarian diet of sorts\) and never replace them. They use my cutlery \(no boundaries, let me remind you\), toothpaste, mosquito repellent and clothes conditioner, among other things.

Also, the fact that I also share my classroom space with them means I see them all the time. It gets to me sometimes, as they often want to speak about class stuff \(gossips, usually\) with me. Even when I clearly no show interest, they still continue to talk anyway.

Plus, I pay the electric bill, internet bill, rent and other things; they sometimes don't send in the money to my account on time, and it makes me irate when they do that. Plus, if a tap doesn't work, the bathrooms are unclean, internet doesn't work, or the fan stops working, I must call plumbers, electricians and scavengers to get things sorted; they never do that.

Sadly, we don't communicate like adults, and that only results in my resentment growing in leaps and bounds.

**That said, I think I need to be with them as well.**

Here are five reasons why I think I need to be with them.

1. I'm not a very social person. About 70 percent of the friends I've made in the recent times were friends with them initially.
2. They're my classmates, and it makes doing assignments pretty easy and efficient. Also, they help me wake up in time for the class, as my circadian rhythm is effed up.
3. I don't want loneliness to exacerbate underlying mental or personality disorders and addictions. My family members do seem to have a few bit of undiagnosed mental or personality disorders, and I think having conversations with them \(even if I don't particularly enjoy those poor quality conversations\) is at least marginally important.
4. Living alone can be expensive. I'll have to pay thrice as much as I've done the last 10 months.
5. I wake up sad on most days. Hearing them talk loudly in the other room helps me forget the things that make me sad.

I'm not sure if I should stay with them or move out. Help me out, Reddit.",21Apr2018,2
241," 
This is incredibly hard for me to admit or even talk about it, but I need serious help and advice. For the past two years I've been enduring my moms physical and verbal abuse and I've been strong about it but now I can't do it anymore.


I'm 21 and my life has gone spiraling down. My mom is verbally and psychically abusive, incredibly toxic, narcissistic just complete hell spawn. I have strict parents and live in a typical Asian household where parental abuse is normal. When I was younger it used to be that she would hit me or thump me because I was misbehaving or being a ""bad child"" but always pushed it aside and it progressively grew worst as I got older but I still bottled up the abuse and pushed it aside. She would scream at me for every little thing I did, berate me, call me useless and tell me how much she regrets having me as a child. She's even said that she'd rather give birth to a dog and it'd be more helpful to her than I am.


I remember her coming home from work one day, she was stressed and tired and the house was sort of a mess. (I was 12 at the time) She walked in and all hell broke loose. She screamed and screamed and I was terrified and hid. She found me and threatened to kill me with this 20 lbs vase she was holding in her hand. 


I have really bad anxiety when I'm around her and have had multiple panic attacks where I've fainted because she's yelled at me. Has happened 4 times in my lifetime.


3 years ago, we were at our lowest financially and my mom decided to open up a business. I was still in school and also had a good paying job. She and my dad poured every ounce, every penny into that business. However, when the time came near that the business was opening up, she threatened me to quit my job and promised me that she would pay me better than my current job did and I did it. Being the authority figure and abusive tendencies, how could I say no? I worked for her and she never paid me a single penny. I eventually had to drop out of college because I had no money to pay off my school bills and we couldn't afford it either. So, instead she offered to pay my school bills in exchange that I work with her.


Working with her was the worst. She's very particular and strict. Always yelling at me to do this or do that in a certain way or I'm too slow at my job. She would hit me with whatever object was in her hand. She's thrown chairs, knives at me. Several months ago she came all the way home from work and beat me with a wooden broom until I had bruises the size of baseballs. I couldn't do anything because I was sleeping at the time and she burst into my room. I hid under the covers until she stopped. A couple weeks ago she splashed hot water on me. It's like this every time she has a outburst and then it would go back to normal and she could be joking and laughing with me.


If you're wondering where my dad is in this picture, he's also a victim to my mother's verbal abuse so he stopped fighting back. He's incredibly kind hearted man, never laid a hand on me and is scared of my mom. He won't defend me or call her out so he's useless. I have a younger sister who is also a victim of my moms physical and verbal abuse. My mom and her aren't on talking terms anymore. 


I'm too ashamed to even talk to any family members about this and none of them even care. My closest friends have moved to other states so I really have no one to turn to. I'm terrified of the consequences if I go to the police about this so my ideal is to leave quietly and never see her again. Today. I ran away from my workplace because she threw a fit and started screaming at me. I am just bawling my eyes out writing this at my local library.

For context, bigoneforfun2014 is a pornhub community user/poster who puts up videos of him having sex with peoples wives and girlfriends. In a few of his videos, it appears as if her partner knows and is even filming the video, but from his twitter and tumblr, the screenshots he posts of text messages it seems like these wives are cheating on their husbands. [Here is one text message someones wife sent to him](https://78.media.tumblr.com/8a9cc8b01be273fac226401ea1c7c375/tumblr_nhaddkPUSr1telacyo3_1280.png). 

Another woman gave this review for him on his tumblr: 

&gt; Best sex I have had in 12 years!!!Clearing my calendar to see him again. Attentive, passionate, intelligent and a real pleaser! I just found out that size does matter! That huge beautiful cock made me orgasm multiple times. His tongue too. Mmm. Mmm. Good!

His response to this review, was: **That’s the thing. The reason it was the best sex in 12 years for her?  I don’t treat her like a fragile little princess. Her husband can treat her like a breakable special doll  I, however, fucked her like a woman should be fucked.  Like she was wanted, desired, and like she needed.  I yanked her around, gave it to her hard, pulled her hair, pounded her roughly, and gave her a size she had never experienced before.** So you can tell this guy gets a kick out of women cheating on their partners.


This is some 40 year old guy, with a dick that is almost 9 inches long, and you have to turn the volume on his videos down because of how loud the women scream from the pure pleasure he gives them with it. i wont appreciate hearing any platitudes about size not mattering, thats not helping anyone here. So you can understand why so many women are willing to risk their relationships for his dick.


A month ago, my wife told me she had to go into work for a meeting with her boss during the morning, she dressed up and put more effort into her appearance than she usually does but whatever I thought, its a meeting with her boss. So after she leaves, I went out to the grocery store, and I saw her boss there. This was 45 minutes after she left home. We started talking and he said to give his regards to my wife. I thought this is odd, didnt he see her in the meeting, or at least he was going to see her? I also wondered how it could have been over so fast if it did happen. I didn't say anything to him about it to avoid creating awkwardness for her after. Anyway, I didn't give it much thought, even though I should have and maybe found out sooner. 

Last night, my friend is sharing random tweets with me, and shares one of bigoneforfun2014, who posts clips of him fucking all these married and taken women. For a moment time stood still when I saw the socks the woman in that video was wearing. They were high striped socks, the exact same ones I had got for her just a month before. She was moaning in ways I have never heard her moan before. I am 100% certain this is my wife. I couldn't believe it, I'm still in shock and my hands haven't stopped shaking.",21Apr2018,0

250,"Hi everyone! This may end up being long so I'll try to cut right to the important parts.

My boyfriend(of one year)'s father is currently in the hospital with mere months to live. This has been extremely stressful for him and, for a long time, he refused to talk about it. Lately, he's been opening up to me more and more, and he confessed to me something that he's never told anyone before. His mother raped him consistently as a child, for years, into his early teens. He moved out of the house as soon as possible and has since severed ties with her as much as possible. 

However, since his father has been in the hospital, he's been making the two hour commute to visit him frequently. The issue is, his mother stays there most of the time. He doesn't want to visit when she's there, because she instigates issues, and he just wants to get as much time in with his father as he can before it's too late. 

Things have been getting better. He got a very well-paying job right near his father, and is currently working on moving over there. Right now, he's commuting 2 hours to work every single day. I convinced him to visit his father even with his mother there. I didn't quite grasp the extremity of the situation and I thought maybe she would leave him alone, as they had a mutual understanding about what's important-- his father. However, his first night visiting with her there, she started a fight with him because he hasn't contact her in years. She turned all of his family in the room against him. 

The second time he visited, she tried the same thing again. She got in his face while yelling, and he hit her. His father told him to leave, and his mother told him to never come back. His father called this morning and demanded that he apologize to his mother. He was very angry.

This is where we are currently. He is getting completely overloaded with stress, to the point of breaking down. Between when he gets home from work, and when he goes to sleep, he has about 2 hours of free time. Some days he stays out late to see his father, and then comes home with horrible news like that. He spends a lot of time panicking, waiting to receive the call that his father finally passed. I feel so horrible. I just want things to get better for him before they get worse. 

What can he do maximize his time with his father and make things positive before it's too late? Any and all advice is welcome, as I'm completely lost on this situation. I just can't stand the thought that there will be a time where he is regretting not doing enough. 

Please, please help. And thank you all so much in advance.",21Apr2018,2

255,"I need to fix my sleep. I'm going to bear my soul here, and go in-depth on explaining everything, because my sleep habit is the biggest stress in my life right now, and has ruined a lot of things for me. Please help me fix this.

It all started around 6 years ago when I was 18. I stopped smoking weed after doing it constantly for 2 years. Literally high 24/7. I stopped all substances (been sober ever since), weed, alcohol, coke, mdma, everything. I had a little bit of an issue with the coke and molly, but I was certainly addicted to weed. That's when I noticed my sleep to get slightly out of whack, but I could still maintain a normal human sleep schedule. While I quit doing drugs, my friends continued, and I still hung out with them. That's when I started going home around 5am, and going to sleep around 5am. Not as consistently at first, but then it started to become the norm. I'd eventually fix it by not going to bed at 5am, staying up the whole day, and going to bed at a reasonable time, then eventually repeating the cycle.

That's how my bad sleeping habits started, and it affected me at the multiple part-time jobs I've had throughout the years. Using up all my days off, last minute shift changes, just not showing up, etc. I'd usually get away with it though. I got good at it, and I suppose luck was involved...until I had my first big boy job and got fired around 6 months ago.

The year is 2015. This was the worst/hardest year of my life. This was the year that my anxiety/ocd that hadn't been treated came to a head. I had just quit a job I was at because I had an intense panic attack and needed to figure this out. My sleep schedule was messed up at this point of course, so the following day or two I decided to fix it how I always fix it. Stay up 24+ hours and go to bed around 10pm. I stay up the whole day and lay in bed around 10pm, only I'm not falling asleep. 1 hour passes, then another. At this point I'm exhausted, and my anxiety is starting to kick in. It's around midnight and I start having the most intense panic attacks I've ever had. I'm shaking horribly and the attacks just keep persisting. I essentially had a 5 hour panic attack, it was the worst day of my life. I wake up my Dad because I didn't know what to do, then we wake up my Mom. Eventually I say, I think I need to go to the hospital, and they agree. I go to the hospital, get a shot of ativan in my ass, and they say I'll be asleep in 20 minutes. 2 hours later I'm home and I fall asleep. Fast forward a few days because I don't remember what happened when I got home besides us figuring out what we're going to do about this anxiety thing. I have another panic attack, only this time, it's during the day and I'm having intense suicidal thoughts. We go to the hospital again, and I'm admitted to an in-patient treatment program for mental illness, essentially. I get on medication, and get my anxiety/ocd under wraps (I'm still dealing with it because I basically had to start over mentally at square one, but I'm doing very well, and I'm currently happy). I do in-patient, then out-patient, then see a therapist every week, and would you believe it? I'm on a regular sleep schedule!

I maintain this for about 3 months. That's when I start to get on my computer more, and I'm doing electronics an hour before bed instead of writing in my journal or reading. That's when I start to devolve into my old sleeping habits, and it's scaring me because I don't want a repeat of the worst night of my life. I'm deathly afraid of that happening again. I still am honestly. I have not fixed my sleep schedule that way ever since. I now do a new method that I have gotten down to a science. I go around the clock. I stay up and go to bed an hour or two later each night until I'm at a normal sleep schedule. Currently I'm going going to bed at 11pm and waking up at 7am. I've been on this schedule for two days and I'd like to keep it that way.

Let me take you through a *typical* day of mine:

* Wake up, play on my phone for an hour, sometimes even two (I'm now just trying to wake up at 7 with an alarm, and get out of bed)
* Go the to gym. (sometimes eat breakfast before. I'm also dieting. Staying under 2000 calories and not eating shitty food). I'm about 20 pounds over weight. Just have a Dad bod going on. I do 30 mins of cardio, then work on arms and abs
* Take a 15-45 minute shower.
* Eat breakfast (if I haven't already)
* Fuck around on my computer until lunch. Eat at computer
* Fuck around on my computer until dinner. Eat at computer (I don't currently have a job because I'm trying to figure out this sleep, plus I'm lazy, but I do have an interview this Monday for a job and I really don't wanna fuck it up)
* Fuck around on computer until an hour before bedtime.
* Get in bed and play on phone for around an hour
* Fall asleep (hopefully)

I've always been a very light, and very specific sleeper. Even when I was a baby. I hated taking naps (I still never take naps). I need all these things to go to sleep. Those are the essentials. I haven't slept at anyones house in around 3 years because I'm very afraid I won't be able to sleep. Let me list what I need if I'm going to sleep.

* I need my medication. I take .5mg of ativan every night (along with an anti-depressant). It allows my brain to kind of shut off so I don't have a billion thoughts going through my head. It doesn't make me tired, just calms me down. Eventually I'd like to not need it, but I'm not ready for that. Even thinking of getting off of it gives me anxiety.
* I need it to be very dark. I have black out curtains.
* I need it to be cold and have background noise. I use a fan and an air conditioner. Year round. 

I believe I know where I'm going wrong. It's like, I think I know what I have to do, but I almost just need someone to be like, ""hey, idiot, do this! Just do it!""

* I probably need to be more active and have less computer time. I do go out occasionally, but for the most part I'm a home body. Once I have a job I'll spend less time on the computer. Plus I go to the gym almost everyday, so that's being active. I know exercise early in the day, and losing weight will help with sleep.
* An hour before bed I should probably just read a book or write and not be on my computer. I also probably shouldn't get into bed and get on my phone. idk I hope you all understand I'm a creature of habit and change scares me. The thought is scary to me of laying in bed and just closing my eyes and waiting to fall asleep. I like being on my phone because it get's to the point where I'm so tired that I just fall asleep. Sometimes phone still in hand. I'm really afraid that I'll lay in bed and won't be able to fall asleep, and I'll have a repeat of the worst night of my life. That is 100% my biggest fear, and I'm obviously not over it.
* I've been eating less, and healthier. I think that will help with my sleep.
* Waking up at the same time everyday (and trying to go to sleep at the same time every night) no matter what is important, but here is where things get weird. When I'm really tired, I get anxiety. I HATE being tired. When I get 6 hours of sleep, that's not a good day for me. Typically that night I'll take 1mg (double dose) of ativan. I'm afraid I'll be so tired that I won't be able to fall asleep because of anxiety and (you guessed it) have a repeat of the worst night of my life. I can't stress how terrified I am of that happening.

If I had to get advice on two things (but I'm very, very open to other advice on what to do out of this huge wall of text) they'd be:

* I feel like people get really tired around an hour or two before they go to bed. That doesn't happen to me, and that's why I don't go to sleep at consistent times. I just stay up later on the computer until I get tired. Or maybe I am tired, but I'm having a lot of fun with whatever I'm doing so I stay up.
* As I've explained, I'm very afraid of not being able to fall asleep. It hasn't happened since that one night in 2015, but the feeling is still in my head and makes me really scared. That was the first stepping stone of being having my mental breakdown. I don't want to mentally start at square 1 again.

Side notes/closing:

* I know I can do this. It will just be one of the biggest challenges of my life.
* I've told myself, maybe when I get another serious girlfriend, and we're consistently sleeping in bed together, I'll have a better shot at having a normal sleep schedule. I say that because it happened before, albeit that was 6 years ago. It's not something I'm banking on either. I don't want that to be my ultimate goal. 
* If I can't get advice in this thread. I'm wondering if there is a professional I can see? Are there sleep therapists? Someone to say, ""hey, you need to do this""? Do those exist?

I really appreciate the people who took the time to read through this lol I just feel it's important exposition if I'm to tackle this issue. Thank you in advance. I'll do an ""edit"" if I think of more. Feel free to ask whatever question you need to ask. I'll answer 100% honestly. I need to fix this.",21Apr2018,2

257,"I starter dating my ex when I was 19. He was my first bf (I had been sexually assulted by someone, tournented and had a pretty bad life until that time). 

I met him online, we met in person and liked each other. He told me to take my dating profile down and he would too. Saw each other for 3 weeks before making it official. I said I wouldn’t sleep with him unless we where bf and gf. Well I slept with him, then A week later he messaged me and dumped me. Saying he wasn’t up for it just as he was leaving for a weekend away and I was starting a new job the next day. 

I was really pissed off but not that hurt and got over it. Didn’t know him that long. Then after 3 weeks he messaged saying he is sorry and would like a second chance. I gave it. And we became official again after 3 weeks. He was the first to say he loved me and then he gave me keys to his house. Christmas came and he got me a present of his favorite music, and s trip for us to somewhere he wanted to go...hmm ok I wasn’t really pleased with it but nice enough. 

We live 1hr away and I lived with my parents so he would NEVER come to my place. I had to go to his. I wanted to change jobs and settle down and it was hard being so far away. I could get jobs near him or much further out. I was staying over 4times a week. So pretty much living there. 

I wanted to move in. Nope would not do it. Was afraid I’d take his house or something. Then after a year he dumped me. Because I wanted to move in. Then again he comes back to me. I take him back then 6 months later he dumps me again. I take him back. 

He wouldn’t go anywhere with my friends, wouldn’t do any activity I liked if he didn’t. Would pinch and bite me, put me down, tell me not to eat junk because I’d get fat. Wouldn’t come to Christmas with my side. Was very his way or the highway. I definitely didn’t agree with this and there where arguments. 

Then after a year after his last dumping me, I asked seriously will you let me move in. He said no, not now. So I left. As I left he was laughing saying I’d never leave him. But I did. He sent me abusive emails, also saying who would love me, and my sexual assault makes me shit, and same old, said the same stuff when he dumped me too. 

We have both moved on but I moved on to someone totally different to him. He is a wonderful man but I had to move far away for him (we met when traveling so one had to move). So I terribly miss my family. I have everything in my life BUT my family. They live days away by flight. 

I then found out my ex married someone with same racial background as me (I was his first with my background) and she looks exactly like me, likes the same things. It’s me. He married her in 3 years. (But he did want kids by a certain age which he just got) 

But I keep thinking now, what if I had stayed. I’m pretty sure I would have married him. Would I have been happy. More happy? Would I be close with my family? Would I have everything?

So a little bit of backstory, I was raised Catholic and have gone to Catholic school every year of school besides seventh grade when I went to a charter school for a year. I have been baptized and received First Communion. I'm currently a freshman in high school and my mom wants me to get confirmed. I do not want to get confirmed mainly because I do not believe in anything the Catholic church teaches. Their teachings go completely against my personal beliefs and when I am in religion class or church I just feel like I am imprisoned. I do not want to live my life that way. It also annoys me how my mom is basically forcing me to do it. It shouldn't be her decision, it should be mine because it's a very personal decision.

269,"Hi,
i’m tagging this as “personal” since a lot of personal reasons are leading to my problem. So, i’m 20 and in my fourth semester in medical school in germany. basically did everything “right”, finished high school with remarkable grades and got straight into medical school. when i was in school i always wanted to do something sciencey, like chemistry perhaps, but my dad (doctor) convinced me that i had more options going to medical school (research as well as practicing physician or something in between); he didn’t push it on me per se but he definitely influenced me in my decision, yes. he’s also a kind of role model to me and i have a really close relationship with him. so yes, 1 1/2 years pass and i really really enjoy my studies. i like what i’m doing and i especially enjoy subjects like physiology and biochemistry, because understanding the human body on it’s molecular level makes me wet my panties a little bit. i never once thought about doing something else during that time. now a few things happen at around the same time - i meet a great guy who’s doing law, and from what he tells me it is vastly different to what i thought about it. i must say i am impressed by how it reflects logic and system, how you produce and argue your own thoughts in exams - that’s something i haven’t gotten to do in 2 years now. well, i madly fall in love with him but things turn to shit between us, but that’s a different story. this did however also influence my emotional stability. okay so then my dad has his stroke, he’s really unwilling to go to the hospital and no one listens to me, no one sees how irrational he’s being. these hours affected me so much, i think it took me about a week to work through those emotions. he gets to the hospital late, luckily it’s just a minor stroke but he’s got trouble walking, speaking and writing. i am reminded of why practicing medicine isn’t for me: disregard for patients but the leading factor: we don’t know shit. people get sick, people get better. we mostly have no idea why. my dad was stressed and had really high bp and smoked but from a neurological standpoint he didn’t portray the standard stroke candidate. i wanted to go into medicine to understand, to grasp “knowledge” and - i hate admitting that to myself - i thought that knowledge could somehow help me; save me; make me untouchable. a lot of doctors have that idea in their heads. they’re detached and think their white coats protect them. i only just now realised that i probably made my decision on those grounds - i didn’t wanna put my life into someone else’s hands. i can’t picture myself working myself into my grave, being stressed and terribly overworked. working, doing the same thing over again without creating, without putting meaning and myself into my work. but i also don’t know if i should be making decisions right now. my dad - my role model - “failing”, turning out not to be untouchable caused deep insecurity in myself. i’m convinced i didn’t make the decision to go to medical school by myself. i feel like i lost myself or i never found myself. i think im “growing up” only now - realising your parents aren’t omniscient (and yes i “knew” but i didn’t physically feel it) and aren’t always right is scaring the shit out of me. and i feel like i wanna go into a field that is more rational, more theoretical, that makes sense and follows rules, where i can think and debate logically and come to conclusion: i want to create but i want to create logic. and that’s why law school appears more and more appealing to me. should i quit medical school and try out law? the problem is that losing my spot at medical school could actually mean i don’t get in again, and if i do i might have to repeat some courses etc. - in short - giving up medical school now might mean losing a lot of time or possibly not getting in again at all if i change my mind. i am looking into keeping my spot while starting law, financially not really a problem here (free university) but i need three different student bodies to be fine with it - bureaucracy en masse. am i just making myself crazy? am i just traumatised and thinking horse poop? should i dare? medical school gives me a safe and well paid job, law is very much depending on your final grade in one/two exams and there’s less jobs and they’re often paid worse. i just really don’t know and i feel so lost. but i just feel like i can’t move on like this right now",21Apr2018,5

I'm 26, female, living with severe Schizophrenia. I've been better for the past 3 years, been on good medication and haven't been hospitalized, but recently I was in the hospital for a suicide attempt(like 3 weeks ago), but was not hospitalized, just stayed in the hospital overnight for the OD.

I have one class left in community college before I get my AA degree in Graphic and Web Design. But it's insanely difficult for me to go to school, it's ridiculously stressful to finish this one class and I find myself becoming symptomatic. And I wonder if I should take a break and just go to mental health groups with my days for a while. 

I don't know if I ever see myself working, as the stress will trigger symptoms and I'll disappear. 

Should I just give up the idea of being ""normal"" and working? Should I just focus on my mental health and spend my days going to groups at my mental health clinic and focusing on meds and stuff? Should my life become mental health focused? 

I don't know what to do. I feel like it would be nice to just go to groups and relax, not worry about school or work, and I can do it because I get SSI/disability money and live in a low-income apartment, so I don't really have to worry about money.

He also began putting his head onto his shoulder. In the last week, these actions have increased to a point where I think I should do something but I’m not sure what. For example, in the past week he’s started shouting ‘fuck off’ and screaming or screeching. He also repeats phrases he hears, or words like ‘electron’ or ‘please’. The foot to touch a crack one has gotten to a point where he’ll run back into the road to touch a white line, or push someone out of the way just so he can do it. I’ve had friends from our circle come to me asking what’s up with him, he has been going to therapy and is on 2 medications but everything has increased recently. He doesn’t open up to me much, but he doesn’t tell any of our other friends ANYTHING regarding these actions he does, I know about to medication and therapy but nothing about whether he has a diagnosis or why he does these actions. He’s been 20 minutes + late for every time we’ve gone out this past week, and when questioned he says ‘I was Tic-ing’. I’m not exactly sure what to do, but as a friend I notice these common rituals and behaviours and it’s making everyone within our friendship circle stressed. 
Should I tell someone or get in contact with a relative of his (as I am close to him and his family)? Or should I ask him personally what I should do to help? ",21Apr2018,2
304,"ok so say I help a person here on reddit.  what if this person is also a terrorist? i help him and he ends up killing 500 people.  am i guilty of providing aid and comfort to the enemy?

or would i have to have known he was a terrorist and that i had known my aid would help him kill people?


it's not like these terrorists are posting ""HI I'm a terrorist and I'd like to have some help figuring out this bomb timing device.  please reddit help me kill people.""",21Apr2018,2
305,"I reached out to family and friends and only 1 person actually gave a shit and helped me get food. So I now know no one in my life except this one person actually gives a ship about me. Its sad, but slightly relieving. I was also hired at a new job and as of today my training is over. So I have a source of income, but its a low income.

Going forward though I now face the issue of my debt and housing. Next week I have to move out and haven't found a place due to having to pay for breaking my lease. Its becoming clear to me that I may be homeless but working til I pay it all back. How can I prepare myself physically and mentally for this?",21Apr2018,2

307,"I live in a household with 7 cats (only 2 are mine). We feed them dry food because 1 of the 7 cats has a bladder issue (UTI) that's standard of older male and needs to eat special food. It's not super expensive so we give it to all of the cats because it's healthier for them. It shows, according to the vet all of the cats are perfectly healthy except for 1, Pikachu, who is overweight (but not obese, yet). 

I've tried everything, but she's just a low energy cat and it's impossible to force a cat to exercise when she doesn't want to. The only thing I can think to do is put her on a diet. We don't free feed them, all 7 cats share two cups of cat food per day. Any advice? I'm open to changing food for them as well, if anyone has (relatively cheap, I am feeding 7 cats) brand recommendations that the UTI boy can still eat. Thanks!",21Apr2018,2
308,"Hi Everyone,

After about a year and a half of experimenting with different things, I've decided that I want to put my full effort into YouTube, gaming in particular. I absolutely love it and I want to have a positive influence on others, particularly younger people. I would love to have millions of subscribers and be similar to Jackscepticeye or Markiplier (as anyone would), but I'm VERY determined to make this happen.

My Biggest Debate:

Start off with my favorite game, Runescape 3. 
Pros: 1. I've played the game for a long time and understand it very well
2. It's a very niche specific start
Cons: 1. Much of that player base is older than the viewer base I want long term.
2. There aren't many successful RS3 YouTubers because of this

Start Indie/Console Games:
Pros: 1. It's what I would like to do long-term
2. There is a larger audience

Cons: 1. This seems to be a very saturated market
2. The games I currently have are older (WiiU/Xbox360). I finally have enough to buy a Switch when the next big game comes out, but I wanted to gather some advice before making that commitment.

Option 3:
Could I do both?

Thank you for reading and for your advice in advance :)",21Apr2018,2

310,"So... today my sister received a package addressed to her at our address from Amazon. The package contained a welcome mat that simply said 'hello'. she distinctly did not order this package and felt the need to call Amazon customer service in order to figure out what was going on. According to the Amazon service member. The item was purchased by Capitol One Credit. they where not allowed to give any other information than that. It arrived today: the same day we just signed a lease to a new Place and the same day as her late wife's birthday. I wanted to ask the wise of Reddit for advise for my sister on how to proceed with this situation. Should we inform law enforcement? should we contact Capitol One? She would we sleep with daggers under our pillows? 

Please advise Thank you,  

PS: She is mid thirty something and I am late 20 something.",21Apr2018,4
311,"Hi, I made a plan with my friends 2 weeks ago and me and my girlfriend were supposed to go to play bowling with them today but I told them this morning that I dont think we can play bowling today because of the money.

So we decided to go to the restaurant with them and I honestly don't care where we go and since I ditched them first, i thought i would let them decide on places for dinner. 

But my girlfriend just wanted to go this random restaurant and kept insisting on that place.

 Even though, I suggested her that we could find similar places. She won't listen to me and told me she is gonna go to the restaurant by herself if I'm not following her. To be honest, I love my girlfriend more than anything and I listen to what she says all the time but I just don't wanna ditch them again just because she won't compromise and get mad at me.

Should I go to the restaurant with my friends by myself? Or should I follow my girlfriend?

Sorry for bad english ;)",21Apr2018,2
312,"I won't give out much info except what is necessary to understand the situation, since it's a pretty personal matter.

My parent has been diagnosed with kidney disease, and a year ago they failed. They've been on trips to the hospital 3 times a week ever since then, which I imagine must be very hard. (3 times a week to cleanse blood since kidneys don't work)
In order to do a kidney transplant, her antibodies are too strong for her body to accept any new organ - in order for a transplant to be possible, they'd need to take some sort of pills that weaken those antibodies over the course of a long time. Pills which they definitely won't take.

My parent is sketchy of medicine. They prefer the ""spiritual"" side, which is very worrying for me because I call bullshit on most of that.

Doctors are telling her that kidneys cannot heal and my paren't will not accept that, they have taken a trip to a doctor that apparently does ""quantum medicine"" (which I've never heard of before being told about this - searched it online and people say it's a hoax, apparently quacks use the term ""quantum"" to lure in anyone who is gullible or desperate)
My parent said they've been diagnosed with some sort of machine there that shows you on a graph how your organs and spine are doing, based on a color chart. They've told me this machine is ""very complicated and that astronauts are diagnosed with it to make sure they are very safe before departure"" which I was *really* skeptical about because it does sound like something to lure somebody in. I didn't comment on it since I don't want to contradict them and because I don't have any knowledge of the subject. I don't know what the machine is called but they will tell me more about it tomorrow.
They've been prescribed some sort of treatment with water, I think it's most likely a placebo but what do I know.

To justify ""quantum medicine"", my parent has told me about someone called ""Bruce Lipton"" that talks about a concept of ""not getting sick because you don't want to get sick"", basically. Everyone on the net says he's the typical quacker with no evidence to support his claims, and a lot of fallacies.

I don't want to tell my parent anything about what I think because that wouldn't solve anything, it would just make the whole situation worse.

I don't know what to do. Probably nothing would be the best answer here, right? Giving hope is the only thing I can do, they are very sensitive about this and the whole thing is **very** sketchy.

TL;DR parent's kidneys failed, seeking hope they perhaps fell into some quack's scheme which would most likely be a scam. What do I do? Help!",21Apr2018,2
313,"Hi, redditors. I’m having a problem, and it’s the fact that I do not enjoy being in night clubs. I don’t appreciate the hot environment, nor being in touch with other human beings, and I especially don’t like the music that plays in said places. I don’t drink alcohol either. Plus, I have no friends, and I don’t know anyone who’s going. I’ve been in night clubs around 5 times. Sadly, I have some bad experience; in all of these times, I ended up alone, until 3 a.m when I decide it’s enough and just go home.

Thing is, I’ve been friends with this girl for over 9 years. We did go to high school together, and, after 2 years of not seeing each other bc college is hell, she invited me to her birthday party, which is tonight. She’s getting pizza and then go to the night club. She’s a great friend, very understanding and nice. I don’t wanna disappoint or disrespect her by not going...

What should I do? Should I go and stay with her all night, or just go to her house, say happy birthday, enjoy dinner and go home?

Ps: sorry if there is a mistake, English it’s not my first language",21Apr2018,2
314,"If the title is confusing please allow me to clarify, my girlfriend and I have been together for 4 months now, and everything had been amazing until I was on her Instagram (she told me her password I haven't hacked her Instagram, I'm not (that) creepy) and read the messages shared between one of her current male friends. In the messages, they used to send each other Couple Page quotes (ie ""do u ever lay in bed and get really sad about your favourite person bc they're not in the bed with u"") and so what I guess I need advice on is getting over this. 

I know it's a fairly trivial issue but it bothers me that someone who used to make her so happy is still fairly involved in her life. If someone could just tell me I'm overreacting or if it's an issue with me that'd be great.",21Apr2018,3
315,Long story short; haven't heard from this girl that I've known since 08 in two months and I wanna try giving her something that shows that I still care about her. I just feel like calling/texting and leaving messages isn't really enough anymore; what do you guys think?,21Apr2018,2

So there this guy and he is pretty hot. He starts to hit on me, and we start talking blah blah blah. Then he gives me his number and we start texting for a bit. This guy is desperate cause he kept asking me to kiss him and shit like that.
