0,"Hey y’all,

Next weekend I’m going to be moving out of home into a new place but don’t currently have a job. I’m not the biggest fan of retail work but I absolutely love dogs and being outside when the weather warms up. So currently, I’m trying to start a dog walking business as a solo kind of deal  in a small town where everyone and their mom has a dog at a decent price ($22/walk), but as the moving date draws closer and I haven’t seen a single person who’s interested outside of my parents saying they “have people lined up,” I’m starting to feel stressed with trying to start a business in dog walking/sitting even though I’ve had a year of experience just doing it casually on the side for a couple of neighbors. I enjoy it, I love being around dogs, but with the business aspect creeping in and the cost of just getting things together such as a background check and bonded as well as potentially changing to self employed, it’s overwhelming me because I feel horribly lost as to what to do and it feels like it’s going to cost a lot for something that I don’t even know is going to work. I just had an interview today with a local Mom and pop type dog walking company that pays well and walks in my area. While I do not know if i will be hired, the job is nice and has security to it and I want to take it up because I need a steady source of income to pay my bills. They have a competitive clause for up to a year which is standard and kind of sucks, but to me it’s Work and something I actually enjoy. My dad is fighting me tooth and nail on starting my own business and he is knowledgeable, as he runs his own, but right now I am stressed because I am in desperate need of a job that won’t drive me crazy and stress me out horrendously (I am not a big people person) with decent pay. We just had an argument and seems to think getting a part time job or two will be quick and easy in a 2 week span and I do dog walking on the side. I argued that a part time job with a small business with a clientele that’ll potentially fluctuate won’t help me pay my bills if I’m only working 30 hours a week and two part time jobs would mean not having room for dog walking as I would be working full time. Likewise, getting a full time job would mean not being able to run a business because peak hours are in the afternoon to early evening. What I don’t have right now is money nor actual proof that he has people lined up waiting for me to walk their dogs. I am stressed, its discouraging, and most of all I’m worried about putting a financial burden on my boyfriend if I decide to open up a business that’ll take a while to build up. I don’t want to be irresponsible, I want to be responsible and carry my weight when we move it and now it’s making me stressed that I can’t seem to figure out what the fuck I’m supposed to do in this situation. I’m trying to save my money for my rent and now I’m being pressured to spend it on business related stuff when I don’t really know what’s going to happen. I just want outside advice aside from my dad because he has a much different view of the world then I do. I tend to be optimistic but in this case, it’s me trying to be realistic and make the best decision for myself.",03Apr2018,2
1,"I constantly feel the need to lie and manipulate my wife. Sometimes about small things, and sometimes bigger things.
It's really screwing our marriage up seeing she can't trust me. Shit I've even cheated before. And I'm not really sure how to fix this problem. I had to lie alot growing up. Whether it was protecting my drug addict mother or her abusive boyfriend. Or for personal gain with my father and I guess I never grew out of it but I really want to. I just don't know where to start",03Apr2018,1
3,"Both of them basically told me that they don't wish to be friends with me anymore four months ago. This was because of excessive arguing and fighting because I wasn't invited when them two were hanging out. I got obsessive about them, I was worried and had feared that I wasn't doing a good job of being a good friend and all that. I apologized every time I argued so an apology isn't going to mean anything to them.

At this point both of them don't even look at me, don't think of me and just deleted me from their minds. They talk and do things like play games with other people now when they used to with me. I don't know what to do. It makes me terrible on the inside but I haven't stopped them or argued about them not liking me or talking with other people. I haven't talked to them at all in the past month or interacted with them in any sort of way. 

I really do not know what to do and how to get them back as friends.

This has been hurting me for a couple months now and any sort of advice would be great.",03Apr2018,2
6,My mom never thought about what's next in life after raising kids. All of my siblings have left going in the military except for me and I'm college bound. We live in a small town and she doesn't socialize with anyone around town. She has no hobbies. She just watches tv all day and clean when she can. My dad doesn't really interact with her and usually is away at work. And if he is at home he's usually working out at the gym. This has been like this for all of my life. She can't get a job because of her illnesses and she recently went through rounds of chemo because of her cancer. Thankfully the cancer went away. She wants to move away to a different town but unfortunately we can't afford it. I really worried about her and I want to help out but I don't know what to do? ,03Apr2018,1
7,"20, male, highschool graduate if that info is relevant. I'm currently at a job working at a liquor store and I'm getting tired of the current environment and the irregularity in my work schedule (different offdays, plus working 3rd shift on top of that). I'd love to be able to work in some sort of office position, and I see some data entry jobs open in my area. What should I do? I don't mind if I end up making $10 an hour, I'm not really interested in the money; I'd just rather have a job I go to that isn't so menial like this. And I have no interest in college. I got an okay score (1680) on my SAT, so I guess I could get through it, but I don't want to deal with the stress of studying again.",03Apr2018,3

My friends and I have decided not to go, we all agree that 90 percent of our class are either annoying or brain dead.

9,"I'm friends with this guy and I've had a huge crush on him for well over a year now. I'm sure he doesn't like me (him moving away when I get too close, him always referring to me as A FRIEND, him asking for advice on a friend of mine he liked a couple months ago) but because we're friends, we still chat almost everyday (over text, we barely ever speak in person) and play video games together and such. I tend to analyze every single interaction we have just to try and find some sort of clue he might like me which I know is probably the most unhealthy thing I could do. He's told me he considers me to be one of his greatest friends and I would never, ever want to ruin that. So there is absolutely no chance I'll confess my feelings to him because even the slightest gamble of ruining our friendship is unthinkable.

It'd be easier if he was just some guy I was crushing on and I barely ever talked to or if he showed blatant disinterest in me, but that's not the case. We talk a lot, we game together, he comes to support me at my events, everything that a good friend would do. The issue is that no matter what I do, I keep deluding myself into thinking that maybe there's a tiny chance he'll like me. Even if there was, however, I'd never actually tell him out of fear of ruining the friendship. I have no idea what to do. I'm so lost.

11,"So, I currently work as a payroll professional and I've been doing it for almost ten years.  A year ago, I got a new job which was great.  I love the work environment, the coworkers and the job in general. 

I was just contacted by a recruiter for another payroll job.  I was not actively searching, but they found my professional profile and reached out to me.  I am tempted to actually submit a resume and apply for the job, but I feel very conflicted.

The pros is that I will be doing payroll for the third of the employees I currently do payroll for, but make more money.  And we're talking a sizeable amount.  My current earnings are about 35K but this job starts at 50K.  

The cons are having to get used to a new job, and establish myself in a new company.  I will also be the only payroll specialist as opposed to working with several (since the company I currently work for is significantly bigger).  Their benefits are also through an insurance company I'm not fond of, but that 50K is so tempting.

The recruiter seemed confident I would be a good fit, but my current place has just lost an employee and there's a lot on my shoulders and they're relying a lot on me.  I do like the job, and I'm worried if I applied for this new one, I would regret it in the end.

If you had the opportunity to leave a job you really like simply based on the workload and pay for the new job, would you go for it?",03Apr2018,2

15,"Yes. This is exactly what it sounds like.


I'm 18 , just graduated and I fucked my English teacher after I left.

Here's why, lmao


I've always been a bit promiscuous, Boy crazy, if you will. Probably a hoe .

Especially for men that dress clean and smell good...for me Mr.R was eye candy from the start.

( Speaking of eyes ,I've had ""fuck me eyes"" for as long as I can remember, if you've seen the look you know what I'm talking about ) 

It's like flirting/ showing that You're horny even when your not . 

With mr .R I was intentionally giving him the eyes 25/8 lol 
He was very nerdy, slender built,

Wore quirky patterned socks ,with dress shoes, pants (usually some obscure color ,like dusty red) and a button up shirt .

Without fail he looked like a Tumblr hipster's page's wet dream..

I ended up running into him checking out at Safeway (grocery store) , and he offered to drive me home ...it was only like a 5 minute walk but OFCOrse I took the offer.

He asked me how things have been since graduation, if I'm enrolled in school, ya know..small talk.

After I finish answering him I told him he was always my favorite teacher *insert Fuck me eyes here* , he says oh yeah? ..I say yeah.

Next thing you know his hands are down my shorts and I'm sucking him off . I was surprised at how huge and thick it was ,Idk why I thought it couldn't be that girthy just because he was thin, but no complaints...


The ride home wasn't so awkward, he told me to email him sometimes if I ever needed help with ""English"" related work..his email is on the schools directory page so I don't have to risk adding it to my phone...


He's not married so the only wrong here is that he's a teacher ,but I WAS a student . Not at the time of the incident...



Should I email him and let him fulfill my fantasy of being fucked against a wall, or save my Thot-ish ways for someone who I won't risk getting fired?",03Apr2018,0

People are saying I should ""grow up"" and be worrying that I have never been on a date with anyone at this point.

I've had a crush on a few guys but couldn't dare to confess. Instead, I just let my feelings faded away. My race might as well be a factor as I've crushed on some people of different races.

20,"For my final project in college, I decided to challenge myself by creating an artistic videogame. After all, I thought, I want to work in the art department for video games (textures, 3D models, animation). I thought it could be a good way to get out of my confort zone and try new things! The concept is simple and I like the software (Construct 3). 

The problem is, I have no knowledge on game design such as programming and AI. The learning curve is a huge burden for my project. As a result, I rarely keep my teacher updated on a Tumblr blog (we had to individually create one to show our progress). I'm not passing this class so far because I'm just trying to figure wtf is going on. The software is fine, it's definitely my inexperience that is shooting me in the foot.

The scariest part is that my project will be part of a public exhibition in mid-May. I only have two weeks to finish this and my anxiety is causing panic attacks as well as insomnia.

49,"So my stepbrother D tried to commit suicide about 5-8 years ago and left a video for us about why he wants to leave this world. My uncles, aunt and my parents did not allow me to see because I was young but I think it was wrong of them to not let me see what he left.
All they told me was how much he hated the family and working other than how much he loves me and my brother J.
So now 2018, he giving my mom 1 more month before he commits suicide again.
I'm wondering why and or what made him act out again. Usually it's when someone is saying something about him and our family etc etc.
Ex. Him and uncle Ts went out to drink and they got drunk, uncle Ts said something as a ""joke"" about my brother J saying something about D and it really pissed him off, later brother D left a voice message (which we couldn't understand) of him screaming at J. D comes home wanting to know where he lives and kept asking me ""do you know where he lives?"" And I asked why and he replied in the lines of ""so I beat him up that's why"" and without crying I said ""why? He did nothing wrong he doesn't even know what he did wrong? Do you know how much your scaring him? He's so busy with school how does he have the time do whatever your thinking of?"" And then he just left. Later brother J forgave him and Brother D and uncle Ts never talked or hang out again. 

He's been kicked out of the house now for about a year or so because I'm terrified. He texted me he'll take me him his car and wants me to show him where my brothers live. He asked for my phone for information but I made sure I deleted them. And one night he came home 2am banging on my door for about 5 minutes before smashing an item and leaving. Also during winter break he came home one night smashing stuff around and because I was downstairs of the room he was in it literally sounded like a tornado, like he was going everywhere smashing stuff, and I kept balling my eyes out and called the cops. When he just broke a picture frame of my dad and mom together and some other pictures.

I'm sure it might be because he feels abandon, he hates that my mom did not support or defend him after some events (drama) took place. My mom just couldn't pick a side between him or her brother. She wanted things to slide by and be family again but my brother D would not have it if he is not right. He feels wronged by the world.
When we offer help sometimes he rejects it. When we offer a therapist he rejects it, saying he doesn't have a problem. My uncle and aunt gave him a room in their house and he got kicked out/ or he left (destroying his younger brother room who lived there at a time after he had left and then punching his uncle who came to visit his parents)
When he takes me and my brother j out to eat or watch a movie I mostly always go unlike my brother j (and I'm not sure if it bad timing or he doesn't want anything to do with him) this was all because we went to visit uncle C for vacation and brother D found out and called saying he'll kill him if he laid a finger on me or my brother and that they need to come back home. Then the next day he took us on a hike asking us questions, (we couldn't say no because he was scary and my brother thought he was going to kill us in the mountains).

Another time he bought a gun and was going to kill uncle Ts for saying ""one day I'm going to kill my whole family"". My uncle T called brother D to calm him down and that Ts was just drunk, he not going to kill his family.

When the adults in the family came over one time to have a meeting on how to deal with D and how to help him and what to do, brother D came home and said ""you don't think I got a gun ?"" ( I'm pretty sure this was towards my dad)

58,"I’m a girl with PTSD. I’ve been sexually assaulted a couple of times and it’s left me with huge emotional scars. One of those is the idea that I’m nowhere near good enough and that anyone treating me nicely is too good to be true. 

I’ve also been engaged before and had that broken off pretty cruelly. The ex would waffle back and forth between “omg let’s get married in six months” and “no we’re not ever getting married but we’re still dating” which left me highly emotionally unstable. 

Another problem that I have is that I self harm. I’m entering Dialectical Behavior Treatment to fix this problem because I don’t want to constantly be self harming. I’m on antidepressants to battle my depression which is pretty bad, honestly. Like I don’t ever get out of bed if I don’t take my meds bad.

He also knows all of the above information and some other private things I won’t disclose here. Basically, everything there is to know about me he knows. And I know the same amount about him. 

He began to bring up marriage, and then a couple of days ago he admitted he’s been planning to propose to me for three weeks. And so we started doing heavy wedding planning (guest list is complete, venue is chosen, etc), and we are going to book everything once he proposes. 

And then today he called me and said he’d had a conversation with his mom and that we weren’t getting engaged after all. So I told him I would respect his decision but that it was hurting me.

My employer transitioned to a new employee system that is a real pain in the ass from what I’ve been told and it could take another month (maybe longer) before the contract gets approved. 

I will also mention that I had a better job lined up that I was ready to accept but didn't because my current boss called to tell me about how someone will be leaving and I would automatically take that persons job. I would have been making the same as the other job I had lined up. I also took this job because it would have helped me with graduate school tuition and give me experience for when I start a master’s program at this university. Well that person did not leave and therefore I won’t get their position. So I’m working for lower pay, driving 45 miles a day in my personal vehicle and I have to start buying food to feed animals that I’m taking care of as part of the job requirement. Because I am not under contract I can’t use the work vehicle or work funds to pay for the materials so everything comes out of my pocket for now. 

I am only employed with them until May and god knows when the contract will be ready. I seriously regret not taking the other job. I’m really frustrated because I have no insurance and I am not getting paid. My boss did pay me 1000$ of his money but that wasn’t very close to the official salary we had discussed. I now have to start looking at insurance plans because I have important doctor appointments this month that I will now have to pay out of pocket. I thought I would be covered under insurance at this time. I will start another job in June but I am seriously considering leaving my current job out of frustration and to take some time off so I could study for GRE exams.

68,"I basically have a few hours left to make a decision. I recently got my master's degree. I have been offered a job, a good position in a fast rising IT company but the pay is absolute shit. The pay wouldn't be a problem if I didn't have to move to the capital city of my country in order to take this job. I am currently in a smaller village by the sea. The housing/renting market is shit and I would have to live with at least two roommates. I would have to scrap by and basically, according to my calculations, I would be left with no savings and would have to stretch the money. Plus the summers in that city are absolute hell and I would most likely not even have an air conditioner. 




On the other hand, I never lived in a capital city and it could be fun. I have a lot of friends there and the job position would bring me more prestige for further advancement. This is also the choice I wanted but now that it became real I started to notice all the downsides. I also somewhat resent living where I do because it's so dead and you can't experience anything new and most of the people have the classic small town mindset, but I do enjoy the nature a great deal.

If I stay at home I would have a choice to live alone in our apartment or at my grandmas place, both for free. I would get paid the same, or even more in the same field but a far narrower position and therefore I could save up. I would also get to help my old grandma and manage our small tourism business as I have for the last few years. I would also be like 200 meters from the sea and could even get a dog. 





The logical thing would be to take a job for about a year where I am right now and after that year search for jobs in the capital but with greater pay so I could live alone there. But I feel if I chose this I would be copping out and choosing a more comfortable option. I am know for taking the easier road and I am trying to be mindful of it but i can't recognize if I am trying to do it this time again or are the reasons not to do it actually reasonable.

I suffer from anxiety and go through periods in which I isolate myself from friends and family; this is something she does too, and in a very similar fashion. She told me that this led her to break up with her boyfriend of one year a couple months ago (before we met). We've become really close, but I didn't want to make a move because she was still healing from her last relationship.

Last week we were hanging out and she told me she had gone back to talking to her ex-bf. I didn't think much of it but was wary, so I thought I had to make a move soon. Thing is, soon wasn't soon enough. A friend of mine told me he saw them kissing earlier today, so it's very likely they're back together.

I have never been in a relationship in which the other person truly understood my emotional problems (and neither has she for that matter), so I really wanted to be in a relationship with her.

73,"A quick back story on me, I'm 28 never had a girlfriend. My only friends are a group of co-workers and even then I'm the bottom rung of the group. I also still live at home with my parents.






The above isn't the most attractive characteristics or something to brag about but I'm ok with it.







So Saturday night as I'm working (3rd shift Walmart in a small town) I pass this girl with her arms full and offer her my buggy. ""Aw thanks you're so sweet"" she says. Awhile later I hear her  a couple rows down calling me to help her find something.




As I get beside her she starts flirting with me,  
rubbing shoulder to shoulder, I had a break about to start and thought we we're about going to go make out in the parking lot. She asks for my number, I tell her ""I work 3rd shift so If I don't respond during the day I'm sleeping etc, was going to give her my number but I get called to go to the other side of the building for something (I'm a manager) and tell her I'll be right back.





I go see what I was needed for and tell the worker ""I'm flirting with some girl I need to get back to her"". The worker asks who then tells me ""she's bad stay away""....I didn't have time for the details then.





As I get back to the girl I tell her straight up ""Before I give you my number and get yours I just want you to know that I don't know if you do stuff but I don't do things I shouldn't and I don't associate with people who do.""  She the tells me Forget it then that saying I really hurt her feelings and walks off.




I immediately think that if she has nothing to hide she wouldn't have left. I see the worker that warned me about her later and ask for more details and she gives me a lead, later I do some internet research and HOLY S***




This girl had  arrested for public intoxicate 5 years ago, wanted in another state for weed two year ago and being a fugitive from justice off the weed charge a year ago. Now that's just what I was able to find who knows what else she wasn't caught doing.




She was caught on the FfJ charge because the cops came to her house because her boyfriend was beating on her, holding a gun to her head, shooting at his sister...like what the f***.







The exboyfriend  has a record a mile long over drugs, booze, pills, theft, pulling guns on people. I wasn't able to figure out when the two dated but my parents always told me ""You can't be around someone like that unless you are like that""





Now I know it's be hard to drop the above on someone you just met, and I can only imagine my family typing her name in the old Google machine finding all that out. My parents wouldn't trust her, my sister wouldn't want her in her house to see my baby nephew. I wouldn't even trust her at first. 




I've been beating myself up the past two days thinking maybe I should have given her a chance that just because that its her past doesn't mean it's her present and future....





I also know I'm probably letting my lonelyness cloud my judgement and I don't and haven't had many chances with women. She did seem interested in me and she was nice, not the hottest but not ugly.


The worker says she is starting to come in a lot so there's a decent chance I'll see her again.

If I see her should I tell her about what I found out but say we can try this or just be like hey I've felt bad about not giving you my number the other day

78,"I’m sort of in a stressful and frustrated situation currently and could use some guidance and/or advice. Well to start off, my mother passed away around 4 years ago and from all her hard work and basically the main bread winner of the family, she left me, my two brothers, and my dad some inheritance. We basically received $141,000 EACH. Though, I believe my dad was made the Head of her estate so I think he had more power over the entirety, (but I believe I may still have a document that states we were supposed to get an even percentage each). 
Now back then I was around 22 years old and to me, my $141,000 was A LOT of money and well the only thing I wanted to use it for was to go to college. However my dad told me to wait because there was still the mortgage of the house we live in that was left under him now, so his idea was that we all each chip in an equal amount to help pay off the mortgage of the house and in turn all of our names would be on the deed. We all agreed, but told us it would take some time so in the mean time back then, we all went to the bank where he helped me and my brother open a Money Market account and I remembered we both signed something agreeing that he would be the primary account of the funds and that me and my brother would just be secondary owners and just have access to it if we ever needed to. At the time I trusted him and few months go by and see the Money Market account building interest whenever I checked it, but then one day I noticed my account was at ZERO and so was my brother’s. I then found out he had withdrawn everything, opened a new account and only put his name on it, and then paid off the house only putting his name on the deed. My dad basically went behind our backs and took everything all for himself and went basically corrupt. He moved in this young girl (who was old enough to be my older sister!)  he was seeing/cheating on my mother with into our house 2 months after she passed away, started spoiling her, and used more of the money to try and open his own business which later failed 3 months later. 
Back then I was completely angered and infuriated with what he done and all the things he said about us and our mom and how he got what he wanted. Though I managed to convince him to put me as a secondary owner of his account sort of as a means to quell me from having arguments and fights with him, and later on I withdrew whatever was left and put it away in savings once I found out that he was falling into debt from all his loans, credit card debts that he’s neglected, and got hit by the IRS when he found out our mom hasn’t paid taxes since 2008 and him being the head of estate now, took on my mom’s loans and the second mortgage they took out to have the basement redone. 
Right now, I am 26 years old and ever since then I’ve been working fulltime consistently in order to pay off my own bills and the home utilities that I’ve taken on because my dad refuses to take responsibility for the home and pay them himself since he doesn’t have a good enough job and only works part time because he wants to enjoy some so called “freedom”. The money left over that I’m sitting on, I have $20,000 in savings to serve as emergency only funds, and have $80,000 invested in stocks through Citizens Bank where a financial advisor is helping me manage it. Recently I found out that my dad is planning to sell the house in order to help himself get out of debt and use whatever remains he had to find a cheap place to live and basically told me and my brother that we are on our own. Around 15 years ago, the house was worth around $330,000 when they bought it. Ever since then, it has been poorly maintained, everything is old and out of date, and it’s basically a sinking ship. My estimate is, if he’s lucky is somewhere between $100,000-$140,000 if he’s lucky.. We live next to Boston in Massachusetts and properties around this area are pretty expensive even for something small for just me and my brother. I still want to go to school to take up a skill like Carpentry and have a career involving it where my goal is I want to purchase out run down cheap homes/apartments, flip them, and rent them out. But I feel like balancing that, a job, and bills may be too much for me to handle..
So what I’m wondering is, what should I do? Should I try and make time to meet with and talk with a lawyer and try and sue my dad for what he’s done? I’ve brought up this situation with friends and they all say I should but most say it might not go well because there’s too much gray area.. Do I just bite the bullet, cut my losses, and move to Texas with my friends where the 5 of us can rent a home and I can be able to start fresh and find a Union Job to learn Carpentry? Do I try and find a cheap place in the far outskirts of Massachusetts/Rhode Island for me and my brother? 
Or what advice/guidance can anyone offer? I’ve been carrying this on my shoulders for the passed 5 years almost and I’m just really tired.. I want to get away from all this, do something with myself, and properly mentor my lil brother through life best I can and help him with his autism. Would suing be the best option?

As the title states, I have two big goals that I want to achieve within the year.

The first is to write a feature length movie screenplay. The second is to make a career change to become a Front End Developer (I hate my current job). 

Right now, I spend time on weekends writing, and during the week, after my 9-5, I take online coding classes.

These are two big goals that mean alot to me. My dream is to do work I enjoy  (and make good money) by day, and then spend my free time pursing my dream of becoming a filmmaker. 

Is it foolish to pursue both these goals at the same time? I am pretty satisfied with the progress I am making so far, but concerned that I might end up taking a very long time.

It's also hard to tell if I'm doing less than great work if I was otherwise solely focused on one of these goals. But then again, slow and steady progress is what wins the day regardless, right?

I try exercising in my room and putting videos, but I think it's too intense and don't like doing stuff like crunches, jumping jacks etc. I also feel like it is very time consuming.I have P.E. at school, but they mainly focus on sports which I hate (no affense).  Something I prefer is running. There is a large park near my apartment complex, more like an empty grassy area with  gate around it where you can have picnics and play fetch with your dog, you know. I am thinking about running for 30 minutes to an hour around it every morning at 5, before I have to go to school (bus comes to pick me up at 7). I like this Idea because it outside where I like it.

107,"There’s a good chance my girlfriend of 7 months  [17F] might end up moving to New York to stay with family after finally getting out of custody from her abusive father (she’s staying in a group home atm) and she’s saying that her aunt will more than likely buy me a ticket and let me come live with her. Now all of this is purely hypothetical as her aunt might not want me in the equation at all but she’s already tossed out the idea and they don’t seem opposed. 

I live with a friend of the family because I was kicked out 16 from my moms. My dad isn’t apart of the equation. I don’t really have friends or family here [In Arizona] worth staying for other than my sisters. But she’s getting married soon and about to have kids and has a lot ahead of her. I don’t. I’m technically not in school at the moment although I’m only a few credits away from graduating, and I’m not employed but I’ve put out many applications recently and I believe I’m close. 

Is this worth it? I’ve already invested so much of my time and effort into her. I do love her. If it wasn’t for me her dad wouldn’t be losing custody and she’d be back getting beaten.

111,"It finally hit me today as I pulled into the parking lot...the exact term to explain what has been happening for the past 2 years at work—gaslighting. Well, in a sense. 

A coworker (another manager, who is unfortunately next in line for GM) has manipulated the environment so well, that every time a problem arises, it boils down to, “She is just an emotional chick”...(super male-dominated environment by the way). It’s so bad now that I literally have no voice to direct my own program, all requests are ignored &amp; people will actually spend time to undo my efforts. I’m getting railroaded. 

As a result of how cleverly this guy can twist a situation to his benefit, I’ve spent many sleepless nights questioning everything about my work ethic &amp; professional relationships. I love my job though. I do it well &amp; I throw everything I have into it. Only yesterday, when things came to a head, did I truly see that others have fallen under his deceptions as well...my boss actually defended him choosing not to communicate vital information.

115,"So the thing is, one of my friends I find it hard to contact her because she rarely replies to my messages which is not just for me but all of her friends. She says she doesn’t know why she takes so long to reply but just does so this makes it difficult to arrange anything to meet with her. As a result we’ve only really met at clubs where she’s drunk and this is where I worry about her the most. When I try talking to her she forgets most of what I say and replies saying “I don’t know” or something really vague. I’m always having to repeat myself even in quieter areas where she can hear me perfectly fine but I still get the same replies. Sometimes she talks to me first but it always seems to be really personal when she does so for example, on Friday when we were in a pub she went up to me and told me personally she was bulimic. I wasn’t sure how to reply so I asked her if she’s seen a doctor and if any of her friends know but she  said she didn’t know. About ten minutes after that she asked me if I remembered what she told me (the bulimic thing) and I said yeah to which she didn’t reply again. She kept asking me throughout the whole night and every time I said yeah she didn’t reply so sometimes I said no so see if she would say anything different but she just repeated the question again. I know it might seem this probably just drunken behaviour but I’ve also had similar conversations when she’s sober. I’m not sure what’s wrong with her but she’s so unresponsive to what anyone says to her so I’m not sure what to do? She also seems to trust and want to talk to me more than anyone else and I think it’s because other people tend to give up when talking to her where I really try to make a conversation and keep in touch with her.",03Apr2018,3
116,"I'm a university student, and over the long weekend, I went on a trip with 3 of my friends (they're all girls, and I'll call them J, A, and Je)

J was going home over the long weekend and so decided to invite me, A, and Je. Over the weekend, her parents drove us everywhere, drove us on a 12-hour road trip, made all 3 meals for us, and paid for all of our meals when we ate out. Mind you, they're not rich - just middle class. I'm angry about the following reasons:

1) after everything J's parents have done for us, A didn't even say a GOODBYE OR THANK YOU to them on the day we left
2) I told A and Je that we should buy a present for J's parents to thank them, and THEY CHANGED THE SUBJECT. I know they're tight on money, but c'mon, if you have 37 DOLLARS TO SPEND AT THE GIFT SHOP BUYING RINGS AND A PLUSHIE, can't you spend that money to buy her parent's a thank-you gift instead??
3) we went to dinner one night, and J actually asked her dad if he could pay for the whole bill (this was before we even ordered food). Of course, with all of us staring at her dad, he would obviously say ""yes"". But as a daughter, is it really right to have your dad pay for all of your friend's meals? And what really irritated me was that Je actually went to order a drink afterward as well - umm, water is free yenno?
4) Je is an exchange student who hates her home country. She told her parents that she wants to come back here right after she graduates; in a text, her mom said:""I'll try my best to save money so you can go back and visit your friends"". First of all, ""save money"" indicates that her family isn't rich, and that her mom will have to WORK FOR THAT MONEY. Je's about to graduate, can she not make that money herself?? Why must you rely on your mom? She also said that once she returns home, she knows that her mom will miss her so much that she'll be able to ask her mom to go shopping with her and buy her clothes and I quote: ""milk it out of her"". 

Why am I so angry when it's not even my problem? Their parents obviously seem to not mind much about giving them money and providing for them, so what right do I have to be angry? I'm actually so angry to the point where I'm thinking about ending my friendship with them....is this normal? I'm starting to look down on them...and judge them...and I hate myself for that because I've always been a judgemental person, and that was one thing I swore I was going to change. I just find them super ungrateful to the people who LOVE THEM THE MOST, and yet they talk poorly about them behind their back, spend their allowance buying FREAKING PLUSHIES, and that just IRRITATES THE CR*P outta me. So what do you guys think, is it just me who's just being judgemental again? Perhaps parents enjoy this kind of thing, and that I really have no right to judge them for their family matters? Should I end my friendship with them?

118,"Wow, what an interesting situation I have gotten into. I am a teen still in high school. My father is VERY against the smoking of pot. Well after a bad breakup and a lot of hits to my mind, eventually I foolishly gave in to pot. I messed with it for a month, and ultimately got caught. Or I got caught by a very very good friends mother (almost my mother) and she forced me to fess up to my dad. Well I did, got a few hits upside the head, turned in my pipe, and told him my situation of my very bad mental state, and that I’m working on it now. I’ve begun getting into new activities and spending my time reading and doing good things like reading and going for walks. After two weeks the whole incident had almost disappeared because my dad was very pleased with the change he saw. Well just earlier today, he found ANOTHER pipe in our back yard. First I will say, the pipe is not mine. And I have no friends that I smoke with, or that ever come to my house, so it wasn’t anyone I know. And my siblings are 11 &amp; 13 so no to them. So my dad obviously thought it was mine, stormed to my room and yelled at me, threw my whole room to the floor searching for more, and it’s a mess. He thinks I’m some wizard who is able to smoke pot and pass drug tests, and he thinks I smoke out back while everyone was home, and then went and had a full on conversation with him. I asked him, how would you not be able to tell if I was high? Because I have no tolerance. Well he doesn’t trust anything I have to say and thinks I still smoke pot even thought I’m still not allowed out of the house, so the whole situation is a mess. But luckily I think it could have been the neighbor. He found the pipe in one of those cement brick holes connecting between us and the neighbor, so it could have easily been the neighbor smoking late one night, and he put it in the hole of the wall separating our two houses, right? The neighbor is an old lady who always seems to have a bunch of younger dudes over having get together, around 25ish years old. I don’t even know what I’m asking here, I just want closure. I’m afraid if I go to knock on their door I’ll appear rude asking them if they’ve been smoking pot or whatever, plus the dudes are only in and out of the house, only the old lady lives there. So do I ask the old lady, or wait for one of the dudes to come by one day? I just need help honestly. This is really putting a dent on me and my fathers trust.",03Apr2018,2
122,"I’ve always been a socially awkward kid, I’ve never had friends and I’ve never fitted in. I’m in my early 20’s, live at home, got a degree in media and the arts, and working casually in a related field. Problem is though, I’m bored, scared, and way too passive.

Day after day I’m finding that I don’t have anything to do. I’m just bored. And the most common advice I hear or read online, ‘use the time to exercise, learn a new skill, do what you love, etc’ and that’s great - for about a minute. Then my motivation levels go plummeting back down to nothing when I realise how difficult those things are.

All my life I’ve only ever done things simply because it’s the next thing to do. From school, to uni, to work, but I know, I just know that the ‘normal’ lifestyle isn’t for me. I want to be making films with creative people. Going on adventures. Every night I dream in film, but I’m just so scared, I’m terrified of ever doing anything about it. I’m scared of what other people will think of me, if I’m good, if I’m terrible. Yet I know I’m getting judged for not doing anything. I just don’t know what to do. And I just don’t know how to do anything about it. 

I want to get in shape, I want to exercise and eat right, and yeah, there are days where I do, but for the most part, I just can’t do it! I would absolutely love to learn new skills and practice what I love doing. I’d love to make new friends that have the same interests as I do. But I just can’t find the ongoing motivation to do it, to do anything really, because I just can’t find the purpose. 

I know I don’t fit in. I never have, I never will.  I’m terrified that I’m just wasting my life, wasting my time, all because I’m far too passive.

So, I guess what I’m really asking is, how do I go from a passive person that always waits for something to happen, to an active person that makes things happen?",03Apr2018,3

So, as the title suggests, there is this guy who I've known since school. He moved to a western country from somewhere in the middle east, and we kept in touch. That's because he did tbh I didn't mind because i tried to brush it off as harmless.
He used to make me feel uncomfortable in school and tell me I had a nice butt and etc. It was stupid to not take action but I was stupid back then and I've changed a lot since.

He was recently trying to chat me up by asking how I'm doing and it was nice to have someone just speak to you on a mature level and see how you're doing. But to my surprise, he then asked for a nude. And I was shocked. I told him I won't do that and that I don't like him back. And he quickly defended himself and said he'd want a picture of my butt. He sent me multiple pictures of women taking pictures of their butt and angles. I just said I have to go and I blocked him.

He then sent me a message on Twitter and asked me where I've been. I told him I've been struggling with family issues. He asked again if he could help and to come off as genuine. He then said that his messages aren't going through and that I should add him on my WhatsApp again.

124,"So, obviously this is my side of the story, but I need ideas to prove to my landlord i'm innocent.  
It started the day after we moved in as a family of 5 to our apartment on the second level.  The lower level immidiately complained of noise, (quiet time is 10 PM here and we stopped at about 7:30 PM)  they said to try to keep the noise down but they understand we are moving.

The second complaint came as a note from downstairs after the night before banging on their ceiling, which we promptly reported to the landlord as it was 6 PM and my three kids were playing in their rooms (no jumping or running).

There were about 4 more ceiling bangings that continued for the next month(5-8PM).  Again, kids weren't doing any wrestling, or horseplay, in fact we have gotten them to become aware of their noise more and we also went out and purchased rugs to try to dampen the footsteps.

Well i got a verbal warning from the landlord this morning, saying that 'a neighbor' is complaining of to much noise after 10 pm, shouting and fighting specifically.  So now they are lying, and i am looking for advice to prove innocence or cover my ass from eviction.  I am buying a audio/video detection surveillance camera so i can provide evidence to the date of complaint.  I also started logging when they bang on the ceiling and what we are doing.

126,"OK, so here's the full chronology:

1. My girlfriend (at the time) and I, who are from Canada, took a two-day trip to the US. During the trip, she broke up with me for valid reasons. I took it well, and said that I respected where she was coming from. We finished the trip as friends and left amicably. She said that she genuinely wanted to stay friends because ""I was one of the most important people in her life."" To be clear, if she decided to change her mind later, that's 100% fine. I totally get that some people don't want to stay friends with their exes, so that's not what bothers me. It's the complete lack of an explanation (explained below) that is bothering me

2. Once we got back to Canada, I messaged her on Facebook saying that I'm glad we were still friends, and reminded her that she owed me $247 CAD (which is like 190 USD). The money was for two things:
(a) $97 for all the stuff I paid for her in Buffalo; (b) $150 for a gift. Now, I know (b) sounds weird, but let me explain. So, for my birthday, when we were dating, we decided that I would get a travel backpack that I've really wanted for a while, and that she would contribute $150 to the total. However, she asked if I could purchase it on my credit card, and then she would pay me the $150 as a gift in a couple of weeks once she got her paycheck. Some notes: the bag can't be returned, I never would have bought it for myself if she didn't say that she would give me $150 as the birthday gift, and she made it clear that she would pay me as soon as she could.
3. Once I sent the message, she e-transferred me $125 ($122 short of what she owes me) and then immediately blocked me on Facebook. Honestly, the money's not a big deal. Well, it is, but it's not what I'm most upset about. Just a couple of days after saying that she genuinely wanted to stay friends (she even said that we should still continue our weekly movie night tradition, etc...), she just blocked me on Facebook with no explanation.

5. I tried contacting her to ask how/where I should drop off the stuff of hers I had (just a scarf, water bottle, book, etc...). After two days with no response, I ended up dropping them off at her porch along with a letter saying that I understood if she wanted space.

5. It's been like 20 days since then. I emailed her a couple days ago asking if we could talk. Here's my exact message:

Hey [name],

So first, I know I'm breaking my promise that I made in my letter because I said I wouldn't message you until you were ready.

I just want to know *why* everything changed so suddenly. Not why you broke up with me - I completely understand and respect your decision. But when you broke up with me in Buffalo, you said that you wanted to remain friends, and it seemed like you genuinely meant it. But just a couple days after, you got mad, blocked me on Facebook, and didn't even give me a reason for why your opinion of our friendship changed so fast. If you don't want to be friends anymore, I get that, but I do think it's unfair that you went from saying that you wanted to remain friends to cutting me out completely without offering me some sort of explanation.

Anyways, I hope you reply, but I'm not sure if you will. In any case, hope your mom is doing better, and good luck with exams!

6. &lt;-- that's supposed to say 6. I got no response from that either. I swear I'm not trying to overstep my bounds. I know that we're exes, and if she wants nothing to do with me, I understand that 110%. I *swear* that's not the issue. I only want two things: (1) an explanation for *why* everything changed in the span of like a minute (again, I think it's fine if she doesn't want to remain friends, but couldn't she at least have *told* me that instead of saying all this stuff about how she wants me to stay in her life and then blocking me on Facebook two days after?); (2) she still owes me money lol

I know this was super long. If you stuck with it, thanks!! Happy Easter, everyone!

**TL;DR** Girlfriend said she wanted to remain friends. I asked her for money that she owed me, she paid me about half of it, and then blocked me on Facebook. Won't reply to email now, and I just want closure",03Apr2018,3

134,"This is a throwaway. 

I have a very unusual situation at hand, and I don’t know what to do with it. I’m a wedding photographer, and I’ve used the same person as my second photographer on many weddings in the past. Our situation is complicated because we’ve dated previously, but remained friends after. They also live out of state. 

I hired them to shoot a wedding with me coming up. I’ve paid them, and bought their plane ticket up. We had planned on driving back to her home state after the wedding and I was going to take a vacation there. I also have been watching their cat, so the trip was twofold. 

We’ve had some issues come up between us where we mutually decided it was for the best they not fly up to co-shoot with me. I agreed to just eat the cost of the plane ticket, as it was non refundable and non transferable. We talked and I also agreed to drive 8 hours and they would drive 8 hours to meet halfway so I can drop off their cat. 

I’ve made no mention of expecting them to return the payment to me since we decided it was best they not shoot with me, but rather, I’ve waited for them to offer to repay me. There is mild tension there, and I haven’t wanted to breech the subject. 

After I drop off her cat, that’s it. We’ve decided no more communication. My question is, is it even worth it bringing up paying me back what I’ve paid them? I hinted at it briefly during a phone conversation earlier, reminding them I had paid them, and their response was “Yeah, that money is gone. I paid bills with it.” and then they went on about having to spend two grand on dental work. 

It bothers me immensely they’ve not once offered to pay me back. Especially after eating the cost of the flight, and countless other things I’ve done for them over the years.

4. Time for myself.

My question is : If instead of finding a solution to this and sleeping more, I adapted to it, slept 3-5 hours a night, what wrong would it do to my body? Is it a great or bad plan? I'm pretty sure I'm done growing up - I've grown 2inches in the last 3 years and I'n 5""6 right now.

Right now, trying to fix the problem, I go to bed early and even though I feel tired, I can't fall a sleep (mostly because of anxiety).So I spend 3hours doing absolutely nothing before falling asleep instead of doing productive stuff like studying.

To me, I feel like doing that could make me put more work into school - am I correct?",03Apr2018,3
138,"Let me start of by saying that I'm 17 and a junior in highschool. Recently I've realized that I never notice that I'm being rude or disruptive unless someone tells me. At the same time, I feel horrendously guilty about innocuous things I do, or even nice things. I can no longer trust my own perception of my actions.

I have a friend who calls me out on my shit, and while I really appreciate it, I realized it's been making me hate myself more and more. I recently sent him the following message.

&gt;You call me out on my shit a lot, and I appreciate that. I'm completely unaware of the shit I pull most of the time. I don't think there's anything wrong with what you're saying or what you're doing, but thered definitely a problem with the way I've been reacting to it. Even though I know what you're doing and why you're doing it, part of me feels like you hate me, and recently just seeing you has started filling me with dread. I've started hating myself more and more, and mentally using your words to beat myself down. I've been feeling increasingly isolated, even though I know that I'm just isolating myself. I know that I'm just full of shit and this is all in my head, but it doesn't change anything. You're a great person, and I really want to be your friend, but my reactions to everything are really unhealthy. I don't know what to do.

144,"While I won’t be taking online school for college for much longer (I’ll be returning to my semester at physical college by the end of the month), I’m still having trouble with its lack of structure. It’s opened my eyes to how I cope without a set schedule (“be here by this time in this place with this assignment”).

I’ve always had a tendency to procrastinate, but it’s gotten even worse. I turn in good work and get good grades, but I always cause myself so much unnecessary stress. When I try to do something ahead of time, it’s like my brain shuts down. No matter how hard I try, I just can’t get the information in. It’s like I lose the ability to read. 

I’ve tried the Pomodoro Method of studying and working, but, somehow, those little breaks turn into 2 hours of “just checking” things, whether it’s checking the pantry for a snack or surfing the internet for 3 hours.

My sleep schedule suffers because of my procrastination (it’s nearly 4 am right now), so when I wake up, half the day is over. Then I hate myself because I get up later and have to work later. It’s just an ugly, vicious cycle that I can’t seem to break. 

I have no way of leaving the house either, for a change of scene. I’d kill to go study at the library, but I don’t have any mode of transportation. (For medical reasons, I cannot drive, and I live in the suburbs).

I’m anxious because I don’t get enough done. The anxiety makes me procrastinate. The procrastination makes me anxious. 

I know it all comes down to me to fix things. I have no one to blame but myself for my disgusting behavior. But if anyone has any advice on how to improve the situation, like former procrastinators,  I’d really appreciate it. ",03Apr2018,2

They both live in the same house as me (I'm 20). Myself and my aunt are caring for my bedridden grandmother.

They are both terrible people.
Drugs (lowering frequency since the baby), domestic violence (both ways, usually aunt&gt; fiancee), no respect for anybody, including each other, disgusting living style (dishes, rubbish, scraps). I feel  incredibly bad for the baby, too.

He is the bigger problem of the two. He's been arrested once before, for over a year. This didn't change him. He's very openly threatened everybody in the household, and hangs out with the wrong types of people. I've been threatened by people he's gotten on the wrong side of before. He's almost gotten my sister (she was 16) killed by a third party (attempted hit and run).

The local police have been contacted very often about the both of them, but they aren't doing anything at all about it.

She's shown desire o breakup, but this is difficult for a few reasons:
1. He had a fatherless upbringing, and she doesn't want the guilt of leaving the baby fatherless
2. He's openly threatened that he'd hurt everybody if she left him

I am 22, and I have an elderly neighbour whom recently lost his brother, and now lives a secluded lifestyle. Whenever we see each other, we always chat and he is very sociable, empathetic, and intelligent. I asked him once if he was interested in joining my roommates and I for dinner, he responded that we wouldn't enjoy his company, and I felt that he was a little embarrassed, so I didn't push the invitation. 

I am thinking of things I can buy him which will keep him entertained, and keep his mind active. He does not leave his house, and struggles to get down the three flights of stairs. Each week we bring his groceries up to his apartment (which he has delivered), and he buys us a box of chocolates 'for our troubles' (sweetheart). 

It breaks my heart to see him alone. Does anyone have any advice as to how I can bring some more joy into his life, without intruding too much? I was thinking of buying him a introductory German book, as he explained that was the language which interested him the most when he was younger. (I am also learning German). 
I also thought of buying him a diary. I'll ask him tomorrow if he enjoys writing.

Tonight, my fiancée (F25) and myself (F24) were talking about an issue I recently had at work where I was being harassed, and she told me that I was not being assertive enough about it, instead just dropping the issue because I didn’t feel it was going to get any better by making a fuss of it. This then led to a conversation about how I am not assertive at all and how she gets upset when I am walked over. And it’s true. I am not assertive enough (I’m not assertive at all). So my question is this: what can I do to become more assertive? Examples of how not assertive I am include:

I was served the wrong dish in a restaurant, ate it without saying anything and paid for the more expensive dish I originally ordered.
Went to a screen cover replacement kiosk in the mall where the employee was visibly high, he took off my original screen cover, then said he didn’t have the one I needed, so I just put it back on and ordered it online.
Was being harassed by a coworker for nearly four months, was continually given the runaround by management for a face to face meeting with that coworker, and when finally able to confront her, never said my piece because my coworker cried and it was at the end of my shift and just didn’t feel it was worth it to sit and argue about it anymore. 

I feel that when I am assertive I become like my father, who is a manipulative White Man (ie the customer is always right). Is assertiveness a confidence thing? Please help r/advice, you’re my only hope.

174,"I [24/F] have been an avid coffee drinker since I was about 16.  I’m talking ~3-4 shots of espresso almost daily for YEARS. 
Looking back, I think it mostly started as a result of desperately finding a way to keep myself awake during 8 hours of school, 4 hours of work, and 2 more hours of chores/studying on an almost daily basis.
(I realize it was pretty terrible to have started drinking so much caffeine at a relatively young age, but hindsight is 20/20.)

Now, out of college and with a steady job, I find myself “needing” the pick-me-up less and less, although I genuinely enjoy the taste of coffee. 
However, if I don’t drink any caffeine throughout the day, I end up with a SPLITTING headache in the evening.
I’ve tried quitting cold-turkey numerous times with no results, as the constant throbbing in my head makes it impossible for me to focus. 
I’ve been trying to SLOWLY wean myself off for the last year or so, as I’ve reduced my intake from 4 shots to 2 a day. 

Looking at the bigger picture though, I WANT to quit, as I don’t really believe it’s doing great things for my heart, stomach, and wallet, among many others. 

In any case, for those who may have experienced the same or similar things, do you have any advice for me? Should I keep on doing what I’m doing, and should I expect some form of suffering before I completely stop? What did you do to stop partaking in caffeine?

I'm a 14-year-old female who has had sex with multiple people. My parents have found out about a few of the times that it's happened and have completely lost all trust in me. 

I've come to my own conclusion that through a childhood of neglect and sadness, with a constant feeling that I was never loved, I made the decision as I grew,  from hearing about what sex was, that it was the ultimate form of love. That if a man and a woman were to love each other so much, only then could they do this. 

As I aged and got into my first year of high school (year 7 in Australia) I was raped by a 'boyfriend' of mine. After that I completely felt violated and disgusting, though I also felt that now the deed of love had been stolen from me, it doesn't matter if I do it now. So after that, I had sex with numerous people.

The parents found out through reading my texts, listening to my conversations with friends, hearing me sneak back in at night, and their reaction is always the same. They call me a disgusting whore, slut, a shame to the family etc. At one point they even got a boy I was with arrested.

Though this 'slutty' part of my life is considered to be in the past by me, my parents don't see it that way. They don't trust me in the slightest, and they've fallen out of love. I've disappointed them.

I remember being in the hospital for a suicide attempt, and not even then could they say I love you. I didn't get a hug or a kiss, and they left after a few hours to go to work.

Due to a toxic home environment, I've been looking to move out for a few years now.  Unfortunately, I live in an expensive area, and so for the longest time I wouldn't have been able to afford it unless I got a room mate, despite making more money than the vast majority of people my age.  None of my friends were in a position to move out with me, and my attempts to find a room mate via Facebook and Craigslist failed. 

Well yesterday I just found out I got a raise at work. It's just enough to bring living by myself within reach. The apartments I'm looking at are 35% - 40% of my take home pay.  I know it should be closer to 30, but at this point, for the sake of my mental health I think I need to get out.  Plus I've been told I'm getting a promotion at work, and while that will be a few months away, it'll entail another pay bump. In addition, one of my friends might pay me a few hundred to crash on the couch if I get an apartment. This would depend on the terms of the lease though, of course.  

So anyway, I've never done this before.  I've found 10-15 places on apartments.com within my price range and area, so what's next? Do I call and set up an appointment.  What questions should I ask? What should I look for? Are there ""unspoken rules"", similar to how they say you never pay sticker price for a car? How do I avoid getting taken advantage of?

180,"Hello, some of my coworkers have mentioned that my emails come off as having a harsh, mean, and or demanding tone. How can I write better emails? When I read my emails, I don’t read them as how they say, but some individuals take it the wrong way. Whenever I communicate with someone in person, they say that I come off as a very nice person and funny. This is probably because of the tone in which I communicate, facial cues and smiling. How can I transfer that to email? My job requires me to work with many different functions and asking them to do things.

What I typically do in emails is say ‘good morning’ or ‘good afternoon’ with the name of individual. I always say ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ whenever I ask for something. I think I might come off as mean/ harsh, because a lot of the time I’m frustrated with the individual because they keep messing up after spending a lot time explaining how the process works. I have made training documents, checklists, asked them if they understand, and walked them through the process. Im honestly not sure what else I can do. The individuals that have complained are the ones I consider ‘slackers’ that I have to work with daily.

One manager mentioned to call or go in person to explain to the individuals what I need from them. To me that is such a waste of time when there is sooooo much to do! I don’t have time to walk or call every single individual and ask them to do something. I lose visibility and the person tends to forget to do things and I don’t have a paper trail to say, “yes I already told this person to do XYZ and haven’t had a response” when my manager asks if I’ve gotten XYZ done.

I’m a very blunt individual (as you can see above), believe in being very transparent, work hard, and expect people to do the same and follow the proper process. To make my emails “nicer” I’ve been putting smilie faces because maybe that helps make it seem like I’m being nice? I’m seriously not sure what to do. Maybe the selection of my words are not great and it could be due to being bilingual and not learning one language well.

I am a person who wants to do soooo many things in life. My goal is to experience as many things as possible and try to do and see everything I can. I have, for example, tried martial arts, got a scuba diving license, driver's license, found a passion in music, tried digital art, etc etc. It's what keeps me going.

Obviously I had to pick a career path, so I did and I am about to start uni, Software Engineering. I have always been confident about the choice and pretty sure my life would be that of an Engineer, be it Software or Robotics or whatever.

Hoooowever...

Ever since I was about 15 I've also really wanted to join the Airforce Academy and become a pilot, preferable helicopters, or at least an Engineer in the field (Aerospace Engineer). My grandfather was a lieutenant and my dad is an ex-sergeant. Military life, aviation and space have always fascinated me (I am such a sci fi buff), but I had to pick one of the two so I went with what I was more confident about. I picked uni.

Thing is, I keep feeling like I may perhaps be wrong about it. I really want to work in the military but I can't do both. Is it normal to feel like I'm giving up a potentially more fulfilling career? I don't want to abandon what I've been working towards for what could potentially turn out to be a mistake and, although risks are essential sometimes, it's just so difficult to even get accepted due to very, very limited spots available here in Italy's airforce.

193,"My SO has a lot of family over in Ireland so we're catching a ferry with his dad/sister tomorrow to spend a week with them. We got to talking about religion (I know Catholicism's still prevalent in Ireland) and SO revealed that a few of his cousins are creationists.

I generally have no issue with belief and I can get along with people just fine whether or not they share the same views as me (I'm not religious myself). Creationism however, is something I find absolutely ridiculous.

This is the first time I'll be meeting my SO's cousins so I want to make a good impression- I'm worried I'm going to offend them and irreversibly sour the trip if this topic comes up. I'm just looking for advice on how I can amicably react in a discussion about their faith without betraying my own opinions on the issue. SO isn't religious but his family are very important to him and this could screw things up.

195,"First, let me say that there seems to be an epidemic of mental illness among her peers. (sarcasm) It began when her best friend started cutting herself in 8th grade, then my daughter and every single other kid in her friend circle followed suit. It was ""cool"". I put a stop to it at the time but the popularity of being depressed has continued on. She's a Junior now, 17 years old. Several of her friends are on medication and have even been hospitalized and/or taken out of school. Cutting, talking about suicide, just generally being emo. I am sorry but they cannot ALL be mentally ill. 

When a kid talks about suicide you have to take it seriously, right? At first of course I was very concerned, but we have explored all the avenues. We have been to psychologists, our family physician, psychiatrists. She's even tried several types of antidepressants and mood stabilizers etc. Finally I decided (with the psychiatrists blessing) to take her off of all medication. I just do not think she needs it. I don't think there is anything wrong with her.

She tells EVERYONE she suffers from depression and panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. All her friends, all our family, all her teachers. Like she is proud of it. Every single thing she says these days is a plea for sympathy. Every single day is the worst day ever. Every single day is a long list of complaints. I don't feel good, I hate this or that, I'm going to quit band bc someone doesn't like me, I had a terrible day, I am sad. The last time she said she felt suicidal, I was 150 miles away. I said I'm going to call an ambulance. She said no no no I'm not going to do anything. Well, then why did you say that? You cannot exchange the word sad for suicidal. This isn't a game and it's got to stop. Five minutes later she started chatting about other stuff as if nothing had happened. Then the next day the school called me because she told her English teacher that her assignment wasn't turned in because she has been feeling so depressed, then she told the guidance counselor she has been feeling suicidal. The counselor and I discussed the popularity of depression among her peers and she agreed that my daughter seems to be okay.

Where does this end? What if she is, as I suspect, just looking for attention and feeling sorry for herself? What if she isn't? How long do you really entertain that behavior? We, as parents, are just coddling and enabling them. How will they ever learn to cope and become adults? I'm terrified that this is the kind of person she is going to be.

I've begun to just change the subject or tell her (in a nice way) to suck it up. At this point I am constantly irritated with her. I try not to show it of course. But every time she opens her mouth or my phone goes off and it is a message from her, I am irritated before I even know what it is. It is something negative every single time without fail. It is exhausting. I don't even want to be around my own daughter anymore.",03Apr2018,0
196,"Hi all, My girlfriend (17), and I (18), are both seniors in high school. We have been together for a pretty long time and are planning on going to college at the same school. I recently found out that she is bulimic. When describing it to me, she says that she can’t find anything good about her body and she’s been eating healthy and exercising quite frequently yet seen no impact. I have known since we started dating that she has issues about confidence, her body, how she looks, etc.. I have never met a girl more genuinely beautiful than her. Losing weight is not something she needs to be doing or thinking about at all, yet in her head she isn’t seeing changes she wants. I need real solutions. I’ve told her how I feel about her and how much I care about her and honestly wouldn’t change a thing. She tells me about how she doesn’t want to do it, but keeps thinking of how she hates her body and will succumb to the pressure of it. She won’t admit to me she has this due to it not happening “enough” for it to be real. I’m worried about her and I’m at the point where I can’t sit idle and watch this happen anymore. I need real solutions. I care about her so much and find myself thinking about it constantly. Any help is appreciated. Thank you

197,"My best friend recently left our hometown to pursue her dreams elsewhere. She’s been living there for a few months now, but despite applying to over ten places, she still cannot land a job... Half have told her she comes across as too rude, the other haven’t called her back. To make matters worse, her new roommate/house host recently told her that her extremely silent nature is unnerving and that the living situation isn’t going to work out. My friend is really upset and discouraged, but the sad truth is that those people are actually right. 

Like me, she was a very sheltered homeschooled kid  who hardly had any of the necessary social exposure she needed growing up. I have developed a lot of social skills throughout college and in the work force and now previous social difficulties have become easier for me. To this day, however, my friend won’t look people in the eye, she mumbles when she talks to new people, comes across as rude, acts like she would rather not be there, and is overall very hesitant and nervous. She seems to think everyone is discriminatory towards her because she’s not extroverted, but honestly she does have the tendency to drive people away from her, and that’s certainly not what businesses want when hiring.

As an introvert I understand how she feels, but she doesn’t have any sort of drive to improve because she doesn’t feel the need to; she expects everyone else to take her exactly how she is. Perhaps she doesn’t understand that she does, in fact, seem very rude and that developing basic social skills aren’t a sacrifice of who she is. Her other friends are all telling her that those people who said that are all idiots, and her mother (whom she often turns to for advice other than me) babies her without offering anything that could be helpful and  constructive. I feel that as her best friend I should do something about this. 

How can I delicately tell her that, yes, her social skills are very lacking? She seriously needs to work on them in order to make it out there, and all it takes is mastering the basics. It’ll be tough as I’ll be the only person in her supportive circle who will be agreeing with the ones who say she’s too anti-social. She’s in a tough spot now and so I want to confront her with tact, and I’m not sure how to say it.


TL,DR: Best friend can’t land a job because she comes across as rude and is very socially awkward, how to tell her that she really needs to work on that. ",03Apr2018,1
202,For further context: Basically me and a team of fellow college engineering students designed a small model car with a fully functional 5-speed manual transmission. All of the components (from the frame to the gears &amp; driveshaft etc.) are entirely 3D printable with the exception of the small electric motor used to drive it. We designed this as an educational tool to introduce people to engineering principles and to show in a simple way how transmissions work in cars with the intention of selling the 3D templates to schools so they could print their own models to assemble and use as learning resources within the classroom.

203,"Don't get me wrong, I love animals and I absolutely adore dogs. My common law spouse and I recently moved to a new building which, for the most part, it's pretty decent. There are, however, a couple of neighbours - one of which is on our floor - who have dogs that they do not bathe. When they use the elevator to take their dogs out for walks, it stinks for the next hour or so. Pretty much every time we use the elevator it smells like unwashed dogs. The other issue is that the one tenant is on the spectrum and she hits her poor dog in the face for whining. I hate confrontation, but I do not tolerate animal abuse; hitting your dog and poor hygiene are both abuse to the animal in my opinion. A dirty dog is more likely to get sick or an infection.

I don’t have reason to ever think she would cash it and say never got it. She has been watching our children for close to a decade now. I looked at the check online it had some code on the bank but no signature on the back of the check.

Who is legally and morally responsible to see that my child care provider gets paid. 

I reported it to the bank and they are investigating. Provider and I have not discussed if she is taking this hit or we are (check was for $600) or we just wait to see what the bank investigation turns up. She doesn’t think it’s necessary for her to file a police report. 

edit: I ended up calling the police dept and filing a report. Officer gave me an incident number and told me to call and give it to the bank.

211,"Currently 22, finished uni degree where I did most units online, so I made no friends. Friends I did make I've lost contact with for some time. Still have some old high school friends around, and while one is probably the main reason I’m not even deeper in all this, the rest almost seem fake. None of them really want to interact with me, and no, depression and such is never something I bring up with any of them, which I know would make them uncomfortable even more if I did.

Can't find a job in relation to degree. Still living at parents house and, in my situation, that's not a big problem. Family is heavily religious and it's frowned upon to leave house until marriage and all that jazz.
But regardless, I'll admit I have a small part time job which is good but, getting a ton of flack and pressure from parents to keep trying to get another job which has been a pointless feat for the past half year. No luck anywhere. As far as depression goes, I don't know who to talk to. Not even my doctor knows since I don't want to talk to him about it. I am all alone with everything built up inside and try my best to hide it.

I have one good friend, however his working hours have changed so I rarely see or talk to him anymore. I feel unloved and frankly unable to fall for someone due to religious pressure. Here's a quick rundown on that situation.

I can only go out/marry people within my religion and everyone within my religion is in another state. I am never really allowed to go out with friends or just be.. a normal young adult really. I've already missed my chance to be a normal teenager. If we do end up marrying someone outside the religion we are cut off and basically disowned by the entire family. I've seen it happen before. I'm aware it's probably classified as a cult really.. but even if I found leaving home as a financially viable option, would I really want to be disowned like that?

Maybe I got a bit off topic here, but my entire life and situation is a ****hole and I don't know my options. I wouldn't consider myself suicidal, but I'd damn sure be happy if everything just stopped, if that makes any sense. Just need to get all this off my chest, since I feel just trapped and don’t know where to go from here. Feels like a dead end.

219,"I received a Bachelors in Film Production around 2008. Started working for a small company as an intern right after graduation. They barely paid me and worked me to the point of nervous breakdown. In all honesty, I should have been smarter about that scenario, but I was young, out of school and enjoying doing what I love and paid the price. I was hospitalized, diagnosed as Bi-Polar and went back to living with my parents. Within a year, I was able to regain my health mentally and return as a functional member of society. Was not able to find film work afterwards and if I did it was the bottom of the barrel work.

Still lived with my parents and was forced to return to a movie theater job I hadn't held since the early days of college. From there, I worked as a medical biller, bookkeeper, warehouse manager, ebay/amazon lister, used restaurant equipment salesman, office assistant and now a unit secretary for a hospital.

I'm about to turn 34 and everything is suddenly hitting me. Literally feels like all my hopes and dreams just flew right out of my hands. I know I'm not at the lowest point in my life, which was when I had broken down years ago. That experience really grounded me and put me on a different path in my life. The love of the arts is still in me. I write short stories and skits on the side for myself, but the adult in me knows the arts is not a stable career. 

Now with my current position, I'm being given the opportunity to go back to school and have my tuition paid for by the hospital. A lot of my co-workers and family told me I should pursue something in the medical field since I'm already in the field. Nursing seemed like a viable option and since already having a Bachelor’s degree, there are programs where I can get a BS in Nursing within 15 months. I'm currently enrolled for a BS in Biology and taking A&amp;P and Chemistry for the first time. Honestly struggling in A&amp;P, but doing fairly well in Chemistry to my surprise.

The problem is that these thoughts rear their way into the back of my mind. Lots of what-if's and maybes... have me questioning every decision I make. 

Anyway, with the way things are going, I won't be able to get into the 15-Month Nursing program with my grades, since it's a competitive program. So starting an associates in nursing is out of the question for me. I know it’s smart enough not to go backwards in a degree. So my other alternative is going for a MBA in either Accounting or Business Intelligence and Data Analysis. None of this is what I planned for, but things don't go like you plan them in this day and age.

The actual advice I'm trying to get is, what do I follow? My heart, my brain, the current work climate, the wind? 

I have this scenario that I tell my girlfriend and friends. My parents came from Russia, back when it was the Soviet Union. I would tell them, ""If I was born back during the Soviet Times, I'd have no choice, but to become a Doctor or Lawyer. Or even in an extreme case have a gun-pointed to my head and told to become (insert profession) or killed."" Honestly, I'd would prefer that scenario then having all these options. It's the beauty of being in this country that you can have these options, while others don't. I feel this privilege of choice and being told you can literally be anything when you grow up, kinda messed me up.",03Apr2018,2

I am in my early 20s, I met a girl 1 year ago, shes beautiful, amazing in every way, best girl ive ever dated and I love her to pieces. Shes from a small town just over from me, about a 20 minute or so drive, we both live with our own parents

We recently decided (i suggested) that we move in together, as we love each other very much, this could be a great step for us. (Keep in mind i had pretty much been living at her moms house with her for months, only really went 'home' to get clothes etc for work, and do laundry) 

The 'official move day' was 2 months ago. I spent a lovely 3 days with my family, had the playstation vr set up, laughing, joking etc. On the final day i was excited. i got all of my previously-packed clothes, most of my belongings, loaded up the car and made the 20 minute drive to my new home

Here's the problem; ive felt servere home sickness everyday since i left. Its not getting better. I very rarely get upset normally, cant remember 1 time ive actually cried since i was about 13. I can handle emotions pretty well and am normally a generally happy person. 

The past 2 months have been hell. I havent been eating, work is getting harder due to not sleeping properly, nothing feels like home and ive actually starting breaking down crying the past few days when im alone, then i feel stupid for crying because everyone has to leave the nest some day and im only a 20 minute drive away. 

We have spent 2 weekends all together again since i left. Seeing my brother and sister and my mom all play on the playstation vr together was amazing and i had such an amazing time, but 1 week back at my girlfriends and im a depressed mess again. 

Im panicking that ive moved out too early, but when im at my moms i miss my girlfriend; ideal scenario is living at moms with the girlfriend, but there just isn't room.

Im in serious trouble here so any help is appreciated, im starting to feel depressed all the time and have even had thoughts of breaking up with her so i can go to my real home..

We both agreed on holding things off for a month or more and see what happens after that, I said to her that i feel like she just wanted to end things now but can't but she said she didn't so I'm in a super confusing spot right now, I don't want to end things with her either because I think the world of her and she means a lot to me but I don't want to be left hanging on a string, because when we do finish this hold period she said that it might not go back to how we where.

233,"Sorry if this isn't the right place for this, I just don't know what to do at this point. 

This is long. I tried to type out some background and ended up going off way more than I intended. TL;DR at the end.

My mother is an alcoholic. She has been for years. She rollercoasters - she hits rock bottom, gets her shit together, is sober for a few months (or sometimes only days or weeks), and then starts another downward spiral (or starts drinking just as much - sometimes just hiding it better, or recently, barely hiding it at all) until things get bad enough again. 

Things got really bad several years ago. She was with an abusive alcoholic boyfriend, lost her home, received multiple DUIs in multiple states, lost her license, her car - pretty much everything. She served some time in jail, but I cannot remember how much. 

I was a child at the time those things happend, and was removed from her care fairly early into her issues, to live with another family member. I didn't speak to her for several years, but eventually she got sober, a new apartment, a job, etc. We started talking and had a (somewhat strained) mother/daughter relationship again. 

For job purposes, I moved in with her about 7 months ago, where I began to see the extent of her drinking problem that was resurfacing (or in reality, probably never went away). Before I moved in, I knew she was drinking again socially. But living with her, I learned she was drinking every single night. 

Two or three months after moving in, I had to take her to the ER, because she felt depressed, suicidal, and wanted to get clean, but felt she couldn't do it herself. I drove her to an ER approximately 1 hour away, because she couldn't go into the one in our city, because she works for them and didn't want them to know. 

She blew above a .26, spent the night sobering up, and convinced them all in the morning she didn't mean the suicidal threats, she was just drunk. They let her go in the morning. She's been to the ER twice more since then, both different places, and done the same thing. Longest she's stayed was 2 nights, because they were giving her good enough drugs. When they started to bring down her dosage, she left. 

She has also been doing drugs, or more specifically, crack. Every weekend. She's confided in me that she used to be addicted to it, and has in the past spent upwards of $800 per week funding this habit. She's trying to hide it as much as possible, but one good thing about her being constantly shitfaced is that she's usually honest if I ask her the right questions enough times. 

Thankfully she still doesn't have her license back yet, so her being a danger to others is less likely now. She did take my car once - driving unlicensed and drunk, to drive to the store down the road to buy cigarettes. I wasn't home. She told me several weeks later. I since hide my keys/keep them on me, and don't leave my car at home when I'm not there, so I don't have to feel responsible if she does some stupid shit. 

Unfortunately, she doesn't have her license. Getting the DUIs and going to jail and losing her car and license was the only thing that convinced her she had to do something last time, and that wasn't even enough. 

Today, she was asked to leave work. You see, she had started drinking in the mornings and all day on weekends, when she and a few other people would come in for overtime. She was obviously drunk and slurring. Several of her co-workers have reported her to management. Her boss, thankfully, is incredibly kind. She told my mother to take a few days to reflect and think about things, and to call her on Thursday. She also told my mother that if she needed to attend an inpatient program, that she would still have a job when she returned. 

My mother isn't taking it seriously. She laughed it off, and is using it as a mini vacation to get even more shitfaced 24/7 until she's allowed back. She won't consider a program or anything. She admits she has a problem, and she wants help... but she doesn't want to get help. I don't know how to convince her or guide her into a program, because I think an inpatient stay, with no opportunity to leave, is what she really needs. She needs to dry out for a month, if not more, and learn healthy living habits. I don't know what to do.

**TL;DR: My mother lost everything several years back due to alcoholism, and is back on the same path. The only thing she has to lose this time around is her job, and that's being threatened because she's showing up drunk. She's tried to get help at hospitals, but she can only stick to it for one or two nights before she checks herself out. I don't know what I should do or how I can convince her that an inpatient stay is probably the best thing for her. She needs help, and I don't know how to help her.**",03Apr2018,2
234,"I'm 30 years-old, single, soon to be completely debt-free, and I make a *very* respectable salary (not in the 6-digits or anything, but enough to live well). I worked hard to get here, mind you, but I also had an awesome friend to help me reach this point.

Yet, I am every bit as miserable as I've ever been.

Granted, I don't have to worry about living paycheck-to-paycheck anymore (just last year, there were times I had to pay for fuel to get to work using spare change in my car, sometimes less than $2 of fuel at a time), so that level of stress is gone.

Yet, so many of my issues are simply *the person that I am*.

I don't like exercising. I don't have any hobbies, or interests. I'm great with ""people"", but I've never been in a relationship. I want, more than anything else in life, to have someone care about me and to care about, even just ""dating"", or one day start a family.

It's hard to even describe the kind of loneliness I feel.It's not the sad, ""woe is me"" kind of loneliness, but the matter-of-factly ""Well, I guess this is how it's always going to be"" loneliness.

Every time I open myself up, I get crushed. And I feel almost certain the exact same thing is about to happen again, because when I started opening up the other night to this woman I've really grown to care for, I just felt like she only sees me as a friend.

It's so hard to even ""keep trying"" anymore. I don't give a shit about my job, or even being debt-free. I don't care if I never had to work again; I just wish I had someone in my life, who I could just *be with*.

Maybe I'm putting off some kind of ""clingy vibe"" or something without realizing it. I don't know. It doesn't even matter, because it's not like I can change any of that. There's always going to be some better-looking guy who ""gets the girl"", and I feel like my lot in life is supposed to be the eternal bachelor, but I don't want that.

I honestly just think about walking away from everything, but I don't even have another life to walk *to*. It's not like giving up a successful career is going to make me *more* attractive to women. So I don't even know where the hell my life is going.

What am I supposed to do? How do you become happy, when the only thing in life you want is to be with someone -- anyone -- else?",03Apr2018,1

I’m the meantime, she never deposited money into that account but still had a few autopays set to take out which resulted in her going into the negatives and it taking out of my paycheck a few times. She owes me at least a hundred dollars at this point and is still in the negatives right now (I did manage to get my direct deposit changed over finally so she will stay that way until she pays it.)

I tried talking to her about it but she was ignoring my texts and she moved back home so communication is limited. When she did finally talk to me she just resorted to blaming me and told me I’ll get it when it get it. She got hostile and then told me off and said she would get it when she gets it and she doesn’t know when. Since she moved we have to pay more rent and a hundred is a lot for a poor college kid.

I’m a senior project manager with around 10 people on my project team handling tasks from scheduling/purchasing to construction. 

Besides the overall tasks that the projects need accomplished, i have a daily/weekly to-do list that slowly gets whittled down with more important and/or critical tasks. My manager is very hands off and let’s us run our projects as we see fit. We update him as needed if some urgent issues arise or once a month or so. 

I come into work in the morning, get coffee and eat breakfast, peruse and respond to some emails (usually low hanging fruit), then read news on the internet, check stocks, look at some financials, go to some meetings, peruse the internet some more, do my morning bathroom/reddit routine, then really get cranking with work after lunch and will sometimes go well into early evening before I leave work. 

I can’t seem to hit the ground running in the morning. I know what I need to do for the day and have no problem completing my work and performing well overall, but I just feel like I’m dragging and slacking in the morning. If there’s urgent issues that need to be resolved I’m all over it, but short of that, it just feels like I can’t motivate myself to actually do as much work as I’m capable of.

244,"Background about me: 22, M. I have a pretty good set of friends, hobbies, and am quite involved in my school. Throughout this whole time, I’ve never been in a relationship but am happy being single.. till now.

So I’ve met this girl, known her for a year. She’s from my country but is now currently studying overseas. We had what I would call an online relationship because when we met she was already studying overseas. The relationship was “undefined”. However we eventually drifted apart, a small part was because I was v unsure as to what we had.

Fast forward, we hadn’t talk in 4months, and she just flew back home. Decided to reconnect with her and we went out a couple of times just to catch up before she flew back. We had a great time and she thanked me for everything. This time, I realised that I really like her and have been thinking about her. But the situation is that we’re no longer on that “talking” basis and I’ve been finding it hard as if I’ve lost her attraction because now she often takes Long hours-days to reply attributing it to being busy. I believe on giving space so I don’t double text, I just leave it till she replies and she continues the conversation. For once, I don’t feel happy being single and I’ve been trying to bury myself in work/friends but it isn’t helping. 

Advice: I feel like waiting till she’s back again in 2months, because I will have more time to work with and base on her vibe, decide whether or not to put everything out on the table/ask her on a date (to be clear with my intentions) and to consider a LDR should the date goes well. But till then, should I be ok if the conversation dies out within this two months? I really don’t like double texting but I treasure her as a Friend regardless. Also, how do I cope for this two months? She’s constantly on my mind even when I engage in gym,friends, school. Any tips?

Writing this is hard for me, but here it goes.

So this is my last year of high school before I am supposed to go to university. And I have been having trouble to stay focus on studying on my subjects, and often I would even find it challenging to pick up a textbook to read or make notes unless the inter-school test a couple of days away. I'm not the brightest academic student either. With a bad predicted grade in my A level (Bio - C, Chem - C, Math - E). I wouldn't say I was forced to apply to unis in Canada ( which is where I am from), but my family wouldn't let me take any other options after high school. So I applied to couple uni courses that I am interested in (health related subject and criminology), with a gut feeling telling me that they will indeed reject given my current predicted grades. Although the sixth-form administrator that is supposed to help me with my uni applications have been very supportive of my choices whenever we look into my predicted-grade, we will have this moment of awkward silence. I know her thought of this is, ""He has no chance."" I applied because I told myself, I wouldn't know the outcome if I don't try. 

I don't have any problems with making friends with anybody in school. But seeing all close friends and girlfriend having no issues with receiving offers from unis. I feel so ashamed of myself. Often I avoid the topic about universities when asked by anybody. Everyone expects me to get good grades and go to uni, and right now I feel like I'm not cut out for it and on the verge of just giving up. I can't seem to find the motivation to keep going and try anymore. I tried to self-medicate with Ritalin, putting up motivational quotes around myself. I go to the gym very often but feel like I'm getting no results recently. Everything seems to be going downhill for me.

My confidence in going to uni is virtually 0. I feel hopeless. And this puts me off to study even more. Whenever I'm supposed to study I find myself running away from all my responsibility as a student and end up gaming or just procrastinating. 

The only ambition that remains in my heart is going back to Canada and join the army like how I told everyone I would. Problem is my mother wouldn't allow me to join unless I finish uni. I moments where I thought of just use my savings to buy a one-way ticket back home and sign the papers and join and leave everything here behind. 

In the end, I don't know what to do anymore. I feel lost. Don't know who I can take this to. I guess I want advice on how to find the motivation to study and what to do if all my unis reject me.

TL;DR
Bad grades I received in tests from my school are affecting my chances to get to uni. Need advice on options I can take if I get rejected from all universities. And need advice on how to drastically improve my self-motivation to study and go on.

However I'm completely burnt out on sales, my patience for people has worn incredibly thin and apathy has set in hard.

251,"Before going into the question, I'm gonna start with a few bullet points for context:

+ For 5 years, my life was pretty shit, and going downhill. It wasn't until two years ago that things started getting better.
+ It's been my dream to create and run my own business.
+ I am currently in a position where I can _try_ to start my own business.

Now on to the dilemma: I have to choose between (1) accepting a job offer, or (2) trying to start my own business. The reason for the above bullet points is that I am worried I am rushing into starting my own business just because my life is on an upswing after years of getting worse, right as I've achieved financial stability.

With both options, I will literally be working on the exact same thing.

Here are my thoughts on both:

## For the job offer

+ I'll be getting a guaranteed salary.
+ They are offering some % of the company. The exact % is unknown, and will be based on my performance.
+ I'll be committing to working with people who seem nice, but I've never worked with before.
+ Just about everyone I've spoken to has told me I'd be stupid to not accept this.
+ I _wouldn't_ be able to work on my own project on the side, as it is the exact same work and would be a conflict with the job.

## For doing my own thing

+ The short time I've been working on my own project is among of the happiest times of my life.
+ Even if I'm working on the exact same thing, it feels much more fulfilling when it's work done for me than work done for someone else.
+ Some people have told me they genuinely believe I can make it work.
+ I'm not making any money, and won't be for months (years?)
+ I have a _hard_ deadline, and if I fail, I'll be completely out of money and in a worse spot than if I'd accepted the other job to begin with.
+ I don't think I'd have trouble finding a job though.
+ The uncertainty around the economy, given the current political climate, has me worried about how long my money will *really* last (I think an article talked about a recession being predicted in 2019)

**tl;dr**: I can either accept a job that pays *very* well, or start my own business (which is my dream). I'm scared of failing at my business and passing up an amazing job opportunity, but I'm also scared of passing up on my dream for the sake of money and stability.",03Apr2018,1

259,"Okay, so I might post this to a couple places because I’m needing as much input as I can get. If it’s not allowed in this subreddit, I plan on removing it. I’m using a throwaway, as my main contains my name. 

TDLR; Interviewed with Job #1 and Job #2. Job #1 has already called to offer me the position, but I kind of want to work with Job #2. Don’t want to look like an a-hole, or mess up my professional reputation (as both positions are within the same company), but also not wanting to be dumb enough to pass up a proposal for a wink. 


Last week I interviewed with a job within a department of a University. Yesterday (Monday), I interviewed with a job for a different position in a different department within the same University. Today (Tuesday), the first Job I interviewed for called to offer me the position, but now I kind of want the job with the second position (who hasn’t called yet).


So to elaborate on Job #1: 
The interview went fine, seemed a little uptight. I was interviewed by 3 women in a room. Made all 3 kind of laugh at the end, took that as a good sign. They told me the job would be very tedious and monotonous; staring at a computer screen. I would be sharing a cubicle with 2 other people and they mentioned it would be a bit cramped; and also quiet and no cell phones (no biggie). 
The pay starts out at about $11.50-$12.50 an hour (but the benefits at this University are absolutely awesome). There’s really no overtime, and when there is it is completely optional. It’s an 8-5 work schedule and they said they would work with my class hours until I could transition into night classes. 
I would not really have much interaction with the public at all in this role; maybe the occasional phone call or fill in for the receptionist. But it’s great because my former job was ALL customer service. Which is great because college kids in general make me anxious (don’t ask why, I know that seems weird and crazy). 
It’s located in a building that is a 5-7 minute walk from a parking garage and is up 3 flights of stairs with no elevator (no big deal, but worth noting). 

Now, my friend’s sister worked with Job #1 loosely, and she said they cannot keep people as it’s a strict job and you can’t eat at your desk (doesn’t bother me) or microwave certain things in the break room and no being late ever (common sense) and they are NOT flexible on schedules at all. So it is definitely a very regulated job with a lot of rules; but as with any job there are rules. Job #1 called all of my references yesterday, and apparently they mentioned to one of my references that they are having a hard time keeping employees; which they did vaguely imply during the interview. I asked for an elaboration on that in my interview, and they kind of shifted uncomfortably and mentioned something about people being promoted and moving on to higher positions. So I felt like that was code for “we fired them or they quit”. 



Onto Job #2: 
I interviewed with Job #2 yesterday (Monday) and 5 people interviewed me. I had all 5 people laughing the entire interview, so I feel like it went really well. This was in a different building and department on the same campus as Job #1. My job in this role would be a very busy one, as I would be assisting all 5 department heads of this place. I would be in an office with my own desk space. I would have to help with events and it would essentially put me out on campus now and then with students and faculty, doing career fairs and stuff. It starts out at $13.50 (an entire dollar more than Job #1), but there may be some overtime required. They never mentioned about working with my school schedule, but they are aware that I am still in school. They have the same benefits as Job #1. Also, it’s on the first floor of a building right next to a new parking garage being built. It’s also directly across the street from a lot of cool places in this town, which is a plus. I applied for this Job #2 two weeks ago and received a call for an interview last week; I applied for Job #1 two months ago and was just interviewed last week. 


SO, job #1 has just called and left me a voicemail to call them back. They called all of my references yesterday, so I know when I return the call they will offer me the job. But I can’t stop thinking about what I should do, because now I feel that I want to work for Job #2. I already told Job #1 during my interview last week that I could start immediately (as this was the day before Job #2 called me for an interview).

My friends are telling me that if Job #2 calls I should just quit #1 for #2, and just tell them #2 is offering more money. But I feel like to accept a job and then turn around and tell them “never mind”, discredits me as a professional; and I don’t want to burn any bridges as both positions are for the same University which I have wanted to work for for over a year now (because of the amazing benefits). 

I’m not dumb enough that I’m going to turn down a job proposal from one job for a wink from another- but I’m worried I will hate the job I get and miss my opportunity to work with the people I vibe with.

262,"So my boyfriend, who has approximately just over 2 years line cook experience started up with a new company in September. He was unofficially next in command after the assistant kitchen manager(AKM), essentially an unofficial supervisor. Everyone still treats him like a supervisor, the kitchen manager, AKM, even the front of the house management. 

Because of this he was given a performance review 1 month early (November) to bump his wage up to 12.15$ (from minimum wage 11.15$). The rest of the kitchen staff received their performance reviews and raises in December. 

Now in March he has received a second performance review and has been brought up to 12.50$. Though today he discovered that the rest of the kitchen has been receiving 12.50$ since their performance review in December. So he was essentially acting supervisor getting paid less than the rest of the kitchen staff. Now they’ve bumped him up to par with everyone else and still praise how important he is to the company but it feels kinda back handed and shady. 

I understand that it’s an unofficial supervisor title and we don’t really care about what his wage actually is  but this feels very dirty and underhand. It feels like the company isn’t being the most upfront and honest. I’m just wondering if there’s anything that can/should be done moving forward. We aren’t sure what his next move should be or how/if to approach the company about this.

However, since then I’ve gotten into 3 more car accidents (some were my fault, and some were not) with the most recent one happening yesterday. I’m starting to feel really freaked out and cursed. I’ve been told that I most likely never really processed the first accident, and instead I internalized it and no longer really trust my own driving. I’m honestly really freaked out and stressed.

Though, today I was only given one thing to work on and despite my asking have not recieved anything else.

267,"Hiya, I'm 27 years old, I work in a care home, and have depression and social anxiety. Going to work is a struggle. I like my job, apart from some of my colleagues, especially the management. The job is thankless, awful pay, and stressful.

Sometimes I get fed up with the way I am spoken to. This is just a small incident, but I just want reassurance that I am not in the wrong. Anyway, at work today, my colleagues and I noticed there wasn't much food in the fridge for the residents. We said that the manager who normally does the food shop will probably do it, as she would be in during the afternoon. 

The manager came in in the afternoon, and she was fine, she was nice and asked how I was etc. A bit later on, she came into the kitchen and said to me, ""Miss_Chickpea, have you been whinging about there not being enough food?"" I said, ""I wouldn't call it whinging, we just noticed there wasn't much food and said you'd probably order it today.""

It really ruined my mood. I hate the word whinging. I wasn't whinging, I just made an observation because the fridge was almost empty. Sometimes I have a good day at work, but a comment like that just ruins it for me. I still feel sick and anxious now. Sometimes the manager is really nice, but other times she makes comments like that. Am I overreacting?",03Apr2018,1
268,"Hello reddit,
I come to you today with a question about my post graduate goals.
I am currently a student a great school, and will be graduating with a dual degree in Economics and Bachelor of science in Business Administration. Keep in mind it is a top 5 Econ and business school, with a very good reputation. I have always been interested in starting a company, or leading one, working with new technologies. However, there is a strong push towards banking here, and it is quite difficult to find meaningful analyst positions in tech. Since I was kid, I've bene fascinated and drawn towards the military, I love a life of action, structure, and purpose, and feel like potentially going to Officer Training School to be a pilot, and then using the skills and experience learned there to then work in Business Tech seems like a more exciting option. My family isn't fond of that idea, but I will do what I must. I was wondering what your thoughts on such a matter are? What are the pros and cons of joining the military, and then going into the business sector after? Will I be throwing away opportunities by not going to work immediately after University? I also understand I don't have a technical degree, will this be a problem to become a pilot? What kind of skills can I be expected to learn and make use of? This has been an internal struggle for me for a while. Part of the reason is I would have to renounce my other two citizenships, I hold 2 in addition to American, which means, even if I was born here, I don't I'll be able to get a security clearance. Should I give up my French and Swiss citizenships? Will I be throwing away  important opportunities if I do that?
Any advice would be helpful. ",03Apr2018,1
269,"So I am a male 19 years old and I’ve been hanging out with this girl for about 5 months. I’ve know her for longer probably since I was 16 but we never really hung out until this past October her mom took us down to see a mutual friend out of state and so she could see her boyfriend. Then at the end of November she helped me out with getting a job at the place she works. After about the first week working there she wanted to hangout and pretty much since then I’ve been over almost everyday and weekend. About the middle of December she told me that she had broken up with her boyfriend of 3 years due to stress of a long distance relationship and her starting college. Then for New Years we went back down to see our mutual friend and while we were down there she had started sleeping with me in the same bed and that continued when we came back from our mutual friends house  it progressed to spooning and cuddling whenever we watch tv and go to sleep I also took her out for Valentine’s Day and got her a gift. So I’ve developed a pretty big crush on her since about February. There has been no kissing although a couple times she placed my hand on her breast we hug whenever I return home but other than that nothing new has happened mainly because I’m pretty shy and I wanted her to get over her 3 year relationship which about a week after she broke up with him she said she doesn’t even feel sad anymore. But she does still talk about him sometimes and she hasn’t signed out of his Netflix account yet. I’ve been having a lot of anxiety about telling her my feelings for her I feel like she isn’t the kind of person to lead someone on with the cuddling and all that. I don’t know whether I’m over analyzing it or not but I think she might like me too. It’s been roughly 4 months since she broke up with her ex. Is that enough time to wait and tell her my feelings? Does anyone think that she might have feelings for me as well? I feel as though I should ask her soon though I don’t want to lose what might be.  I was thinking maybe the end of this coming weekend I should ask her. That way if I do get rejected it won’t be awkward and if I do get rejected I still want to be friends. I think that’s the part that scares me the most. So, should I ask her out? Does it seem she has feelings for me? And maybe some of you might be able to suggest how I should ask her?

275,"Hello Reddit,

So I'm gonna try to cut a long story short. My dad grew up in Afghanistan and earned a degree as an Computer Engineer but moved to the US where his degree wasn't recognized. He went to school here again and got his degree in CE here again. (This was maybe 20 years ago.) We moved to Minnesota where my dad got a job working for Seagate and we were making decent money. Then in 2007 he got laid off and we moved to CA. When we moved here my dad was like I'm going to just get a job to earn some money while I look into finding another. So he got a job working at the gas station, and ever since then my dad has been unmotivated to find work for some reason. I honestly have no idea why considering he hates his current job. I'm not here to make excuses for him I honestly have no idea why he never changed jobs and it's not my business to ask him. I am currently going to school for BS in Accounting and my dad wants to work for me when I graduate but that's in a couple years if everything goes right.

We live in a ghetto so his job is dangerous. He has seen a lot of stuff and yesterday he witnessed something horrible (that he won't share) that has completely motivated him to get another job. I know it's almost impossible for him to get a job as an engineer since he has a 10 year gap in his resume and I'm not sure putting 10 years experience at a gas station is any better than leaving it blank. I am just looking for any entry level job that my dad can get so he can get away from his current job. ",03Apr2018,2
276,"So. My girlfriend and I signed a lease (Grave mistake) in September of ‘17 with two roommates that we previously lived with for a short period of about 3 months. 

When one of said roommates called us to ask “Should we move in here?” I said no because it was too expensive. He hung up on me and paid the security deposit anyway.

These two roommates to say the least are two of the most manipulative toxic people we’ve ever met in our life. 

A few examples:

they told us (Grown adults btw) that we couldn’t get a dog even though we pay for half of the rent and ALL not half... ALL of the utilities simply because they didn’t want to have a dog in the vicinity. (They aren’t allergic).

They have a cat, and haven’t cleaned the litter box since before Christmas. (This has nothing to do with us but I think it’s ridiculous to treat a pet like that).


Overall they just treat us like children, and think that they own the entire house. Well our financial situation has changed, we’ve lost so much trying to pay for this house and we need to leave. 

What would you all do? We have contacted the landlord stating that we can no longer afford to pay our portion. She said anything we plan to do is fine with her so long as it’s amicable.

We have to get out, physically and financially, But we know that these room mates will go to the end of the earth to try and further ruin us if we leave.",03Apr2018,1

279,"I have recently quit computers in the last week. It started about a year ago when a couple of friends and I started playing game with our computers. They tent to use profanities extremely often, and are all just normally bad people. The thing was that I sometimes hung around them at school, but not often. These people I never really liked, just played computers with. Hence the “friends “ quotations. Well recently this dick (excuse my French, but I needed emphasis.) told my really good friend to “kill himself”. This is really bad because he is insanely depressed and is sometimes close to actually doing it. Well, my friend did the right (and wrong kinda) and went to the principal. I was called in the next day by my teacher who asked me some questions, as I was present in the discord call. I told her what I knew and she thanked me. Then the other guy had to show his phone to the principal so she could take pictures. The day after That the principal called my mom and told her what happened. My mom instantly started screaming and yelling at me for even being there. I know I’m a good kid, and almost never say anything vulgar or hurtful, but she screamed at me for even being around these people. I guess i tried to say that at my age (13) you are always going to be around someone that doesn’t make good decisions. Cussing and profanity is common in this secular society, and you won’t be sheltered for long. My mom went into the conference room at my school where she was showed the hundred pictures taken . I was then called to the conference room after she left, for them to tell me I wasn’t a big “player” in the whole thing, probably because I broke down in the nurse’ office because of the anxiety my mom set upon me that morning. When I got home I tried to make amends, but she wouldn’t have it. I don’t blame her, because I know that these are bad kids; but I don’t have anyone to play with besides them. I promptly cut the cables of the computer I spent 4 months planning and building. I was finished at that point. I was tired of my mom blaming everything on my computer, and saying I was addicted because I saved money to build it.

Sooo, short backstory.
I'm someone whos rather an Introvert.
I've been like this since the early days of school and I couldn't find any friends because of it.
So when I was like age 13 I finally met somebody to watch movies, play Videogames, etc. (Before then, I just went online, watched anything on the Internet or just played something, but never went out or did something with other people). So we became good friends, he showed me another person.
Then we began a Friendship-triangle. (If you can call it like that)
So we 3 had fun over the years, went out, always did stuff.
We just enjoyed our time.
To this date I only had those 2 Friends.

So heres the problem:
like 2-3 Weeks ago they just cut off the contact with me.
I don't know what I did, but they don't want to associate with me anymore.
I asked them what I did wrong, but I became no clear answer.
Since then I just sit at home and do nothing at all.
I see on Snapchat that they are going out every other day to do stuff, have some fun, etc.
I fell frustrated and I don't know what I should do now.
Any advice?

282,"So, I work at a library.  Unfortunately, while they are great resources for a lot of things, they also attract some not so nice or innocent people.

On Saturday, I was working circulation when an older black man came in.  He approached me and asked about a replacement library card.  I told him about the replacement fee and that he could replace it for free during National Library Week this month.  He then asked what the tattoo on my left wrist meant.  (It's the Japanese Kanji for ""Tiger"", my eastern zodiac sign.)  I explained this, and he asked if I had been to the middle east, and if I had a passport.  I responded no, but I do want to travel eventually.  This seemed to satisfy him and he went to look for books.

When he returned to the desk, I was free and checked the books out to him.  He said ""I'll tell you what, you get yourself a passport, and call me-"" he handed me his card, ""And I will call an associate of mine, and we will get you to Japan."" (I had mentioned wanting to travel there.)  I faltered a bit, and he stressed that it wouldn't cost me a thing and I wouldn't owe him anything.  At that point I was creeped out and was simply smiling and ""uh-huh""-ing so he'd leave.  I thought that was the end of it.

Well, today he came in again.  I was working on the floor, pulling some books when he approached me and asked to ""treat me to dinner"".  I declined, and he asked if I was racist or predjudiced.  I said no, I'm asexual.  I then had to explain that meant I was not interested in any sort of relationship, sexual, romantic, or otherwise.  He seemed a bit down, but accepting of this explanation, said he wanted to leave ""this"" with me, and handed me an envelope.  Inside were instructions on how to obtain a passport in my county, customs and definitions to observe in Japan for the traveler, and **$145 dollars cash**.

I took the envelope to the Managing Librarian and recounted the story like I have here.  She's going to be returning the money and speaking to him about approaching me, as this is not the first instance at all of something like this happening to a library worker.  The departments and circulation have a description of him so they can keep an eye out, and because I use a disability service for transport to and from work, I am picked up at the door, so no worries there, though I will be informing them about this.

So my question is this- if he continues to approach me with ""offers"", will I need to get the police involved?  Part of my job is to work at Circulation every 3 weeks, and I have no issues checking out books to him or casual worker/patron conversation, and of course, have no intention of giving him any sort of personal information.

In my country things are organized this way: we can attend exams in sessions:

2) May, June, start of July
3) End of August, start of September

The problem is that I could not attend lessons for the first part of the course (September, October, November) so I did not manage to do any of the exams for that semester's subjects.

Now, I managed to attend lessons for the second semester. The workload is manageable but when I think that I haven't done any exam in the first semester I get severe anxiety and my brain stops working.

I was always used to study things ""by myself"" in the sense that I studied math and economics finding resources online since my bachelor had nothing to do with it. 

The problem is that attending this university is relatively expensive and I feel a lot of pressure on me to do well and at the same time I can't seek help because I would feel extremely ashamed of letting down my parents.

289,"Lately I have been dealing with some personal problems, I've always kept problems to myself since I don't want anyone else to lay awake because of me. Having family that already has a lot to worry about and seeing how others' problems affect close ones has stopped me from sharing my problems with anyone.

However it seems impossible to keep everything for yourself, it keeps building up and you get this urge to tell someone about it (at least for me). This is exactly what happened, I got drunk a night, couldn't fight the urge to hold my problems to myself and told my close friend Z about some things that were on my mind. The following days I was terrified Z would tell anyone and felt terrible. I hoped it would be a relief to open up about my problems, but it sure didn't feel like it. After that day I never heard anything from anyone about what I had told and just went on with my life like normal.

The most important thing I shared with Z was about something that person X did to me. Now fast-forward to late 2017 and my friend shared me an article, the article was about X. He had done the same thing he had done to me, to someone else. After this Z admitted he had shared my problem with another friend, they both forced me to tell my parents about what happened since they felt it was too big of a problem to keep secret.

I told my parents and they reacted with shock, I told them I wanted to go to the police. My father said I shouldn't, no idea why. Since I have never talked about this with them again, it seems like they don't want to talk about it and neither do I.

The following days my friends were constantly spamming me with texts, because they were worried. Then when I finally met them in person at a party with many others, they decided it was a good place to confront me about what happened. I felt very uncomfortable. Now this is the part that fucked up my trust a lot, they told me that they didn't believe me. That I had made up the terrible thing that happened to me. But now since X had done the same the exact way I described what he had done to me to someone else they believed me and told me I should go to the police to report person X.

The reason I made this long post explaining what happened is because I have changed, and I don't think I changed in a good way. This is why I need advice, I don't know how to proceed from here. I have been keeping so many secrets from everyone I know and I keep blocking people out. I avoid conversations with my parents in general and conversations about certain topics with friends. Sometimes I lie to them just so I can keep my problems to myself. I feel like a douche typing this, but it sadly is the truth.

I am also having trouble reporting X to the police. I have gone to the police in my hometown, they were not helpful they told me I had to go to a police station in a bigger town and report it there.

That happened a while ago...well, time has passed and I’ve recently started seeing this man I've had feelings for forever. He is one of my best friends and he is absolutely amazing but he happens to be part hispanic and I consistently have to lie about my relationship with him to my dad. He makes me the happiest I've been in years. Everything is truly wonderful except for the fact that I have to hide this from my father. I’ve talked to my mom about this and even she admits that I am not going to be happy living at home as a young adult and she disagrees with my dads racism but my funding for college and support for my music is basically dependent on my dad, so she thinks I should stay at home until I finish college in 2 more years..honestly, part of me agrees, but part of me feels like I don’t know how much longer I can endure this. I hate lying and sneaking around like a teenager just to do things that are not wrong. If my dad had his way, I would go to school and come home and do absolutely nothing else. He doesn't see the need for me to hang out with friends, have boyfriends, dance (I'm a ballroom dancer), or anything, except play music for his business. Those are things that are also important to me and it takes some serious effort and even lying for me to even do those things- and I hate lying. Also I’m going to be honest- the thought of being independent does scare me because I’ve never known how to be. Ive never been trusted to make my own decisions and my dad always tells me I’m never going to make it in the real world so its like I completely doubt myself. He tells me I'm an adult and that I can make my own decisions, but the second I do, I'm demonized and threatened to lose a relationship with him. I want to start taking steps toward moving in with my older brother but I don’t know how to bring that up with him or my dad. I want to move out soon without coming off as a rebellious child- which he has mentioned that the only reason I would ever move out is to go be a wh*re and do bad things. In his eyes, I should not move out until I’m married and that if I do, I will be dishonoring my father which is a sin and God will punish me. I am a believer in Christ but I do not share this radical view. I know I need to gain independence but there is still this part of me that aches for my fathers approval and I just feel trapped.

299,"long and all over the place stuff :

Well see, I originally planned to goto college(stem)  after school but then I got really sick and flunked a bunch of exams, skipped a year to write em again and well, contrary to expectations that I'll woosh my time away : I actually studied. studied but alas I found no joy in most of it.  the skipping the year thing is giving me an existential crisis ,I feel like I've done nothing meaningful, I feel sad that I wasted my 1/60th of my life for a few goddamn tests. Oh you say, why did you study for shit you don't care about? Well, I did care about it, but doing problems set after problem set of weird mumbo jumbo really makes you think what the fuck you are doing with your life. This thought is a black pill I've taken and now I can't revert back to the old enthusiastic me. Honestly some parts of math was the only thing that bought me happiness, where I could come up with madman solutions completely different from the routine drivel in the books. 

Someone out there will say oh just goto college and work on your own thing, well I'd fuggin do that if colleges here didn't fuggin have classes for 7+ hours a day and a super inflexible curriculum . more importantly - no more meaningless problem sets please God, no. 

I want creative freedom, I can't deal with this garbage anymore. I don't feel like college material . Should I just go at my studies alone? I'd probably study a dead language or two, some maths and programming as they really interest me .but I have no long term carrier goals, so doing this would basically make me a NEET with a few hobbies. Which is again quite fucked up. 

I want to do something meaningful, something that'll not making me wonder where the fuck the days ran away. Do I just go get a random ass job? I'm already feeling very crappy with time spent this year on such meaningless stuff. 

I'm scared about my future, I'm scared that I'll keep running around pointless garbage and then wonder where the days have disappeared. I'm really sad now and don't want more existential crisises. This is getting to me quite badly, and now I think of my own mortality and feel crappier.I don't want to die with this bitter taste in my mouth.

301,"My girlfriend broke up with me. She cut contact with me soon after. She was extremely devoted to me but I managed to fuck it up. I think because I was too busy and didn't make the time for her, because I suck at talking, because I don't joke much so I'm not funny. Even though I suck at talking she was and is the only person I felt like I could talk to me. And even though I in theory like to joke around (and I might have been able many years ago) now it's hard, doesn't come naturally and I have to make an effort. If I don't make that effort I tend to be pretty serious. Also I barely ever laugh, I usually just smile a bit and do a weird breathing noise. Usually I only really laugh out loud when I exaggerate, am in a weird mood or something funny really catches me by surprise. I want to practice laughing but comedies are boring as shit, sorry.

I was for all practical purposes friendless when she broke up with me a month ago. Now it's not entirely true. An I asked for support from an old irl friend, he's been very supportive but it feels like the majority of what keeps together is him helping me. I made some friends online but those friendships won't last much longer.

I'm a university student finishing my bachelor's even though I'm 25. If I don't graduate maybe I'll have to start working and then my life's pretty much over.

I used to talk to my ex everyday almost all day, and was extremely close to her. Now I have a pit of loneliness that I just can't satisfy. I need some of the closeness that I felt. From everyone I've met online they either don't want a very close friendship or they just don't want one with me.

Some more about my social skills. I'm shy but not very much really. I absolutely can't talk in groups. When I run out of well a set of well chosen topics, usually that means the conversation is over because I'm seemingly unable to chit chat. Maybe I can with someone I'm close to but otherwise I just can't. Another thing I seemingly can't do is talk to more than one person, as I'm not able to lead the conversation and I'm not fast enough at saying things and often I just have nothing to say. Also I have a very introverted so practicing socializing is exhausting and decreases motivation to talk to the few people who I might actually have a shot at having a true friendship with.

I'm already trying a lot of things to get better but I'll end here. I'm posting here because I'm desperate. I know I'll probably have feelings for her for a decade. But meanwhile how do I make life more bearable? How do I learn how to laugh? How do I develop social skills? And where do I find a reason to live? ",03Apr2018,0

Anyway we went to different highschools and lost touch BUT he dm'd me over Insta gram and I answered and he jumped straight to asking for my phone number and I knew him and just to be nice I have it to him and we talked for a little bit and he all the sudden wanted to make plans so I suggested we go to church together sometime (last time I went to church was before I knew how to talk) because he's pretty religious I think. He said that would be good but he would rather have a sleepover (!?!??) so I said my parent's don't let me have sleepovers so we now have plans to go to a church service in 3 weeks?? Ok so I did all this stuff just to be nice to the guy, but this is when your opinions of me get a little shitty, I don't want to be friends with the guy. He's touchy and clingy and really hard to talk to and makes me uncomfortable, in elementary school he would hug me while I was changing for gym class, like when I had nothing but underwear on and I made it clear to him that wasn't something I wanted him doing.

So I’m a guy who wants to stand up for a good friend of mine (Girl) who got drugged and raped at a Harvard dorm room this weekend after a Harvard hosted event. I’m the only person (outside of nurses/medic personnel) that she has told and shared this with.


FACTS:


-not exactly sure who it was (sounded like it was a friend of person who’s room it was, also sounds like he was from Germany)


-not entirely sure she was drugged (although very likely as she does not remember parts of her night/currently waiting for test results)


-Likely NOT a Harvard student


-Could PROBABLY (she said “easily” find out) find out who it was given access to surveillance footage/sign-in sheets at the Harvard hosted event



DILEMMA


-I want to help stand up for her and have the guy get found out that he raped her. (At a minimum)



-Although I’m aware that Its not my place to be pushy and more overtly concerned than she is, it sounds like she has no interest in doing anything about it.



This is what she has said...

 “I don't even know how I would go about it” (reprimanding the guy who drugged/raped her)


“&amp; I don't think there would be any benefit from knowing who it was”

“it might even make it worse”



I don’t know what to do. Nothing? I feel like I want to stand up for her. Otherwise, this motherfucker gets away footloose and fancy-free. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",03Apr2018,1

*EDIT*: I was mistaken, the person is not my 2nd cousin but rather my great uncle! I just mixed up the words! Sorry! I will edit it in the post but the title cant be edited!



My family is kind of in turmoil right now and I just learned that I have a great uncle who I've never even heard of before that doesn't have contact with my side of the family. His Parents don't have contact with us either. I know small things about him and my Mother only had good things to say about him from childhood.

But it really saddens me that I have relatives who I might never even meet. This great uncle lives over 1000km away.

Would it be awkward or rude for me to contact him? I am not an adult so I thought that maybe it would be different if I were to contact him since I am kind of like a blank slate.

And if I did contact him, what should I write?
That I want to connect with family members I have never met before and that I would like him to respond? Contacting him without an actual purpose feels kind of wrong.

It feels like I need to do this since if I wait too long I will never have the chance to rectify.

I am duel-enrolled but I actually plan on moving soon to go to a college elsewhere. I appreciate him giving me this opportunity and want to leave on a good note but I am not quite sure how to approach this with him. 
I graduate at the end of May but really want to quit now because I don’t really like it very much and I don’t need the money.

The reasons for absence include illness of course and some cases when I simply felt that I wasn't particularly benefitting from attending them.

I did not charge anything upfront for this service, but like Shapeways, take a percentage of each sale. There were no surprises, and everything was clearly explained up front and agreed upon.

I first reached out on February 23rd of this year and had everything finished and ready within two weeks. They were very excited the entire time we went through the process and we were both professional and nice.

The last I heard from them was on March 11th and since then they have not responded to any of my emails. They continue to upload videos and live stream but will not respond to my messages.

Which, I'll admit, sucks a little. But I've gotten used to it. 

So in my isolation, I've more or less completely forgotten how to be any good at social interaction at all. I'm so goddamn awkward and not in a cute way. It's baaaaddd. But the thing is. There's this girl in one of my classes, and it's not just with me, but she completely overshares about everything in her life. And normally that would annoy the shit out of me, but there's something about her that I like? Whatever it is, her oversharing makes it easy for me because I don't have to talk a lot. We also have a bit in common, so it makes it easier. 

I only have a month or two left here until I finish my first year, I'll be moving back home once I complete it. My problem is, I don't know if it's worth it to get completely attached to this girl when I'll be leaving soon anyways.

Yesterday morning what seems to be on the top of people’s tongues is their unrestrained hate for idiots. As in all that they talk about. Basically the theme with each encounter as I pass by employees and people shopping together. Just in every social whatever, people just resting on toxicity. Somehow most of this “banter left me feeling they’ll crack at any moment how strong they feel whatever is touchy to them. It wasn’t a great experience to know people publicly voicing opinions like Arian race superiority banter that contradicts the rant they started off with. Like being a massive asshole is entitlement to being intelligent. Then abuse the attention to say the most arrogant things that actually happened to be dumb. 

One moment when I made a criticism against the banter, immediately covered my head from being bashed in. But a miracle happened. One guy actually came to his senses. That’s nothing I want to test again. 

For myself, I’m just adding to the problem somehow. I tried to help a co-worker last week make rate and they rejected me in self pity. The next day the roles changed and they egged the other coworkers to taunt me. Then the last day they were back in the slumps so I left him be. My therapist is also having personal problems and it shown in their body language, which I reflected and shown concern. 

It just seems that I’m not dealing with the same problems other people are and they can’t consider me help or a logical friend. I came home last night and tried coffee and then liquor to keep calm. Really lost. Just trying to keep peace with people.

338,"Hey everyone,

For some context: I’m a 22 y/o guy in australia. I still live with my family as I help to look after my younger siblings when my parents work night shifts. That and I want to save a bit more before moving out early next year. 

I graduated from a politics/literature degree last year. During my degree I took a year off to work for a nonprofit social enterprise and loved the pace and the fact I was doing good for the world. 

After graduating I got an entry level fulltime job in one of our big four banks. I’m in the call centre doing inbound sales for home loans. I moved into this role two months ago and need to stay in it for twelve months before I’m allowed to explore other areas in the company. 

I really dislike it and want to quit. The environment is quite toxic and the work isn’t fulfilling — I don’t mean to sound cocky but I think I can contribute more elsewhere and learn more elsewhere. Ive had two anxiety attacks on the job, my first anxiety attacks since last June, due to the type of work I’ve been doing and dealing with abusive customers over the phone, but my Team Leader essentially told me not to let it get to me. I’ve been applying for a couple openings at nonprofits that I’m qualified for but have been struggling to find the energy and discipline to apply for things after work because work leaves me so drained atm with the sort of customers I have to talk to. 

I lost faith in the bank recently and feel like we’re encouraged to be unethical, so by extension I feel unethical. We’re measured on how many home loan applications we get approved, and the easiest way to get them approved is to understate customers living expenses so it looks like they can afford the loan. It runs the risk that in 2, 5, 10, 20 years the customer can’t afford the loan based on what we do, but all that matters in the company is hitting our # of approved loans — management don’t care about anything else and praise the bankers who overachieve their targets even though those bankers admit the only way they can hit them is by doing what i described above. Unethical tbh. 

There was a royal commission inquiry into the unethical practices of the banking industry at the moment in Australia. My bank was questioned in the court recently. On the day my bank was questioned, my bank blocked all the livestreams of the questioning which is pretty suspicious, without any explanation. Their difference in the questioning was that they know what they have done two years ago (the events called into question) were unethical but they have fixed everything in the last year. Yet they only changed the internal policies a few days after the questioning. Again, dodgy, and I feel unethical working for an employer like this. 

So essentially I really dislike my job and am not passionate about it, and have negative feelings about my employer. 

My goal in life is to open a social enterprise so working for a nonprofit or social enterprise leads me in he right direction whereas working for my current employer is quite the opposite. So i’ve been looking elsewhere. 

I have enough savings to last me 6 months at least. I dont have responsibilities at the moment so I feel even if I leave my job now and am unemployed for a few months, at least I will be happy and won’t be slaving away at a job that I hate, counting down the hours until the end of the day from the time I wake up in the morning. 

I think i could even pick up a short term course in the interim between jobs to help explain my unemployment. 

Ultimately I’ve committed to leaving but don’t know if there’s a point continuing to work my current job if I’m in a position where I don’t need to, especially if it’s not making me happy (and is making me unhappy), and I could redirect the time and energy spent at this job to finding a better one that I want to do and can learn more from. 

Would appreciate any advice (sorry for the long post!), will answer any questions in a couple hours on my break. ",03Apr2018,1

I just walked into the house and heard him yelling at my dad about how my mom’s suggestion for his science fair project “ruined it.” He hasn’t even started it yet. He started yelling about how my mom keeps ruining things, and did what he always does: ran into his room and slammed the door as hard as he could. This was a milder situation compared to other ones. Surprisingly, he hasn’t broken anything other than a laptop, which happened a while ago. Whenever my parents leave us alone at home, he’ll go ballistic whenever he gets mad, yelling racial slurs (calling me a n****r, which doesn’t make sense as we aren’t black) and other insults/curses. Once, he held up a kitchen knife to his chest and yelled at me while crying, saying that I probably didn’t care if he killed himself on the spot.

345,"On phone, so apologies for any weird autocorrect words.

My niece recently turned 18 in March and has decided to move in with this guy she claims she has known for a few months. A week after moving in, she announced she was marrying him. My sister (her mother) is very worried as she has only met the guy recently and hadn't even heard of him until my niece moved out to live with him.

My sister also claims he has been manipulating my niece telling her things like her family doesn't love her and her mother has never done anything for her, etc , etc.

I don't live in the same state so I've never met him and can only go off what my sister says, but she did find a rap sheet for him online from a different state than the one they currently live in where he was charged for a class 3 felony for assault with a weapon and a class B misdemeanor for possession. I had a fellow friend who used to work security help me look into it and verified he is on parole and attending PO meetings, but that's as much info he could get.

My sister is really worried that he'll hurt my niece. I've told her there's not much we can do, her daughter is now an adult and can make her own decisions and the most she can do is just support her as best as possible and make her feel welcomed to come home so she doesn't cut off contact. 

Being far away I'm not familiar with all the details but I was wondering if there was anything I can do to help? or what I can do to maybe convince my niece to at least be careful? I know people can change and that a rap sheet doesn't really tell the whole story. For all I know he could be a great guy. Should I be worried? or should I just let the cards land where they may? I thought about friending the guy on Facebook but I'm worried that will come off creepy or paranoid and not sure I want him to have access to my Facebook either.

All I really know is my sister and my dad don't like him.

Any advice on what I could, if anything, to help either my sister or my niece would be appreciated.

353,"I know this is a pretty dumb, straightforward question but just let me explain my situation quickly before you roll your eyes at me.

After graduating high school last year I opted to go to a tech school instead of university like seemingly 99% of my old classmates. Unfortunately, this school is overwhelmingly male, and the average age is probably 5 years older than I am. There are a grand total of two girls in all of my classes. 

Whatever, just meet some girls outside of school right? Well my social circle is pretty small and none of us are the most outgoing people. Or at least the ones that are typically leave me out of their plans. Which is honestly fair, in high school I made no effort to make it appear I was interested in leaving my house. But anyways you aren’t going to find us hitting up bars or anything. 

So what can I try to meet someone? Tinder is the only thing that comes to mind, and a couple of my friends have (sort of?) got results through there. I’d rather it not come to that if possible. I don’t think any of my hobbies are particularly well suited to meeting new people either. Is it still socially acceptable to just approach a girl in like, the mall or something? Please say no, I do not want to have to do that.

So what am I missing? It can not be so hard for young guy and girl to meet each other even if I didnt go to university. My social skills aren’t the best but I can handle myself. I even briefly had a girlfriend once in high school so I don’t think I’m just completely repulsive. I’m just not even seeing any opportunities anywhere.",03Apr2018,1

Im still friends with 2 it's just we havnt seen each other in such a long time since he hangs out with his gf basically all the time. We still text just never hang out. 

Friend 1 and me are in multiple classes together while friend 2 is not. I have a other friend that hangs out with friend 1 and 2 that I like but it's just that hes been introduced to drugs and alcohol at the start of high school and was the one who introduces friend  1 and 2 to it. Great guy, just don't agree with his choices.

Me , my other friend and friend 1 and 2 always used to hang out. The reason I think in not invited to these things is because  I told them I don't want to have  alcohol or drugs when going over to these things (Im under 19). I believe thats what created me not being invited.  It's not like I wasn't invited to things at all before but now im just not being invited to anything. It just seems like whenever my friends hook up it always involves  drugs and alcohol.

I don't know what to do. My worst fear is losing all of my friends. I feel like the only reason me and friend 1 are still friends is because of the classes we have together.  Other than that, I feel like we will fall out of touch quickly which has happened before.

357,"So my girlfriend and I have been dating for a little over a year. We finally talked about moving in and she agreed. THat was maybe 6 months ago? Since then she’s changed her mind twice or so. Originally she was ecstatic and couldn’t wait. Some time after we get into a big fight and she says she can’t do it. About a month later she said she wasnt opposed to going and I talked to her about it. She said she needed to clear some things first at home financially. She calculated it and said around September of 2018 or sometime after she would be ready to move in. 

Today she was saying “Well I don’t know, I wanted to go to college, own my own place to call home, I wanted to find my dream job”. Her original reason after us fighting and she said no then was due to separation from family, job/job security, and financial issues. 

I told her she could go to college where I’m moving to, she would have her own place to call home with me, and I’d help her look for work that she would have a deep interest in. 

To me, and I do take into account her side and try to be understanding, she is backpedaling and or making excuses. I love her, I want us to be together,  I feel like we are too separate in our ways. She was mentioning “well maybe a year after you’ve arrived at your new place” but the thing is I’m only at this new place for two years. If she’s backpedaling now what’s stopping her from backpedaling then. I’m investing time into her because I see something in her. Once I leave (for sake of story) Place X (where I’m moving to) and if she still hasn’t moved in with me we are going to be in yet another extremely long distance relationship which nearly killed our relationship twice before due to her lack of communication and some issues on my end. I would feel like it’s just a big waste of time or like she’s just dragging me on to use me whenever is most convenient for her. 

She was also the one, and I concurred, that said us moving in would be time we got to spend with each other and learn about each other under a single roof which is so much different than just dating and casually seeing from time to time like we are now. But now she’s backpedaling. I’m not entirely sure what to do. We are still talking about it all at the moment but I figured I’d turn to Reddit to see what advice you guys would give.

I knew not to expect anything serious from her but it still felt bad, then right after she got the “fuck you” snap of him with another girl and so she asked to go eat with me and complain and even said she felt kinda bad bc she was basically using me..... but I still went even tho I did feel kinda used, I dunno why I did possibly a combination of low self esteem, loneliness, and just feeling lost and I’ve told myself that I’m gonna take a step back from trying to date bc this is one of many recent failed attempts and focus more on myself but a part of me still feels like I wanna still talk to her to see if it goes anywhere and if she talks to me I would cave.
