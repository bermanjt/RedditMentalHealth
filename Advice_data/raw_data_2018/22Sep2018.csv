1,"My life just feels so empty and everyone in it I don't feel an emotion towards. And it's just so hard to feel the need to keep trying because I have nothing that makes me want to keep trying. I don't know what to do. 

I know I have love and good feelings inside me but there's no one or thing I can do to put those emotions into. There's nothing I know of that draws these things out of me... I need some advice",22Sep2018,3
2,"Throwaway and also on advice but is this would be appropriate enough to fit on advice? If it isn’t I’ll put it somewhere else 

I [17F] see my grandma every Friday and we have lunch together with my mom (grandma doesn’t drive). My grandma has had issues with dementia for quite a while now, I’d say because of her old age. Usually my sister comes along, if she happens to drive home from her apartment. We eat, hang out, and talk, and either go to my grandma’s or my mom’s house and I am honestly close with my grandma and I admire her a lot.

But honestly it has been really hard for me to accept that my grandma is going to pass away soon (I know it’s like that for everyone). I think because she’s the first family member that I’m really close to that I’m going to experience passing away. Also that she’s seen everyone at their graduations except for me (I’m the youngest) and I don’t know if she’ll make it until then. She’ll forget a lot of things and asks me multiple times what grade I’m in, or where I go to school, and sometimes still thinks I’m in middle school. I suppress it in front of her and in front of my family and obviously I do understand because of her dementia but it really fucking sucks and hurts

Sometimes I just want to stay home. I love her so much honestly and would do anything for her but it’s just really painful to go out with her sometimes especially because I have to remind myself that one day she might not remember me or this could be our last lunch together. Yet today I wanted to stay home instead of visiting her briefly because I was tired but now I’m crying because I just feel so guilty and as if I just abandoned my grandma like that. 

However my sister is saying she’s disappointing in me and when my grandma passes away I’m going to regret this moment and that I’m victimizing myself. I don’t know if my sisters being a dick, or if I’m being a dick, or if we’re both dicks but I’m just really stuck and don’t know what to do and I just feel like shit. Anything helps idk :( thanks for reading ",22Sep2018,1
3,"Hey there, 

I posted a few days ago looking for rental and grocery resources. As if right now, my (soon to be ex) husband moved out and now I will be able to keep the apartment that we had together. So that covers my living situation. That said, when he left a couple of days ago he took EVERYTHING with him. And I do mean everything. He took the bed, tables, chairs, couch, TV, dishes, silverware, vacuum....everything, right down to all of the paper towels and toilet paper that I had stocked up in the pantry. He took it all. As I had said in the last post, I have a bone disease and pain disorder which forced me to leave my old job as I couldn't keep up physically. I begin paid training for a new job on the 28th but even then it will be a while before I have a paycheck coming in. So eventually when I am back on my feet I will be rebuilding from scratch and having to furnish my home. But for right now with very limited finances, my main concern is being able to buy groceries, pay for my medicines and getting a mattress/mattress pad as sleeping on the floor is killing my body. 

If anyone has any resources they recommend for groceries (I have already looked into a couple), it is much appreciated. Also if anyone has any recommendations on where to acquire any furniture or a mattress for dirt cheap, that is also very much appreciated. I am in Eastern Tennessee. Any advice is helpful. 

Thank you guys and thank you to everyone who had sent me previous recommendations. You've been super helpful.

7,"So basically I am a freshman this year in high school. I’m not a loner, I have friends in most of my classes and talk to people in others. In my gym/health class (right now it’s health until about October then it’s gym the rest of the year) I know literally NO ONE. Well, I know some people from my old school but they are all judgmental and fake people so they never talk to me. 

Anyhow, that usually isn’t a problem cause I like to branch out but everyone in that class are just sticking to their friends and act like assholes to me when I try to talk to them. I am basically a loner in that class and my teacher assigns partner work every damn class and I never have anyone to work with. 

To make it even worse the class is an odd number so she has to put me with people who are already in a group and they always act like they are annoyed I was out with them. I tried to get my schedule changed but I couldn’t and I’m literally miserable in that class. What do I do?",22Sep2018,1

12,"I don't know which one I want to stick with.

I work at an adult store and a Hilton hotel. I have no college degree and I love both jobs for different reasons.

The adult store is privately owned and the owner is amazing considerate and very flexible with her hours. She makes sure that we're all certified to be sex educators/informants and she pushes sexual/physical health and acceptance over pushing sales which is a big deal for me. She has offered to pay me more to get me to work for her full time and even offered me a manager position. And that could even lead to me owning the business later if the person meant to take over for her decides against inheriting it. They've won awards across North America and have a great relationship with some of the big names in the industry. And if I wanted to open my own ""branch"" out of state, I probably could with the owner's permission. (This is years ahead of now)

I love the hotel because 1) the benefits for traveling are amazing (I'm a cosplayer and love to go to different cons), the team is supportive and driven, and the possibility of possibly growing in a larger company is already looming over my head. Especially since a degree is not required at all hospitality based management positions. But it also leaves me able to move to lots of different locations if need be (I do wanna move out of Mississippi one day) but this also years in the future talk.

I'm so torn on which to choose since I love them so much. Any advice or good questions to think over would be appreciated. Please and thank you!

13,"Ok, so for a little bit of context here: I'm 17 years old and throughout my life I've only liked 3 or 4 girls, the last one being when I was like 14 or 15 years old. Nothing special to be honest. Just crushes I've had that have lasted for some weeks. Now, I've never liked the idea of having a girlfriend being this young because I always thought it was kind of pointless, so I've never been interested in a relationship, but this girl has me thinking otherwise for the first time.

I don't like being cheesy, but I swear I hadn't felt this way before. I could say I'm in love for the first time. Every time I look at her my heart starts beating a little faster than normal. I genuinely like this girl, like, she's so beautiful, smart and mature, and she's the first girl I picture myself with, honestly. We take the same classes together and I can't stop but starting at her sometimes. When I'm laying on my bed I can't stop thinking about her, and it's making me feel a little stressed, the fact that I can't talk to her. Because I know some of you guys may say ""Oh, if you're so interested in her then just talk to her lol"", but it's not so easy. She has this core of friends and she seems to always be with them so it's a little hard to try to get in when I have a core of friends of my own too. I make her laugh sometimes when I make a joke in class, so that's usually the highlight of my day.

Now, I don't really know what kind of advice I'm looking for because the normal thing to do is just say ""hi"", and I get it, but I can't seem to do it. I kind of wanted to let it out because I haven't told this to anyone and it's making me go crazy. I truly like this girl, and I don't want to mess anything up.

16,"There's this one kid at my high school, and recently he's become a borderline ""soundcloud rapper""- rapping about drugs, autotune to the max, etc. 

I commented on his newest song saying that he should rap about things that actually relate to him, and not say he's ""straight out the hood"" when he is in fact from a middle-class suburb.

After posting my criticism (which he welcomes so that he can improve), his friend posts something about me calling me a ""fat fuck"" (I'm 6'2 230ishlb) who ""never leaves his room for anything other than school"".

I messaged the friend and confronted him about what he said and he instantly backtracked on it and said he was ""being sarcastic"" (lol what?)

Our message transaction basically consisted of him calling me stupid, irrelevant (haha what) and talking shit to me all because I messaged him asking why he made the original post calling me a ""fat fuck"". 

Our messages ended with him implying that he wanted to fight me, and him saying he had a 4.16 GPA (which is a blatant lie).

At this point I'm cool with the ""soundcloud rapper"", but his friend really has me pissed off.

It's not even that I'm pissed at what he said, he's just so irritating and acts like he's hot shit and has a massive ego.

19,"Posting this from an alt account.

I just started college this past week and it has been amazing so far. I met a lot of new people, got to know some people on my floor, and even found a couple of girls who aren't repulsed by me. I finally feel socially confident and I feel great, but there is still one problem. I always want to hang out with my friends, but I know that I cannot do that 24/7. I feel like I am borderline stalking them, but its because I feel pretty depressed when I am alone. 

When I am not hanging out with them, I just lurk around Reddit and hang out in the lounge areas in the dorm. I feel alone and depressed when I am not with them, but my mood lightens up whenever I am with them. As an example, last night there was an activity where we could walk down a road lined with fraternities and sororities to get to know them better. I just wandered aimlessly for an hour feeling lonely and depressed. However, later that night I hung out with my friends in their dorm room and I felt happy again.

Am I being too clingy? Do I have to be around them 24/7 to be happy? I can't help but feel they don't want anything to do with me whenever they are with someone else or doing something else. What is wrong with me?

I had been travelling abroad for a while so my mom was taking care of him and when I got back I asked if I could have him back and she said no and took the dog with her, and now she is homeless with her husband living in their car with my dog and can't afford the dog's medicine or take care of him. I asked to have him for a night and as soon as I got him off her she followed me in the car and started banging on my windows and yelling and saying that I stole him from her. She waited outside my house staring through the blinds for about 3 hours refusing to leave. I don't want her to take him back because of the living conditions and the fact that he is legally my dog and I want him to be healthy and in a home. She's a pillhead and the husband is an alcoholic so they blow all their money on pills and alcohol and then are homeless and can't look after the dog properly. I'd let her stay here with my grandma but last time we let them stay here they took my grandma's bed (I live with my grandma) and made her sleep on the hard kitchen floor... she's 74.

24,"I moved in about a month ago with a stranger. Right before moving in, we had some issues over rent, which meant our relationship has gotten off to a rocky start. She loves to bake late at night (anywhere between 11pm and 1am) and early in the mornings (7-8am). However, I am a light sleeper and noises from the kitchen (spoons hitting bowls, trays hitting each other) wake me up. I recognize that a heavier sleeper probably wouldn't be bothered, but when I get woken up by these sounds, I get more irritated each time, and it is harder and harder to fall asleep. I asked her to be quiet last night at around 11:20 when she started baking, and then again at 7am today because she was baking again and I was awoken. She bakes several times a week, and I am pretty tired from being woken consistently. In the future, if she insists that she is being as quiet as she can, and I am still waking up, would it be reasonable to ask her to keep her baking between the hours of 9am and 11pm?

25,"I'm in a discord server with friends I've known for a few years, and whenever they talk to each other, I see how many interests and hobbies they share, which I usually don't. I've only played a few video games, but they've played VGs I've never even heard of. They share university majors (or classes) and sometimes I can't even bond over simple stuff like fashion (in the case of my female friends). I have plenty of thoughts to discuss, and I can joke around pretty easily. I just don't share almost any of their interests or hobbies, and I feel like that's integral to catalyze more intimate conversations. I freeze up whenever conversations move to a private setting because I don't know what to say. I don't know how to make people care about what I have to say either.

for the record, I do share some interests with them, and I've had a few good conversations concerning those shared interests, but there's still a lot that completely flies over my head. It was kinda similar at my last job. I liked my co-workers, but I found that most of our interests and hobbies didn't match up.

28,"Hi there!  
So this is kind of a weird thing.  I never really thought about it until this morning and I will get to why that is but my neighbors are kind of...weird and they do weird things, and kind of creepy things if you think about it.   
I live in an RV park and you get some characters here but these people, or at least the husband of the family and his brother, are by far the strangest?   
I live in a spot where my RV has a large yard that I use for my dog, and to my left the space is really far away so I don't REALLY have a neighbor on that side. To the right for the longest time, a family lived one space away from me. I have only really interacted with the mom and she's been megapolite. Sometimes one of their sons is with her but he doesn't talk a lot. And then they have the husband who I think I have talked to once, maybe twice, he is also a man of few words.  
Sometimes I would be working on my laptop or sitting on my bed and I would look out and see the husband standing in my yard? Not just in my yard like on the corner of my ""porch"" (I have this outdoor mat I have laid out which I joke in my porch), looking down. And I saw the son doing it once. It was always kind of ""What the hell?"" to me but I thought maybe their dog wondered over to my yard or something.  
There are also random times where I will be sitting here and something loud will bang on my door, like a rock, but when I go outside nothing is there, but I would swear to you I saw the husband standing right near my porch right before this happened once.  
Now last Friday, someone moved in RIGHT next to me in between this family and I. And this person was in their old trailer (they bought a new one recently). And I thought maybe it was the Wife's dad bc she mentioned he was going to stay with them and didn't think much of anything anyways. That evening I was laying in bed when I remembered I left Chinese food for dinner in the car and went out to go grab the bag and then just decided to eat it in the car and get a break from my dog and two cats. I am in my car, listening to MBMBAM podcast on my phone.   
Suddenly the door to the rv slams open and standing there is this guy who has a shaved head, pretty thin, and he starts like walking towards me in my car. Growing up in some pretty bad places and being homeless at one point has taught me to be pretty weary of people kind of power walking towards your car in the dark with no one around at 11 PM at night.  
I roll down my window a little bit so he can say whatever he needs to say and he introduces himself as the brother of the husband in the spot over.   
And I'm just like ""Oh cool, nice to meet you."" Then he mentions my tires flat ""And I'm like 'Yeah, I know, forgot to stop and air it up today, I'll do it tomorrow.'"" and he's like ""If you ever need any help with anything to do with your car, you can ask me. I am a mechanic for a living."" And I'm just like ""Oh thanks, I'll keep that in mind. Night.""  


The next few days I am going through a really intense depressive episode, just sleeping alot and not really getting up unless its to feed the pets. And I swear to your I heard my car door slam. I sometimes don't lock my car door bc I often lock my keys in my car, so I will leave one or two doors unlocked. I didn't go out to check, I figured I must have been hearing the neighbors car.   
Fast forward to today, my car has been having all kind of issues all week. And I'm like ""Obviously its the fuel filter, I need to change it."" So I have my dad come over this morning (bc he has more tools than me and I can always use an extra set of hands) and we open my hood and there are wires and tubes disconnected in my engine...and I didn't do that.  


I'm starting to feel just a little more than paranoid and really want to set up security cameras around my RV. The problem is, where I live I can only get internet service through my RV park and its 10 dollars PER device to hook up each month and I don't have a ton of money. Really I just want to get the hell out of this place. Does anyone have any advice on how to hook up cameras without wireless? Or how to magically pull money out of my ass to move away from these people? Thanks a lot.",22Sep2018,2
29,"Okay I know the title sounds like a r/thathappened  post but hear me out. So for background we are both in highschool so is his friend let's call French and let's call my brother German. So french and German are really good friend they've been friend since the beginning of highschool. German and I work at the same place so we know all the same people. It's a summer job and German and I meet 2 co workers who we find attractive we hang out all summer but now that school has started we dont see eachother but we do text. Around 3 weeks ago I get a text from my ex let's call Finland, he asks me out I say yes thing are going good no one knows. Then about 2 weeks ago my brother German asks the co worker out let's call her Sweden. Also German and I are very friendly with the opposite sex I have alot of guy friend and he has alot of female friends people always think we are dating our friends. 

Okay now on to the real story. so I have a class with french he sits next to me and we are friendly but not really friends. One dad french asks me if I know about the ""coworker"" he didnt say her name he just called her the coworker and I ask him which one and french says the one German is dating. I laugh it off and say they are just friends. French then tells me he has the screen shots but he won't let me see them he also makes it very clear I cant tell German that he told me. Now I'm interested an I knew if it was true and I asked German about it he wouldn't talk to french again, and I can't ask Sweden because she is on a 5 week vacation with out her phone. But I just go on with my life. 
Then Tell Finland about but I tell him we cant ask him about it or else German would hate French. Finland tells me I have to ask German about this or else he would punch me. So I asked German about it he says maybe and so then I pressure him into telling me the truth (am I proud of that, no but I don't want to get punched)  
So the next day German asked who told me, I told him I figured it out on my own. He didnt believe me and assumed it was one of my friends let's call amarica. But German didnt know that I hadn't talked to amarica for 3 weeks because Finland thought we would run off together. 
So later german convinced me to tell him who it was. I told him it was France and German acted like he was fine with it. 
So this morning I get a text from Finland asking me for nude and asking me some not appropriate questions I got fed up and broke up with him then and there I was sad but I realized he wasn't treating me right. So today i sat next to amarica instead of french. I felt pretty sad and paranoid but aside from that I thought  everything for the most part was going great. Till the end of the day amarica told me she didnt want to hang out right now and my 2 other friends were no where to be found so I went to German and tried to hang out with him because he was all alone and not with french.
I go up to German and with out saying anything he drags me to France and his friends then leaves. Then France tells me German hasn't talked to him except to tell him that he knew he told me. French was very upset (as he should be) I repeatedly apologize and was almost in tears but I didnt want to cry in front of him because I didn't want it to look like I wanted pity. So I walk away but German pulls me back not knowing what happened this morning and German tells me that I need to face this problem and I cant just run away from it. I couldn't tell German that I was about to cry becasue then German would be more mad at french.  So I just awkwardly stood there for 5 minutes getting told I messed up. I had never had someone that angry at my and I didnt know what to do so I offered them 5 dollars as an apology gift, but that made them more mad. Then I got on the bus and went home. I've yet to talk to German about this becasue hes mad at me

TL;DR my brothers dating a coworker his best friend told me my brother found out and they are both mad at me.

So now I have a lie that will most likely work but if it doesn't German will 100% never talk to french and they would both probably want to kill me. But if it works everyone would for give eachother and we will be happy.
So what I could say to germanis that ""I found was talking to french and he asked if I knew Sweden. I told him I did then asked why he asked then he said dont worry about it. Then I asked if German and Sweden were dating (Sweden came to my birthday party and she was dropping some major hints) then I asked German if they were dating. I think this should all work but I'm not sure if the risk is worth the reward.

I have liked him for like 3 years and its odd because I have never talked to him, but his personality is just what I like about him, and he is just different from the guys in my school. He is calm, quiet, and talks too few people, but you'll mostly see him by himself listening to music. I don't know i just like him i first saw him in the cafeteria and I was standing at the back of him, and he just push his hair back with his hands and i just staring and my heart was beating. Anytime i see him in the hallway my heart beats, and i just put my head down anytime when he looks at my direction. Anytime he doesn't turn at my direction, i always smile and i just lose focus and i remember this morning i suppose to go to my class, but i saw him walking somewhere else so i followed that direction (now that i think of it i am weird) but i just wanted to see him because I did not see him yesterday and just seeing him makes me happy even though he does not know how I feel or haven't spoken to me i really like him and i am always happy when I see him i just smile and I am obviously not attractive and i am a very shy person so talking to him it is a no so even though he does not know how i feel I hope he will find someone better or whatever so I do not regret liking him because he  has made me so happy and i hate school so much so after a bad day just seeing him makes me smile it is so weird I bumped into someone today because of that.

34,"So I'm 15 and got my learners in April. I have only driven a handful of times, and every time I have it was on wide roads. I drove fine and I thought I was getting better. I even parked well and everything seemed to be going perfectly. I didn't mess up at all. Today was my first time driving on a small backroad. I was with my grandma. At first it was okay. Then I was looking in the rear view mirror for a little too long and went over the white line and nearly ran off the road. I guess I underestimated the road size. That scared the shit out of me, but it wasn't that bad. Just a little scary is all. I made sure to watch more carefully. I was driving okay, then a stop sign was ahead. I could turn left or right, and I needed to turn right. As I approached, I pressed the brakes, obviously. The car slowed down, but didn't stop. It was still going relatively fast. I pressed them almost all the way down, and it STILL didn't stop. She was yelling at me and I kept saying ""IT WON'T STOP. IT WON'T STOP."" I freaked out and just turned right and pulled into a parking lot of this little church. I got SO lucky no one was coming. She eventually got it into park and it stopped. I got out of the car and realized I had my fucking foot on the gas too. I know, I know. Call me stupid, whatever. I know already. I didn't even realize it. I almost killed both of us because I was too fucking idiotic to realize I had my right foot pressing the gas. I thought it was just resting on the pedal, but apparently it wasn't. I didn't even think about it. I couldn't bring myself to tell her, so I just kept saying that I didn't know what happened or why it wouldn't stop. It has been many hours since it happened and I can't get it off my mind. I don't know if I'll ever be able to drive again. it scared me SO bad. I've felt like I could cry all day. Has anyone else does anything as stupid as this? How can I calm myself or ever bring myself to drive again? I wasn't fucking around with the radio or anything either.

I was starting to like her, and kind of still do right now, but now I don't want to anymore because all of her friends have told me she's not into girls so I know she can't return my feelings.

I'm not like SUPER into her or anything, but it is to the point where it would be hard for me to turn back. I mean I could try avoiding her but that would probably be a red flag for her because we would always hug when we see each other in class and she would be all around happy to see me as I would to see her. I want to still be friends with her, because she seems like a really great and genuine person but I feel like if I keep talking to her I will just catch more feelings and dig myself into a deep hole.

It happens specifically in the crease on the bottom of my foot nearest the toes. I’ve looked up athletes foot and similar and tried foot fungus cream but it didn’t help. It seems to happen mostly in the evening or at night, and it feels like it’s itching inside of my foot under the skin more than just on the skin. It also feels so much better if someone else itches it instead of me (this is particularly annoying to my boyfriend lol). It requires lots of itching to get relief. I’m getting so sick of it.

I live in a small town (55 people) and 7 miles away is a ""bigger town"" per say, (about 10,000 people would be my guess maybe a bit less) my small little town has no job opportunities as it is so small. And I have really no reliable way of getting to the other town where I could geta job, uber is not available in my area, taxis are but the cost is so much that id be losing more money then I'd be making. I can't get rides from friends as they all live out in the country and have their own needs to attend to. My dad won't give me rides. And I have no other family near enough to ask them for rides. So I guess I'm just wondering if there is ANY way to get transportation to a job, or a job that I could somehow get online to make a little bit of money. I can't stay after school and work because the school that I go to is another 7 miles away (to put this in perspective my small town is in the middle along a highway, one way leads to the bigger town and the other way leads to the town where I go to school) and that town is small as well so there arent job opportunities there either.

40,"Hey all, looking for advice. I am a 32 year old in my final semester as a junior in college. I have been heavily considering leaving my retail job. I have been at this job for over 3 years while in college and as a STEM student, my job is relevant (fixing computers) to my degree, but I feel like as I am getting into my final semesters, that its becoming more of a hindrance than anything.

I would love the free time to focus on school, and I live with my fiance who covers most of the bills. I have done the math and am able to take out additional school loans if needed. While not ideal as I'd of course have to pay them back, it would at most be for 2 semesters.

Aside from just generally disliking the retail environment, having more free time would not only allow me to focus on classes and studying more, but I can also work on coding projects to teach myself cool stuff and even put projects on my resume.

I have over a decade of work history, including a great and relevant internship opportunity, so I feel like being called out on lack experience is a non-issue. Just mostly looking for others thoughts before I do something potentially scary like becoming willingly unemployed.

42,"Hi All.
Very confused, angry,  non confrontational person here.
I follow a very popular sport in my country (details are irrelevant) and tickets are very hard to come by and very $$$. Out of all my friends and family I am the only one who is willing to pay for the high level membership to get access to tickets to the final. I follow one of the more successful teams however we got knocked out of the play offs yesterday but I still get 2 tickets to the final next week because of my membership level. 
But last night at the game where I watched my team lose (I’m sports obsessed and all my mates know it) I get a message from someone I know (I’ve known him a while but I wouldn’t exactly call us close friends) before the game has even finished and he says “hey mate, I know this is insensitive and bad timing but I’m just getting in early, can I have your tickets for next weeks game? You don’t support either team in it (neither does he btw) and I want to take a mate and surprise him with the ticket”

To be honest I was super pissed and let him know that if he felt it was insensitive and bad timing then why the hell did he message me right when I’m devastated by my teams loss????

His reply was this:
“Stop playing the victim and trying to crucify me for wanting tickets. I won’t bow down at your feet” 

I’m at a loss on how to handle this.  I’m normally a peacemaker and try to bring people together but this guys attitude is fucked up and I want to show him how much of a dick he is. 
How should I deal with this?",22Sep2018,1
43,"Hey guys, this is a throwaway account. My boss knows my actual handle. 

I work at a PT job that is very tedious and mentally demanding. I honestly don’t get paid enough to handle with it. I work a FT job which I absolutely love; I got this PT job for an excuse to get out of the house and make some extra cash. 

Since I’ve been working there, I have been cussed out by fellow coworkers in front of customers. I reported it immediately to my boss and she just “talked to them”. She was upset it happened, but continued to schedule me with this guy. He literally called me a fucking dumbshit to my face in front of a customer. It left me in tears and I was in shock. My husband told me to quit then and there, and was so mad at that guy. I decided not to, and felt it was a one-off situation. I wanted to give my boss a fair chance to fix it. 

The shift a week after that ANOTHER male coworker cussed me out again in front of customers, to which the customers (high school student aged) laughed and mocked me. I started crying which led the coworker to yell at me even further for “causing a scene”. It took everything in me not to walk out that night. Then the other coworker I closed with came in and she started commanding me to do things and then judged my work and made passive aggressive comments to me all night. I started months before she did and actually was one of the people to train her when she started. 

On top of all this, my boss never answers her phone and always schedules me when I specifically ask her NOT to. When I ask for someone to cover my shift, no one volunteers but I’m the first to volunteer myself for other people. 

Weeks later I just couldn’t deal with the stress and gave my boss a 2-week notice. She forced me to do it by text message, because she didn’t feel like meeting me in person and didn’t want to talk on the phone. I sent her a paragraph explaining why and all she literally replied with was “cool dude, ok.”

She of course, scheduled me this Sunday (knowing it’s my only day off and that I have already asked to not work Sundays) with one of the guys that berated me and one of the only other girls that was actually nice to me. My husband and cousin told me I shouldn’t go in but then I would feel bad for the coworkers if I didn’t. This is my last shift with them and I truly don’t want to go in at all. It’s during our rush hour(s) and I don’t want to get yelled at again by the same coworker or have to stress my ass out getting orders out in time, especially on my last shift. 

My question for advice is; if it were you, how would you handle it? Would you go in to the shift and work it and leave to be done with the place? Or would you not show up and ignore them? I would feel bad doing that especially because they’ll be busy and I would honestly feel bad for the one coworker I like. 

Any advice or feedback helps! 

TL;DR: verbally abused at job I don’t need. Boss scheduled me on a day I specifically asked not to be scheduled on and no one will cover it. Wondering if it’s worth to go in even if it’s my last shift there. Need advice on if I should go in or skip it? ",22Sep2018,1

54,"So I'm turning 21 on Tuesday. Cool, whatever, just a number to me. But I really need to figure out my life. I'm just in a really confusing part of my life and I just dont know what to do. Let me explain.

I dropped out of college... so what you might say? ""Two months in"" is my response. Why? I just felt like it wasn't for me. However, I'm a smart kid: i was an honors student throughout highschool and excelled in maths and chemistry. 

I have or had a job, I'm not really sure right now. Its a town parks job, cutting lawns and maintenance projects around the park. Nothing special, 11 an hour. That stuff is usally just for the summer, but, I got asked to worked (not offered, explaining) year round part time so I said sure. After Labor day, i have to take a week or two off and I'll get a call when I should start. My regional supervisor is telling me that they've been ignoring him and hold it back and holding it back, so that's great. 

But even if I take that job again, which I will, its nothing special. Its very brainless, very simple. You wont believe the type of people that get paid more than me when I feel like i should get paid more. I actually had two jobs, the other at a local supermarket, but i quit half a year ago for that reason. I demanded a raise or two weeks notice one day, because the store manager new the kind of guy i was, he even said ""I can't lose you."" But he didn't give me a raise so i jumped ship.

Parts of me have wanted to go back to college. Coming out of high school, I wanted to be a math teacher. There were times in high school where i was helping out friends in study halls, helping out my younger sister and the way i explained better than some teachers methods i could become one. But in college, i just didnt see the point in going after weeks. Just sitting in the classroom one day and was just like ""Why am i here? Whats the point? Is this what I want to do?"" 

I don't really want to do this town job. First of all these past two weeks waiting for a phone has been throwing my morale down a drain. I busted my ass off all summer and impressed one of my superiors enough just for nothing is what it feels like. I did part time year round there a few years ago before layoffs and winters can get verrry boring.

I've been holding off on this post for a long time. On easter at a family party someone asked me what do you do now? ""I work at a local supermarket and during the summer I cut lawns"" while my other cousins are in college getting internships becoming something. That hit me, thinking to myself ""Wow just realized how much my life sucks now.""  I just don't know where to go right now. The thing about college was i was at a university, and I would really rather not go to my community college.

And another thing that kind of contributes to this is that during high school, I was mostly guided along and directed, go to school, go to each class, learn, get good grades. After High school, it was just all choice now, pick what job i want, going there is a choice, I wasnt forced to go to class in college, so I guess I just lost my path, given too much freedom now.

If anyone has anything helpful to say, please do so. In case anyone else is wondering these few things:
•About 10k in savings, I do drive. I've very rarely drink or smoke
•I do play video games often, its really been my fallback as of late.
•I would rather ask a random person on the internet (with hopefully good words of advice) rather than family or friends because I don't want them to have this thought of me on them or make me a concern.
•No, no thoughts of suicide, I still think there's a bright side coming, theres plenty of friends and family that still adore me and want me to do better as well. I just dont know when the light begins to shine.

Ever since I was a young child, I’ve always been very shy. I’ve always been seemingly “cold” and distant, and hard to read. But underneath all this, I’m the softest person ever. I love animals and memes just as much as the next guy. I get attached easily and love too much. Currently I’m a high school student. Recently I’ve been noticing that I’ve been presenting my insides more outwardly, and I hate it. As the head of my school theatre’s cosmetic department, I’m required to be friendly and sociable. It’s taken over. With every smile and overly friendly interaction I can hear something screaming at me in the back of my mind. I lay awake at night reviewing the day’s events and I’m disgusted with the interactions. Of course, I’m not actually an asshole, I’m actually quite sensitive. But there’s nothing I hate more than overly friendly people and I’ve become just that. I feel like I’m false advertising and people would be disappointed with my resting bitch face, dry humor, and distant but observant behavior.

     I often make comments about how I drink every night and I should probably slow down and he’ll say things like “I support it man, wish I could drink as much as you do.” And I know he knows I think it’s a problem. I just think he likes me because I’m more fun when intoxicated. 
    My girlfriend is even worse. She buys me alcohol without asking. Tells me to drink at work when we work together because she ‘won’t tell’. And even says things like “You’re so nice to me when you’ve been drinking.” Even after I told her I had a problem and wanted to quit. 
    I’m sick of feeling like shit. I’m sick of drinking. I’ve tried to quit multiple times but can’t get past the withdrawals. I’ve gone to r/stopdrinking for support multiple times. 
    I guess I’m just sad that my closest people support me basically being an alcoholic because they don’t like me as much when I’m sober. I don’t think they realize how much it’s hurting my body but either way I wish I had someone who realized I need help.

Long story short after a bit of arguing he went on Facebook and posted 'It sucks when you realize your true friends aren't really your friends.'. Some of his 'other' friends started to agree. WTF!?

78,"Hi, my best friend and I were best friends for about 8 years. She was so kind, really sweet, one of those really good hearted people and super close to all of her family. About four years ago, I left our religion and we stopped getting in touch. Two years later, added each other on Facebook again, then one day I noticed she was just gone. Our relationship really wasn't close at that point. About a month ago, I get this voicemail from her stating she really needed my help. I call her back, she's talking super fast, stating she found out she has breast cancer, stage 3, overdrew her account and was wondering if I could help her. I'm currently unemployed and felt bad so I offered to create a GoFundMe for her. She said she'd have to think about it. I felt like there was something off and was put off by her asking for me, but hey, it's cancer, I get it. Expensive as hell. Three weeks later....  


1. Someone who knows her well let me know she accepted money from a relative for a job, never showed up, and was taken to court for it.
2. She admitted to going to rehab a year back for pills. 
3. She blocked everyone around 2 years back including family, but now is asking a ton of people for money, without telling the other people.
4. She is telling people her hair is falling out from chemo...it literally looks like she shaved her head and in fact in recent photos it looks like it's growing back....in the middle of chemo.
5. She's asking at least 4 different groups of people for money (Church, former roommates, former friends, strangers)
6. Refuses to provide proof for anyone that asks (because the whole thing sounds so fishy that no one believes her).
7. Without actually knowing, (but it was), called me up, chewed me out for not being like Jesus Christ, told me to go to hell if I'm spreading rumors about her not having cancer, because another friend that I warned told her straight up that it sounded like she didn't have cancer. She told both of us to go to hell.   


Now it sounds like she might try to ask her former high school classmates for money. I have no idea what to do. At this point, I'm well outside who she's talking to and with her past and crazy nature, I don't want to get involved but at the same time, I don't want innocent people to fall for this. I told her, if she has cancer, provide proof, otherwise accept that people might not believe you because of how you are behaving. She chose to tell me to go to hell again. Any advice would be great.

85,"Just to give a little background, I was raised in a middle-class Christian family. I would describe the environment as riding the borderline between simply toxic and actually abusive. I needed counseling as a young adult to move past the intense anger I harbored for my parents (particularly my mother) because of their manipulative, narcissistic behavior. I'm happy to say that despite all that, I've moved on to create a pleasant little life for myself as an adult, but I've noticed that in doing so, many of the choices I've made starkly contrast the life I grew up in. 

For example, I chose to move out and live on campus during college (against my parents wishes and despite needing to work two jobs to pay for it). I chose to leave the state after graduation. I chose to move in with my boyfriend, educate myself about my sexual health (Lord knows the adults in my life didn't) and become sexually active (all big no-nos growing up). I adopted two dogs, both of whom live indoors (the most I had growing up was a mostly self-sufficient outdoor cat). I shed the religion I was raised in (and I guess I now identify as agnostic). And finally, I donated most of my possessions, embraced minimalism and the nomadic lifestyle and moved into an RV. I'm currently working as a remote tutor and editor (kind of using my Master's degree I guess, but definitely not doing what I was supposed to do). 

Tonight, I had the first truly toxic argument I've had with my parents in years. Thanks to strategic separation and avoidance of certain topics (mostly what is listed above), the relationship with my family has grown to what I would describe as a ""pleasant tolerance"" over the years. Like we can be around each other and enjoy ""family time"" without getting in too deep and being reminded that we are actually fundamentally dysfuntional. That's our norm, and it's good enough. 

But I adopted my second dog, a puppy, about a month ago and brought her home for the first time this weekend. She's three months old and (understandably) nervous about the whole situation. When my dad asked me to put her inside her kennel, in the outdoor shop for the night, I protested. She'd be terrified and cry all night if I left her out there. Dad called her ""filthy"" and it came to light that he never really wanted any of my animals in his house. This came as a shock since he gave permission for me to bring her and had spent most of the afternoon on the floor playing with her (to say nothing of the past year loving on my older dog when he visited). 

It turned into an ordeal, and I found myself reflecting on the deep plunge into profound unhappiness I experienced remembering what it was like to grow up in this house, with so many of the things I cared about being out if my reach. It made me deeply homesick, in two weird ways. First, it made me want to go home to my boyfriend and other dog and trailer, where I feel at peace. And two...that old but still painful realization that I will never have a parental home in which I feel safe and wholly accepted. 

 I'm not even sure this is the right sub to post this in, but it's not really a fresh, still raw kind of pain. More of an old scar. I guess I'm wondering if anyone now older than me (24) has experienced this. How did it play out? ",22Sep2018,1
86,"I posted on r/offmychest about 3 months ago about a situation I was dealing with at the time. I won’t post that full text here, but please feel free to read it for additional context. In summary, my friend (Jana) was friends and played games with someone online (Pam) for about 2 years. Pam became possessive and Jana ended the friendship. Pam became *obsessive* and contacted Jana incessantly, causing Jana to fear for her own safety. I contacted Pam to tell her we’d call the police if she didn’t stop. Pam attempted suicide and her family blamed me.

After that, Pams family asked Jana what all had happened. Apparently Pam was insulted and bullied by other users in their game, but Jana never knew the extent of this bullying. Pam was also previously abused by an ex boyfriend, which Jana did know. Jana explained what little she knew and asked to be left alone.

Pam and her family and friends have not left us alone for the past three months. Pam feels like a monster for contacting Jana against her wishes but continued to do so. Pam has attempted suicide multiple additional times both because she feels like a monster and because she’s convinced the bullies are still out to get her. 

The family keeps asking for more and more. They wanted Jana and Pam to remain friends. We said no. They wanted Jana to forgive Pam. She did. They wanted Jana to give Pam her old user names from the game. She did. Now they want Jana to give Pam her (Jana’s) gaming accounts because of the memories they contain for Pam. Jana has been withdrawn; she does not feel like herself. She doesn’t sleep well and has her own panic attacks because she feels haunted by Pam and her family and fears they will never leave her in peace. 

Pam is currently in hospital after another suicide attempt, and they say she is hysterical and still wants do die - and that she is actually dying - because she doesn’t have the memories on Jana’s accounts and because she is convinced the bullies are gossiping about her.

What do we do here? I feel that we have already met so many of their requests and that they have not respected our one request. Are we monsters if we do not give Pam the accounts? What if she does because of this? Objectively, would it even actually be good for her to have those accounts? Or would she become obsessed with something that no longer exists and not move on? What if we give the accounts and we are still never left alone?

89,"First off,  I'm completely financially dependent on my parents till at least another year while I get my degree. I live at home. I've been looking into part time jobs but haven't had any luck so far. A starting level salary in my field won't be enough to move out but that's going to be my first goal. My parents will not let me get a service job. My financial dependence is my biggest problem right now.

My parents believe that they are in charge of everything in my life. What I wear to when I eat gets commented upon. If I wake up later than 8:30 AM on a Saturday morning because I've been studying late at night, I am subject to taunts and passive aggressive digs.
I've generally gone along with everything, from my career choice to clothes and when I do exactly what is expected of me, they're the nicest people on the planet.

If I refuse to comply, I am told I am an ungrateful child who is only leeching off them for their money.

My mother has a multitude of health problems and her idea of healthy conversation is her ranting on and on all day. Recently I've asked her to talk nicer to me and since then neither of my parents have spoken to me directly,  preferring to speak amongst themselves in the vein of ""that girl...."" every time I step in the room.

My father is a functional alcoholic who is extremely stressed out financially. He is the sole breadwinner of the family.
This makes him very irritable, with me especially since I had an expensive phone stolen from me. ( I have made it very clear that I don't expect a new phone from him at all)

Our financial issues have not resulted in a cut down in ordering food in on a whim ( four times a week) or donating massively to religious causes. In the last five years, my father has built a second home. This house is his lifelong dream and I appreciate it. It has also massively eaten away at all of his savings, to the point where he's in debt.
It sits empty 11 months of the year. It is not in an area that will appreciate in cost over the years. 

We also live in an expensive city. Moving is not an option.

Both of them are deeply religious and are also currently extremely pissed at me for missing one religious  event.

I've recently become sexually active, which they're unaware of ( They do not approve of dating). I've always used a condom. I haven't got my period this month. The test says negative but it's still terrifying me. A suspected pregnancy would probably result in locking me up forever or just loss of any semblance of freedom. 

If I am pregnant, I'm going to get an abortion without their knowledge, absolutely. 
I'm just extremely stressed out and guilt stricken at the moment. 

My parents have done a lot for me to provide opportunities that they didn't have. When things are good, they're really good with them. I still can't get myself to give up all control over my life to them.

I'm unsure what to do right now.
I am so very tired of this.

Since then I go back to school and it gets worse because I have not been able to focus on my work alone or in class. I have been walking forever.

I’m guessing I made the wrong medication switch. They put me back on the old MEDS on top of the new ones but with a better brand recently.

I’m currently 17, almost 18, senior in high school, and as long as I could remember, at least in my entirety of being a teenager, I’m alone for the most part. Sometimes I choose do things alone, other times no ones free, or I just didn’t bother to hit anyone up in general. I have friends, I have a group that I hang out with from school, and I have another group that I’ve known since childhood. The group that I’ve known from childhood is falling apart, probably not to them, but definitely to me, no one really hits each other up to do stuff. The group from school is cool, but since senior year started, it seems like there’s a divide in the group, and it’s like I’m not as close to some of my close friends in the group as I once was, and i feel like they don’t really even think about it. No one really hits me up just in general, I have maybe one friend who texts me from time to time just to see what’s going on, but most times he just likes to meet up with me to smoke.

But I think if I say that I had a crush and don't have anymore she will treat me differently. What should I do? Should I tell her or should I keep it to me?",22Sep2018,1

103,"Long post, pardon my rant in advance. Before this May, I had been best friends with a girl, let's call her M, for two or three years. At first we meshed very well - both young, met at our first semi full time jobs, and were both a bit troubled ( my mother passed and I was having a hard time with being depressed and she understood bc she was too, etc). We seemed to get each other like no one else did. Of course as the years passed, I began to grow - got help for my depression, traveled and found myself, learned to drive, got married, and she just...didn't. She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had told me once what her manic episodes were like so when she began acting erratically  I automatically knew what it was.

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm an angel of the Lord"" she informed me one night. All I could do was stare mutely. She then went on to talk about how she had ""wings""  and could kill demons and Lucifer was influencing her and everyone she had romantic feelings for was astrally projecting and appearing to her, telling her they loved her. I hate to admit this, but I need to: I didn't say a damn thing. I go on, letting her think that I believed her, until her boyfriend at the time told her that if she didn't go into the hospital for help he couldn't be with her anymore. She asked me what I thought and I came clean: yes, she did need to go because what she was seeing were delusions and not healthy. Throughout her stay we talked on the phone and after she got out, things were better to a point. But then it started again: not only was she an angel, now she was a ""holy grail"", a mystical being who shared the same bloodline as Jesus and who would eventually become the second Messiah. This time I did not let her think I believed her, but I still tried to be there. Mostly I just listened. It got increasingly hard to be there because she had the nasty habit of monopolizing conversations, throwing tantrums, going off on people and not caring, and being willing to break up and marriage or family to get the man she wanted. Everyone that looked at her was in love with her.

&amp;#x200B;

Last fall, she finally formally filed charges against her rapist and I went to the station with her, held her hand, and was with her every day for three weeks, my own life and schedule be damned. Every time she did something inconsiderate - like calling me 13 times in one day and then getting upset when I told her she couldn't come over because it was date night for my husband and I. The last straw was when she pretended to possessed by her rapist, claiming she still loved him. We BOTH KNEW she was lying but she kept it up and even got racial with it. That's when I hit the roof:  I went off on her, yelled for her to take me back to my car, and did not see her for weeks. When she messaged me asking about it I told her I couldn't be her friend anymore because I wanted to love her again, but right now I didn't, and that she needed help and shouldn't act like an overgrown child. Cut her off completely.

Recently I saw her in my ""people you may know"" on FB and did a bit of lurking: she looked well, seemed like she'd matured, and to be honest, I missed her. When things were good with us, they were really good, but when the episodes and delusions got in the way it was a different story. Long story short I reached out and sent her a message saying I hoped that she was alright and that I was sorry for hurting her feelings/abandoning her when she really needed help because I couldn't take it - I had been going through my own stuff then and I couldn't shoulder the burden of hers. So we began talking again and she apologized too and we agreed to try and mend things. 

&amp;#x200B;

Monday I went to where she was living - her dad had kicked her out and...how to put this delicately? It was a total shit hole. It was this fleabag motel in the middle of nowhere that I was afraid to park my car outside of her. Her so called new best friends were the epitome of the word ""junkie"". The girl was sober for the most part when I came in but the guy was so stoned on weed and pills that he handed me his bowl by mistake instead of shaking my hand like a regular person. I smoke weed too, on occasion, but my mother's pill addiction helped contribute to her demise and I could tell by their slurring and eventual nodding that they were addicts too. In the course of the two hours I was there, I watched them both nod off with lit cigarettes in their hands. I pulled M aside and told her ""you need to be careful with these two. They're major pill heads. I know, my mom was, and they could pass out with lit cigarettes and burn the motel room down"". On top of that, the two of them had both recently lost their jobs, and for some reason my friend also just stopped going to work. On a job she'd had for years and that accommodated her off days and that went above and beyond to help her out. Just...quit going. So now none of them have jobs. She's dropped a ton of weight so quickly that people have asked her more than once if she was doing drugs too. She swears she isn't. She also has started using dating apps and will fuck anything that looks her way. Now, I am far from being a prude - I had my share of fun too and met my husband on a dating app also - but it's too much. She's having copious amounts of unprotected sex and letting strangers spend the night, hanging out everywhere in the middle of the night till one of them can pick her up...and it's just not like her. It's not normal. It's scary and I love her and I don't want anything to happen to her.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the novel, it's just that...I know if I tell her she's spiraling and she needs to get her shit together she'll get super pissed, and if I tell her her so called best friends are junkies who are more into drugs and each other than they care about what happens to her and she needs to drop them and never look back, I will be labeled ""jealous"". I have told her they definitely did more than just smoke weed and to look out, but what else can I do? It's not my responsibility to take care of her and that resentment from trying ruined things for us last time. So what do I do? Back off? Be honest at the risk of losing my friend again?

I’m 19 years old, my parents are divorced. My dad is a really great guy, he has a good income, he’s always given me what I need and he’s supplied me with a car, phone + offered to pay for my college. I love my dad, but we’re pretty different and I feel like it’s difficult to be myself around him. And he has a few rules that I really don’t like. I want independence in all aspects of my life, even financially. 

I’d love to just come out and say “hey dad I love you but I’m gonna move in with mom or some friends” But I feel like I would lose my dad and the resources he kindly offers. I’d basically be on my own, broke with no car and (right now sadly) no job. 

I don’t feel like he would support my decision or me because he doesn’t approve of my mom much. And I’d hate to upset him or emotionally wound him by saying i don’t wanna live with him. 

So what should I do? My heart is telling me to pursue my independence, but I’d at the very least lose the opportunity to go to college, maybe my car/phone, but at the very most lose my dads support and stuff.

For the past two weeks I’ve had a worsening “rash”. Finally went to the doctor and she said it was mosquito bites...it’s definitely not. Though the rash looks like bug bites, I’m never outside enough to sustain this many mosquito bites.

So I’m thinking I have bed bugs. I’m living in a dorm at my university right now. None of my other roommates have any bug bites but I’m not convinced that means I don’t have them. I wake up feeling like bugs are biting me. 

I guess my question is general- what should I do? I’m in a dorm so I can’t really just fumigate the room or something. The doctor wouldn’t even entertain the idea that it wasn’t mosquito bites. My school is a little ratchet so I wouldn’t be surprised if the mattress had bed bugs kind of just in it. Idk what to do.",22Sep2018,2

108," Just based on the title you can probably guess the general idea of what my views are. 

 The problem is, I never get a chance to actually talk with anyone about them. They're just opinions I've formed over the years from experience and just thinking about things. The more people try to censor me or refuse to talk it just cements it even more, because think about it logically, if I was wrong, wouldn't it be much more efficient to shut me down publicly so everyone could see how wrong I am, than just ignoring the idea?

 ""If you rip out a mans tongue, you are simply proving you fear what he might say"".

 The most discussion I've gotten is ""you're just a hateful person"", which isn't true at all, I'm actually very nice IRL and do my best to help people. (obviously can't prove that here, you'll just have to take my word for it). 

 So that's basically it, I'm just looking for conversation.

109,"TLDR: my brother doesn't take care of his pet leopard gecko, I asked to move her to my room, mom immediately shut me down. 

My brother has an older leopard gecko (approx. 15 years old or so, we got her from one of my dad's coworkers about 3 years ago) and I've been trying to setup a more appropriate enclosure for her. My brother doesn't really do much of anything with her, so I've taken to most of her care. She was kept on paper towels for most of her life but recently my parents put her onto crushed walnut shells. I know that can lead to impaction so I've started feeding her outside her enclosure, especially after I noticed how bad she seemed to be at catching a cricket or even a dubia roach. She's also in a tall 20 gallon tank that I would like to switch with the 20 long in the basement if not something a bit bigger and front-opening. She's under a red heat bulb 24/7 which I've thought about putting on a timer myself, but my brother has a window AC unit so it's practically sub-arctic in there by morning and I worry about her getting too cold. Frankly, it pisses me off. My mom and I got into an an argument just this afternoon after I asked to move her onto a spare shelf I have in my room along with my other reptiles. She says it's unnecessary because I'm already taking care of her while she's in his room, so why would I want her in mine. Honestly, my brother seems to be the only one who *isn't* taking care of her. Just a week or so ago the tank was full of poop and skin and her water dish was dry as a bone. To be honest, I'm heavily considering just stopping everything I've been doing with her. I've been buying her crickets (I have a small dubia colony, but my brother says it's too much work to feed her dubias) and her lights because my brother is too lazy to just drive ten minutes to pick some up. I don't want to just abandon her to my brother, but I feel like it's the only way to get it through my mom and brothers head that I'm the only one who really takes care of her. My dad says he's on my side, which I appreciate, but didn't have my back earlier when my mom and I were arguing. I want to move her because I am her main caretaker and I can easily forget to feed her because I don't see her after, especially as my brother keeps his door closed almost constantly. My mom is also covering his ass saying that he ""doesn't have the time"" to take care of her properly (maximum 2-3 minutes a day) which IMO means he shouldn't even have her. To my mom I guess that means that I should just keep doing all the work to take care of my brothers pet without even a thank you or my brother paying me a dollar or two a week for the nasty crickets (they stink and I hate them) that I buy for her. I worry that my brothers negligence will kill her.

119,Alright so I used to live in Florida. I went to college there and in one of my classes the professors made us talk to the person next to us and get to know each other and talk about the person to the class. Then the professor said get your buddy’s number so that way if you miss class you can text him or her. I didn’t talk to her that much since I have a girlfriend and I didn’t want the impression that I wanted to date. Just wanted to be friends. I would text her here and there but it wasn’t that deep of a conversation. Later in the semester I ended up adding her on Snapchat. After the semester ended I moved to Michigan. She would snapchat me and I would snapchat her back. It was only the messages never pictures. So today I asked her how’s the weather in Florida to make a conversation. And she responded super hot and I said it feels great here in Michigan it’s in the 70s and I talked about how fall feels so good here. And I said jokingly oh you should come here sometime and enjoy the weather. Since she lives in Florida over 1200 miles away didn’t think she would buy it. Well she said actually I was thinking about going up there in October I have some family. So I was like that’s awesome you will like it here. Then she said you’ll talk to me and won’t be quiet if I come right? And this is where I shit my pants. I didn’t talk to her that much cause I didn’t want her to think I was interested in a relationship. Now is she wanting to just see me as friends or more than friends? I can’t tell. She doesn’t know I have a girlfriend I’ve never brought it up since I don’t talk to her much. I don’t wanna just flat out say I have a girlfriend because I feel like it will scare her away.

I used to work at a local newspaper but I quit over this story: the school is one of the newspaper's biggest advertisers.

It involves bullying. Parents allege the school administration does nothing to stop the bullying, which includes boys hitting girls and boys groping girls. 

I tried my very best to get the state news agencies interested. I can't figure out why they took a pass. I had a lot of interviews and offered to provide contact information so they easily could have verified this with my interview subjects if they'd wanted to. 

But anyway, here's where I am now. I wrote the story and I put it on The Daily Kos, and I boosted a Facebook post so a lot of people in the community saw it. But not nearly enough.

I am very sensitive to it, to the extent that as soon as a beautiful female character enters the story, I just get turned off, because I feel like I know what is going to happen. It annoys me.

131,"I’m starting to realize that when I get in “deep” conversations with a close friend about myself or their perception on our relationship, I am turned off and anxious about the conversation. I’ll answer honestly for the most part, but I am geared towards answering in a way that will appease them so I can end the conversation ASAP.  

I’ve grown up with not talking about pressing issues or expressing yourself entirely to the point where it needs to be addressed, so I’ve kept to myself about touchy subjects, no matter the severity. I understand that this most likely why I am feeling this way. The problem is correcting it.

Do I continually put myself in these situations as a form of exposure therapy, or do I need to alter my way of thinking and perceive these interactions differently? I feel like if I do that, then I am created a personable facade that appeals to humanity in general, or do I embrace it as my own quirk in my personality?

I’ve been trying different trial and error methods where I would say what people want to hear, say what I want to say, and a mixture of both.

I know everyone has a different personality and reacts/responds the way they would uniquely, but on my personal level I feel like this is wrong and I should not be saying just whatever people want to hear. 

I obviously have deeper concerns than the example I’ve outlined so far, but I am trying to find a starting point to branch out to root cause. Obviously therapy is an option, but I am a strong believer in self help before therapy. After all, therapy ultimately helps you understand yourself and tries to help you make these decisions and will only work effectively if you make the decision, as with all forms of therapy. 

I apologize for incorrect grammar and scatterbrained questions. I also understand there will not be one answer to my questions, just looking for some outsider insight to my one of many internal struggles. ",22Sep2018,1
132,"I have never had a best friend. Only had one online GF for 1 week then i fucked up by doing mistakes. 

My parents always tell me go out and find a job. And meet new people. Well i found a job i still couldnt get close with people.

 I only asked one question to a person i didnt want to come out as needy. And the question wouldnt go past ""hey, how are you"" 

I dont know what topic to talk about. Mostly im afraid what to say next. And i fuck it up always. It basically feels like no one values me at all. I feel compelety invisible. I try not to beat my self up. Feeling like a loser soy boy. 

How do i turn the tables around and be a badass? Well i just want to get out of this shit hole and let people know i exist. I want to read No more Mr nice guy. I read until 85 and it got to complex and it hurt me.

Every thing i said was in there. Chasing girls. Chasing approval. Blaming my self. Zero social skills. No one valuing me... all this and more. I reason i stopped was because i didnt know how else to act. I want to be a man. And stop chasing pussy.. i want to stop being this low.",22Sep2018,0
134,"My entire life, everyone who's known me has told me that I'm one of the nicest people they know and that they're happy to have me. But recently all my friends have been telling me that I act like an asshole. They tell me that they wish I could go back to the way I was. When I ask what's wrong they each tell me a different reason. They tell me that my jokes are rude, that I sometimes objectify women too hard in conversation, and that I'm inconsiderate.

135,"About a year ago, I moved away from home when I was 18 to live with my girlfriend and her family about 10 hours away. When I got here, I thought they had all liked me (I met them before but never really got to know them). I met her extended family and they all seemed to like me too. Then, about a day or two ago, I learned that none of them really like me. Her grandma is putting all of the blame on me for my girlfriend dropping out of college for a semester (which is actually because she was only there for a semester and is already $5000-$7000 in debt), she’s also blaming me because she put on a little bit of weight which I didn’t see as a problem. Then I learned that her Aunt doesn’t like me either and I guess it’s the same reason, I’m not too sure on that. Her parents I guess are also the same reason. The thing is, from the small amount of time that I’ve known her grandma, I’ve learned how manipulative she is. She will get her way one way or another. At this point, I would move back home and try to continue our relationship with long distance but I don’t wanna leave her, I love her too much to leave. I can’t really go back home either since my mom is an alcoholic and doesn’t want me back and I haven’t spoken to her since I left a year ago. I just don’t really know what to do, I didn’t feel like I was doing anything wrong. Is there any advice anybody can give me?",22Sep2018,1
136,So I’ve been thinking about getting a sleeve lately. I told my parents the day that I went to the tattoo shop for my consolation. My mom freaked out and was telling me I shouldn’t do it. When I was driving there my dad ended up calling me 2 times and sent me like 5-6 text within minutes telling me that I’m never going to get a job with a sleeve. He is telling me to get a half sleeve and get the rest on my chest. The sleeve I want to get won’t be the same if I get a half sleeve and get it on my chest. Is getting a sleeve that big of a deal when it comes to getting a job? I’m getting my masters in computer science. If anything I can just wear a long sleeve to the interview then wear short sleeve after I get the job. They can’t fire me for having a sleeve right? ,22Sep2018,1
137,"I'm a nineteen-year-old woman currently attending a technical college for factory maintenance work.  I have an internship at a plastics factory, which I started 4 months ago.

Last summer, I had just graduated high school and was enrolled at an expensive state college for a double major: physics and biology.  I was working part-time as a lifeguard.  I had completed all my generals and would have graduated in two years.  My mental health was also shit and I wanted to jump off a bridge, so I had a mini quarter-life crisis and quit everything I just mentioned, shattering the illusion of perfection.  

Telling my parents I wanted to attend a tech school instead of climbing to the very top of the STEM ladder was rough.  It was a massive fight for a while, but eventually, my mother came around.

The first year out of high school was the best year of my life.  I got a cashiering job and enjoyed it immensely, making amazing friends, spending my work days chatting with customers, and generally being the extroverted person I am.  School was even better.  I made friends with every single classmate, and I know we will all always remain friends.  I enjoyed the material, especially welding, and felt so much more empowered with a little practical knowledge under my belt.

I have had a dream of building myself a house for a long time.  I'd do it with very alternative methods - anyone heard of earthbags?  Strawbales? - by myself, on the cheap.  Hard work, but rewarding.  It was this dream that led me to my current internship, actually.  I chanced a few interviews for full-time maintenance jobs, hoping I could land one with a big enough salary to get a land loan.  Unfortunately, I only qualified for paid internships.  Oh, well, I said to myself, putting aside my dream with some disappointment.  Next year.

The internship was wonderful at first.  I made fast friends with my coworkers.  The day shift was full of chatty and interesting people, and I was usually tasked with something that felt meaningful or educational.  My boss is great, my coworkers are great.  Sometimes I had no tasks, and I would sit for hours, feeling like I was weighing down the system - but that was rare.

And then school started, and my hours changed.  I am working evenings and weekends now.  Gone are the bustling offices and chatty coworkers.  Gone is my boss, who was usually the one to assign me projects - he works day hours.  Gone were the day-shift maintenance men who didn't mind training the intern.  Now, my work has taken on a dark tint; I have begun dreading it.

Half my evening work days are spent with the N1 shift.  This shift's lead is a self-righteous, joyless man who seems to derive malicious pleasure from making people squirm.  The other two maintenance guys on the shift are nice but very, very quiet - and heartily disinterested in training an intern.  During these shifts, I may do one of three things: sit and do nothing, letting productivity paranoia set in; latch on to one of the maintenance guys and shadow them, feeling very much like a nuisance; or work on a separate project, sometimes actually a meaningful one.  Obviously, the third option sounds the best, but there are few things at my workplace that are trusted to an intern alone - and besides, to be assigned a project, I would have to speak to the shift lead.  The shift lead, who always manages to corner me into a mightily uncomfortable conversation about the impropriety of the personal choices of anyone other than himself, the idiocy of differing political ideas from his own, and general mean and unnecessary gossip about fellow coworkers.  He is a toxic man.  I think he likes me well enough, but he is exhausting.

The N2 shift is much better.  I actually connect with them.  But, aside from the shift lead, who is usually far busier than he wants to be, the guys on this shift haven't been with the company much longer than me.  So, while they at least try their best to give me some training, I still feel lost, and I still sit and do nothing an awful lot.

My Saturday shifts are okay - they're spent with one of the day shifts.  The offices are still bare and I still sit a lot, though.  Doing nothing.  But it isn't free time.

I feel so lost.  I'm stagnating and have no direction.  I'm living far away from my family and farther from my home friends.  I only see them maybe once a week, and I miss them so much.  I haven't seen my family in two weeks.  

I do best with near-constant social interaction, and right now, I always feel alone, especially at work.  I'm so lonely and homesick and I just want to go back to my old cashier job.  

I want to call my mom and tell her how rough this is, but I can't.  It would be an admission of difficulty that I am not proud enough to own up to.  And I can't talk to her about so much.  She is so afraid for my mental health that I'm the one who has to protect *her* from any transient low moods I may have.  Besides, there are other things that would hang behind the curtain of my words - socially drinking with friends, going to clubs, recent psychedelic experiences, the fact that I might want to convert a school bus and live in it for a while, a budding relationship, and so many other aspects of my diverging life that affect me but that I cannot share with her for various reasons - and so I would not really be communicating, just recounting a hollow story.  I haven't had good, honest communication with anyone for a while, honestly.  That's the loneliness.

What do I do?  I am going crazy at work.  I'm actually dreading it right now, sitting up in bed so as to delay the morning.  But if I quit now, I'd have to find another job - maybe just the same.  School is hard because I am lost.  I feel caged by pride and my own ego.  I miss everyone.  I miss my mom so much, but I can't reach her.

I've been exercising a lot.  I meditate regularly.  Those things are what is keeping my mood at the relatively  high level it is still at.  I go out with my school friends at least every week and my home friends maybe once a week.  I talk to my mom on the phone a lot.  But I'm not connecting, not most of the time.  And there's the ever-present dread of work.  Work is the epicenter of my misery right now.  

Please give me an answer, even if it's one I probably already know.  I honestly just need a human sounding board, because I'm stuck in my own brain and it's stuffy in here.",22Sep2018,1
138,"The story is that my mom met him in her early 30s while he was married with 2 children (i have 2 much bigger sisters who don't know of my existence). my mom got pregnant, he wanted her to get an abortion and she decided to keep me. He didn't want any relation with me and I never knew him. my mother told me that he was sending her money when she needed (my mother is a proud though woman so it wasn't much) for my first 18 years. He is still married to the same woman and I assume that his family doesn't know of me or my mother(they never found out). I don't want to ruin that family life but the thing is that he is older than my mom and I am afraid that he will be too old or not alive anymore and I'll ""miss the train"" and won't get a chance to meet him. I can't help but think how my life could have been easier and where I could have been if I had him to guide me.

139,"I have been thinking about this. On one hand, the absolute worst never happens. On the other, it gives me a false sense of security that everything might be good.

Last night a situation was developing.
It was a situation developed by me as a result of my overthinking.

When I tried to say to myself, ""It's gonna be fine."", I was so scared that my assumption towards the fact might come untrue.

140,"Gonna be specific. I was a pretty trashy person back in the day, I had a lot of conflicts and lied a lot, then I started to ""fix "" things by pushing them under the rug, ignoring them or lying to make them seem fixed. My partner recently discovered one of those lies and went with her mother. It's now when I notice that everything I thought I had fixed is just in standby and I need to do something to compensate my partner as she's not guilty of any of my stupid decisions. I need to fix things and say truths, but trying to remember exactly what I did or why brings back a lot of the depressing pain I went through when I took those decisions, as I took some of those thinking I'd keep living up to a month or less and pretty much took decisions which's consequences I won't ever have the chance to fix.",22Sep2018,1
141,"Some important information:

1. She is an online friend
2. I have known her for over 5 years over Minecraft (don't judge), discord, and skype
3. I do not know her real name nor what she looks like, though she knows my name, and maybe knows what I look like (not sure if I've ever put my face up on my profile pic before)
4. We are both over 18 and she is a few years older than me
5. Since I don't know her real name, instead of using her minecraft name I use a nickname I've had for her since we became friends
6. As I've been busy over the last year or so, we haven't hanged out as much (like every week or so)

As for what triggered these feelings, it's a bit of an odd story. One day, I hopped onto minecraft just to have some fun. I saw that she was online and messaged her in-game, and in discord. She responds in minecraft, returning the greeting, but then gives me the ""we need to talk"" message. Well, at about that moment, an unrealistic thought surged into my head: ""she might like me and worked up the courage to tell me now."" Of course, the world is never that easy-going and a darker message came from her that crushed me. She told me she actually hated my guts and then cut ties with me.

Well, that hurt like h*ll. I actually cried in real life a bit. I even went through a bit of denial and told myself she was just joking. No response from her for the rest of that day. At theend of the day, I see amessage pop up in discord. It was her telling me she couldn't respond because she was at work. It took a little time for me to connect the dots. Her account had been hacked and that was someone pretending to be her. I told her immediately, leaving out my emotions of course, and our friendship went back to normal.

Those feelings stuck. I now get a little leap in my heart whenever I hear her voice. I can't help but think about some of our best and worst moments. She means the world to me and it means even more to me that we've stuck together through so many ordeals (another story).  

So my question is: How do I reach out? From what I know she lives on the other side of the country and doesn't seem to ever want to give any more personal info than that and her age. And if she does reciprocate those feelings, how do I make such a weird relationship work?",22Sep2018,1

144,"I have been struggling with Depression and suicidal thoughts, but one of the major challenges is that I don't have anyone to talk to in a crisis. That is the cause of my Depression in the first place. 

I was bullied for eight years in school, and usually, you should be developing relationships and collecting experiences in adolescence, but instead I was alone. I have never had any close friends, and in fact, I have had two budding friendships end after a few weeks because I was closer to them than they were with me.

145,"So right now I am living at home while going to a nearby university, but I cannot stand it. My parents are so overprotective and controlling, and it's driving me insane, and I want to move out as soon as possible. However, I am enjoying my experience at the university I am at, so there is no real point in moving out unless I transfer to a farther university. Every time I go out, I get a million texts, even if I'm just nearby at a friends house, and my mom yells at me if I take the bus back home because I have to do a short walk from the bus stop to my house, and it's 'dark out' and 'dangerous'. It's so annoying because it's a good area in a quiet residential area, there is no danger. Anytime I occasionally go to a party, they refuse to let me cab home and forcefully pick me up but then they give me a 12 o clock curfew. I barely socialize as it is, and this just worsens my experience. I hate telling them I'm going anywhere because I get asked a million questions, and then when I get home I get screamed at if I wasn't answering my texts. This means I just sometimes don't go to things because it's so much of a hassle to get past them, whereas if I where living on my own, I wouldn't even think twice about going. I also am an avid fan of concerts, but have had to miss out on so many because I had noone to go with, as I don't have many friends due to their controlling ways, and if I go alone they throw a fit. I'm so fed up, but then they guilt trip me telling me how good I have it because they pay my tuition and I get free food. But I'm always getting yelled at and being told I'm lazy, especially by my mom, even though I work in the summer, take a full course load during the year, and exercise regularly, whereas she doesn't have a job and constantly complains how hard she works. I;m so fed up, should I just take out student loans and move, or should I just drop out of university and figure it out?

146,"Hi reddit. My mom has been prescribed ambien for probably 7+ years and she takes it on and off to help with her insomnia. She's had depression as long as I've known her, had been on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds for several years.

Lately the amount she's drinking has gone up. She's also taking ambien and drinking beer. Tonight she had half an ambien and 8 IPA's. She's been confrontational and trying to start arguments with her husband all evening and she pestered my brother who dropped by for a few minutes until he couldn't deal with her and left.

She is so psychologically abusive when she's drunk like this. I wonder if everytime she's been abusive it's been because she's drinking and taking ambien.

148,"So I am going to pre med next year and put my name in the hat for medical school. This requires a big international move, but I'll be moving back to the country I'm originally from as I've been living overseas for 5 years and working as a paramedic for the last 3 years.

I'm feeling like maybe it's too late to do this? I have 2 young children (4 and 7 months) and I'm 32 years old. I've always wanted to be a doctor and this is my best chance as I worked hard to maintain a good GPA with the paramedicine degree, which was what held me back before now. I'll be 38 when I graduate but my husband (who's very supportive!!) just says I'll be 38 anyway, may as well be 38 and a doctor than not. Here's the thing though. My extended family/in laws have a horrible attitude toward me studying again as I did a degree straight out of school, got my pilots licence, went back to school for my paramedicine degree and now I've only worked as a paramedic for 3 years and I'm going back to uni to complete my medical degree. In their mind I'm work shy, but anyone who's been to uni knows it's definitely not easy, and doubly so with young children and a full time job! In between I followed by husband's career, raised his son from a previous relationship and became a qualified volunteer firefighter.

How do I deal with the ""you're just a perpetual student"" comments?

Should I even do medicine? Stay working as a paramedic? (We're very well paid where I live now but not my home country)

I had a fling with a guy where we had ""done the deed"" quite a few times over the course of a few months. He also took my virginity. It is now months later since the fling ended and I keep getting intrusive memories of us doing the deed. It's almost like a flashback or that I am reliving it. It makes me very embarrassed and uncomfortable. I find it very unsettling. 

I find these flashbacks can happen anywhere such as at work. I try to just ignore them because I desperately do not want to relive those memories. I have been trying to forget that the whole thing happened.

I have always been aware of D, even at the age of like 13 (I'm 18 now for reference) I knew that something was probably wrong with me but didn't really think anything serious of it. This feeling I have has gotten much stronger now that I am older and even more so after my mother died when I was 16. I have a hard time doing things now, I get angry fast and make impulsive decisions in hope that I'll feel something from it (like buying things I know I can't really afford). Most of the time I just get mad at myself from doing it over and over, while knowing I'll just end up this way each time. I don't have any friends anymore, and I'm not sure if it's because I've become a class A asshat or if it's because I've graduated high school. Might be a mix of both. D has really been nagging at me as of recent, I get in these dark moods and I scare myself. I could never go through with these dark thoughts but it's always on the back burner of my mind. I feel so damn guilty all the time, I expect people to call me out on this shit in my mind.  

Everyone in my family believes D is made up, that it's all just for attention, so I can't get any assistance from them. They are completely oblivious to it. Plus, I'm still on my father's health plan so he might see that I started visiting a doctor. The only people that I might be able to get help from is some of my high school teachers, I grew extremely close to one of them towards my junior and senior year. She has always been there for me and is honestly a huge role model for me. She helped me get my current job and I even walk her dog each week for a few extra bucks. I could probably consider her a friend at this point. I think she is the only one aware of D hanging over me, but I'm too scared to say anything about it. If she does know why hasn't she said anything about it? This fear eats me alive and the cycle repeats every day, I'm just so tired. I really need some advice.

I get random panic attacks, I'm suicidal, I believe I have spd (short explanation ; makes nothing seem interesting/emotional detachment/zero energy) and I go weeks without leaving the house at all. 

I actually feel kind of ashamed even writing this because its not a physical disability and people who dont deal with mental illness dont understand how much it really destroys you.. 


I've thought of applying for disability before but changed my mind because I feel ashamed but I'm only getting older and older and eventually im going to need some type of income to at least help the people i live with.




tldr : Mental illness is making it impossible to be employed or enrolled in schooling, how do I apply for disability?",22Sep2018,1
156,"Since I can remember he always made me believe I was stupid, and that if I died, he would be happy. When I was little and couldn't defend myself, he liked to hit me and brag about how much more damage he could do. Hitting was always justified by something, like lying or stealing, so it made sense to me. Following the punishment he wouldn't talk to me for days. If I tried talking to him he would tell me we are not on good terms. This type of treatment happened for around 10 years from ages 6-17.

When I was 8 my mom left us because of a divorce. Around this time, my dad liked to threaten to drop me off at an orphanage if I was being bad. I cried at these threats, and he just laughed saying it's just a joke. What a great joke! It wasn't like one of my parents already left me. Another time, he gagged and zipped me up in a suitcase and told me he'd throw me off the Niagara Falls, a place we had recently visited. He destroyed what should have been a nice family memory.

When I grew up a bit, around the time I was in high school, his strategy shifted to a more psychological pressure. If I do not try at school, he said he would kill me. Having some perspective now, of course he wouldn't have done it, but at the time he made it very clear that he would follow through. His strategy was always to keep me broken. I never learned to stand up for myself. I wanted to die very often.

He continued to break me down until college, when I told him I was seeing a therapist and on antidepressants. I truly believed that he would laugh it off, but for some reason he changed completely. I suspect that a friend of his had a child who committed suicide for reasons that were entirely fixable by the parent. I don't know why else he would suddenly accept my depression when he was so rigidly against the existence of such a thing in the recent past.

I've spent years working with therapists to learn how to deal with everything. In the worst days, like today, I feel that living is so unsatisfying. If I offed myself it would absolutely destroy him. How satisfying would that be? Living is like letting him win.

On the other hand, he was right about many things. He was a single father who raised two kids. He gave up his career and prestige as a diplomat to be with his kids full-time. The lack of a steady job meant we were poor for a long time. Despite all the problems, he cooked dinner for us almost every single night while going to law school. He loved us. There was and is no doubt about it.

Most importantly, his tone is very different now. He is actively supportive and no longer tries to break me down and control me. I feel comfortable enough to talk to him about generic things like my career. He tells me I'm smart. He tells me it hurts him when I talk about suicide. However slow the progress, our relationship is on the mend.

I deeply love and hate this man and I have no idea what to do. Therapy is more about self-discovery, so I have no perspective on how people deal with similar issues. Your thoughts are greatly appreciated.",22Sep2018,11
157,"Hi there,

I'm posting because I want to help my best friend in some way. So, obviously, my best friend is trans. He's an amazing person but because of that, has gone through so much hardship and it just breaks my heart sometimes, knowing the things that he had to put up with growing up and still do now. 

He has now transitioned - he's been on testosterone for a few years, and had top surgery I think a year (or 2?) ago. He passes fine and doesn't get misgendered anymore.

However, I think he's now feeling kind of lost because no one ever says what you do after you do the transitioning bit - there are still things that he can't change which he wants to, like the fact that he IS trans. He just wants to be ""normal"". He feels very self conscious about his body, and feels undeserving even though he's kind, funny, nerdy, cute and handsome. He talked about going back to the gender identity clinic but said that wouldn't help because they can't change anything - he just needs some specialised counselling. He spoke of going to the GP, and I suggested maybe counselling and CBT might help but I really haven't a clue if that actually would help?

He feels down because he's trans, and also his mum had a stroke 8 years ago (?) and now rarely leaves the house. He feels responsible for a lot of things and feels like he can't leave and go study elsewhere, although I think he doesn't necessarily want to but he'd just feel guilty if he left. It's nice to have the option to be able to leave though? 

Relationship wise he just recently broke up with a girl that he was seeing briefly for about a month. They bonded really well and she was being really nice to him, but she had a horrible ex and said that she was ""heartbroken"" over him still so couldn't keep seeing my friend. Because of that, my friend felt very hurt because he feels inadequate, that he wasn't ""enough"". I've tried to reassure him that it's not him and it's just bad timing, but I think you just can't help how you feel, and I understand that too. 

I feel sad because there's not much that I can do to help, and I did suggest posting in Reddit as well, but I don't know if he would actually do it, so instead of posting in the trans subreddit I thought I'd post it here where he's less likely to find it. 

Anyway, any advice would be appreciated especially if you're trans - how did you deal with things after having transitioned? How do you deal with dating, and self image? ",22Sep2018,2
158,"So I’ve just moved into a new apartment about a month ago and living with someone who goes to my school, I don’t know her but we connected online. I’ve been having things happen that make me feel uncomfortable. The first thing was her drinking a whole bottle of wine - confessing ( obviously was her we live alone ) and then saying she will buy me another and still hasn’t - this was a month ago. A few weeks ago I was missing my hair brush and got a txt later from her saying I used your brush yesterday I put it in the living room.... which grossed me out because I don’t know her like that and also going in my room is not okay. I let it go though because I figured it was a one time off. Last week my boyfriend slept over and she was unaware, thinking I was in class went into my room only to have my boyfriend catch her, same thing happened when my friend stayed over and she didn’t know. She will send weird texts like “ hey your bagels expire in 4 days can I have one “ like sure ? But why be so creepy about it and checking my food expiration date as an excuse to have one, it just makes the whole thing seem shady. The last thing I’ll mention was her texting me asking if she can use my phone charger when I was in class, due to her going in my room before I wasn’t comfortable and so I lied and said I packed it to class but I’ll be home at 5. I ended up finishing around 2 and get home to find her phone plugged in laying on my bed and her shooting up from the couch when I got home. She completely disregarded what I told her via text and went in anyways.

[Her] “Is anyone else going?”

[Me] “No lol it’s just us. We’ve talked a bit but I thought it’d be cool if we got to know each other better.”

[Her] “I might be busy but if I’m not then yeah, totally.”

Anyway my friend told me that I’m not forward enough with what I want and that I need to make sure she actually knows what’s going on. About 30 minutes later then I get a text that reads like this

165,"So, this is my first post on reddit, and I need to get this off my chest. 

For about over a year, I’ve been listening to voices in my head. I created them when I was at my lowest point in secondary school. They comforted me and they have been with me since. I don’t have a lot friends and I’m quite introverted so whenever I’m alone I just talk to them in my head. They don’t say anything too alarming, just regular conversation.

I also like too imagine my myself in impossible scenarios, which distracts me from my learning a lot. I think I might have a mental health problem but I don’t know if I should see a doctor or not.

166,"So, I'm from Australia (19F) and the last year of high school is Year 12 and when you graduate you are given an ATAR score based on your performance throughout tests and final exams.  Universites then give a minimum ATAR score for each course. 
I left Year 12 a couple of weeks before the exams in 2016, and did not receive an ATAR. 

I'm thinking about going back so I can go to University. And it all seems like a no brainer but my issues are - I'm a recovering drug addict. I'm only 19 but I have been on drugs for about 4 years now. I also have some awful mental health instability that was the main contribution in leaving Year 12 in the first place. 
I was doing really well in Year 12, A student. 
I'm very capable academically to try school again but it's my other issues that are really holding me back. 
I'm a hella perfectionist and generally anxious person. This makes it a lot easier for me to get really overwhelmed by what seem small things, and when I get overwhelmed I tend to quit and avoid the overwhelming things.  

Right now, I've been sober for a week and have been getting myself into therapy and trying to get my life together a bit. 

If I was to do Year 12 again, it would be online because I have very bad anxiety and can't do mainstream schooling, unfortunately. But at least I would get a score? But then again, I don't want to get half way through and become overwhelmed and give up. 
I really don't know what to do. 

I have til the end of the year to decide, otherwise I'll have to wait til 2020.

167,"I'm really not good at anything. I can't draw, I can't cook that well, I don't play sports, I'm not good at video games. The most I can do is work somewhat with computers and I'm not even amazing at that at all. Everytime I practice and say that I'm going to amazing at something, I hit a wall then give up or I'll come back a couple days later then give up. There's nothing in my life that I find satisfying. 

I know why all this is true. I'm not patient and I always try to strive to be #1 at everything, not thinking the time people have actually spent to get to where they were. Why is this world ran by so much inspiration? Why don't I have the ability to get up on my own and say that I'm going to do this without feeling inspired to do so. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe everything in this world was formed based off of inspiration, but people actual take that inspiration and work with it nonstop, no matter how much they fail. Until they succeed.  

Why am I not motivated to do that? Is it because I have no friends who are along side with me? What is it about me that makes me so prone to stop trying something when I hit a wall. Why can't I just stop trying to compete with others and actually feel happiness and satisfaction while trying to do something that I might end up loving. 

I'm fucking tired of this. I have so much passion in me and I know it. I know I'm something special, but I have nothing to show at all. I'm just a guy, that one guy. No other description. 

Just a guy.

171,"This will be lowkey long and badly written, also English isn’t my first language, sorry!! 

Me and my boyfriend are both kind of paranoid in our relationship so we have this deal that we can go through each other’s phone whenever we feel like something’s up. I was just casually using his phone as he was laying beside me and he didn’t react at all, I was just looking through the pics he has of me on his phone and stuff. But then I saw the tik tok app (musically), and I got pretty confused. I have the app myself to look at cringy videos of people, and I send them to my boyfriend all the time. However, he has never sent me a musically before, so I wondered, why does he have that app? When I opened it he immediately grabbed his phone and laughed, so I started wrestling him for the phone, not out of anger! We were just having fun. And suddenly he grabbed my phone, opened my tumblr app, and saw all the porn on my feed. He froze and asked me why I had all of that, to which I explained I compare myself to the women in the pictures, as I have a very very low self esteem. He understood, but told me it wasn’t normal and that it was really weird. It felt bad, but I didn’t really care, so I just tried grabbing his phone again, but he wouldn’t let me have it. I asked him jokingly if he was making musicallys. He started laughing hysterically and ran out of my bedroom. As I chased him around the house he kept laughing and so did I. We were both just playing and having fun! Eventually I had him in a leg lock and tickled him until he confessed. Apparently he had been making musicallys unironically and this made me extremely confused. We both make fun of people on musically all the time, so why would he be making his own? We’re 18 years old, so I told him that’s not normal, to which he seemed to get really sad and didn’t want to look at me. We’ve been together for almost a year and he’s never done anything like this, so I couldn’t believe he was serious. I made fun of him for it when he told me he did it to get famous on the app, and now before he left for training he seemed really down. I don’t know if I should apologize? Like, he made fun of me for comparing myself to the girls on tumblr, so I thought I could make fun of him too. I obviously didn’t want to hurt his feelings, I thought he was joking, but now that I realize he was serious I don’t know what to do. ",22Sep2018,1
172,"So I come onto Reddit a lot mostly because 
whenever I need help I find the comments to be honest and so comforting. This is for those who look at my other posts. Anyway, this post is about how immature I am. I graduated highschool 2 years ago and now I'm in the open free adult world and before I continue I would like to mention how I met ,then, this 35 year old guy who basically gave me all the attention I wanted in exchange for sex...it wasn't a literal exchange in that there was some kind of arrangement in that order but more so I saw that this dude was like a father figure and a romantic interest to me at the time and that sex was always in the picture. Seeing this guy was harmful to me and my education because I had started year 12 with determination and a goal of doing well in the HSC so that I could go to University but because I lost focus a little after February I went off the track and drifted into this imaginary world of me and him and the chance of being together (barf!) and he was just using me the whole time. I ended spending a lot of time out of school and lost my friends. It's something I regret deep down but can now kinda accept as I have moved on and grown from the person and experience. I have bumped into a few highschool peers in public occasionally and see them on social media too. They all seem quite mature..studying and taking responsibility for themselves. If you take a look at me.. I'm currently unemployed took 2 completely different courses at TAFE and never completed them..I'm home all the time on my phone. I feel sad a lot often out of the most trivial things about aspects of myself, others or my life in general. I don't know how to think for myself or how to have self-respect... I still don't know how to have self-respect and don't properly comprehend it but I am told that I need it in life. I feel different because I look at things in life from a spiritual perspective and have on and off experiences of existential dread. Before you label me with depression which I do have, I can not deny that I have a very spiritual mindset...I do not see the importance of hobbies or making maintaining friendships or decorating my room or wearing nice clothes or anything material, tangible and non-tangible wise. I sometimes feel like there should be this 'exit' to life.. and I will repeat myself.. I do not see the importance of hobbies. I can be terribly shy or overly confident, very talkative I'd make your ears sore or quiet as a mouse. I get sad that I stay in a big house alone for so many hours and have a history of having been to clubs completely alone, yet as a friend has just moved in with me she's incredibly annoying no matter how much I make it obvious I'm ignoring her and I don't want her around.

I recently got back to town from a summer job and a close friend of mine (who's always been a little odd) let me know that his father had been beating his mother, my friend, and his two brothers for as long as he can remember. His father just went out of town to another state for a family members funueral, and on the way out of town apparently screamed at all his family and beat his mom because they didn't pack his luggage. This has been going on for a very long time and they decided enough was enough. They got a restraining order, moved into a motel, and are moving into a new appartment next week. His dad comes back tomorrow and my friend is just really worried about what will happen when his dad does come back. I reminded him that if his dad does come back and get violent, they are able to call the police, but obviously because it's his dad he doesn't want to do that (he didn't say that, he just said no and shook and his head I'm assuming that's why). I've gone through this before with my parents when I was about 3 or 4, but it didn't escalate to this extent and I don't really remember it. Now he's dealing with it at 19. I just don't know what to do to help him other than just listen and remind him that with time it will get better. I don't know, if anyone has more applicable experience with this I'd appreciate some advice because I've got no idea what to really do other than be around for him. I told him he can stay at my place, no questions asked but obviously he's reluctant because he wants to be there for his family, but he's here tonight because that's just where we ended up.

174,"So I usually do really well in my studies while being focused and calm. However ever since my final exams from last year I have being doing consistently not that great for my exams. My assignments and projects have been great but I have been screwing up my exams because of stress and anxiety. I feel like my fear of exams that causes the mental block that screws me over orginated from my childhood. So when I was 9, I got into a special accelerated stream. The exams in this stream were insanely difficult for me in my first year in this accelerated stream( GEP for those of you in Singapore). So as you can guess I fucked up my end of year papers for that year. Now I was terrfied when this happened and I hid my results from my dad because he used to beat me when I pissed him off for even the smallest things. When he found out he beat the crap out of me and I couldn't lay on my bed properly because of how much my back hurt. Ever since then I have had a crippling fear and anxiety of taking any sort of exam. Whenever I take an exam I usually get a mental block whenever I start a paper since I always have a fear of my dad beating me. Now this didn't affect me until last year's end of years as my papers were ridiculously easy before that. However since last year that fear has started screwing me again and my grades have started slipping. Not terrible but its not enough for my dad( who has unrealistic expectations of 90 percent in every subject which isnt exactly achievable in a good school like the one I study at.) . And the problem isn't even my dad. My relationship with him has improved drastically since very recently but I still haven't lodt that crippling fear.

177,"I started my first 'real' job a year ago. Full time, often working away from home for a week or two at a time in a small company doing electrical installation (2 directors, 6 or 7 employees split in to 3 teams).  


It's fair to say that I generally dislike the job. However, this dislike has turned to outright hatred in the last few months and I've been suffering from anxiety and depression as a result. This is for a few reasons:  


* The bosses have no interest in morale or employee welfare: My colleagues have had parents and relatives die and were getting phonecalls the day they died asking when they'd be back at work because they couldn't afford for them to have time off. We get thrown around the country with little planning and no regard for driving fatigue. We are TOLD to work weekends, not asked. They have a history of calling from their office to gloat about how they're at home enjoying christmas whilst all of their employees are working outdoors in the snow on Christmas Day (seriously).  

* Wages: I started on minimum wage at 40 hours a week. But the rest of my team were paid for 50 and I was only able to work the same hours as them. After 8 months I got a 'raise' (which basically just raised my hours to 50). Every time I'm made to work overtime, my overtime wage keeps going down. It was initially £125 a day (same for Saturday and Sunday), then £100 the last time. Now I've been told I have to work a Saturday but he can't afford to pay me so I have to ask the guy I'm working with to split wages with (£75 each). We also get paid 10 hours a day regardless of whether we have to work 10, 12 or 15. We aren't paid for travel and we often leave for work at 5am and don't get home til going on 8pm.  

* Colleagues: One guy I get on with. The rest are intolerable. They can only communicate by shouting and I just can't get on with them. A slight mistake is met with extreme anger and abuse. Before I joined I hear that around 10-15 people have come and gone (I can see why)  

* The work: Our bosses never survey jobs properly, they just throw them at us and expect us to work it out. Deadlines HAVE to be met and often get cut short or undermanned. I'm pretty useless at the job anyway, but people like me for my 'attitude and energy'. Working away we have to stop in the cheapest hotels imaginable and eat in the cheapest places imaginable. We're always in the middle of nowhere with nothing to do, so we get in from work and just sit around drinking or in the hotel room doing nothing. I've lost contact with my friends and family since starting the job so even during my time off I basically do nothing.

I'd have quit a long time ago, except my boss has spent a lot on training for me and is relying on me to start a new line of work he's been offered. Plus, the guy I'm now partnered with likes having me with him since I'm told I work harder than his old partner, so I quit it'd put them both in a bad position. Also, the company has been having issues with losing contracts so our boss is pretty pissed at the minute. I think quitting wouldn't be a very pleasant experience for me and I'm terrified of that interaction. But I don't know how much longer I can handle the stress.  


Should I try and see out this new line of work in the hopes of improvement? Is the guilt I feel regarding my colleague and boss understandable and should I let it control my decision to stay?

183,"I'm 30 and disabled so I live with my parents.  Like most people, I enjoy buying things on Amazon every now and then.  I have an interest in camping and survival gear.  I like collecting gear that I sometimes use and other things that I might not use.  It's fun for me.  I'm expecting a rechargeable flashlight and collapsible cup today and a solar charging battery bank tomorrow.  I'm a private person and keep these interests to myself but my parents always ask me what I bought.  We live in a neighborhood where the mailboxes are inside a building a few streets away and packages for residents are left on a table.  I don't have a car so my parents get the mail.  They will look at the return address label and ask me what I bought from whatever the company name is.  I don't want to tell them what I bought because I don't feel like sharing this interest with them.  A year ago I could avoid this problem because they both worked and I had a car so I could go pick up my packages while they were gone.  Now they're home most of the time and I can't pick up the packages myself.

&amp;#x200B;

So long story sort, what should I say?  In the past I've said things like phone chargers for smaller items but I can only have so many chargers by now.  And what about bigger items?  I don't want to lie but I also don't want to say ""none of your business"" because that makes them suspicious.  I've said ""stuff"" but then they just ask me what kind of stuff.  They also ask a lot of questions if I get more than one package a day (like today) or more than one in a couple days (also like my packages today and tomorrow.)  I don't buy things often, maybe a few times per year so I guess I understand why they ask when I actually do get packages.  But I don't want to lie, be vague and suspicious, or actually tell them what everything is because I would like to actually have some privacy.  And like I said, I'm disabled, so moving out hasn't been an option in my life so far.  Any suggestions?  Thanks!

What I am looking for is a career that can provide an income that can cover full expenses (like rent, food, etc), basically so I can live on my own without having to rely on anyone, and doesn't require a degree that takes 10-15 years to get, not that I am lazy but that my parents won't be able to financially support me for a long time.

And then spent another 5 minutes explaining the directions back to my house saying I should come out tomorrow.

This weekend I picked him up as per usual after work when she told me, she has gone to see the Dr and they recommended he go on a gluten free diet. He doesn't have Celiac disease btw, they said for him to use berocca to fill in for any lost nutrients, and that this diet will help him with his school work.

I know reddit is no replacement for a Dr, and I will take him to see one tomorrow.

194,"Okay, so. I have this friend. We’ll call her Emily. Emily is 20. She is absolutely beyond self-destructive. She has anxiety, which she struggles with during the day - really, really badly. However, at night, she turns into a wild party animal. She is never not on drugs. Hardcore fucking drugs. She does this to cope with her mental health issues. She also sleeps with anyone who gives her attention, and she doesn’t use protection. You may think I’m exaggerating - I’m not. She has ruined nights out by disappearing with a guy or ending up in a K-hole, she’s slept with the majority of my boyfriend’s friends (who she doesn’t know, causing rifts between them) as well as the males in her friendship group - and you can definitely see where her self-confidence issues come in when she gets really upset when they don’t contact her after and seek a relationship, or when they get with other girls. She struggles so much with her image, all she talks and tweets about is sex and when she’s going to get her next shag. She will not stop, she’s admitted to others that she can’t stop taking drugs. 
Please don’t get me wrong. I love my friend dearly, I’ve told her I don’t support what she does but if she uses protection then I can handle it - but she doesn’t. She rarely gets tested. She’s putting herself in serious danger by going home with a different guy nearly every night - she’s at uni so it’s easy to do. 
I can’t get her parents involved because they aren’t the caring type, her dad especially.
I’m tired of it. She won’t listen to me, she won’t listen to anyone. I can’t keep watching her on this down spiral because it breaks my heart. I don’t know if I’m being selfish. Please tell me what I should do. ",22Sep2018,2
195,"I'm a 33 year old male. Diagnosed last year with an anxiety disorder and major depression. Everything broke down several years ago, and I can't seem to get back up.

My life was a lot better at age 25. I had a place of my own, a steady job for over a year, and I even attained a much higher paying job at one point. But that's about when things went downhill.. 

I lost sight of myself, my own path. 

I became interested in a girl in 2010, met her online. She lived about 4 states away from me. We talked night after night on the phone and, eventually I asked her if she wanted to meet. 

To understand why the experience was particularly difficult, you have to know that I'm a pretty reserved guy. I prefer to talk to people online because it allows me to be within my comfort zone, and more ""myself"". I also never really had a true romantic partner in my life and I attribute it mostly to this issue. This whole thing was me taking a big leap of faith on someone, and betting the farm that it was going to work out. 

Well, it didn't. It wasn't the worst week of my life, but it was close. Started off great, but we really just didn't fit together - and you just can't really get around the truth with that sort of thing. It just sucks. To top it off, I got to see her be introduced to the guy she eventually got with after me, and he was there almost the whole week. I never really felt like she was even into me after the first day or two. 

I returned home devastated, broke with rent due, and no motivation to do anything but lay on my couch. I quit my job that week and ended up moving home with my parents after my lease was up the following month. I never got any closure out of this because she never wanted to talk about it.

I'll be honest. I haven't really done anything with myself since then. While the pain of that experience has faded, I'm still pretty shaken when I conjure up those memories. I realize people have gone through much worse and still haven't become totally jaded, but I feel like I stupidly bet all of my optimism and trust in people on this one encounter. Something changed in me from the time I flew there to the time I came back. I used to be the one who encouraged people to brush themselves off, and get up and all that. Now I feel like no one is worth risking my emotional well being over. I've lost friends and even screwed up potential relationships over how guarded I am now..

The only thing I'm holding on to, is there's a feeling that won't go away that I'm eventually going to find the strength to try again.. I'm just not there yet.

I don't want to be stuck without a car. He reluctantly agrees to catch a train.  

Half an hour later, I get a phone call asking me to pick him up from the train station, he never left. I agree because it's only 5 minutes down the road. He gets in the car, pissed at me because I ""cockblocked"" him by not giving him my car. I ask him why he couldn't walk or catch a taxi, and he says ""I couldn't be bothered walking from the station and a taxi is like 40 bucks"". 

I confronted him about it, but he refused to take responsibility and continued to blame me for ruining his night. Never mind that I know for a fact that the dude has over $30000 saved up and has no problems with money (he works ridiculous hours). 

This is not the first time he's either blamed me or I've had to cover for him when things have gone wrong. He never chips in for things, never contributes to group lunches at work, never spares a dollar unless his life depends on it. 

Needless to say I was pretty pissed off. I don't think the dude will ever change his stingy, shitty ways and I should just cut him off, but I've never been in this situation before so I don't know what to do.

200,"Alright, so I had a girl I really like over last night. We were just watching a couple movies and just enjoying each others time. Ya know, vibes. About half way into the movie, im letting her know whats up by rubbing on her thigh. I try to inch closer to her inner thigh over time, and she wouldn’t tell me to stop so I thought I was given the green light. So I try to rub her vagina through her pants and see how she feels about it before I start fingering her and she says “you havin fun there?” Shit catches me off guard so I’m like damn is that a curve? She wasn’t getting too touchy with me either, so I just assume she isn’t trying to do that our first time of hanging out. I mentioned her staying the night and I could tell she lowkey wanted to, but at the same time, she didn’t wanna feel slutty I guess. So before all this when we’re talking and being cake’d up, I said some random shit that was kinda embarrassing and she didnt hear me so I tried to keep it a secret for the rest of the night. It was one of those moments where you go “I was gonna tell you something, but nvm”. In hindsight, I shoulda just said some shit to get her off my back but I couldnt think of something good enough. So I just played it like it was a secret that I would eventually tell her later. So she’s about to get ready to leave now and we’re at her car and she says “so what were you gonna tell me?” and I still dont tell her because its TOO embarrassing( I was gonna tell her I cried during a song lmfao). So she gets in her car and she’s still trying to get an answer from me and after I still decline, she just drives off, and said that pissed her off without saying good night or giving a nigga a kiss ): few minutes pass and I text her that if she was really pissed I’ll just tell her and she says “dont worry about it, I’m going to sleep”.

202,"Hi thanks for reading this, any advice super appreciated, not sure what to do or if there’s anything I can actually do. I’ve not mentioned country names but the distance between this persons country and mine is more than 10,000kms (6000miles). Also a throwaway account. 

Tl;dr I have a mentally unstable stalker who has traveled half way across the world a few times to find me and not sure what I can do to stop him. He’s from Europe, is there any way of notifying authorities there? 

I don’t live in my home country any more, my family is still there but I live a couple of countries away with my husband. I’m a musician and travel a lot for gigs, often back to my home country. I also have a pretty successful YouTube channel which is how I assume this person found out about me. 

About a year ago I started getting emails from this guy in Europe. I’ve never replied to any emails and there have been hundreds of them. His initial email was along the lines of ‘love your music I’d like to see you live, I’ll travel to see you, don’t worry I’m not a crazy fan’. A couple of emails in quick succession telling me not to worry he wasn’t crazy and asking if I could let him know when I was next performing made me realize this wasn’t normal fanmail. So I didn’t ever reply to any of his emails. 

His emails got weirder over time, eg. warning me about how to travel safely and not get in cars with people that had my name at the airport, generally they professed  his love for me and said things like how only I understand him etc. I continued to ignore him. Then he said he was coming to the country I live in now, told me his flight info and hotel details and where he’d be waiting for me everyday. This got me a little freaked, still thought he might just be trying to scare me. With a quick social media search we discovered he was indeed in my city. He stayed for a month, apparently waiting for me and emailing me everyday. Eventually when he was leaving he got a little desperate sounding and said how he was waiting at the airport for me and would pay for my ticket to Europe and he knows I’m married and family commitments might be my concern but he would take care of me etc. I honestly thought ok, surely the guy got the hint when I didn’t meet up with him when he’d traveled half way across the world and that would hopefully be the end of it. That was in June. 

Fast forward to the end of July I’m at a festival back in my home country, I catch a glimpse of this guy backstage (terrible security and it was easy to get there) he stood out like a sore thumb because he was just so European looking in a huge crowd of non-Europeans. I actually quickly ran over to my parents and briefly explained that I had a bit of a stalker and it looked like it might be him and to just keep an eye on him. My Mom still commented that he didn’t seem particularly focused on me. He was just standing there, wasn’t with anyone and just sort of stared into space. Because he didn’t seem threatening I did my thing, left and thought nah that was crazy he wouldn’t travel all the way back to this continent after having just been here a month before. A couple of weeks later I get an email saying ‘I hope I didn’t scare you at the festival’. It was all over social media so even though I felt a little sick at the thought I figured he could just be using publicized info to scare me.

This month I get an email asking if I wanted him to come to my home country again - I don’t even have any plans to be there anytime soon, but he mentioned my home town and then the next thing sent me a copy of his one way ticket. I’m from a small town and it would be easy to track down my family by asking around, so I told them the whole story and warned them that it was possible he was headed their way but also possible he wasn’t and to just be on high alert in case. 

I then got an email from him saying he’d landed and was at the airport. My Mom was freaked out enough that she called the airline to ask if he had actually arrived. Initially they weren’t willing to give out that info - but when she explained why she was asking they stopped her and said they knew exactly who she was talking about, yes he’d been there. The lady explained that he’d arrived the day before with nothing, no luggage, no money and no idea where he was going and just said that he was waiting for his girlfriend. Eventually they asked him how to contact his girlfriend because he’d been waiting there for so long and he said he didn’t know, that he was only in touch with her on Instagram. So they then realized something was amiss, they put him in a cell for a night to give him somewhere to sleep and in doing so discovered that he had actually been there in July during the time of the festival and the same thing had happened that time around. The lady at the airline said he’s definitely mentally ill and the obvious language barrier aside, he didn’t make any sense. They say they put him on a flight back to Europe as far as they were willing to and took his passport away till they got him back there (that was Monday) but I got an email a couple of nights ago saying he was still on the continent, waiting at an International departure gate for 3-4 days (I don’t really believe this because why they would let him wait through at an international departure gate, unless he was on standby because he didn’t have a return ticket? also how he would know he’d be there 3-4 days seems weird) the airport is a hub that I unfortunately had to travel through yesterday. It was a horrible feeling. I never post my movements real-time so this was a totally messed up coincidence if he actually was there. 

The airline in my home country said they’d blacklist him and report him to immigration and my parents were going to see what they could do to make sure that happens, but I’m just wondering if there are any steps I can take to somehow notify his country’s immigration about the situation? Also any advice on how to actually deal with him? I thought ignoring him was the best way but clearly that hasn’t deterred him. He has no way of knowing his emails have even reached me, they could be going to an agent for all he knows. We thought about blocking his emails or sending error messages but it seems smarter to know his movements than to be completely unaware. He’s never directly threatened me at any point but I’m understandably very threatened by this all as it all seems to be escalating. 

My husband managed to do some digging and find out about his background and it seems he’s been sort of drifting since April and not working since the end of last year but he doesn’t have much interaction with anyone on social media, we found a potential family member on Facebook but we wouldn’t even know where to begin with them. 

I can’t not post about live shows or let promoters advertise me, but I also can’t keep feeling like he could turn up at any time when I don’t know what his intentions are. 

Thanks for reading, seriously any advice would be super appreciated.

204,"Hi. So I'll be short: I'm in a long distance relationship. I met my online boyfriend 1 year ago over the Internet and we met this year in march. But we didn't have sexual relationships cuz he stayed in my home and even though we kinda tried, we were feeling too guilty/dirty/nervous because my mom prohibited to do it in that trip and I didn't either have the guts to go to a hotel because of the mentioned feelings. Some months ago I met a boy in uni who's from the same country as my boyfriend and I got excited cuz I'm learning the language, and I thought it was nice to have a friend to practice with, but things went further than ""friends"" and we started attracting each other, it went from a kiss to a touch to you know what. The fact is that I didn't do it just once: I did it three times. Second and Third times were mostly because I thought I wanted to ""make sure"" that I didn't like it that much and I also wanted to give him a ""nice memory"" to remember because I felt each previous time was lame (I cried and everything... so I felt really childish).  There was no penetration tho. But I guess it counts as ""loosing virginity"". I couldn't handle the guiltiness anymore so I told my boyfriend everything, and he got terribly sad because he's also a virgin and for him sex is sacred and he wanted us to loose our virginity together. But he forgave me and made me promise I won't ever do it again. I also thought the same before but now I have experienced, I kinda want to do it again. But to be honest that boy from my uni is not as special as my boyfriend and I can't either say sex was amazing with him... but... still it felt good and I think I'm implying feelings with that boy even though my boyfriend is the one who I feel I really like, but the fact that this boy is present so I can meet him everyday and actually see him whenever I want to makes it difficult, I can't take him out of my head and plus I feel so guilty that I lost my ""first time"" in a way that was not as special as I imagined or as it's supposed to be and plus cheating on my boyfriend, I honestly feel like a hoe, I also was super honest with the boy from uni and he knew from the beginning I had a bf but somehow we could not stop, but I just wish I ended the desire for him and we could be just friends because the truth is that I appreciate him, any advice? :( ",22Sep2018,0

""I never said creep I was saying that if you said this (and meant it) that you need to take it down  a few notches because im terrible at relationships and I don't know what to do... because I'm just that kind of person (laughing emoji)… oh no no no! Your nothing like my ex at all no worries (laughing emoji) My last thing told me he was addicted to breaking bones and the taste of blood and my ex never talked to me and I believe was cheating on me... But the only creepy guys like me is kinda true (besides you) because of a lot of incidents ive had with guys. So its all good no need to worry."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I was super hyped and we had a normal conversation afterwards about homework. Then I randomly said, ""Yeah it's so sad we could have been a thing."" 

&amp;#x200B;

She responded with ""???""

Me: What

Her: Im really confused

Me: Why are you confused

Her: Nevermind I figured it out

Me: What is it

Her: Nope its good no worries

Me: Nah tell me

Her: Its good

Me: (her name)

Her: What?

Me: That's what I was going to ask

Do you like Kanye West?

Her: No, why?

Nope

Me: No reason

Her: Okay?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm mad at myself because everything could have worked out if I would have played it cool and just talked to her the next day (today). What do I say to her (in person)? Someone suggested that I just ask her if she wants to be a thing. It could have worked out but I was a complete idiot.

Another thing I read the other day was how many people were implicated in the panama papers and the only thing that happened was that a journalist was assassinated for it.

It makes me feel paranoid to think how all these faceless people who claim to support so many social issues only care to make some money. It makes me feel like every store, every brand and every company see just use us and it makes me really depressed.

When I go to school I always study and prepare myself for applying to medical school. But I get these thoughts in the back of my head which makes me question if it's worth it to aspire to anything at all. What is the point if I grow up to be used by everyone who will try their best to squeeze as much money as possible out of me?

215,"I am a single white male aged 34.  Educated, gainfully employed (60k/yr pre tax) with health insurance, and have had an un-diagnosed medical condition for over a year now, and I don't know what to do as I can no longer afford the doctors who keep telling me nothing at all.

First, I am in the greater Pittsburgh Pennsylvania area - and I have only one choice for health insurance (there are no second/third/fourth options that I could even have a different plan if I wanted to) which is Blue Cross Blue Shield.  This restricts me to not being able to visit any UPMC networked doctor.  If you haven't heard about the health care war in Pittsburgh, here is a quick overview 
[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/two-visions-for-the-future-of-health-care-are-at-war-in-pittsburgh/2018/02/13/d987433c-0157-11e8-9d31-d72cf78dbeee\_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm\_term=.e7d078fc5cbe](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/two-visions-for-the-future-of-health-care-are-at-war-in-pittsburgh/2018/02/13/d987433c-0157-11e8-9d31-d72cf78dbeee_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.e7d078fc5cbe)

My issue is my junk.  

Phase 1: It started out as low level (1 or 2 on scale of 10) share pains radiating up the shaft and tip of my penis, and the head of my junk was constantly red. 

Phase 2: Then it evolved into fairly constant sharp pains (still 1-2 on the pain scale, nothing crazy) and the redness went away.  

Phase 3: The constant sharp pains continue, and now the junk is cold to the touch after lying in bed for a while.  Like, Ice cold.

Phase 4: The pains have subsided from constant, but still happen off and on.  The coldness is worse, and I wake up multiple times per night with a massive erection, which sometimes is sore (pain level 1-2 still).  The erection won't go away unless I get up out of bed for a few minutes, and go piss even if I feel like I don't have to piss.

Phase 5 (now): The pain has mostly gone away now, the erections while sleeping are worse and constant.  Additionally my testicles are sometimes growing 2-3 times their size while sleeping, which also quickly shrink back to normal after getting up and walking around for a few minutes.  Sometimes I wake up 3x per night and have to walk around/piss.

I've been to two different PCP's.  
I've been referred to a Urologist, and a neurologist.  I've also seen a Chiropractor who is a friend of mine, and my Mother is a Physical Therapist. (Whom has surprisingly given me better results than any doctor to this point) 

Every PCP visit costs me $25 + tests  
Every other doctor costs me $50 + tests (And of course, you have to go BACK IN to get the results and pay the copay just to hear anything)

PCP x2 -&gt; Dermatologist x2 -&gt; PCP x2 -&gt; Urologist x3 -&gt; PCP2 x5 -&gt; Neurologist x2

First with the redness, they said it was fungal infection.  3 different creams over 2 months and none of them helped.

Then they started tests.  

* They tested for every STD in the book - all clean.
* They did urine tests
* They did tests for kidney and liver function
* They did an ultrasound to rule out testicular torsion and cancer
* They gave me steroids
* They gave me muscle relaxers
* They did prostate exams - all clear
* They gave me the pills for prostate relief anyway to see if they would help (FloMax?)
* They did like, 3 separate rounds of blood tests and everything came back clear and normal
* They did an MRI of my pelvis - all clear
* They did an MRI of my lower and mid spine (All the S, all the L, and some of the T vertebrae - some issues, but nothing that they can definitively say could  be causing this issue.

The last place I left it 3 months ago is we have no answers and the neurologist wants to refer me to a neurosurgeon with the results from the last set of MRIs.  While he says he doesn't think that anything could be causing this, he wanted additional opinions.  The quickest I can get in with a neurosurgeon is 7 weeks.  

The consensus (started by my PT mother) is that the issue is with the Pudendal Nerve.

In phase 2/3 I noticed that it was occurring more when sitting or lying down (I sit at a computer all day) - I got a motorized standing desk and now alternate between sitting/standing all day which has helped some.

My PT and Chiropractor have shown me various stretching and strengthening techniques which I can do at home myself to stretch the areas where the nerve run, and strengthen my pelvic and core areas.

I also purchased switched to a new memory foam bed, thinking my old one could be worn out since sleeping is the worst time for me, didn't really change anything.

The only major change in my life over the past years has been that I have lost over 100lbs of weight.  I've not injured myself or anything.

All-in-all, I have racked up some $4,000 in medical bills for just this issue, and can not continue to afford even continued diagnosis much less treatment  My deductible is only $1500!  The rest of that $4000 is COPAYS.  And my yearly max copays are something to the tune of $7,500.  And the first \~$1,000 of this was on last years insurance.  After tax, this is like 10% of my take home pay.  My savings has been dropping, and I have almost $1,000 left that I am paying monthly still and will be for the next 6 months.  I can't afford the continued run-around, and don't know what to do.  I am fairly close to the Cleveland Clinic (2.5 hours each way) but would need to take X days off of work to go there, and its going to be a bare minimum of $400/day plus cost of tests. (I have called and talked with my insurance, and they treat a visit to the clinic as a day in the hospital, at $400/day)

I have no credit card debt, but I have a mortgage and student loans that eat up a large portion of my income.  And the damn mortgage is cheaper than any available rent in the area....

I don't know what to do.  I have been seriously stressed and panicked about this situation for a year now.  I'm worried that I am going to start losing the use of my junk.

What can I do?",22Sep2018,0

218,"So my parents have had a very dysfunctional relationship my whole life. She has a jeckyl and hyde personality - one min she is fine and the next she can simply turn, just, odd. She has zero family and no friends besides me because of this. However, we do have a relationship because when she's good - we have a laugh, we get on. Things are better when I don't live here (I'm about to move out again after having been here for several months unemployed - nightmare)

HOWEVER. The man she has married to, I have never called 'dad' even though he technically - bleurgh - is, my whole life. He is a functioning alcoholic, an aggressive and emotionally manipulative mean person, who has never been anything but cynical, angry and oversensitive. His whole family seem to have some degree of narcissistic personality disorder, especially his mother who was mentally unstable her whole life, so both my mum and I think he does too.

I have no relationship with him. None. He has always resented me for simply being around, it seems to me. I used to hear him bitching about me for hours when I was 8-10 and they thought I was asleep. I was the ''brat'', the ''spoilt attention seeker''...

I was a happy kid with lots of friends and a super active social life. 

My teen years were awful with him around. He was one of those people who would project a super supportive image, but the reality was alcohol induced tantrums and ''DO NOT QUESTION MYYYY AUTHORITY''. Yup. Quite honestly he has always creeped me out as well - and I can't put my finger on why. Little things mostly.

The point is. Lately I'm struggling. When I meet new people they ask about my parents. I say my mum lives in *insert town* with her partner. I simply cannot refer to him as anything else. I think I'd vomit.

But then they ask about ''where's your dad'' etc etc...

How would you phrase?

222,"Hey friends. So I recently moved from a big city with an animal services/control department to a tiny town without one, so I'm a little unsure what my options are.

A little brown dog continuously comes into my yard to poop and thoroughly enjoys pooping on my porch. It's unafraid of my German Shepherd (to be fair, he's only 15 weeks old so \~36 pounds), but likes to come up to my patio door and taunt him through the glass. I can't open the door to shoo it away because my dog tries to chase it in a territorial fashion. 

Today, a medium black lab has appeared, but this one is wearing a collar. It looks like it is sick (has possible ringworm) and is extremely friendly. My dog, being a GSD, is very wary and was puffing up trying to spook the lab through the patio door.  Normally, my dog is very dog friendly and happy, but this was a whole new side of him.   
   
I was told I could call the local shelter and they could have someone come pick them up and find their owners, but I have called numerous times over the past couple of days and about 4-5 times today with zero answer. I let my dog out on a lead, but I'm afraid since the lab is friendly it will come try to make friends with my pup and pass on disease. I'm also very tired of picking up other dog's poop off my porch.

And before anyone asks, I can't just fence off my back yard because this is a rental property, and fences are expensive. ",22Sep2018,1

Other than that we have no connection. When I see her on the way to class or something (small campus) my plan was to just tell her she's cute and ask for her number and say we should hang out some time. Probably not word for word but something along these lines.

224,"I've posted here before asking if I should call my deadbeat dad who hasn't been around for 17 years.

Long story short. He's an abusive peadophile who has had relationships with several girls 14 and under while in his 30s. He abuse my mother and left her to raise me at 16.

Since then he turns up and asks why I haven't called him and says that my mother forbids him to contact me. He messes with my head and disappears for 5 years.

I'm almost done with high school, but recently an agency managed to find him and contact him for child support. Exactly two days later after not seeing him for 4 years he pulls up alongside me in his car. This isn't the first time he's done this, all the time that I've seen him, he has magically appeared alongside me while I'm walking down the street, usually around where I live.

This time it was just outside of my school which is a long way from home. I think he was following me but I never asked.

Anyway, I asked earlier if I should contact him with the number he gave me, to ask him why he did the things he did and why he didn't love me. Everyone said no and to delete the number.

I haven't deleted the number because I can't bring myself to do it. Though I don't know why I can't do it. He has wiped his Facebook account and changed the name, he has also lied to the government agency about how much he earns, which means that he only has to pay £15 a week. He hasn't paid a penny.

I know what a bad person he is but it hurts so so much to know that I'm not worth £15 to him. He has 3 other children that he doesn't pay for and they are also after child support

One thing that has plagued me for weeks is the overwhelming need to expose him. I want to message his family and friends on Facebook and tell them what sort of person he is. I want to message him and ask him why he did those things and make him take responsibility for his actions.

I've only seen him a few times but every time I have everything I want to tell him in my head but the minute I see him I crumble into this meek little girl who still calls him ""daddy"". The word is so wired to say but I can't call him ""dad"" I still refer to my mum as ""mummy"" so I've always applied it to him. But calling him by his first name seems strange as well since he is my biological father. What do I call him.

I though I was brave enough to confront him but I couldn't open my mouth to tell someone off just this once and stand up for myself. He blatantly lies to my face and manipulates me and I just stood there and accepted it.

Just thinking about him makes me so angry sometime and it makes me want to destroy his life. I would have liked a nice father and he took that from me. He doesn't deserve to go on cruises to Jamaica or have a nice car or have people praising him and calling him ""uncle"". He has all these thing yet he can't acknowledge that he has a a daughter.

Every so often I look at his picture and wonder why my father has to be such a disgusting man. He's so ugly and pathetic and I look just like him. It makes me sick to the core.

These thoughts are tearing me down and I don't know how to deal with them. I still have his number but I can't bring myself to delete it since that's my only connection to him.",22Sep2018,1

231,"4 years ago I used to be a pill addict.  My girlfriend at the time broke up for me because I was a addict and she was scared I was going to die sleeping at night in bed with her.  I was lost and met a new girl on fb.  She was young (19) African American whose dad would sell his and his wife’s prescription pills to me for cheap.  It started off great because I was high all the time and everyone liked me because I had a good job(I’m a Transportation broker).  So about 3 months later we get in a fight and I break up with my new gf.  She goes crazy and steals a bunch of my stuff.  A month later she call me to pick up my stuff and I get it back and her lil brother who is 17 tries to fight me.  About 2 months I am super lonely and somehow get back with her.  This whole time I am a raging pill addict doing anything to get pills even stealing.  A couple months later I try to break up with her again and she flips shit.  She tries to fight me and won’t let me leave.  I am stuck in my room for hours and try to climb out window.  She attacks me and I put her in a head lock so she doesn’t hit me in the face and bite me.  She calls the police on me and they come and issue me a ticket for felony strangulation domestic violence.  I get a lawyer and he tells me to take a plea for misdemeanor domestic violence. I get put on probation for 1.5 years.  I get placed in rehab and get clean.  I get a call from her 2 months later saying she is pregnant.  I wasn’t sure it was mine so didn’t talk to her until the baby was born.  The baby was born, it was a girl and it was mine.  I try to work things out with her.  Her parents wanted to move back to there hometown in Houston.  We get a house and stay in our hometown, I am just trying my best to be in my daughters life.  I pay for everything and she doesn’t have to work(she has never had a job her whole life and just lived off her parents who are both on disability and sell there pills) and just take care of my daughter.  All she does is hang out with her friends and smoke week.  She would also cheat on me.  I still just stayed calm and try to work things out with her.  She was taking benefits from the state so they came after me for child support, so to make child support the least as possible she agrees to give me half custody(all the child supports goes to state for her insurance and food stamps).  One day she goes crazy and destroys all my clothes and threatens to kills me.  The next day she shows up to my work and says she doesn’t want to take care of our daughter anymore and leaves her with me.  I go and file a protection order against her.  She has to move out of my house until we got to court.  She files a protection order against me as well but the judge drops both a month later at court.  I change the locks on my house and call the cops when she come over and they tell her they will arrest her for trespassing if she comes over again.  For the next 8 months I take care of my daughter myself, take her to daycare everyday and work to support my daughter.  Her mother see her daughter a total of 3 days in those 8 months.  So one days after those 8 months she takes my daughter to Houston to live with her parents.  Houston is 1000 miles away and she doesn’t have the courts permission to do this.  I get a lawyer who gets me temporary full custody but that doesn’t do anything because cops from different states won’t get involved in civil disputes.  She changes her phone number and I don’t where they are for 2 months.  I hire a private investigator to find out where she lives.   My dad, my friend who is ex marine and I drive down to Houston and wait outside her apartment.  She come out with my daughter to smoke a cigarette and my daughter is running around.  My marine friend goes and yells her name and throw court papers at her while I grab my daughter.  We go back home and I file for full custody and I get it.  She has to pay me child support now.  She calls me all the time saying she is going to kill me.  I get messages from her friends threatening me.  The treats stop for about a year and she never pays me child support.  3 nights ago a black dude shows up to my house at 1 am knocking on my door.  I have a ring motion detector camera hidden.

I'm a male I should add. I've been super skinny most of my life but over the past few years I've been gaining a bit of weight. Mostly in my stomach, back, neck and face. 

It's really only been maybe 10-15 pounds, but I now have love handles, a bit of a gut and I don't have a super strong jaw so I got a double chin at times. 

Over the last year tried a lot of different workout programs to help me build muscle, but I just dont really stay dedicated to them. 

I think if I just cut back the bad food I eat and do some cardio every day I can see improvement.

I just want to be happier with my body, and I want the small of my back to go in again. It just feels like when you're a 20 year old guy you're supposed to want to be all jacked.

First Major: Criminal Justice

Fall of 2017 I entered the criminal justice major at my local community college. I was fresh out of Highschool and naïvely optimistic about this major. I had this weird perception that the criminal justice system was black and white. After one semester I realized it was not for me. Things weren’t as concrete as I expected, there wasn’t as much _right_ and _wrong_ as there were technicalities. As interesting as the field was to learn about, I couldn’t see myself going it for a career.

Second Major: Computer Science 

My second semester, Spring 2018 ended up being computer science..for a week. As a kid I grew up around computers and got pretty good with them. In Highschool I took classes on repair and building them. I always had the dream of being a computer programmer and making websites and games. Only problem is I’m abysmal at math. Absolutely terrible. As far as Highschool went, it was the only class set that I was bad at. First week of computer science and I felt completely out of my league. These people were so ahead. I freaked out and dropped the computer science classes and kept the non-related ones. 
_________________________
Third Major: Psychology 

In Highschool I took a psychology class. Absolutely loved it. Decided to try it out as a major.

Fall 2018.

I’m a few weeks in, I enjoy the psychology class. Sociology sucks, I can’t enjoy it. I like nothing about it. Exposition and Persuasion is a workload that is hard to manage while I have a job and social life. And Spanish I. Spanish I is a joke. I took one Spanish class senior year of Highschool. I wasn’t too bad. I forgot it all, of course, but the context is that I’m not terrible at picking up the prospect of language.

It’s my instructor.

Don’t get me wrong, Xavi is really cool. He’s from Spain. Absolutely zen, chillest dude I know. But he is a terrible teacher. He has no lesson plan. He comes in and attempts to teach us new stuff but it just doesn’t work because we have no basis to work from. He’s the type of teacher that works mostly from showing YouTube videos from different Youtubers. In my opinion, if you’re going to go off YouTube at least show the series in order so we have context. 

So far this semester has left a sour taste in my mouth. On top of that, psychology requires at LEAST a masters to really do anything with, and at this point, 1 1/2 years into college with nothing to show for, I can’t do it. I can’t do 6. 

So here I am, about to piss my family off again with switching a major. Or is college even for me? Should I attempt trade school?

A little bit about me:

Single mom, dad wasn’t in the picture. Raised by grandparents a lot since Mom always worked (she’s always been a store manager, she’s a damn good one but I never want to do that) My grandfather is an entrepreneur, but really it’s just that he has his own chimney sweeping business. It’s just him going to houses and cleaning their chimneys and doing installs. He makes damn good money but has almost died several times. I don’t want to do that either, no way.

My mom is leaning towards me sticking in college and finding a major (though honestly I don’t think one exists that will work for me :c ) 

My grandpa is leaning towards me learning a trade like HVAC or electrician. I’m not really built like someone that would be in those positions. I’m small and skinny. Not muscular at all. I want to work on that though.

Me myself, I’d say I’m a creative without vision, without focus. I have ideas but can never execute them due to procrastination, fear of failure, and lack of time. Ideally I’d love to write books but I don’t have A.) time and B.) I can’t make a career out of that. 
I’d love to do something with video editing, since that and photoshop are hobbies I enjoy. I can’t really see myself finding an honest living with that, though.

People like Elon Musk are inspiring to me because of their ability to utilize their creativity in a way that allows focus and vision, two things I lack. Elon is extremely smart though, I have a harder time with science and math.

_______________

I feel like that last bit might have been a bit much, but maybe it’ll be helpful. 

Bottom line: I’d ideally like to stay in college and find a major, but I just can’t handle the useless classes thrown in that aren’t related to the major itself. It’s extremely annoying to me and I almost feel like it’s for profit. Does anyone have any failsafe major ideas?

238,"Hi all,

I've been working at my current job for about a year and a half. I work full time at one location, plus Saturdays at a different location, but with the same company. We very rarely have management on site. Two months ago, they hired a receptionist to only work Saturday with me. Before this, I was doing both my job and the receptionist tasks on Saturdays, which was manageable 95% of the time. 

They brought in another receptionist to train her, plus I've been here to help her when she doesn't know how to do something. The problem is that she rarely remembers how to do even the most basic of tasks. I'm at the point where I'm sick of asking her to correct her mistakes, because I've already mentioned them over and over, so I nolonger say anything, and just fix them myself. It ends up being more work for me than if I was still doing both of our jobs. 

Additionally, she over shares her life, and it's apparent that she doesn't have any interest in anyone else in the office. This makes it even more frustrating, because I'll be trying to teach her something so I can go back to doing my job, but she winds up venting to me about things that are completely irrelevant to our work. It's annoying as hell, and just hearing her voice irritates me at this point. I'm not sure how the other person who works on Saturday feels about her, but I've heard her asking her very basic questions as well. 

She's also called in sick three of her 8ish shifts (which I was thrilled about), so I doubt her manager is impressed anyways. 

Should I bring this up with her manager? How do I phrase it if I do bring it up?

239,"I hope you guys appreciate what I have to tell and I hope some of you might give me your opinions or some usefull advice, to help with my problem. 

First to me and my family. I was born into a super conservative catholic polish family. My parents, my grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins, nearly everybody in my family is \*\*super\*\* chrisitan. On easter they visit the church \*\*four times on the same day\*\*. In rural poland you're batized basicly the split second you come out of your moms womb. It's just the way things work, we basicly lived in the middle ages back in the old country.

For the most time I was just part of it. Went to church, got my communion, until I was maybe 15 I never even doubted the religion, I even became a ministrant for quite some time. That was long after we moved from germany to poland, when I was four years old. 

 I can't say I was the brightest child. I always easily followed orders and what others said to me was was law, I followed every order I got and went on with it. Even though I was pretty smart with physics, mathmatics and languages (and still am) it never really came to my mind, that maybe I shouldn't be just a lamb, waiting to be culled. It was easier to not think about it. But I was thinking a lot. I thought about the possibility, that all this was fake and religions were bullshit. But I was afraid, what life without religion would mean, especially living without believing in an afterlive, because nothing scares me more, than death itself.

 So I went on with it. And with time my questions only grew and grew in numbers and size, especially with my increasing amount of fascination about the laws of physics and evolution, basicly everything that contradicts religion. I went on in thinking, that maybe god and science could coexist in peace, but with age I started to see how this simply couldn't be.

 I'm 23 by now and moved out of my parents home. They are loving and caring persons and they never would sacrifice our relationshio for their religion, but I sure as hell know, that I would break their hearts, by telling them I don't believe in Jesus or God no more. And it sure is hard to live and go on with it. Especially because my parents went through some hard times in the last years, with their marriage and some pretty hard loses in our family, to whom faith was their only help. 

 I hope that I someday may come to terms with religion, my parents and me, but I don't really know how I could achieve this. Maybe some of you could help?

Thank you for reading and I hope you have some advice for me maybe. I hope to hear from similar stories. Oh and before someone asks, no I'm not gay and this was never a matter to begin with.",22Sep2018,0
240,"I (23f) recently graduated from college and moved back to my childhood home to be closer to more job opportunties. My parents moved an hour away to my grandparents house after they died, and left the house semi-empty for about 3 years. We came down maybe once a week to mow or do general upkeep of the place but no was has lived there full time in years.

&amp;#x200B;

Since moving back home, I am dealing with a nut of a neighbor who lives two doors down from me. She has a sick mother living in her home. The house which is in between us, was just sold, and supposedly the people who lived there are also sick. I met the home owner of next door, he is about 29 and told me his step mom and dad are sick (those are living there).

&amp;#x200B;

The lady two doors down from me, has to watch my every move if I am in my yard. She went as far as to threaten abuse if I move garbage in my yard. And caused a fit because I had to move my parents truck on to property between me and next door neighbors. The property owner again sided with me as the truck was on my property and not trespassing.

&amp;#x200B;

The neighbor lady, in front of my father stopped her vehicle on our back alley, and had to watch me weedwack the yard. I overheard her telling her mother, that she ""needed to watch this situation"". As my father came home early to help me move funiture and clean up our rental (other side of house) which was damaged over heavy rains. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am scared as its constant survalliance. I simply wish to live at this property, to get myself financially settled. All the other neighbors around us are all family friends who I could talk to no sweat. Its literally this women two doors down causing issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do many 20 somethings go through this with older neighbors? I drink socially, but hardly have company over, and am single,  I might be at this property M-F, as I have a temp job near my parents home, which has me work weekends. There is no wild parties, drug usage, or tons of cars in and out. Its simply I live there just to work.

Any way to help me?

244,"My mom has been a stay at home mom since she was about 40 years old and had kids. She never had a career of her own and never really made a lot of friends after she stopped working.

She is home all day and only leaves the house to walk our dogs twice a day (short walks). Her only friends don’t live in the same state as us and she calls them a couple times a week. She isn’t good at making friends either. 

She is very pessimistic and has the mentality “when ______ happens, I’ll be happy.” Which... as we all know is bad. You should work to be content in the moment, not from some external event. 

Her and my dad don’t have a good relationship either.

Recently she was diagnosed with cancer (stage zero so it’s not suuuuper serious, although still serious) and she has been taking it fine. She just got a cold a week before her survey and now says she’s going to have to cancel it (because you can’t be sick before it?). She says, “it’s going to take me 6 months to get over this [cold]” and huffs. 

She does that a lot when things don’t go her way or as planned. She huffs and sighs as if it’s a huge issue that can’t be solved. Even if it’s the small inconvenience (i.e. goes to the store to get milk and then the store is out of milk). She doesn’t adapt, she gets anxious and way too stressed over issues that CAN be resolved, although it may be a little extra work.

245,"So the point of this is my boss’s boss is going to sit in on my 6 month probationary review (probationary period is 12 months). This is not the norm and I’ve been given different reasons for it from different people.
I work in higher ed in a very large department, but on a 3 person team. My previous boss recently left for a better job and they promoted from with in. Now objectively the new boss lacks people skills and has no idea how to manage... he could learn, but man has it been messy. And my last boss left a lot of problems and, in my opinion, my new boss’s inability to get a grip on the situation allowed for interpersonal problems to explode. It’s been very toxic for the myself, my 1 colleague, and this new boss- and that’s our entire team. It got so bad my boss obviously went to his boss. Now her favoritism for him is real and it runs deep. And she took it upon herself to clean up this mess, which to my knowledge she’s never stepped in at this level. She manages the supervisors at 26 different locations and the number of employees that fall under her is vast.
In her involvement, she’s been the hardest on me. Automatically thinking the worst of my intentions and making assumptions about me based on hearsay. She went out of her way to criticize me in front of the team. And I think she either just does not like me or is making me out to be the fall guy in all of this or both. Now my boss has actually messed up enough that I could take him to HR - it’s complicated but there’s a workman’s comp issue that was filed on my colleuages behalf and he royally mis- stepped. But I haven’t gone to HR because I’m a probationary employee (at will) with less protection and realize that HR only works to protect the company— and my boss’s boss dislike of me and favoritism for my boss only complicates it more.
So the whole situation sucks. And next week is my review and I’m thinking my boss and his boss are going to mark me as the reason for the mess and as a result I’ll have a bad review or maybe even be fired (if you don’t have a passing review you’re out). But I don’t know. And I’m wondering if I should go to HR to see if I have any support in case this does become worst case scenario. No matter what I’m still at will- so if I get my boss involved with an HR issue, then it’s only going to make his boss come after me more. Of course I’m looking for other work and have had some interviews, but it takes time. Anyone have any advice? Especially about what HR could offer me? Thanks",22Sep2018,2

i am a 16 year old guy
school and work are my main time consumers

currently work at a grocery store in produce department

mentally iffy manager, non social or enjoyable job/ the scheduling is not really accommodating to my student needs 

i have a hard day at school, i work out at the gym all the time, the last thing i want to do is come to work and be constantly walking back and forth from the cooler and the sales floor. 

meat department has a open position
the job is simple, person selects meat they want,
u wrap and give to the customer. 

i work 6pm-10pm and that equals slow day, barely any customers. my ideal schedule is 6pm-10pm sun-thurs. and have fri sat off(technically whole day sunday just work afternoon). and according to all employees there, the department manager is great and flexible with his student employees 

it’s been 4 days since i put a indirect request in. today i will walk up to the store manager and directly tell him i would like to switch. After that, if he needs more time, i give them one week. if i hear nothing, i go get a interview at another place my friends work that they tell me they can give me that schedule i really want. once i go and get set up there, i give my 2 weeks notice at current location. sound like a good plan?

when i speak to store manager, i don’t want to say i am quitting unless u switch me because that’s a dick move, but i will make up the reason as to why i want to switch which is, “i want to pursue a culinary degree after i graduate high school, and working in meat would be a great experience”. 

all honesty, i been very unhappy with my position for months already but was in the mind set of “fuck it”. i am done, i feel i desire better, i was felt if i did quit, they would take it personally. i am acting as professional as i can, and hoping

Sarah is the loudest in the group and has kind of asserted herself as the ""alpha"" within our circle. She is already the most liked person in the class. The problem is, I feel like I can never get a word in edgeways because of her. Every time I try to say something or make a joke, she will interrupt and take over the conversation. She is constantly hoarding everyone's attention and seemingly can't go a single minute without domineering the conversation. 

She also jumps on every opportunity to socialize with others before anyone else can. An example of this is when another classmate asked someone to go with her to the canteen bc she has anxiety. I had started to offer to go with her, but Sarah loudly jumped in and said she would instead.

On top of this, another person within the group, lets call her Amy, is constantly sucking up to Sarah. Example: in a group chat the other day Amy said that Sarah's classwork would ""outshine"" everyone elses.

I've completely lost all confidence because of this and feel like I can't even speak anymore. I'll be the first to admit that I'm fairly insecure, with a history of mental health issues and being left out by friends in the past. So it's something I'm hypersensitive to. I've also always been ""the funny friend"" in the past and that made me feel good about myself, and it's hard for me being in a situation where someone else is constantly getting all the laughs.

short information about me:

* 15 years old boi
* weirdo, known in my school for being the tech/gaming/maths dude
* im not extremely popular, however most of the people in my school are nice to me, and i have some people i would call friends, but not too many (i guess about 10)
* i am really fucking ugly, and i am not the only one who thinks so, many other people think so. i know they dont mean it in an insulting way, they are just being honest with me.
* i dont have any experience at all with relationships, i just have more female friends than male friends (idk why tbh, probably a coincidence)

so one of my female friends introduces me to her friend (i am just gonna call her juliet), they have known each other since elementary school (i think?). she is really nice, but we dont really speak a lot or do anything like that. however, i kinda found her good looking, but i had no chance with her so i was not really thinking a lot about her. (that should be like 3-4 months ago)

however, some days after that, i get a message from the friend who introduced me to juliet. she told me, that i was gonna be in the same informatics class with her since we both chose high level class and the school of juliet usually collaborates with my school to make a high level informatics class (there are usually not enough people who are interested in high level informatics). that made me happy, however i still felt like i would never have a chance with her, so i kept on not thinking a lot about her.

about one or two months later, we started chatting on whatsapp. i dont even remember how it started, but we have around 45.000 written messages right now. however, since i am really introverted, we didnt meet for some time in real life. 3-4 weeks after we started chatting, she wrote me that she wasnt sure, but she thought she had a crush on me. i had no idea what to tell her, since i wasnt really sure what i wanted... and to this day, i have no idea. she even went as far as asking me what i would expect from my partner..., however the conversation quickly stopped since my parents wanted me to do something

some weeks after that, she referred to the conversation as ""when i thought, that i was in love with you"". i took that as a sign of ""i am no longer interested in you"". no problem, we just keep chatting, and keep it casual.

some weeks after that, i went to an anime convention with lots of people. she couldnt be there since she had no time, however her friend (the one that introduced me to her) was one of the people. Somehow, we started talking about juliet, and she basically told me that juliet still had a crush on me. i was really irritated. 

does she mean it serious? we are still chatting everyday, and sometimes meet irl, but i didnt notice anything special when we talked... thanks for every single answer! :)

My mom heard what my little brother said under his breath and called him out for it and ask him to repeat what he said and he did in a normal tone an then she was like “you better stop with that disrespectful attitude” and I was just like (in my head) he didn’t even say anything that bad he just wanted to complete a game. So then my brother was like “Ok” and what my mom said back kinda hit a nerve, she was like “don’t you ever talk back to me” then I had to intervene and say “He literally just said Ok?!” And my mom was like “Are you stupid? Don’t butt in my conversation” and I was like “It’s not my fault you have a superiority complex” and went to my room. So what do you guys think? Was she out of line?",22Sep2018,1

I’ve began to feel very lonely at times and like I really don’t fit in anywhere. I feel like I’ve become even more antisocial since coming here though which I think is why I don’t have as many friends. I wanted to come to College and try to be more social and make as many friends as I can, but now it seems like all of the cliches are already formed, and while I have my friends I still feel out of touch with everyone. I’m scared that I’m eventually gonna lose the friends I have as I become more antisocial, and eventually I’ll be completely on my own. I’m in clubs so I am hoping I can try to make more friends in those but I’m still very scared, my biggest fear is being lonely.

268,"Long backstory:

My dad has been a self-employed freelancer for the past 20 years or so. As a result, his income has been extremely variable, making $150,000 or more in good years and as little as $30,000 in bad years. Since 2009, it's been more bad years than good. Things have been a little better in the past few years but he still doesn't have a lot of money and usually lives paycheck to paycheck.

I'm in college and I have a scholarship program that pays me a stipend to go to school in addition to paying my tuition and fees, and I have a job offer for after graduation that I plan to accept. I've been frugal and have a good bit of money saved. I'm financially stable for the foreseeable future.

Now the issue at hand:

In the past few months my dad has had a hard time finding work and has had to borrow several thousand dollars from me in the meantime. I can afford to lend him the money and I don't really mind because I know he'll be good for it eventually. But he's always been kinda frivolous with his money and it seems like that's part of the problem. Consistently buying name-brand and luxury groceries, spending money on ""supplements"" that I'm 90% certain are completely ineffective, etc.

I don't mind lending him money but it bothers me when I come home and he's buying weird natural supplements and that sort of thing.

I feel like it would be okay to gently tell him I don't mind lending him money when he needs it but I don't like the way he handles his finances. Would it be my place to do this? ",22Sep2018,3
269," 

I apologize if I don't make any sense since I've been upset for three days and counting. My girlfriend's cousin from New Zealand is coming into town next weekend and they're making plans to go to Disneyland (from Cali) then go to Las Vegas after that so she can have a second driver plus to spend time with her and the family. My gf called at 3am (Works NOC shift/Nurse) on early Tuesday morning telling me to request next weekend off and I told her that I need specific days since my schedule is always finalized every Friday. On Thursday, my supervisor saw my request and wasn't going to approve those days off since he was also planning to take a 4th trip to fly out to San Jose to see his newly born nephew but he canceled his flight for me because I rarely request any days off nor I haven't taken my vacation within a few years working with the company but my supervisor told me to ask everyone of my coworkers if they are okay with it. My other coworkers were okay with it but 2 of my coworkers had to call-in/notify their supervisor at their second job and 3rd coworker had to email her professor that she wasn't coming to the next session. After all the rearranging with everyone, I notified my gf that I am settled for next weekend but when I said that to my gf, she said to me that the plan has changed since her cousin and her changed it on Wednesday therefore she had 1 extra day to tell me cancel my request off. So I am looking like a fool and an asshole (excuse my language) to my peers with all the rearranging and pulling strings just for me to have that weekend off that she wants me to cancel my request. I tried talking to her but shes avoiding to answer my messages or to talk about the situation and to be honest, I am really upset with her that I did all these things for her by going through all the hassle for nothing and its inconsiderate....especially making me look like an asshole when my supervisor canceled his flight.

270,"Okay, idk if i’m just paranoid and my damaged ass thinks everything is so suspicious, but i just have to be sure. I matched with A on tinder 2 days ago. He goes to a university 45 minutes from me. We kind of hit it off right away and he asked for my number almost immediately (nothing shady there, when i say we hit it off we truly did). The first day of texting he told me we should go out sometime and of course i agreed to. I haven’t really been asked out on a date in a while and we had a lot in common so far. 

The part that has me sort of suspicious is that he’s really pushing to see me. I mean this was after he asked me questions and after he was like “you’re literally my dream girl” because i said things that truly impressed him. But he seems like he’s already jumping the gun almost. Like last night (he was pretty buzzed or drunk when he said this) he was like “you should come to (the city he’s from) sometime” and he talks as if he is in this to date me, but we’ve only been talking since Thursday. 

We were supposed to hangout Sunday because that was the first day i said i was available, but his family is here from his city and he said it would basically be watching football and playing yard games. This sounds fun as fuck and something i’d totally love to do, but idk him on that level YET so i don’t really wanna go. I told him i have to babysit Sunday and that we could Tuesday (Monday’s are my busiest days). He said that is completely fine and maybe we could go to the shelter and get a kitten (he has been wanting one, and after he saw my 3month old kitten now he really wants one). But then he said “i may be tired after practice (he plays baseball) so do you mind chilling at my place?” 

He wants to watch movies but i hate going to the guys place the first time i meet them because it’s like ok are you in this just to have sex or?

He isn’t like creepy or anything, he’s actually very nice. He hasn’t made one sexual comment yet which is more than fine and he doesn’t say anything way out of line, but is this weird? He hasn’t given me a vibe that all he wants is to hookup but i just don’t know. I’m not very good with reading boys so i’m not sure if maybe he’s just excited or what

Please help me out here, i think this guy is great and i really hope he has good intentions (which my gut tells me he does, but i tend to be naive sometimes) i just want to be 100% sure.

273,This has been on my mind for a couple of weeks now. I am in high school and one of my friends from my friend group always picks someone from our group to harass by talking bad about them and insulting them. I guess it was my turn for the last month or so and I fought back unlike everyone else in the group and it escalated. We were sitting around before class started and then me and him got into it so I said some stuff about his dad that left his family. I know that was wrong but he has been constantly on me for weeks and I just lost my cool. He got so mad that he jumped up from his chair and grabbed me by the collar and leaned me over in my chair I was sitting sideways in the chair. We were like this for about twenty seconds just saying a few things and then when I sat up he gave me a little slap. I did the same thing to him when we were standing and then he gave me a bigger slap. I at that moment just put my hands up and said that I will not do this and we both sat down. This was done in front of all of our friends and a couple of other people. I did want to fight and I keep thinking I should have but we are in our last year of school and I don't want to lose my shot at college. My pride is hurt I keep thinking I should have acted. What should I have done? Thanks.,22Sep2018,2
274,"I've interviewed for a position that will start in the next 3 or 4 weeks.  I'm pretty sure I have the job, but they are waiting for me to hear back from the local Office of Vocational Rehabilitation to determine if OVR will cover the costs of my training/national certification or they themselves will.

&amp;#x200B;

I have an international trip planned for 6 months from now (5 months after my prospective hire date) that has already been paid for in full by a friend since June.  

&amp;#x200B;

Is this something I should divulge before the official hire/contract sign or should I wait until after, when we are discussing my scheduling post-training/certification?  This sort of position hinges on number of client hours within a certain time period, so I'm fairly certain it would just be an issue of doubling up some client hours before the trip and after to keep up and I'm more than willing to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just not sure when I should come forward with this information.  I don't want to be hired and have them feel like I've deceived them, but I really hope that this won't be detrimental to them officially offering the position, either.

275,"In 2012, I lost my job. My wife and kids had to move in with my parents and collect unemployment while I tried to get a new job. After several months of rejection, I was able to land a job, and right before Christmas. Once the kids were done opening their presents, my wife and decided to see a movie. It had some stars in it I was familiar with, so we gave it a chance. Upon arriving at the theater, I was surprised to see lines of people waiting to see the same movie. After an hour of waiting, we were seated, and I ended up next to a girl who sang along to all the musical numbers. It bugged me so much that I posted the experience to Facebook, and turned it into a kind of movie review:

https://m.imgur.com/gallery/AmK21

A friend of mine said that I should make it public because he ""chortle heartily"" and wanted to share it. I obliged and by the end of the day, the post had been shared 30 times. By the end of the next day, it had been shared 300 times. Some time on the third day, someone posted it to reddit, gained millions of views and hit the front page. And there were hundreds of people who copied it on Facebook for social media clout. But by and large, people were still giving me credit. 

After a couple weeks, the internet moved on. I thought I had heard the last of it. Then, exactly one month after my original post, this happened:

https://youtu.be/HkMUlSaH7YE

It was exhilarating to hear the stars of the show read my joke. I won the internet! I've told this story 1000 times. It made me happy that even though I am a nobody, people liked my stuff and responded to it globally. 

Then in 2018, the very same friend who convinced me to make my original post public contacted me to share this:

https://mobile.twitter.com/westendproducer/status/982748824371376128

This guy had stolen my joke, made it worse, didn't give me credit, and was using it to sell his book. I was pissed. Through all the times people had stolen my joke, no one was making any money off of it. Now, this self-described theatre impresario was trying to get rich off of my work! I didn't know what to do. I posted to his Twitter telling him that he was stealing my joke, but what more than that could I do? I reached out to a copyright lawyer who never called me back. And for as much stink as I raised, nobody else seemed to care.

So now, it's been about 4 months since I found out about this book. I live in the US, and the book's author is in the UK. I don't know what to do. What was a treasured memory is now a bitter pill to swallow.

TL;DR: I wrote a funny movie review in 2012 that went viral. Six years later, some guy stole it and is using to sell his book. He lives in another country.

Should I let it go or pursue this guy for royalties?",22Sep2018,1

I don’t know why it bothers me- especially since I do the same thing (less often, but still makes me a hypocrite). Maybe it’s because he knows I don’t like when he smokes, and does it anyway, or because he’s not very responsible about it sometimes. It’s caused a couple fights between us, so I ended up telling him I was going to stop getting involved. It’s helped to stop the fighting, but it still feels like an area of conflict between us.

278,"This is a stage of my life where everyday feels like heavy rain. Im only 20 years old. My irresponsible parents forced me to get myself a job while studying, so I can provide myself my own allowance and expenses, so I did. (I guess this part needs it own rant on raisedbynarsicists)  Now it feels like everything is being thrown at me. 

I dont know what I am. Am I an employee or a student first? If I prioritize the other too much, I lose the other. My case is very unique because you dont see a lot of art students being employed at a corporate job while studying. Mainly because the schoolwork itself is too much, (you are required to submit projects that cost so much, create this or that in such a short amount of timr etc)  I only have one semester left. This feels like forever. Im forced to be at my job or else I will literally stop going to school and wont get my diploma. I havent been getting sleep. I feel numb.

 I guess, I just need someone to tell this to or talk to, the path that im in right now is very lonely. No one relates to my situation around my group of friends, theyre given allowances and anything they ask for. I just wished my parents respected my age and situation. 

Any advice out there for me? Anything will be very much appreciated.🙁",22Sep2018,1
280,"This may sound really shallow to have so many options but being a single guy who hasn’t been in a relationship for 2 years I’ve kept my options open.

I’m 17 and I’m conflicted between which of the following girls I should try and organise a date with. I’ll assign nicknames so as not to reveal my (or any of their) identities.

1) The crush
We have a lot of classes together and get along pretty well. I can’t tell if she’s into me but I do know she at least likes me. She also definitely has a feeling I like her from what her friends have told me but I have never confirmed it.

2) The 10/10
I don’t really like to rate girls on a scale of 1-10 but she is the stereotypical hot blonde perfect 10. I haven’t spoken to her much but in the small amounts we have spoke she seems alright.

3) The crush’s bff
She’s not ugly by any stretch of the imagination but I imagine she would be overlooked by most if not all other guys. I also used to overlook her but I can’t help but fall for her personality. She’s funny and all around a great person but idk if I just like having her as my girl best friend and not my girlfriend.

 4) Down to earth
I am in all of her classes and we get along pretty well. I’ve started talking to her more the past few days and to be honest in that time she’s become probably more my crush than the girl I actually nicknamed “the crush”. She’s attractive but not in a superficial way like the 10/10 and doesn’t seem to put as much effort into being “hot” like the 10/10 seems to. A hoodie and a ponytail looks great on her. In writing this I’ve started to realise she’s probably the one I’d pick if I could have any of them.

Also if you guys have any recommendations for the type of place to take one of these girls that would be appreciated.",22Sep2018,0

I dont go out or splurge on luxuries, im just trying to become financially stable. I've even considered moving back with my parents but I dont want to burden them. They are both hardworking school teachers and don't make too much. My uncles on the other hand are very hardcore business people. One of them is a Real estate investor/landlord and the other is a new and used car dealership owner. They both are worth millions and hardly communicate with my family.

&amp;#x200B;

Our politics also differ heavily from theirs. We are more liberal and pro workers, they are heavy right wing that are agianst unions and minium wage increases, they are pro trump, anti social services,want lower taxes etc.. So we dont usually talk much because our family cannot relate to them. Anyways, since I was struggling to get by I figured I would ask them for help at our family gathering the last night.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked my uncle who is a real estate investor if he could offer me any apartment of his that isn't rented, just for a year so I could get back on my feet finacially and build up savings. I explained to him how I was struggling and he flat out said NO. He said I need to pay full price because he isn't ""running a charity"". He clearly didn't need the money but was willing to let me suffer because for it.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I asked my other uncle who has thousands of cars if he could give me one because I could afford to purchase and he declined as well. I felt so betrayed by them. They are willing to let me struggle financially so they can make an extra buck when they are already millionaires.

I would be content working any job that he offered because I am very interested in the type of work, so I accepted. 

At first he said that I could start the entry level position the following week but didn't give me any specific details.

Today my sister in law (husband's sister) was showing me the dress she bought for my niece. It's white. Not off white or ivory or anything like that. It's white white. It's short, long sleeved and has a layer of white lace over the entire thing. 

Now I'm not into traditional wedding stuff because that's just not my style (husband and I eloped, and have never worn wedding rings in the 10 years we've been married). But from the looks of their invitation and events leading up to the wedding like the engagement party and bridal shower, etc, Cousin's wedding seems to be pretty traditional. And I know that wearing white is a huge no-no.

When she showed me the dress I actually laughed because I thought she was joking. And when I pointed out you aren't supposed to wear white my other sister in law said ""well Cousin's sister wore white to my wedding.""

300,"I have a plethora of wedding showers, bachelorette parties, and baby showers coming up. There is one of the above three scheduled for every weekend between this weekend and the beginning of November. (Then there are the weddings.)  


I'm 37 and married. I remember doing all of this with friends and family in my mid to late 20's (maybe early 30's). And it was tiring even back then. 

&amp;#x200B;

But yeah. I'm so exhausted from work that once my weekend rolls around, I don't have the energy for all these things. (Not to mention the money for all these gifts.) I wouldn't be so adverse, except that a lot of these gatherings exclude my husband and include an array of people I've never met and do not know. I only know the brides and mothers.

&amp;#x200B;

So... I'm tempted to take it week by week and casually bow out at the last minute if I'm feeling particular wiped out. My job is very demanding, emotionally and physically. By the time Friday comes, my body feels like it was hit by a truck. Not only that, but I'm a few months out from major abdominal surgery (huge cancer scare) and burying my father, who died not long after I'd just buried my mother. And so all of that stress has worn me down too.

I guess my one fear is that if I bow out of most of these (I want to flake on all of them, considering how I feel as of today) that people will be hesitant to invite me to future events. That's probably an idiotic paranoia on my part. I think the paranoia stems from too much stress and exhaustion.

304,"Hi, Reddit. As the title says, I've had a compulsive/habitual lying issue for as long as I can remember.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't matter what someone asks about. For some reason, I just feel more comfortable lying than telling the truth. Telling the truth makes me anxious. I've lied about what I've eaten for breakfast to saying I'm okay if I'm not. I started to try and break it about 5 months ago with the help of my SO\[16M\], and I have gotten a lot better. All I've been doing is just trying to catch myself in a lie and correct it using ""No, wait, that was a lie. I meant to say this..."" and I haven't had to do that in a while.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is when I don't catch myself in a lie/don't bother to correct it and I'm too afraid to admit it; especially if the lie transpires into something bigger that I can't correct because it might cause a fight. It's not as simple as ""well just don't lie"" because I've led myself to use lies as a safety net, even if there's really no need to have one. I'm afraid I'll slip back into constant lying if I don't start correcting lies I know I've told.

311,"TLDR : My friends ghost me and I'm not sure if they're my friends anymore. I want to distance myself but Im afraid. 

it's 4 of us and we have big exams coming in 3 weeks so we're all studying hard. I'm a guy and it's 2 girls and another guy and before this it was just me and the 2 girls and I was always happy. This was when I started college and before that I was always depressed and cried myself to sleep because I had nothing but online friends. I met the two girls and they changed me, I was much happier and I performed better at everything I did . I play csgo and a bunch of racing games and my performance just spiked the first months of college with them.

 So I'm really happy, living the dream and I really liked one of the girls but she has a boyfriend and I understood that. I never pushed boundaries and what not because she was a great friend as well and I didn't wanna lose her. Fast forward a 2 months, this guy (well name him Jack) starts getting closer to us and I was always happy to make more friends since at that point I was more confident and my self esteem was ok. I was never thinking about things I didn't wanna think about at night and not as anxious anymore.

He got closer and closer to us till it was 4 of us hanging out everywhere. 3 of them speak a language I don't and it hurts whenever they do not because theyre talking about me but because whje they do, they're always laughing. Fast forward to now, 9 months after I started college, I'm back to square one I'm depressed, I sit in the toilet and just cry and in bed too. We have a group chat and I'm completely ignored there so I just stopped replying. In college, it's the three of them walking together and me either infront or at the back. It hit me today the worst that's why I'm here. Today in the group chat the girl I liked said I'm gonna be at Cafe X to study at x time. The other girl replied can I come too or something and she said yeah and the message after was ""Jack COME TOO"" and she didn't say anything about me. 

My heart hurts and I don't know what to do. I'm back to this depressed ass state and I mentioned my exams are coming soon. I have no motivation at all to do anything which includes studying. The whole time I was in college, I felt my mental state depended on them. Sometimes the ghosting would be all day and I'd come home feeling like completely shit and other days they talk to me and I crack jokes and make them laugh. I honestly just like seeing them happy when I do it. I think distancing myself from them would be the best, but I'd have 0 friends again though I don't even know if I'm their friend anymore.

A girl is friends with my long-term boyfriend. They met after we got together. This girl is single and tells my bf that she had a rough week.

Bf says: **How can I cheer you up, no I won't say eating ice cream LOL.**

Seconds later, the girl sends him a screenshot of a dating app and it shows a picture of a random dude with a blue border. The blue border means you are super liked by someone. The girl says; **the blue border means they want to eat ice cream :)** Boyfriend responds with: Lol So I hear you are a Tinder professional.

What could eating ice cream mean in this particular context? The girl does not like eating ice cream. I asked bf, he says its a joke. When i ask what the joke is exactly, he says I don't know/remember. \[text message is from a year ago, and yes it is still relevant, yes they still talk\]

My mind immediately goes to **ice cream = oral sex.** But, if they have an affair, why would she send him photos of other dudes that want to eat HER pussy? Yes I had permission to read his texts.

Side note; in the same conversation she told my bf she got withdrawals symptoms from him. He says thats a joke because they did not see each other often at the time

314,"For several years, I have struggled with anxiety, as I know now. I used to be and am unable to speak to anyone without my eye twitching, my hands and arms going numb, and me getting close to tears in some cases.


Regarding ocd, I often have to touch “hot spots”. They are specific points that I FEEL like I HAVE to touch. If I don’t, I get very itchy and hot. It becomes extremely uncomfortable if I’m unable to touch these hot spots.
e.g. yesterday I was sitting in class, and I felt a hot spot on the back of my teachers neck. Since I obviously am unable to touch the back of a teachers head, the only way I could relieve the feeling was to make myself think I did. That didn’t work and the need got stronger. I had to imagine pressing a mallot into the back of her head repeatedly. Now obviously I’d never do this, nor did I consider doing it, but it was the only way I could trick my brain into no longer feeling that.
Right now I feel hot spots underneath all of my finger nails which is a problem because I can’t exactly do that.
I once felt like I had to cut off my hand to reach a hot spot inside my wrist .


Writing this right now is triggering it really badly and I have to stop because I feel hot spots all over my body.


I’ve also suffered from sleep paralysis. Ive seen an astronaut, a clown, a shadowy man, and my boyfriend with an  inhumanly large smile. It’s terrifying. 
I get extremely anxious when I’m in the dark, and have to sleep with a night light or I can’t fall asleep. I used to have to sleep perfectly straight without any part of my body outside of my duvet or I thought I’d be murdered.


Whenever I have sleep paralysis, I wake up in the same, perfect straight position clutching my chest, no matter how I fell asleep. 


After a lot of research online, I’ve concluded that my mother is an extreme narcissist. My father is an alcoholic in denial.
I’ve told them about these issues, and my mother so far has said that she feels the same way and that it’s normal because she “has to press her lip against a glass before drinking from it.”
They refuse to acknowledge that I have anxiety and says that everyone feels this way.


I’ve gone to a GP and told her my symptoms, and she said that I show signs of ocd and anxiety. She said that I should see a psychiatrist and get cognitive behavioral therapy.
The doctor told my mom about this and my mom said “yeah fine we’ll do that.” My mother then began to cry and state “I will do whatever I can do help her, I never knew she was suffering” and then the second we got back to the car she made me feel extremely guilty about going. She kept repeating “oh well are you sure you NEED to go? Is there even anything wrong with you? They’re used to treating people with actual problems so they won’t take you seriously.”
This has completely put me off wanting to go because I feel like I’m moaning even though I know that how I feel cannot possibly be normal. 


Oh and I don’t have any motivation at all to do anything ever. I can’t focus in any of my classes and I’ve only gotten by with dumb luck. 
 
I would like to seek help but since I’m under 18 I can’t seek it without my parent or guardian. 
I’m not quite sure what to do and I know that if I go she will continue to ridicule me and make me feel horrible for trying to get the help that I think I need. 


TL;DR: I believe I have severe anxiety and OCD. My doctor agrees with me and my mother pretends to in the company of others but when we’re alone she undermines it because she thinks I’m being dramatic. I want help but I’m under 18 and can’t get it without my parents. Advice????? ",22Sep2018,5

I suggested that we should teach my grandma how the more modern technology works as she’s clueless and I don’t want my life to be made more difficult because of this. So just an example of how she doesn’t know how technology works would be when I visited Mexico and decided to play Pokémon Go

In case you don’t know how the game works (somehow), you need to walk while using your phone, it’s meant played while walking longer distances such as doing errands, that kind of distance 

So I’m playing and my grandma keeps telling me to put it away because of how I’m using an expensive phone (I had a $60 Android phone at this time and not my iPhone 7) and that it’s going to get robbed (we weren’t in a dangerous place in Mexico, it was one of the more peaceful locations in Durango), I kept on telling her that I need to have my phone out for this game I’m playing and she says I can play it at home, I keep on telling her how the game works and she wouldn’t listen until when my mom explained to her how the game worked, my grandma then complained about how it’s a stupid concept and that it makes you more vulnerable for being robbed as if I didn’t know that was a risk, I was inches away from them and I always hold a tight grip on my phone when using it in public 

I’m worried that if she moves in with us here in The US and sees the different uses of technology (where she lives, with my cousins, there’s only a computer and an Xbox, but they mostly use a TV, my cousins are almost always at school or doing other errands so she doesn’t know well how anything other than a 90’s phone or TV works) she might try limiting our uses of them using her lack of knowledge of how things work

I’m worried that she’ll limit my use of the internet and Xbox because she paranoid that I’ll be stupid enough to tell strangers my *very personal information* and get myself in danger (she had to warn me about not touching outlets when my hands are wet even though I was 13 and am fully aware what not to do around outlets), when I suggested teaching her about more modern technology to my mom she got mad about how I’m suggesting stuff before we even know if she can move over, but I want to suggest this so we can be prepared and not struggle once she already can move over, so planning stuff ahead",22Sep2018,1

The problem is, I'm worried that if I do this, my mom &amp; her side of the family (all in PA) might hate me for the rest of my life.

343,"Tldr at bottom

Halfway August, my fiancé and I adopted a dog from his brother. My fiancé's brother didn' t feel like he could take care of the dog since they had a second baby coming.

We had long conversations about it and I finally decided that it would be best to get the dog. Our other options were

1. A strange family adopting him. This wouldn't be a great option since the dog is 11.5 years old and the average lifespan of this breed is 12/12.5 years. He knows my fiancé already so the move wouldn't give him too much stress to deal with

2. My fiancé's parents adopting him. Also not a great option because they owned him when he was a pup, together with his brother, but they constantly fought. The dogs brother is still with my fiancé' s parents and if they were to adopt him they would either both need mouth protection or they would need to divide the living room space into two.

As you can see, it was the most friendly option for us to adopt him. My fiancé' s parents were really grateful and will pay for all his expenses and babysit regularily since we' re both still studying.

The thing is, I'm not a dog person. Never was. I'm allergic to them but I thought it wouldn't be too much of a problem since the dog is small and seems sweet.

He is, but he is also really smelly. Even though he eats well and has no disease or anything, his farts are the worst (and he does that a lot). He constantly wants attention but I feel incapable of giving it to him because everytime I try to pet him he turns away.

It's not that I don't like him or dogs at all, I do like them and I know how to pet them (other dogs have no issue), but I feel guilty for not giving him the attention he needs and I feel guilty for sending him out of the room when he farts or starts licking himself (I think it sounds gross).

My fiancé and I already made a deal that the dog is more his responsibility because I wasn't a fan to begin with. I'd love to take the dog for walks but he hates them (what dog hates walks??).

I know I might come off as an asshole and I'm sorry. I just want to figure out a way to bond with the dog. It really seems to like me and it's constantly following me around even though I am the one giving him the least attention. It also doesn't help that my allergies are worse and I'm suffering from depression which causes me to dissappear into my own world at times.

Does anyone have any advice on how to bond? I really do want to make more of an effort. Thanks


Tl;dr: We adopted a dog because we didn't have another choice. I can't bond with it because of personal issues. How can I try to bond anyway? ",22Sep2018,3

So yes, she's had a hard start.

In the last years she has started smoking copious amount of weed. (I haven't been so worried about her because I too went through a pothead phase)

But she's turning 18 tomorrow and has only regressed.
Last night she visited my parents house (which she had asked her mom to bring her to) but she refused to even acknowledge us at all. For years she has been very quiet and usually just laid on our couch and would only answer direct questions. But this time she refused to even look at us.

When we started to eat she immediately started gagging after her first bite and vomited in the bathroom.. She stayed in the bathroom for nearly an hour.

What mental issues could cause her to gag and vomit just from trying to eat?

She was admitted to a help center for 2 weeks because she was suicidal.

I am worried about what is going on for her to have so much weed. (her mother doesn't give her money because of this. She has no job... But lives surrounded by houses with a lot of criminal activity going on) she is also home alone all day while her mom is at work.. It's a terrible life I'm sure....

I am really worried for her mental health right now and would not be the least bit surprised if she killed herself tonight.

349,"To the average person my age, and to 'most' people, I'm fairly successful. No, I'm not a millionaire or any of this shit. I'm a Software Developer at a fun, exciting Start Up in Central London. I'm earning above average salary for most \~30 year olds, yet I'm only 19. The office is chill, hours are relaxed, clothing is chill, it's a really fun environment. I am what most people would consider sorta-successful for my age. I should be happy right? Wrong.

I have this nagging HATRED towards everything in the world. Let me start by saying I'm not Xenophobic, Racist, Sexist, or any of these things, I'm politically pretty central and genuinely listen to most opinions, and try must best to understand and hear both sides of the arguments, in fact I hate politics (I'm clearly angry enough as is, I don't need to deal with politics).

&amp;#x200B;

OK, here goes. I think that this entire world is COMPLETELY fucked up, I think that society is fucked up, I think most cultures are fucked up, whether it's eastern culture or western culture. I think we're too technologically advanced, I think the governments are fucked, I think capitalism is fucked, I think money is fucked. I fucking hate everything.

Who's idea of a good life was growing up in a town where no one talks to eachother? No one smiles to eachother, no one says 'Good Morning', no one helps eachother unless money is involved, no one has time for themselves, everyone is just striving to work for a salary that will get them by, but they'll still end up in debt, working to pay the debt which governemtn legalised, but god forbid you need a break from all of this and smoke weed (I don't smoke, but I still think it's stupid that it's outlawed).

 I know, I sound like a hypocrite. In reality, I'm making the best of what I've been dealt. I've accepted that money is a massive motivator in this world, as much as I disagree with it, and I'm making good money as a result. But like, I just hate everything about modern society. Of course, I'm being melodramatic here, free healthcare is great, some modern hobbies I have are great, etc.

I just want to fucking run off into a forest and do what I like, oh wait.. I can't, somehow people OWN land on this earth. Whose fucking idea was that? Who said, 'No, I own this land now you have to pay me to use it'. 

Please, can someone help me with all this anger. As happy as I am in this job, I don't want to be working to buy stuff. I live pretty minimalist, but like if London just had a 'FREE' section where you could build mud huts and stuff, and avoid rent, I'd do that a million times over. My salary should ALL go to my pocket, I shouldn't be obliged to pay such a large chunk of it to a system I disagree with. If I'm struggling one month, but the government are still STEALING £700 out of my bank check each month, there's a fucking problem.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not angry in the sense of vocalising it, hurting things, etc, etc. I'm actually very chill, I just. When I walk around and see things, pretty much everythng since I live in materialistic London, I get passively angry and it sort of builds up inside.

He is a really good guy doing the things a gentle man is supposed to do ie open doors, pay the restaurant bills etc oh also i have been vegetarian for 2 yrs now and guess what he is vegan. Obviously i started having feelings for him and it was going good until he told me he didn't feel any chemistry but he really likes me, and he would like to keep dating to give the chemistry time. he also said i should date other guys in this process. this happened about two weeks ago, i was hurt but i was expecting it.I told him i knew he wan'st that into me, then he asked what made me think that and i said because he only texted me once or twice a week and it was to set up a date (our dates usually last 5-7 hrs) he said its because he doesn't like texting and just prefers to talk in person.  also he says he isn't dating any body else cause he doesn't have time.  at this point my feelings deflated and i went back to online dating again. but recently we had gas explosions in my area and he called the same day to see if i was okay, then he set up another date....the day he told me he din't feel any chemistry he said that his family prefer he marries someone from his country and that we don't have enough things in common for a long term relationship. yesterday i got really tired of this weird relationship (where he does everything a good partner would do but doesn't have feelings for me and i called him to end it (in a peaceful manner explaining that i don't want to be with someone who doesn't have feelings for me..etc). he was calm about it and said i should call im if i change my mind or if i need help with anything.  At this point i have realized that he likes me as a person and doesn't and will never have romantic feelings for me and at most i will be his really good friend. what would you do if you were in my situation given this very long paragraph?.  i am lonely now and the guys am talking to online don't meet the basic criteria and as a result  i am now lowering my standards so i am here..lol..help",22Sep2018,2

A girl is friends with my long-term boyfriend. They met after we got together. This girl is single and tells my bf that she had a rough week.

Bf says: **How can I cheer you up, no I won't say eating ice cream LOL.**

Seconds later, the girl sends him a screenshot of a dating app and it shows a picture of a random dude with a blue border. The blue border means you are super liked by someone. The girl says; **the blue border means they want to eat ice cream :)** Boyfriend responds with: Lol So I hear you are a Tinder professional.

What could eating ice cream mean in this particular context? The girl does not like eating ice cream. I asked bf, he says its a joke. When i ask what the joke is exactly, he says I don't know/remember. \[text message is from a year ago, and yes it is still relevant, yes they still talk\]

My mind immediately goes to **ice cream = oral sex.** But, if they have an affair, why would she send him photos of other dudes that want to eat HER pussy? Yes I had permission to read his texts.

Side note; in the same conversation she told my bf she got withdrawals symptoms from him. He says thats a joke because they did not see each other often at the time. 

My BF also refuses me to meet the girl because he is afraid I go mad.

Well pretty much everyone in the post is laughing about him, a TL;DR would be : He started to date a girl that was pregnant. And right before he picked her up for the date she had sex with another man.

The whole comment section is basically calling him a cuck. So something similar happened to me. But with a difference. My girlfriend had sex with another guy 1 week before we planned our date (But the date was already planned and it was obvious that we would have sex), she isn't pregnant, and on top of that I waited until the relationship with the other guy ended. (They had a open relationship and my girlfriend was still interested in me but I still refused to have sex or a relationship with her) Well until things ended with the other guy, about 3 months later. The thing is, I'm 100% sure that if I would have been more confident and approached her I would have been able to make her end contact with him pretty easily. But I was 17 at that time and I had no experience so I just told myself ""Well whatever, there are other girls"".

I’d be driving B around, taking care of his dogs, cleaning his house, sending emails, etc. He offered me $15/h so I accepted. He talked himself up a lot. He’s like one of those fake Hollywood guys that brag about everything they own and make themselves sound really impressive. He hired me and another girl and he’d pick which one of us would get the full time position after our first week. Halfway through the week he said he wanted to take headshots of us for his website and we’d meet the other two photographers that work for him. We all met up at a park and the two photographers are girls around the same age as me and the other assistant. Swim is 30 something and I just found it weird that all his “employees” are cute young girls. A couple days later he gave me and the other assistant backpacks and told us to put a change of clothes in there, a passport, a phone charger, and other travel items incase we needed to go on a business trip to California for his record label/photography company he’s starting up. The other girl quit and I got the full time position. When it came time to pay me, he gave me this long pitch where he’d only be paying me 1/3 of what he owes me and I’d get the rest of the money in 12 months.

1) I left my keys on the couch in the common area we all share overnight. 
2) I had this Multitool attached to a black key ring on my keys, which was the only one of its color on my lanyard (the rest are all silver). All other key rings were attached to this one black key ring, because it's a different color, so I figured it'd make it easier to find it if I needed to take a keychain off or something. 
3) When I found my keys the next day, I found that my black key ring was gone, with the Multitool as well, and all of my other key rings were kinda in a mess and connected to each other, but not the one different colored ring like I usually have it. 
4) I let one of my suitemates use it before, so he would know that it was on my keyring, and that it would be of some use to him. 
5) I tried asking him if he'd seen it, and he kinda answered quickly and then walked away quickly.

I am confused of what is the meaning behind my employer asking me not to discuss the sponsorship with anyone and what I should do as I am not happy anymore in the company. The money is not very well truth be told and it's below the industry standard. 

Should I stay until I have completed my studies?

Should I start applying to other firms? (too risky IMO to chase two rabbits at the same time)

Should I talk to my employer? (I don't like that notion either)",22Sep2018,2

377,"So about a week or two ago I noticed this girl like all of my vacation pictures each day I uploaded them. I ended up looking at my other posts and noticed she has liked most of them too. I rarely post, so when I noticed it I kind of got excited. I made a new post yesterday just to test and see if it wasn't coincidental, and sure enough she liked that post too. After all this I decided to snoop around on her profile, and I found that she went to the same high school as me. Based on our mutual followers I figured that she was probably a Freshman while I was a Senior. I find her very attractive and I want to DM her and start a conversation, but I don't know how to start it without it sounding creepy. I thought about starting the conversation letting her know the I noticed her liking all my posts, but I feel like that's creepy. I also thought about asking if she went to the same high school as me, but that's pretty clear since she had our field hockey uniform on in a few photos. I have no idea where to start the conversation without sounding creepy or oblivious. Any help would be appreciated.",22Sep2018,2
378,"I  have a co worker that I had a crush on for about a year. I never made a  move because we used to work together, but when I moved across the  country I figured, why not? I still travel back to our old mutual  location often.

The last time I was in  town we made plans to hang out, but a few days before the hangout she  invited a bunch of other people. After that, I told her I liked her and  she said she liked me too. I told her while I'm glad it was mutual, it  really couldn't go anywhere with the distance, but I was happy it was in  the open (we had been flirting for too long).

I  needed closure so that I could be free to date new people and not be  hung up on her, but she must have interpreted this conversation  differently because she started to text / FaceTime me far more often  (sending pictures of herself, making plans for the next time I'm in  town, visiting me, etc.)

The crazy thing  is the second I started going along with it she started going HOT/COLD.  One day she'll be telling me how much she misses me, the next day if I  message her I'll get no response.

I was  planning on hanging out with her next week when I'm back for work, but  now I'm thinking I should just let this thing die out. While I really  like her and she's no longer my coworker (she took a new job), there  doesn't seem to be any upside here, right? I see her when I'm in town  and *maybe* hook up?

I'm  in my own head about this now and I don't know why it bothers me that  she goes totally hot then cold, we aren't dating so she doesn't own me  anything more than that. That said is it worth it to carry on this silly  cross-country texting game? My gut tells me yes, but how do I gently  end it?

**\*\*tl;dr\*\* Cross country non-relationship seems like it is more work than it is worth. Time to let it die out?**",22Sep2018,2
379,"I broke up with my ex-girlfriend about 4 months ago. My brain tells me that its a relationship that I don't want or need.

She didn't treat me badly directly, she's actually a really she had mental health issues and she would push me away and we wouldn't speak for weeks, I couldn't do it and broke it off.

Part of me wants to get back with her and try again but I don't want to get hurt again, I'm lonely and miss the companionship, the other half of me feels like I want to get back into the dating game and try my luck with online dating and meet new people.

380,"So I’m in my early 20s but until grad school I had just been going through the motions of higher education to “get a job” and start life.  When I started my grad program I had told myself not to fall for anyone....and pardon my French, but “fuck me” the first night of classes I met this woman who I was immediately attracted to.  I thought she can’t be as much into me as I am into her...but we ended up just getting along.  I was in between jobs and sorta depressed or not depressed but just hadn’t felt anything for a long time.   But with her I felt something, and it wasn’t that she was just nice, I know now, stupidity that we both have a ‘thing’ for each other.  I would think after almost 2 years we’d stop fumbling with each other when we go ‘out’, but we still do and it has preserved a fun nervous energy in all our time together.  She’s dated other people, as have I when we’ve known each other....but we’ve always kept it private or on a need to know basis.

I always find it odd that we always gravitate towards each other, even when we’re with other friends. Like we’ll have dinner or go out a day before a party, and neither of us will have seen our other mutual friends and we’ll just end up spending most of our time together.  I know this is stupid, but we both seem to get such a kick out of screwing with each other; making fun of each other,  asking each other out on things...she always gets a wicked smile on her face which drives me wild.  I just like spending time with her so much.

Since school ended we haven’t seen much of each other and I’m constantly missing her.  What giving me pause right now is the fact that I’m moving.  I’m in between apartments and am back with family (1 month is already too long).  When I mentioned to her where I’d be working and wanting to move she said I should move nearby and gave me the name of a bunch of landlords and realtors for me to contact.  I’m just worrying about things getting too complex. I shouldn’t because we’re both very mature about everything except the way we act around each other.

TL;DR: Is it weird that I just feel completely at ease, happy, and filled with purpose when I’m with my friend.  I think I’m in love with her, and she wants me to move closer so we can spend more time together.  I’m not sure if I should chance it...I’m young so I mean why not take a chance, but a person has never consumed me this much. I almost wish she’d just say I’m not interested or something, but every time I push physical or flirty boundaries she doesn’t pull away.",22Sep2018,2
381,"So my buddy (of whom I have known for probably at least 10 years), is off on a business trip. Our friend group is fairly close and so last night we decided to hangout and go drinking. 

It's a Friday night, everybody's having a good time. Drinks are flowing. At about 11:30 there's a huge departure. Everyone started drinking early and proceeded to get tired out pretty fast. Everybody but me and my friend's girlfriend left. 

I've known her for quite a while as well (upwards of 5 years) and my friend and her have been together for about 4 years. They've recently been having some relationship issues and are ""on a break"" (Friends references will be accepted) and we got to talking after a while about life, love, and the pursuit of happiness. 

Turns out we've both been going through some very similar stuff recently, just in different contexts, so it turned out to be a really great talk. 

Both of us were really drunk, and we had been kinda awkwardly flirting all night. Just out of no where things start... happening. 

This morning we have the ""Don't tell anyone talk"". Well now it's eating me alive. 

We have a REALLY good alibi, but it's driving me crazy. I feel awful because their relationship has already been on the rocks recently (thus the ""break""). And now if they end up getting back together I MUST tell him. And I'm terrified. I basically know that I have to wait until they decide if they are getting back together after the break, but I'm not sure I can keep my sanity, and this secret.

382,"So I was out last night with a couple of my friends smoking weed, when one of my friends just collapsed and faceplanted, completely unconscious. I was really high so I didn't react instantly, I didn't believe what I saw. We all helped him up but he was still out cold. Eventually he came back but was extremely dopey. Couldn't talk properly etc. We sat him upright and watched him for about 30 mins. He slowly started getting his speech back and was talking fine then. I walked him home and he seemed fine but we were both pretty stoned still. I haven't talked to him since last night but he got home okay. This whole thing really spooked me to be honest. I think the fact that I was high made it worse. I can't stop thinking about it even though I know he's fine. I feel guilty even though I know I shouldn't.

386,"I'm in a city where i know few people. I've become friends with these people only because i've put tremendous effort in to do so. I feel that no one really reaches out to me, or tries to become friends with me. Although  to be fair i don't put myself in many situations where social interaction may happen. 

The business i work for doesn't give me opportunity to be around people my age, or even very many different people for that matter. I see new faces about 2 times a week at work. These people are generally 20-30 years older than me and I would feel uncomfortable attempting to have anything more than just small talk.

My best friend that i moved here with, was my high school sweetheart and we were together for a little over 5 years. I did everything with her. I never really attempted to branch out because i was so focused on her. We split up. Now i'm in a situation where i feel lost/alone a lot. I don't quite know how to spend my days, because i would always adventure with her. I moved out 2 weeks ago into my friends home. They're extremely nice to me. But after having a partner in crime for so long, their company doesn't quite feel the same, or fill this void that i have. 

While i enjoy spending time by myself playing video games, and browsing social media or reddit. I've felt incredibly alone recently. I have what i think is depression, and that may sound kind of weird. But i don't really understand how i feel to be honest. I've always thought of myself as quite mentally strong, and have always been able to overcome my emotions. Which i feel that i can do with this feeling of ""depression"". But im unsure where to go in my life. I want to meet new people, i want to surround myself with friends. But i don't know how. I'm socially awkward sometimes, which was a lot easier to deal with when i had my girl with me. I'm uncomfortable doing certain things like singing/dancing. And it seems the only effective way for someone my age(21) to meet people is to go to parties or bars or nightclubs. I feel so disconnected from the culture surrounding my city and my age. So disconnected from everybody else. Where do i go to meet people? how do i break free from this shell that i have? What are some things i can do to put myself in situations where i can have interaction?

Side note
Truly I'm still in love, and it kills me to know that it's not the same for her anymore. She's in college and has so many friends; so much opportunity to branch out. She constantly had text messages from many different people, and before we broke up she was spending the night at other guys houses, which is one of the reasons we broke up. I feel that she's completely moved on. I'm jealous that it's so easy for her. I'm jealous that she's already got these guys by her side doing things with her. I hate that it's not me. I was very dependent on interacting with her, and i think that's also a reason that she drifted away from me. I suppose i never really took charge. ",22Sep2018,1

388,"Hey all,

Here's my life-story background in a nutshell. Graduated Uni (Kinesiology) in 2012, worked for 4 years, travelled, decided I wanted to specialize on something that would get me a job. Went back to Uni in 2017 studying a medical profession, now returned into my 2nd year and I have lost ALL interest and focus. My true interests lie in Climate Change, Nature and Photography. Last year while I was in school I applied to a masters in Project Management in Wind Energy Sustainability in Sweden and was accepted, but I turned it down thinking I should finish this program I started. Now I've entered the 2nd year and I feel I have made a mistake and should have done the masters.

My girlfriend even quit her job and moved to the other side of the country to live with me while I finish my schooling, but I am so negative and depressed with the though of this program I can foresee it putting a stress on our relationship. I hate going to lecture, attending labs and trying to perform well. I have no desire to study or learn or listen in lecture. I feel so trapped, mainly because all my saved up money is practically gone due to tuition and living costs, and the only reason I am trying to remain in the program is because it will lead to a stable job/career with stable income to make up for the money I've spent and the money I now don't have. First year I got straight A's with a high GPA, it's not that I'm incapable of performing, I am one of the top students in the class, I just have no interest or desire anymore.

My interests in life are not with healthcare anymore. I feel like this isn't the right path for me, but I am \*\*not sure If I am saying this as an excuse because I don't want to do the work, or I actually don't want to do this\*\*. Everyone will tell me to stick it out and finish it even if you don't want to work in that profession as its a good fall back career to have. But I can't imagine putting myself through this for another year in the classroom and then a year in the hospital if I'm not enjoying it. I feel its affecting my relationship as I am not the positive person I have always been before. My mind is constantly focused on school and whether I should drop out or not.

I feel so conflicted, stuck, and depressed. I don't know what to do. My girlfriend said it's ok if I want to drop out, she won't be upset as she just wants me to be happy, and shes recognized that I am not happy. If I drop out I would plan on getting  a part time job of course to pay rent and bills while my girlfriend works in her career. But I know I won't do that forever, just until I figure the next thing out.",22Sep2018,1

400,"So I feel kind of weird coming out with this because it's usually criticism that is commonly brought up in this context. But my problem is the opposite. I pretty much internalize all negative feedback as being objectively true while finding it extremely difficult to take any positive ones at face value, no matter how sincere or credible it happens to be. This negative tendency of mine has been causing extremely negative effects both in terms of my relationship with myself and with others who I keep unintentionally pushing away.  

&amp;#x200B;

**(Further reading is optional)**

&amp;#x200B;

As far as possible causes go, I'll render them threefold to keep things simple yet sufficiently informative:

&amp;#x200B;

1- I struggle with severe depression of the atypical variety. So in layman terms I guess one could translate that to state that my brain is basically lying to me. It tells me that nothing positive about myself could possibly be true. So when someone tells me ""Oh you're so this and that"" or ""I'm so proud of you for doing X or impressed with you for doing Y"" my brain tends to automatically short-circuit and automatically reject it. While I'm sometimes capable of convincingly displaying sufficient gratitude, there are other times (usually when my depression renders me less alert and more autopilot-ish) in which my thoughts would directly manifest themselves onto spoken words or written text to the dismay of the other person who had went out of their way to provide with highly-appreciated (though I have a hard time showing it) support. I've been recently confronted about this by my highly qualified therapist as well as regular contacts (some of whom, I regret to say, could not put up with my shit anymore--and understandably so). 

&amp;#x200B;

2- In addition to what had been said above, the past few years have been especially brutal in terms of the emotional abuse I've received from people who didn't understand the nature of my illness. And because during most of them I didn't know that I was ill either, I tended to accept it all fact. I've internalized through a combination of internal depression thought patters and external lack of understand that I am useless, worthless, helpless, hopeless, inefficient, ineffective, unreliable, lazy, stupid, among other things. All that trauma and emotional baggage makes it insanely difficult for me to view things through a different light no matter how logically they are portrayed. It certainly doesn't help that I'm still too ill to function on my own, but I don't think this behavior is helping me get out of this dark pit. 

&amp;#x200B;

3- I used to be the total opposite prior to becoming severely ill. I would actively seek and indulge in positive external feedback about myself. I would let it all get into my head to the point where I ended up making a series of increasingly crazy decisions based on completely unrealistic goals and it all ended up blowing up in my face big time, in the worst way possible. Since then in particular, I've been particularly ""allergic"" to hearing the same things since they bring back those terrible memories to the surface of my mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

So there you have it. Thank you for taking the time to read and consider my post. I would be genuinely appreciative of any kind of input you have to offer, so please feel free to say what you have in mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

Best of wishes to all of you out there. ",22Sep2018,2
402,"I'm currently enrolled in Game Graphics Production at Digital Arts and Entertainment in Kortrijk Belgium. This school is, in one word, insane. Actually maddening. The workload is beyond what anyone reasonable would do. Last year, I worked on average 16-18 hours a day, not counting lunch breaks and commuting. I was a wreck. My girlfriend left me, and I slept for 2 days straight once the semester had ended, and I had to take heavy stress relievers for months. Hard work pays off though, and I average about 16/20, only once dropping below 14/20 (to put things in perspective, about 20% of first-year students get 10/20 on every course). And that's where all the trouble starts. While the workload is insane, it's not ""hard"". The reason I can work 16-18 hours a day on nothing but an excessive amount of caffeine, is because I don't have to think. I just need to sit down and work. And it depresses me.

Going back a couple of years to explain that, I was in a public elementary school, I excelled at everything they put in front of me, no matter what it was (with the exception of sports, I don't like very many sports except cycling). This lead to me getting my IQ tested, for some reason, and I came up at 132 (I don't like telling people that number, but heck, it helps putting things in perspective). Which was a punch to the stomach, since it just confirmed I was different than all the other kids (who mostly avoided me, even far into mid school). It felt like the diagnosis of some mental condition. It took about 3 years for me to cope with that, after which I dedicated myself to knowing as much as possible about the world. This quickly lead me to the STEM fields. I excelled at physics, scoring nothing but straight A's for 4 years.

Any sane person would tell me to go get a degree, maybe a PhD in physics, but my parents, ever supporting as they were, knew I wanted to go study game design, and so I did. I've wanted to study game development since I was 9 years old, before even taking the IQ test. And that's what makes this decision so hard.

Also, I met a girl I really like in this school, and that's starting to cloud my decision making, as despicable as I find that. I don't like feelings. They fucked me up before. Although that might have something to do with my girlfriend of 3 years having just left me out of the blue with no explanation (if you read this (and you know who I am, I told you my IQ,and yours is 133) I'm done crying, watch my youtube channel). I'm not sure. Feelings are the thing I understand least of myself.

Last summer I had to go explain some messages I send to someone to Masterchief (I think the founder of DAE, the headmaster right now), and that got me thinking about all of this again. I got really into theoretical  astrophysics. I devoted the biggest part of this summer to restudying the math I saw in high school, and I realised I can't do anything anymore. It's like I never got all those hours of math (I saw most of statistics, and up to Calculus 2, but never anything with Complex numbers). And that's the final complication. I'm not sure if I'm good enough at math (I graduated with 16.6/20) for the astrophysics major. 

That's most of the things that have happened in the past. So let's say I do change schools, there's three possible outcomes. 

1. I fail. in which case I wonder if I could go back to DAE, which I will ask at school ASAP. if not, I lose one year, and most of my friends. 
2. I pass the 5 year course, but not with enough margin for a PhD. I don't know what I'd do, since research is really the only thing that interests me. I care very little about working in a bank or in some nuclear energy plant doing risk calculations.
3. I get the PhD, pass that, and then start looking for research jobs. There's such a small amount of physics research fellowships that I'm not even sure if that's an achievable goal. I'm smart, but I'm not crazy intelligent. I'm logical, but I feel so incredibly deeply that the smallest insult from the wrong person can gut me and put me on my back for weeks. Suicide has been on my mind for almost a decade now, and I'm only 20 years old.

Game design has been my dream and obsession for years now. Physics was just something I was really good at. Also, really good is compared to a class of art students, so quite relative. I also never saw anything harder than various mechanics, some force stuff, some electricity. nothing too crazy in school. Lately, Game Design has become something I'm really good at, and astrophysics is my dream and obsession.

So then I came up with a plan that would get me the best of both worlds (I thought). I'd graduate from DAE, with some really good grades (that would probably allow me to drop a course or two in Uni), and then go study astrophysics. I told my parents that, and they told me to just quit DAE and go to university, since I'd be wasting another 2 years. That's basically telling me ""Things thing you've lived towards for the better part of your life"" It's worthless now, so go do that other thing."" They don't realise the probability of finding a research job is so damn small, and they think I'm a lot smarter than I actually am. Again, I'm smart and logical, but not that extreme. If I did this, I would get my master in science(Astrophysics) at age 26 (assuming I don't fail). Best case scenario, I'd start my PhD then.

Okay, new plan, I can do DAE, self-studying in the meantime, and then take the first year exam while still in DAE, cuttting out one year. As my parents brought up, I already work insane amounts, so self studying would be 1-2 hours every day. Also, the first year is INSANELY HARD, so success chances would be low. this would bring age of graduation down to 25.

This only leaves one possible solution. Leave DAE now, and study astrophysics. But something is holding me back. I don't know if it's fear of not being good enough, my friends, my comfort zone, the feelings I'm developing for this one person(Who is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay out of my league, btw), or the fact that It's my childhood dream and I've lived my life to do this. Every decision I've made has been in favor of a career in Game Graphics.doing this, however, would lower age of graduation down to 24.

I've brought it up with my friends in school, and with the staff here, and they all tell me to stay. Of course they do. Not a day goes by or people tell me how great I am at what I do (not knowing they're only increasing the pressure I'm under, but that's a whole other topic). 

Added to that, my dad is getting another surgery (I think the 5th in 3 years), so his finances are running low, and I'm basically broke. The longer I stay in school, the more he has to pay. I've thought of just dropping out and working in some factory, or in a call center, so I at least stop burdening everyone. For the same reason, my suicidal thoughts have increased again. So far, no attempts in the last 6 months. 

I'm at a loss. a complete and utter loss. I have no one left to talk to. Everyone thinks I'm so incredibly smart, but I've reached my intellectual limit in a simple binary choice. It feels like the hardest choice in my life. I just came home, went to my study, and collapsed in tears against my door. I'm so damn tired of everything.

Tl;Dr: My dream has turned to ashes in my mouth, and I'm stuck trying to decide.",22Sep2018,2
403,"Flairing  this as family because my cat is like my second child. My little black kitty got bit by what looks like a copperhead a day or two ago and I just now noticed because she had been running away from me every time I try to get her to come inside. She has lumps and swelling all around her neck and gray skin as well as puss and blood coming out. She doesn’t act like she’s in pain and was not very happy with me cleaning it. 

I cleaned it up and put bacon grease on it (old time trick that worked on my pa’s dog) but I’m afraid I’m too late. I’m pregnant and can’t work and my husband recently lost his job (like a month ago) and we are barely scraping by with our 8 month old having to go to children’s hospital for high SED levels. I can’t afford to take her to the vet but I’m absolutely terrified I didn’t get to her time for any old time tricks to help. Is there anything else I can’t do for her? And advice at all on how to help her get better or at the very least make her comfortable? She’s my daughters best friend and I want them to grow up together.

404,"I honestly have never really liked this girl, I met her on an obscure social media app where you can talk to randoms around the world. I only started talking to her so I could eventually get phone sex, call me a dick, whatever.

but yah we did some shit over the phone eventually, whatever who cares. we keep talking and i notice shes getting shorter with me , giving me one word replies etc so i start ignoring her cuz fuck that cuck shit tbh. 

eventually i start ignoring her altogether cuz by her giving me 1 word responses it just seems like she wants attention and validation at this point and also she doesnt want to do anymore sexual shit. we used to watch porn together and she didnt even want to do that.

she starts double texting me and asking me why im ignoring her. I just tell her i dont wanna talk anymore n since im getting nothing sexual out of it I don't wanna talk anymore

she sends me a ""K"" and that's that. but now I cant stop obsessively checking her posts on the obscure social media. fucking hell. i legit have no feelings for this girl and i dont even really like her tbh. its just I see her talking to other guys, kinda sexually and it bugs me cuz I thought I was the only one she was really sexual with. idk. its fucking pathetic as shit as its retarded internet shit and its not even real life but im going crazy and i dont understand why I'm being neurotic over a girl i dont even like. I feel really posessive over her for some reason. why? i dont even fucking like her

405,"Well this is gonna get long. I am a fairly smart school kid, I get things faster than others and with no effort get things done (if I want to). I am socially awkward, though it has gotten better in past two years after quite some bullying. I was all but nice to everyone then I realised people abuse that so I became the asshole; that was definitely a step up. Although before I enter uni I thought it would be easy to make new friends, and that has made the failure yet more disappointing. I would say I have read a lot and that has definitely made me a serious person. Up to probably a year ago I had no reason to have fun. ""like why would you wanna let go of you brain for fun?"" then it was a reasonable thing, now I understand why some people might not relate. 

ok well that's one thing, social life. 

the other thing is that i am academically strong but i think that would be a waste of time as a human as to there will be people to solve whatever problem in the world (General AI in the case of my concerns), but i might not have a chance of feeling the sunshine after I die (if there be another life). anyhow, I am dwelling with my path (??) as to what I want to do. I have tried making plans, but i think my continuous exhaustion has  led me to forget about it.

last thing is probably depression, although that could be for quitting smoking and the recent events and whatever, but ya it's there, i just don't see a point of trying really. like I would totally accept it if i were to fall and die right now, you know, don't have to push every second anymore.

and well since uni started I did try to connect to people and make things better but seeing how for some people it is much easier to do so, it has really disappointed me. although i have been quite for literally all my childhood and early-teens while reading, and that it takes time to get better at communication, and that I have actually improved. but ya in the past two days i have been so tired that even talking to people, i think i talk so quietly no one actually hears me and im tired.

Anyhow, if you have an answer for any of the following, you have helped me out a lot:

1) how to socialise more and better without getting exhausted and maybe, god forbid, enjoy it?

2) how to find my purpose?

3) how to stop being lazy?

4) how to manage my life? (is it possible to do all the things I want in one lifetime: writing, travelling, computer science, a generalised philosophy to save humanity from this big despair (hail Camus). and how to keep the motivation going, coz sometimes staying in bed feels stronger than getting up and running towards your dreams?)

5) how can I travel by hitchhiking from detroit to mexico?

6) how to get girls interested?

7) how to start writing in large amounts?

8) how to get angry a tad for the use of motivation?

He really needs this. He's been battling drug addiction for awhile. He got into a really bad car wreck a few days prior  because of drugs, and decided he needed help. My husband is going to be pissed with me because we have a tiny house and is afraid of my friend's puppy destroying things. I haven't told my husband or asked if it is okay if I care for this puppy while my friend is in rehab because I know what his reaction will be. I feel that if I made a promise to my friend, I should keep it, whether my husband disagrees or not. My friend really needs to go to rehab and I truly want him to get better. I also feel that my dog would really benefit from spending time with his dog, being that they are sisters. My friend has a gf that would probably neglect the dog. The dog would be locked in a cage for most of the day, and that's no way to live. I know he loves his dog and that's why he has entrusted me to care for his dog and not his gf.

411,"Recently I have been having a bizzare occurrence regarding my front door lock. I live in Germany and have been here for a year. But recently my landlord had someone come and change all of the door locks in the apartment block...no problem. However when I leave the flat I never put the key to turn the lock as it automatically keeps the door secure. The lock however is capable of being turned twice from the outside to give it extra security. This can be done with my new key. I also have a spare one that stays also in my apartment. 

When I come back from work and open the door I put the key in and normally I have the turn the key half way clockwise to let myself in. However, two times over the last two weeks I have had to turn in three times clockwise before it unlocks fully. I never lock my door to that security and cannot work out why I have to do extra key turns to get in. It's a simple lock with no electronics. What could it be and is this a problem? My only other key has been inside the apartment the whole time.

415,"I started college lately and have been living in halls of residence for about 4 weeks now. Recently I've found myself feeling irritated by my roommate, who is by no means a bad person. He is super nice, polite, and generous, which at first seemed amazing. But the longer I live with this guy, the more he rubs me up the wrong way. 

Examples of his behavior: he is CONSTANTLY trying to push food on people. He'll deliberately make more food than he needs for himself, and then offer it to me despite me saying I wasn't hungry/didn't want anything. This happened yesterday, and when I politely said no he literally held the plate in front of my face while staring at me and waiting for me to take something. 

Another time, he asked me if I wanted a coffee. When I told him truthfully that I didn't actually like coffee, he said ""I'll make it for you anyway just in case"". He constantly checks to see if I've eaten, and despite me being 5 years older than him, he acts like I'm incapable of looking after myself, telling me I'm not eating enough or my food isn't good enough. 

There comes a point where his generosity gets a little patronizing. Every time we go to the store he refuses to let me pay for my own food. I feel like this shouldn't annoy me so much, but it's so overbearing. One of the things I was most looking forward to about college was learning independence and taking responsibility for myself, and he's making it almost impossible to do that. 

Am I overreacting? How are you supposed to say ""no"" to someone like this? How do I tell him that, no, I don't want him to cook for me, and that yes, I'm capable of feeding myself because I'm a grown ass adult?",22Sep2018,1

It's not like I don't try - I volunteer with three different charities, I used to go to the gym every other day, I used to go to Meetup's (no longer due to a bad breakup), I often try new activities like climbing, archery, dance, etc. plus I try to at least get out the house for coffee or go to gigs...although options are still very limited and doing things alone is no fun.

When I say I have no one I mean *no one*, not even online friends.

I just seem to completely fail to make any sort of connection with anyone.

I swear lack of regular social contact has cost me social skills too, so maybe I come across as a weirdo now too.

When I try talking to people often I'm asked what I do...what's my job (I don't have one), what I do after work (I have no hobbies), or what am I doing at the weekend (I have no social life)...do you have any idea how weird people think you are when you say you have no friends? People don't want to be friends with you when you have no friends!

There's also only so long you can hide the fact you do nothing; currently I only work Mondays and Fridays, I have therapy on Thursdays (which I don't tell people about), and dance classes on Wednesday...soon my Mondays and Wednesdays will be empty again, and I'll struggle to fill time again.

431,"Tl;dr. Bosses wife got my number through a coworker. She hasn’t come out and said she wants to bang but the actions and texts are leading that way. How do I tell her I’m not interested?

My current boss works early mornings—somewhere around 4am-1pm ish. Sometimes he has to come in way late in the evening to finish up some paperwork or whatever. His wife will come along and she’ll stay outside by the employees while her husband goes in the back to finish whatever. 

Everything was chill. She would be talking to me or my other coworkers in-between guests and it’d always be bubbly and happy atmosphere. 

Well he recently quit to go to a rival company. Since his plan to go to the other company started to go into motion he would start to show up more often late at night to finish whatever. So his wife got to come along as well and she’d always chat with us. 

The previous run in with her I noticed something that stuck out. We were talking about guys or something amongst the three of us ( coworker, wife, and myself ) and she kind of nonchalantly said “oh darn that means “youcallmek” won’t date me”. We laughed and that was that. I sort of shrugged it off as her personality. 

The one after that before she left he gave me a hug. Which okay but seemed to kind of be out of bounds of social norms given I am her husbands employee. 

Then on Thursday I am about to head to work and a coworker of mine comes in to take my place. She comes up to me and says “hey, the bosses wife wants your phone number. Why does she want your number?” I said I don’t know. And it’s weird that she’s asking a coworker for my number when her husband has it because he and I text a lot about work and what needs to get done. 

Anyway so my coworker gives the number to the wife and she texts me and congratulated me on my new position and blah blah..... Look. We are all adults here. We know what she’s trying to do. 

Before this becomes ginormous I wanted to know how the hell do I even approach this situation. She hasn’t come out and said hey let’s bang but it’s obviously leasing that way. Why else would she get my number through a coworker and be sneaky sneaky? 

I think she’s a nice person and I don’t mind talking to her but surely there’s a boundary somewhere here. How do I tell her I’m not interested? I’m not great with confrontations of sorts. 

I like my boss and I don’t want any beef with him or weird shit going on there. Someone tell it to me straight. Should I tell my boss? I don’t want to ruin the marriage. I just want out.

432,"So, I work the night shift. My job requires I put in a 40 hour week, and then once every  couple of months come in on a weekend during a day shift. Not ideal for my sleep schedule, but it is what it is.

Usually, someone reminds me the week of my shfit that i have to do it that week, but nobody said anything to me this time. So I went through my work week, went home, did my friday thing, and went to sleep at 8am. I woke up just fifteen minutes ago to get a call from my boss. Turns out I just slept through an entire shift. I looked at my phone and saw they tried to call me nine times. I slept through every single call.

Apparently there's a board that I don't know about that says saturday shifts, and it's been clearly labeled that I work this weekend for a while now. I've been so used to my supervisor coming by and telling me I work that weekend that I just assumed I didn't today. I immediately asked my boss if I could make it up to him in any way, by working next weekend or tomorrow (sunday) or something. He said he'd call me right back, that was about ten minutes ago. I started writing this as soon as he hung up.

How do I save this situation? I like to think I'm in good standing at work, but a few weeks ago I asked my boss if he would switch me to the weekend shift so I can accommodate school better; I start full time in spring, and have enough money saved up to live off of through the program. He announced to my entire department I was going to be handling saturdays and sundays as of the end of october, which is fantastic news for everyone because they wont have to do weekends anymore, but I turned around and immediately blew it. This is the first time I've missed an entire shift, and usually I handle saturdays really well. I'm so mad at myself right now, I have no idea how to handle this. I've never missed an entire shift before and this is going to give everyone doubts about me taking the position I absolutely need to have if I'm going to make it through school.",22Sep2018,1
433,"For my Undergraduate degree I have a Bachelor in Medical Biosciences with First Class Honors. I'm currently starting a Postgraduate Masters course for the same subject.

In the past,I feel like I've succeeded in education because of a fear of the consequences of failure. 

But considering that I already have a First Class undergraduate degree,I feel like even if I fail my Masters,it wouldn't matter much to my future job prospects. 

This thought process is having disastrous consequences, as now I feel like I'm lacking the motivation to succeed. I feel that the consequences of failing are insignificant and the gains of success are negligible.

So am I right or wrong in thinking this way? 

What consequences will I face for my future job prospects if I fail or only ""pass"" my MSc?",22Sep2018,1

435,"Hey everyone, this is my first time visiting this subreddit, so If I'm not doing something correctly, I apologize. So, to sum up my situation, my dad just texted me and in very clear words said he is essentially cutting me out.

I'm doing my best to hold it together right now because I'm in the verge of breaking down. I feel extremely overwhelmed with everything right now. I'm trying to put together a mental checklist of everything I need to do, but it's all just freaking me out so much right now.

I do have a job, but the pay is pretty mediocre. My primary concern right now is finding and securing a place to live or stay for the immediate future. I work at a hotel, so I'm trying to see if they would be willing to let me stay In a room there on the days I'm working.

I'm basically just seeking advice on what I could do... I was planning on moving out closer to January, but this whole situation has pulled the rug out from under me and I'm honestly scared... I'm not sure I would qualify for getting an apartment right now due to my credit. Is there anything I could/should do right now? Any advice is appreciated, thanks.",22Sep2018,1
436,"Long story short. My parents have taken all my cash away from me, dumped by bank account nearing 1k and taken almost everything away from me. I do schooling online, make music, and have been trying to get a job for forever. Today me and my dad went to pick up a new lawnmower and while leaving a gas station I found a ""Chase Bank"" envelope on the ground. I picked it up out of curiosity, and didn't open it until about I got home. There is $260 in this fucking envelope. WTF? I'm a teenage pot head, I CANT SPEND THIS ALL ON WEED! I need to make a start and actually use this money to help me instead of being spent on medication (i use pot for my back pain and also my crippling depression and anxiety) that'll leave my system in a few hours. Should I keep it, or return it?

&amp;#x200B;

2 hours ago I had only $24 to my name. Now I have almost $300. No one was around, cars were pulling in and out and I'm the only person in the world who saw this sitting there. There is a small receipt inside the envelope which I've kept, it shows the time it was cashed out which was 9/21/2018 at 16:35. The money has been sitting in the parking lot for almost 2 days. What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

It has no identification on it anywhere to know who's it is. I might just buy 3-5 grams and use the rest of the money to better my self and situation, but why not stay medicated while i fix my issues? lol im jk. i need advice fast.

438,"I’m a college student who’s new to the dating game for the most part. There’s a girl who is in a few clubs that I’m in, and we hit it off. I mustered up the courage to ask her out this week and she said yes. My wording was a bit vague (hanging out vs a date) but we aren’t great friends and the context made it seem more date-ish.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked her over text to coffee on a specific day but no set time. I may be overanalyzing, but her response wasn’t the greatest to me. It seemed kind of uninterested, and she said she would like to but would have to check if she was free.

&amp;#x200B;

We’ve had to see each other a few times this weekend due to our clubs. I get really nervous and anxious, so a lot of that time has been me avoiding eye contact and not initiating any conversations with her, even if we’re nearby. We both helped at an event, and I was actually planning to sit with her during it. I then found out one of her friends was coming, and I also started to not feel well (for unrelated reasons). I just felt kind of awkward and discouraged so I ended up leaving after I was finished helping.

Now I have no set time for this date and no confidence. I just have so much trouble making conversation and not getting nervous around her.",22Sep2018,1

440,"I will be really into someone, but when they show they are about or are interested in me, it’s a turn off and I become uninterested. I hate this because it is hurtful to the guys who do like me. I suspect it has something to do with low self esteem and not understanding why someone would really like me and be interested in me. I am into a guy way more when he may not want me, but as soon as he expresses that he does and is vulnerable and open, I just get uncomfortable and don’t like them much anymore. I need to overcome this badly.",22Sep2018,1
441,"I grew up in a cabin in the woods. It was my dad, brother, me, and our dogs. Needless to say, it was a boy's house and we were rough and tumble dirty boys. I grew up muddy, stinky, and not really a ton of chores outside of dishes and laundry. Now I'm married and I try but I come across things that my wife gets upset about. The latest was I did the dishes with a sponge my dog got ahold of. I made sure to wash the sponge and soap it up, rinse it, and resoap it. She asked me about the sponge and then she got mad at me when I tried to explain I washed it and I don't see the difference between that and cleaning a pan used for raw chicken, with the dogs mouth being less gross in my opinion. I tried to reassure her that it was cleaned thoroughly but the damage was done. How do I stop being gross?",22Sep2018,1
442,"Ok so this is a bit of doozy, I'll try to keep it as short as possible but I do feel like a bunch of the details are needed to establish context.

During the summer, I met this girl through mutual friends. I say met, but we did know each other. I never really looked her way because I saw her as way out my league. She's gorgeous and I have low self-esteem, so I was really second guessing myself once I got her number. We messaged a bit and then one night I got a call from her asking if I wanted to go for food with (mutual friends) and her. I went, and it was 2 mutual friends and 2 friends of hers I did not know. The 2 friends I didn't know had a very strong ""oh, THIS is PDZ"" attitude (clearly I had been talked about a lot). Throughout the meal I would catch her looking at me in a way that I can't really describe, but if you've ever seen or given **the look**, you know what I'm talking about. After we ate, we ended up going to a field just to kick it, and one of her friends that I didn't know looked me in the eyes and said something along the lines of ""you're good, I like you for her"". I know guys are notoriously known for missing signals, but I don't think that can even be classified as a 'signal' haha. Anyways, the next day I bump in to one of our mutual friends and she apologizes profusely on behalf of the two friends I didn't know in case they made it awkward. I interpreted this as another good sign because it meant they were talking about me AGAIN, and in the manner of 'I hope they didn't mess it up' type way. 

Here is where I became conflicted. She goes away for school, and the way I saw it, I had two options. 
1) Pursue a relationship with her, which, in my eyes, was not practical because we really hadn't gotten that close yet and she was going to be hours away.
2) Lead her on to get with her before the summer ends... which is not an option because that is not who I am, and she is a nice girl.

With this in mind, I came to the realization that I probably needed to move on before I lead her on, lead myself on, or both. However, if you compound my low self-esteem with the fact that she's gorgeous, I think it's easy to understand how I could be persuaded to keep messaging her. We messaged a bunch and hung out, and she really opened up to me about a lot of stuff.

Fast-forward to a week before she had to leave, and she made it very clear that she wanted to see me before she left. She even messaged me Saturday saying that Sunday she has a family event but we should hang out afterwards. I said sure, and then Sunday morning gave her a gentle reminder of our agreement to hang out. She didn't respond to my message at all Sunday until late at night, where she said that she got really busy with family stuff and preparing for school. This bothered me, so I hit her with the 'have fun at school' and left it at that. She replied with another message about how badly she wanted to see me but she just got too busy. Well as it turns out, she posted a lot of insta photos with other people (not family btw). A friend also told me that her instagram story on Monday was her out for dinner with some dude (apparently childhood friend). I understand she is free to do what she wants, but I just found it messed up that she kept telling me she wanted to see me but then didn't actually make any effort to and/or made plans that would override her ability to see me. 

I confronted her about this, and she had some pretty bad excuses, which I called her out for too. Problem is, I'm a punk ass bitch... so I backpedaled and kept messaging her. 

When I say messaging her, I mean sending her the occasional snapchat. She would send me selfies with cupid filters and other stuff. By chance, I noticed that she was opening my snaps and replying waaaay later. I took this to mean that she wasn't really replying to my snaps, she's just including me on snaps she's sending to a bunch of people. This made sense to me because if I ever had a question or something in the caption of the snap I sent to her she wouldn't really address/respond to it. But our streak was going up, which means it was a direct reply to my snap? (Question mark bcz I really don't know how streaks work). After this ""realization"", I was ready to move on.

But then, she started messaging me consistently (sometimes 2-3x in a row). One of the messages being about the first weekend she gets back in town and how she wants to see me. Another one was a snap she sent me of one of those Facebook things that says ""tag the cutest law school student you know!"" (I'm in law school). Again, these messages kind of went against the ""realization"" I had about how I was just being included in snaps she was sending out to a bunch of people

So that's where I'm at. I'm completely conflicted because I feel like she's just toying with me (maybe for attention?), but despite that I still can't detach myself from her. I feel like any reasonable person from the outside looking in would be able to use common sense to determine that I shouldn't have feelings for her... but I do?

I know this was a pretty long story, but any advice on how to deal with this would be appreciated lol.",22Sep2018,2

445,"I am 31 years old now and I still live at home.  All I've done for the past year is work and save money.  I love my job and I look forward to growing within the company and making more money, but now I'm in a position I never thought I'd be in.  How do I start living my life?

I know I am way overdue to finally start living on my own, and throughout my twenties, I used not being able to find a decent job and my depression as en excuse for still living at home.  I also have no desire to date or start a family.  Sure, if I happen to meet the right person, I'd consider dating but I feel like at my age and my situation, the only women I'm going to meet are young women looking for a free ride or women my age looking to settle down with someone.

I could move out at any time, but I wouldn't go far because my work is close to where I live now.  If I moved into an apartment a few miles away, all I'd be doing is giving myself a $1000 monthly bill but, for the most part, still living the same.

The only thing I'm looking forward to outside of work is Fallout 76.  I have no desire to go on any vacations anytime soon or explore the world.  Even if I wanted to travel more, it's not like I can stop working for a few months like I could have done in my twenties.

I feel much happier in life, but still don't know what I should be doing.  I have money, a job I'm proud of, I'm healthy mentally and physically, but I still don't know what to do with my life.

452,"Full story and context. I live in a building, 3 weeks ago or so I heard someone scream for about 5-7 minutes, she was a girl, it was intermittent, she would pause for 20 seconds or so, maybe 10, then she would keep going. The building has a whatsapp group, I asked if anybody knew what that was or who it was, but nobody knew anything. Except one person, this one person contacted me privately and claimed it was nothing, the screaming was just girls being girls, nothing to worry about, I asked for confirmation, he said it wasn't a robbery, then I made an additional comment, and he didn't say anything after that.  


My first instinct was to be relieved, but the next day I felt... naive... I mean, what if this person who messaged me, privately, was the one doing the harm? what if he was raping a girl? hopefully if it was something bad, it was domestic violence, which is bad too, but not as much. Anyway, I didn't know who the number belonged to, until today, I know his name, and what floor and apartment he lives in.


What do I do? I searched online for advice and I read that the most important thing to do is keep safe, so going up to him and confronting him probably isn't a good idea, specially because I live with my mom who is 69 and is somewhat frail.  


I keep thinking that if I hear screaming again I'm gonna call the cops and send them to that floor, but I don't know if that person is even the one responsible for the violence (or if there was any violence, really). On the other hand I feel bad and guilty about not doing anything. I feel specially guilty at the prospect of it having been rape.
