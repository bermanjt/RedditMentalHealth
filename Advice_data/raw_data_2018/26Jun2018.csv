0,"I have been active on a very popular user-submitted content site for the last 9 years. During this time I’ve volunteered in a lot of projects and have met and worked with several staff members.

Recently I applied for a public-facing position at the company and was called for a preliminary interview with an HR rep. The interview went very well and my next several interviews have been set pretty soon. Unfortunately, due to financial problems and a family crisis I was never able to finish college and left before the end of my first year so while I have plenty of experience on the website and have multiple staff members recommending me for the position I don’t have any solid professional experience in the field. 

How would you recommend I proceed? What should I do to prepare for my next several interviews? ",26Jun2018,2
1,"I don't know if this is the appropriate place to put this, but I'm constantly stressed out. 

My sister lied for three years that she was doing fine in college, and it turned out she failed out and now just re-entered. She's not motivated, and I don't know if she'll ever work a full-time job. 

My dad is 64 years old and has been in stints of unemployment since he was 50 (months, almost a year), and he's facing ageism in the IT world. Mother was always a homemaker, but has been struggling to find a job as she never got her high school diploma/doesn't speak English that well. 

I applied for medical school using my education funds that was set up when I was born (in Canada), and I graduated from college. I'll be working minimum wage as a scribe as I await to hear results. 

However, the fact that in a few years no one will be working, and I have two little sisters and an older sister AND a parent to support makes me sick to the stomach and keeps me up at night. 

Idk if I'll get into med school the first time- I feel like medical school is for people who have enough money to take four years off without a steady income, and I know low-income students go and succeed despite it, but a full four-five years without an income to support family members makes me want to quit and just go become a high school biology teacher even though I'll hate it. 

Should I just give up on my dreams of being a doctor and then go back to it later in life (maybe when I'm 35-40) after everyone is settled? I feel like I should ""set myself on fire to keep others warm"". Idk. ",26Jun2018,2
3,"I've been in a mostly happy relationship for three and a half years. We have our ups and downs, but at the end of the day- he's my best friend and I love every piece of him. Though, a lot of the time I feel like there's a part that we're missing. Passion? A spark? Romance? I would never put our relationship at risk. But... I guess I didn't end up here because I'm the happiest girl in the world.

About a week ago, a friend of a friend messaged me on Instagram. He asked me about my eyebrows and wanted to know if I use Anastasia brow products. I assumed he was asking for himself and I told him what product I use.  We started talking about makeup, makeup brands, gurus, sharing YouTube videos- I gave him my number and he showed me his makeup collection (which was jaw droppingly impressive) and we talked about going to Pride. We talked about my sexual orientation and how I identify.  I made another (foolish and ignorant) assumption and assumed he was gay/somewhere on the spectrum other than straight- which was incredibly wrong me. 

Fast forward to today. 

This guy was unusually easy to talk to. We made plans for him to pick me up, go out to brunch and hang out. Yes, I told my boyfriend about my plans. Bowever, I had to cancel last minute due to having debilitating cramps from getting my period. For most of my morning, I was face first into the toilet bowl. It was not a fun time. 

He was incredibly understanding. I told him I was really looking forward to talking with him and hanging  out. We FaceTimed for about an hour when he told me to go outside of my house. 

I legitimately was not expecting Postmates to be out there with cookies and churros, and for a flower delivery guy to be outside with literally two dozen red roses and a box of chocolates. I didn't know what to do, I turned bright red and started thanking him profusely for this over the top gift, but I expressed that I genuinely felt like it was too much and maybe crossed a line since... Well, I didn't think there was anything there. 

This may seem like something out of a fairytale, and it feels like that, but it also feels disrespectful to my boyfriend and I don't even know how to approach this with either of them.

4,"Hi r/Advice

I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to post. 

I'm currently in an odd predicament. My situation is as follows: I'm residing at an apartment complex where I was approached by the property management to be the on-site manager and in return, I receive 30&amp;#37; of my rent/monthly and get paid minimum wage to work 3 hrs/week (job duties pertain more to laundry room cleaning and notifying property management of any pressing issues). I happily agreed and I've been in this spot for 2 years. My lease agreement is different due to me being technically employed with the PM company. 

Here's the thing - I currently have a nosy neighbor, Pam,  who I have NOT disclosed that I'm OM (onsite manager). I don't disclose this a lot because in fear of envy. Pam told me that ""someone told on"" another resident who was living in a unit that is an office illegally (I have a feeling it was she who reported this and just wanted to grab my attention) - this resident who was evicted is Jose and has been a tenant for some years prior to me and according to Pam, Jose's daughter was the onsite manager. Pam tells me the PM company by law need an OM - I didn't tell her I was because she will be prying on how I got the position, the incentives, etc. 

I'm curious if this will affect me legally - say if other residents find out about my position, can they, for example, demand to know my rent amount? and/or remove me from my current position?  What are some possibilities that the PM company can demand me to do apart from my job duties? 

I think I'm just in fear due to this Pam lady who seems to be on the hound for every little fault that PM company has.  Any advice or reassurance, I will be grateful for.  Thank you in advance.",26Jun2018,2

7,"I am really at a loss at this point. Let me start off by saying that I'm a high-schooler, going into my senior year this fall. I currently live at home with both of my parents and two siblings. My mom is at work most of the time and doesn't have the time or energy to deal with me, and my dad works from home and is, in my eyes, a control-freak and a hardass. Now, I've never had the best effort in school. It's just not my thing, and although I try and try my best to do everything that's asked of me adequately, sometimes I can get behind. 

My parents rules are that I must have all of my grades a B or above. If any grade is lower than that B, I am fully ""grounded""  until the next grades come out. We have 4 grading periods per year, one right around the winter holidays, one at the beginning of summer, and two others at the halfway points This semester, I messed up. I got a D+ in my Spanish class. I've never had lower than a B- in any class thus far in high school. Now, at my school we have 3 classes for the first half of the year, and 3 classes for the second. They are different classes entirely, a ""block schedule"" if you will. My Spanish teacher has a rule where if you get any one quiz below a 7 out of 10, your entire grade for the half of the class is an automatic D+ regardless of your average. However, if you do better in the second half, that grade will replace the first one. I happened to mess up in both, and was able to drop before the second half made it on my transcript. 

Unfortunately, my first one stayed on there, so my parents decided to ground me for the entire summer. That means no driving the car, no going out to see friends, or leaving the house for any other reason besides a family outing, no TV, no phone, and a keylogger put on one of my laptops, being the one that they know about. What should I do to convince them that this is not the right move? Or am I the one in the wrong? School has always been extremely difficult for me due to a few cognitive functioning ""diseases"" if you will that make it extremely hard for me to sit there everyday for 7 hours for seemingly no reason. Anyway, as for the issue at hand, any advice would be appreciated, or if you want to tell me that I'm an entitled brat, feel free to do so as well. Thanks.

TL;DR: Failed a class, grounded for the entire summer, looking for advice on how to work this out",26Jun2018,1

13,"My neighbor invites my mother over for coffee every morning and she'll agree to go because he's a nice neighbor. Hes retired while his wife works and his kids are old enough to move out, basically hes alone and wants some company, which my mother has no problem with. My mother is a stay at home mom.  

Anyway, once shes over he does not want her to go. He'll beg her to stay and continuously talk so the conversation doesn't end. She feels trapped there because abruptly ending the conversation and leaving his home. Her current method of leaving is telling him she has something to do at home, usually followed by my neighbor begging to her stay and complaining her reason isn't good enough. Hes a nice guy and has done a lot for us over the years, he's just super bored and wants the company. We've tried getting him into some tv shows or video games but he wont budge.

She can technically afford to stay there for 3-5 hours since its been going on like this for months, but there are things she'd rather be doing and she really rushes through the things that she feels she must do. She has tried doing what she could with him while over there, but he'd complain that she isn't talking enough with him. She's talked about getting a job to him and he replied: what, a job stops you from drinking coffee?

She doesn't mind spending some time with him, but not for 3-5 hours every day. I cant figure out a way to have my mother leave him early since shes too nice to just get up and leave and he complains a lot if she were to come up with a reason to leave. Although, stopping the coffee thing as a whole is another option but she's also too nice to bluntly tell him hes taking up too much of her time. I don't blame her since he is our neighbor and it could be a little awkward seeing him if she just ends things like that.

Any suggestions? ",26Jun2018,2

15,"I am going into my final year at Uni and with everyone I am close to having just graduated, I am having to prepare myself for losing a massive support network and what could be my most difficult year yet. Have you any advice for how I could spend my summer helping myself to figure out who I am and what I need for myself to be happy and stay healthy heading into next year? 

For context, I have been suffering from depression and anxiety, which has stemmed from many different pressures and expectations in my life, both personal, academic and in my relationships. However, I am back in my home town this summer, where I have nothing planned and not very many people to talk to. This will give me a lot of time to think about myself and I was hoping that some of you lovely people might be able to share your stories of self-help and how you found the inspiration and guidance to do so. 

I have a gf who will be away all summer and I am hoping to get some much-needed space to figure out what I want, what my aspirations are and basically who I am, so that I can grow as an independent person before our relationship becomes co-dependent. I frequently watch clips of Prof.  Jordan B Peterson who gives me snippets of good advice but with all this time and many areas of my life to figure out, I would be grateful to know whether there is a book/subreddit I could read or something I could do to get started me into making this a reality.

16,"Disclaimer: I do not believe in homophobia in any way or form

My parents were born in Japan and moved to America in order to have a better life for me and my siblings. They stay true to the values where they are from and as a result they are extremely homophobic. I know this is wrong but when I talk to them about it they see it as American culture being messed up. Over time I have grown to not blame them for being homophobic because I realize that that was what they have been taught their entire lives and genuinely think that hating LGBTQ+ people is the morally right thing to do. In addition, they are really old and are set in their ways. As a result I have began to understand where they are coming from and respect their beliefs even though I disagree with them.

I would get depressed at least once every two or three months. I told them about it and they would give me the same old response, ""you're fine, you're just growing up"". It worsened as time went on, and eventually led to me getting depressed every couple of weeks. It worsened as I got bullied all through out my eight grade school year and found out about my older brothers drug problem. The bullying led me to suicidal thoughts and sometimes grabbing a knife and  pretending to cut myself above me (like 6 inches above my arm). My brothers drug problem just worsened it more. I told my parents about it and they just ridiculed me saying ""you're overreacting"" or ""you need to get out of this mindset"" and I honestly try to but I can't. I gave up with it after the bullying mishap. There was a long time period where I just didn't tell them because I just knew they wouldn't help me (around age 11-Febuary 2018). My brother who has a drug problem has depression dn anxiety and is getting help for it (the drug problem) but my parents think that he is over reacting and he actually doesn't have depression.

Honestly I don't know what to do. If I tell them, I won't get help and they'll think of me even less than they do right now.

35,"Hello everyone, I am just contemplating a rather large life decision right now. I know that no one can tell me what is the best choice for sure, but I thought maybe some outside opinions might help ease my mind because I have been thinking about this a lot lately.

I currently live in a small town. I have lived here for 8 months. My lease was 6 months, and then month to month after that. I am free to leave at any time. I have to drive 45 minutes to get groceries. I do not know anyone here. I am 22 and a lot of my neighbors are parents with kids in high school and younger. I am fine with not knowing anyone here as I am not the most social person, but I do enjoy good company and fun experiences. My rent was cheap when I first moved in. It was $675, all utilities included, for a two-story, two-bedroom, 1.5 bath with a garage. My rent has since gone up and I am now paying $790. Still not awful, and I know that it will not go up within the next few years. 

My coworker has a basement with a private entrance. It is a living room, bedroom, and bathroom. I would have to use their kitchen upstairs. He lives in the town that I drive to for groceries. I live 10 minutes from work currently, so his commute is basically an hour. He pays our other coworker $20 a week and he just rides with him. I would be able to do that, too (I was worried about racking up miles on my car because I bought it new last year). He is offering his basement for $450, but this other person lives there right now and said they will be moving within the next couple months. I do have some time to decide, but I am just not sure. I would not have a garage spot, either. I would just park in the driveway. 

The only reason I am considering this is because I would be closer to civilization. I would have the potential of having friends. We all relocated from somewhere else to be here, but I am the only one of my coworkers who is single with no kids and no obligations. The one offering the basement just has a girlfriend, and she has a son that stays with them a couple times a month. I have hung out with them outside of work a couple times and she is really nice. 

I lived with roommates in college for two years. I went to high school with them, but we weren’t super close so it worked out great. When I lived with them, I spent all of my time in my room. I had class and work from 8 am to 8 pm M-F and would go home most weekends. I never sat with them in the living room. They didn’t really either, as they both were in their rooms, but they definitely used the common area more than me. Do you think I will regret moving in with them because I am somewhat of a introvert? In high school, I hung out with my 2 friends literally every day. I didn’t have a great home life, so I would take any opportunity I had to not be at my house. I tried not to invite myself to things, and normally I didn’t have to. My friends always included me. Then, one friend confided in me for something. The other friend found out and I think she has secretly despised me ever since. She “turned” the other friend against me so the dynamic was never the same. She put it in the other friends head that they needed time without me, and that messed me up mentally. I love their families, they are the nicest people. I just wanted to feel like I belonged somewhere. Then they made it seem like I was a burden to them (their families never made me feel that way, only my friends did). This made me become super introverted as an attempt to not be a burden on someone else’s life. I am still friends with them, just not in the same way. I moved to the other side of the country.

I could tough it out for another year or two in my current apartment, because I plan on relocating within my company (still on the other side of the country lol), or I could chance it and move in with them. I think I would have ample alone time, but also be able to go boating with them in the summer and snowboarding in the winter. It’s possible to do that now, I just have to drive all the way back home afterwards (I’m 2 hours from lakes and ski resorts, they are closer). I am just worried that I might have too high of expectations and wish I was back by myself. 

Another thing, if I did relocate, I would have to move my stuff from where I’m currently at ASAP. If I was in his basement, he wouldn’t care where I was as long as I paid him $450 and I could keep my stuff there while I figured out a living situation. 

Thanks for reading if you made it this far. I think I’m making it more of a big deal than it actually is. I’m just tired of being indecisive. ",26Jun2018,1
36,"So I’m in high school (shocker!). Going to grade 12. Long story short, I fucked up my average by taking courses I knew I wouldn’t do good in. The thing is, all my life I was DEAD SET on going to university and studying something to do with science (like conservation biology). Now, I’m pretty late to realize I’m stronger in the humanities and arts. My councillor pointed this out to me. When I really thought about it, all my dreams and ambitions revolves around art, specifically film making. However I haven’t been focusing on my artistic hobbies due to my stress and the fact that I feel guilty working on my hobbies because I shame myself for not studying and improving my grades. Now here’s the problem... I’m convinced it’s too late for me to switch paths. The Requirements to study Film and most other artistic routes are Drama 30, Art 30, and English 30 amongst other things. I’m basically in 12th grade, I haven’t done ANYTHING art related other than Drama 10, my average is low due to my chem and bio marks, and I’m also stressing about the fact that my life revolves around school and I haven’t been enjoying my youth at all. Literally losing friends because of this and I know that sounds extra but I’ve been shutting people out. I feel guilty for hanging out with people instead of studying. I’m super scared of the future and being a fuck up cause it kinda runs in my family. I’ve thought about upgrading but I can’t upgrade in the arts apparently, only core subjects and languages. I truly feel like I royally screwed myself. 
(This was long, sorry)


MY QUESTION(s) IS/ARE: What should I do? Has anyone had this experience? What’d you learn from it? And is it possible to turn my life around now? Should I continue and just upgrade my sciences? Is going into the arts even worth it, can I get a job???  IM SORRY FOR BOMBARDING YALL WITH THESE QUESTIONS I GOT A LOT ON MY MIND.

I’d appreciate any and all types of answers and advice, I’m in a really weird transition stage in my life right now so thank you to everyone in advance! :)

TL;DR: thought I wanted to go into sciences after high school, but I actually don’t, and I have low marks in those classes. Want to pursue Film but don’t have the requirements and don’t think I can upgrade. What do I do from here?",26Jun2018,1
37,"Sorry if this gets long-winded.

I work for Company A. I was hired to be the lease admin on our largest account, XYZ (""XYZ Lease Admin""). The person who trained me (""Sarah"") was frustrated because they just had just had to fire the previous XYZ Lease Admin because she kept making the same mistakes and had a bad attitude. XYZ was wanting Sarah to come back and do it full-time, but she was ready to hand it off to me. I asked Sarah what I could do to avoid making those same mistakes, and she told me to read everything five times, and be comfortable with staying late a lot. As a single person with no family, I dove right in, working through lunch and staying late most days to get the time-sensitive deals done. Unlimited overtime...worth it, right?

Three years later and I am doing everything XYZ could have hoped. I'm basically a carbon copy of Sarah, who since left the company. It took me at least a year to become comfortable with XYZ but since I have become close to everyone at that company, and they love me.

However, I am desperate to get away from this job. Behind the smile and the ""sure! I'll get it done"" the pressure-filled long days were too much. Alongside legit cancer scares (had a LEEP procedure done) and developing IBS I have been dealing with debilitating neck and back pain daily. I have begun seeing a therapist for childhood trauma issues and doing EMDR sessions twice a month but am doubtful I'll see much improvement in my depression/anxiety while still at this job. 

I was promoted to a salaried position that would require less work and overall energy, but would still allow me to work on the same account with company XYZ. I accepted.

I am now training a new person, Erin, to become the new XYZ Lease Admin. It is a slow learning process because it's a ton of work that still has to get done at some point - so while she's working on something, I'm catching everything that's falling between the cracks. 

She is not catching on very fast and also does not seem eager to stay late or earn overtime, so I'm still trying to get everything done that needs to get done. Meanwhile I am learning my new job and slowly getting more and more tasks placed on me. Erin is frustrated because she feels like I ""won't let go"" of the work and just give it to her, but up until this week we were keeping it a secret from XYZ that I would be leaving that position (as they know it is notoriously hard to fill) so I felt my hands were tied. 

Now that XYZ finally knows that Erin is my replacement, they're freaking out (just as they did when I was first hired). Quite frankly they should, because Erin doesn't have the work ethic (or Adderall prescription) do do this job effectively. 

I feel like everyone is looking at me for answers, and I'm about to go insane. After taking Friday and today off, I have 300+ emails to wade through, half of them stuff for my old position and half for my new position.

The easy answer would be ""well just give Erin all of those emails, they're her problem now"" but she doesn't know how to answer most of them due to inadequate training. Inadequate because I ALWAYS HAVE TO BE WORKING, CONSTANTLY, PUSHING DEALS ALONG. And now I have MORE responsibilities with my new position, which takes away even more ""training"" time which I did not have to begin with.

Basically, how do you tell your employer that the XYZ Lease Admin position should be covered by 2 people? They can't see that I've been doing a ridiculous balancing act for the last 3 years, working OT, working through lunch everyday in order to get THEIR deals done. I've been killing myself in this position and they just see that it gets done.

In my new position, I have a salary and am thus exempt from earning overtime. So while I do my new position and train Erin, I have to work more hours and end up earning less money. I am still too much of a pushover to bring up how upsetting this is to me, but I need to say something soon, because this whole situation is making me desperate. I cry nearly every day just because of the stress and the lack of an outlet to express any of this. I know they do appreciate me but at this point I would rather be fired so I can do ANYTHING else. Being unemployed even sounds better, but I know they would beg me to stay.

I'm sorry, I know this is probably scatterbrained and all over the place, but I'm at the end of my rope. What can do do in a situation where you feel like you're being screwed at your job? Or that your position should be handled by 2 rather than 1 person? (I don't know if Erin will be on for the long term, but if she is I'm saying she needs an additional person to help her). The managers at work claim that if she's not up to par with ""my level of work"" then we need to find someone new, but this is literally a 6-8 MONTH training process that ANYONE would have to go through. No matter what, I'm stuck and even more overworked than ever before. And they're depending on me to make the decision whether or not Erin is working out, and I don't KNOW because we haven't had enough TIME.

I'm just so desperate. Any sort of authoritative way to get through to an employer that what they're asking is impossible?",26Jun2018,1

""I'm not even upset at this point. I'm angry. For years I've been fighting to get a new power chair but insurance has a policy that the chair has to be older then 5 years before getting a new one. I find out by mechanics that the model of my chair has been discontinued meaning finding parts for the chair is difficult and the chair itself is falling apart. So over a year ago I was finally told I'm allowed a new chair. This chair has put me in danger several times when it gives out at the worst times. These last few years I've been in a wild goose chase between insurance companies, doctors, and venders. People have no idea the hoops you have to leap through to get a wheelchair. I get told I can either get a push chair or a power chair but I'm not allowed both. I've been lied to and lied about between doctors and venders. There was one employee of a certain vender who literally had it out for me. While promised over night repair, I got left stranded for nearly 2 weeks on a bed with no means of transportation around my home, last year and when calling the vender said employee thought instead of making the customer happy she was going to inappropriately yell at me. Then when my friend had a separate matter dealing with same vender she addressed her concern for my chair to the same said employee who then broke Hippa law by slandering my name and sharing info to my friend by accusing me of purposely breaking my chair. Same vender also accused me several times of making up the problems with my chair even though I've had friends and family who all witnessed my chair breaking down with their own eyes. So a year goes by and I get a simple ""we seem to of never received the forms for your new chair."" The same excuse I've literally heard 10 times so months upon months of going back and forth dealing with insurance who almost never answer calls, doctor who claims to keep sending forms that never make it to insurance, and an unprofessional medical vender company who never wants to help but god help me because their one of the few venders this county has and its a literal fucking battle, where all sides don't give a fuck. Now a few months ago I'm told yet again I'm eligible for a new chair and here I am in the present and told once again no forms have been filed. For about a year or 2 I've made this same post and I've have been making posts like this since. May I also note that awhile ago another employee of the same vender stumbled upon my post, as she expressed over the phone how me posting this is innapropriate and I was asked to remove it. Yeah sure I can get annoying with these posts but what people fail to realize is my chair are my legs. Without it I can't do basic day to day normal stuff. People have no idea how fucking hard it is to do everything without the use of your legs and as I'm slowly losing mobility in my right hand things will only get harder for me. In today's day and age we accepted the unique and the outcasts into our society. LGBT, Black lives matter movement, feminist and women's equality, all had their movenents and their voices heard and they were accepted. And thats a good thing but where's our movement? Who speaks out for the disabled? Who calls out all the hidden injustices we endor? I don't want pity, I want to feel satisfied and safe in a place where I feel equal to everyone else and not a burden to society or an inconvenience. I want to be heard. It might seem like I'm over reacting but why should someone with a mental condition be alienated by whose who work in the medical field? So yes I'm angry!""

I am a 25 year old male, and she is a twenty three year old female, with that said we been talking through work for over two months; i wanted to see if i could move our friendship, into a relationship so i decided to ask her out on a date and she agreed. We decided to go out for coffee, i ended up buying her a coffee drink, but found it odd she didn't say thank you. Moving forward.. I remember talking with her and making her laugh. oddly enough, She would never start a conversation, would only carry them. After the date was over, she told me she had a good time and wanted to go out on a second date which i agreed. I managed to ask her why she was quiet on the first date, she told me she was shy, however she is not shy at work, which i found a bit off. On the second date i took her out to a restaurant, and asked her questions like, where she went to school, what her family is like, her bucket list.. What really through me off, was when i would finish asking her questions, she couldn't ask me anything, also she became very silent. ""No joke"" i wanted to see how long it would take for her to start up a conversation so i waited it out, ten minutes pass by of her looking at me and still no conversation. Now i am getting nervous thinking why you can't ask me a single question? After the 2nd date, she once again did not thank me for paying for her meal. As i drove her home, she finally started a conversation on her own asking if we could go on a 3rd date, and that she would pay for her meal next time. Are these signs of red flags? or should i take her out on a 3rd date to see if she opens up more?",26Jun2018,1

43,"Hey everyone.

I'd like to start off by saying I'm a college aged guy looking for advice on kind of life in general, preferably from people who are older than me. 

I love music, and I like to watch documentaries about my favorite artists. Lately I've been on a sort of 60s and 70s kick, and watching those documentaries and hearing how they lived their lives when they were my age made me stop and think.  This could very well be due to the sample space (successful musicians) or due sort of the good ole days mentality, but every one of them sounded a lot more carefree than I have ever been. They did drugs (I realize the time has a lot to do with that as well) played music and just had fun, or at least that's how it's portrayed. That's what I gather from the limited interaction with people I've had that grew up in that era as well (that didn't get shipped to Vietnam). 

Like I said, I know this could all be romanticism, but do you guys think it's better to kind of live fast when you're young or to play it safe through life? I'm not like asking if I should get addicted to coke or something, just like do you think it's better to be dumb and make the mistakes?

I've always been on the cautious side, and I see a lot of my peers (large state Uni) seem to be care free and living it up. That and the ""when I was in college"" stories I hear from older guys makes me confused as to whether I'm making a mistake by keeping my head down and working really really hard like I do.

44,"His birthday is next week and he’s under the impression that our parents are taking him out to dinner and an escape room, but the real plan is for me to surprise him with Disneyland tickets early in the morning around 3-4am since we have a few-hour drive. I also live out-of-state and haven’t seen him since the Fourth of July last year, so he doesn’t know I’m going to be visiting for his birthday.

He hasn’t been to Disneyland in 5 years and is a huuuuge Disnerd like me; we would always wake up around 2am to go even when we were teenagers, so I know he won’t mind being woken up at 3-4am.

The problem, though, is that he’s at his older friend’s place. I don’t know how rude it would be to show up at 3-4am without letting his friend know. I’m only hesitant about talking to his older friend about this because he does NOT know how to keep secrets. It will either slip that I’m visiting, he’d keep hinting about my surprise, or whichever, even if I decided to fabricate it and say my mom is picking him up 3am. My brother is too smart—he’ll put two-and-two together and figure out that he’s AT LEAST going to Disneyland.

49,"Hi, I'm 17 yo, male, and I have a serious problem of insecurity and self-confidence that has made me commit a lot of mistakes. I was raised by a really strict and wrathful mother, and most of the time I spent, and spend, with her is full of conflict. She wants everything made in her way, and none else's opinion counts, it's just her and fuck the world.

I think a lot of my insecurity it's because her attitude, but at this point, it's my fault that I continue to be this way.

I don't have friends, I only have one that I met in my childhood at school but yet I only talk to him via chat, because I'm not in the country he is anymore. 

I don't have friends because I'm ridiculously shy in front of another person. Heck, if I can't communicate well with my own mom and even other relatives. 

Even if they share some interests like mine, I simply can't connect with them. All of my tries to be friend with someone is a combination of me hiding my internal pain and making the other person uncomfortable. I too, feel very uncomfortable when talking. The silence always comes after some words and there ends everything. I think other people feel that I don't want to socialize at all.

I have bad grades and no motivation for school. I don't have any hobbies, I always procrastinate, I have bad food habits. 

I don't want to commit suicide because I want to fix this, I want to really live my life, and I'm missing a lot.

I always thought to talk this with my mom, because I can't talk this with anyone else, I don't have the confidence, the problem is with her and I want to know how to do it properly, how to discuss this friggin problem and solve it.

How do I do it considering how is she and how she would react? I forgot to mention that I've lied to her about my classmates, she thinks I have friends.

She is very nice to anyone who is not on our design team, because she doesn't feel threatened by them.

This might be a little long but please bear with me. So I’m a 20/m and an only child. Both of my parents are still together.

About six months ago, my mom (55/yo)started having bad leg pain, eventually to the point (about a month ago) where she couldn’t walk. 

About a week ago we finally got her in the hospital and they found a malignant tumor quite large in her leg.

I just heard the news today and I didn’t even cry, which is unlike me, in fact I reacted as I was told she just had a minor cold. I think it might be because subconsciously I saw this coming a long time ago. The doctors said it could be months or years.

Basically I just feel a whirlwind of emotions but at the same time nothing at all.

If anyone has gone through a similar experience I’d really like to know just how to get through this.

If you want any more details I’m more than willing to share in the comments. Thank you.

60,"Okay, so basically my parents are annoying bigots. There's no other way to say it, and I'm not gonna sugarcoat it.

My dad just got home, and I heard my mom and him talking shit in the living room. 

I went in the living room and asked what they were mad about, and I tried to leave as soon as I heard about what happened, because they were shit talking trans people. It's because my dad had a trans customer or something? I'm not all that sure but it's not the point. But I tried to leave because I'm gay and they know that. It's been awkward asf since they found and they're extremely verbally abusive to me about it, so LGBT topics are awkward and angry to talk about.

But they made me stay back, and watch a retarded video from no other than Ben Shapiro. 

I did, and his argument was essentially that, since trans women are biologically male, they deserve to be called males. Same thing with trans men, too.

I got extremely pissed off, and I went for a really offensive response

So, I have an older sister. This older sister, is my half sister. We have different dads, but the same mom. But she doesn't like or associate with her biological dad at all. So she calls MY dad, HER dad. 

So you can probably guess what my response was, I told them that my sister shouldn't call my dad her dad anymore, cause that will NEVER be biologically true.

That offset a huge argument, and they said that my sister would be really sad if she heard what I said.

My response was that I don't care because misgendering a trans person makes them ""sad"" too.

They told me to go to my room, and so here I am. They're mad, and I admittedly feel like an asshole, since my sister supports gay rights and is always very nice whenever we see each other. I don't want to her feel excluded, but I used it as at her expense to make an important point. I would still do it over again, it's a valid point, and it shows the effects these kind of statements can have on people.

64,"BACKGROUND INFO

\-  20, female, scapegoat, black sheep, the ""rebel"" child

\- have narcissistic dad and sensitive/overprotective mom - both are super strict and traditional indian parents - my house is toxic, theres always tension in the air, mom is always crying because my dad is a dick

\- I've been sheltered all my life, not able to do things other people were allowed to (go to bday parties, hang out with friends, go out alone (even shopping or to the library) or go somewhere whenever I wanted, have boyfriends, wear nail polish, wear my hair down, shave, or even volunteer 

\- I'm a ""rebel"", I've acted out and done things that got me in trouble because I am tired of living under rules (slept around for a year (i don't know why, I was in a dark place but I don't anymore), smoked weed (nothing else), got bad grades in college, stole, 

\- I mostly rebelled during college semesters because i was not being watched and had freedom (parents would still call me every other hour and i was supposed to come straight home after my last class)

\- I've been put on house arrest (yes even as a 20 year old) where my parents wouldn't let me out of my room, this has fucked me up mentally and emotionally 

\- I lack social skills, I have a hard time talking to people and I can't think sometimes (brain doesn't work), 

\- I've been stressed out constantly, depressed, on edge, afraid and unsatisfied with my life lately because o my toxic household, the way i am treats by family, I've been trying to find a job since march (so that I can move out and live a normal life without worrying about disappoint or making my mom cry again). I live every single day humiliated and sad. 

SO...all of this overthinking started when my mom caught me on the phone talking to my friend (who is a guy and the only person I trust to vent to about my personal problems) and she got disappointed and started crying because she started making assumptions that I have a boyfriend or someone that I had a sexual partner with (and I'm not allowed to have a boyfriend). Now, I don't blame her but it really hurts me that she judges me based on my past (which i hate being reminded of because I was stupid and in a really bad place). She cries because of this (don't exactly know why). I am a changed person, I'm still trying to improve because I've been a real bad egg (even though I am partly to blame, but so is their parenting technique). Anyways...this incident was a domino effect for everything else i feel living here and my brain won't shut up. I've been crying for 2 hours. 

I've never done this before but I want to run away for a 2-3 days and write a note for my family telling them I'm going Northern Ontario to think, to breathe, to re-evaluate. But really, I'd be with my friends who are going camping this weekend. But I don't know if I should. I am tired of everything right now and i really need to get away. But I am afraid of what will happen when I come back. My parents will be pissed, my mother will probably end up having a panic attack and cry-nonstop, and ill probably be put on house arrest (which has happened before) and god knows what else...I will definitely get a lot of shit but maybe its worth it?

Please help me, I don't know what to do! Should I go through with my plan?

THIS IS WHY I AM TRYING TO MOVE OUT. But I need a job first, I only have $150, so please don't comment ""just get a job!""",26Jun2018,2
65,"I have a great friend of mine (24F) who I’ve knows for two years and graduated college with. I would call her a best friend. She has been in a relationship with a man (26M) for roughly 2 months, they have already said “I love you” and talked about moving in. Fast in my opinion, but whatever works. Recently they have decided to take a step back in the midst of her losing her job and moving back home, they wanted to slow things down. She has since then decided to go on dates and have sex with other men. I’m having a hard time knowing this information because this guy is a nice guy, and has treated her the way she deserves to be treated. It’s hard for me to see them both knowing she’s cheating and living a separate life without him. I personally find this disgusting for a few reasons. 1 being cheating should never be an answer. If you’re unhappy leave. But I understand it’s easier said than done at time. 2: she has a child, where this child has a very good relationship with this guy. And 3; this guy wants a family and house and a whole life with her and she has him on the back burner in case one of these other guys don’t work out. I want to tell him but she’s my best friend and my loyalty is more with her. But on the other hand he is a decent guy with real goals and he doesn’t know her intentions anymore. What do I do? ",26Jun2018,1
66,"Already posted this on r/relationships but I got a pretty quick and unhelpful/I empathetic response. I also have it posted on r/relationship_advice and r/dating_advice and I wanted to post it here to cover all my bases...

Long story warning:

So my girlfriend has never cheated on me or shown signs of cheating ever. She has never cheated in other relationships either, she said she wanted to cheat on her ex-boyfriend with her former best friend because it was a long distance relationship and she never met the guy and was likely never going to meet him and he was trynna extort money out of her and also he cheated on her as well, but even then she never did, so I don’t really think it’s logical to count that against her. 

She’s always been loyal to me, and has always showered me with unconditional love and support basically from day one. Every time she talks to me or texts me she calls me beautiful and pretty and handsome, she always buys me treats and gifts and pays for 90% of our dates. **She’s** even the one who asked **me** out. 

I should feel like solid fucking gold the way she treats me...

But... I have diagnosed Depression, and Anxiety disorder, they flair up and go away on their own, I had treatment a couple years ago but it concluded. 

Our relationship is pretty good for the most part just a couple other issues here and there that we’re working on slowly over time cause they aren’t just things that can be fixed instantly, so I’d say everything is pretty fucking good with our relationship actually all-things-considered. But for some reason (probably my history of mental illness) I get these really bad intrusive thoughts. 

Oh she didn’t text back for 10min? Obviously she’s chatting with some guy or browsing tinder or any dating site really (I have her password on her phone but obviously my next mental jump is to assume she deletes it when she thinks she’ll see me and then re-installs it so I won’t find out, and obviously I have **no proof or reason to think this**)

Oh she didn’t let me know where she was going when she went out? Obviously she’s out fucking someone (no proof or reason to believe this, I very clearly need help, which is why I’m posting this).

My girlfriend knows about my mental health issues, and she knows that I’ve attempted suicide before, so because of my previous suicide attempts whenever my depression/anxiety flare up she insists that I talk to her about it and what kind of thoughts I have and it really hurts her when I tell these things because obviously it’s implying I don’t trust her.

These things are obviously baseless and stupid, but how my mind will rationalize these thoughts is like: **“She’s lying! She’s going to cheat on you because you’re bad to her! You did/do this this and the other thing to her of course she’ll cheat on you! Who wouldn’t!?”** But she’s told me like a million times that even though everyone has bad habits or qualities, nothing I do or am is enough to make her love me any less. 

But my mind just says “as if”.

Idk why I can’t believe her. Logically I see no reason to not believe her. Even in my worst moments, no matter how bad the argument or whatever it may be, everything that she’s ever said to me has been from the view point of someone who loves me and sees the best in me. No matter how mad she’s been she’s never said anything malicious. 

Example I’ll say something that will get her mad and she’ll be very clearly mad but she’ll say “why are you being like this” instead of just straight up attacking me and saying “you’re such a ____” and clearly it’s because she loves me and doesn’t want to hurt me even in an argument.

So knowing this, I just can’t figure out why I don’t believe her when she says she loves me. 

Maybe it’s paranoia? The reason I was diagnosed with anxiety because I used to be super paranoid that my dad was gonna randomly start being abusive or that he was plotting to throw me out, but now we’re good so maybe my paranoia has shifted to a different area of my life?

I see a lot of posts like these from the other perspective (my girlfriend’s point of view) and they all seem to say **“accept that it may not get better, that’s the reality of dating someone with mental illness”.**

Is that true? Does it really never go away? Or if it does go away what are some things I can do to help? And if it doesn’t go away what are some things I can do to make things better for her? 

Sorry for the long story, this just seems to be a re-occurring thing in this relationship and I want it to end. 

I want to believe she loves me and I want to trust her. But I can’t figure out how!

**TL;DR** I can’t stop thinking my gf is cheating on me despite like the 4 page in-depth response I typed out detailing why I shouldn’t think she is. I need help to stop thinking this way. If that’s not enough detail please read the whole story. Thanks in advance...

75,"tldr: idk how to really shorten this. i can basically keep living with my parents where I’m likely to kill myself within a year or less bc of the toxic environment and emotional pain. or I can leave and try to get benefits and help to live on my own and then be able to recover mentally and physically. but leaving would mean being homeless/living out of my car for like 6 months or maybe even longer. and I only have under $200 and am unable to work. I’m also disabled by a few conditions that cause really unmanageable symptoms so it’d suck a lot but I wouldn’t be going through the emotional pain and stress that I have at home, so it’d be significantly better in that way. 

I’m 20, been suicidal since I was 8 because of my home environment. I actually tried to kill myself when I was around 8, but nobody knows and it was unsuccessful because I didn’t actually know how to kill myself properly. but now I obviously do, and I wanted to on my birthday a few days ago. I actually almost did earlier this month. it’s really all because my physical health is shit and has been since I was 12 (when i got sick, and then I got another illness at 17) and my home environment has always been toxic and shitty because my parents are abusive and my mom and brother are both crazy and have outbursts/tantrums on a daily basis. it’s not healthy at all and I can’t deal with it anymore. I know I will end up killing myself within a year if I can’t find a way out. I really only have two options though since I’m disabled and cannot work. 

I’m applying for disability right now which is the only way i’ll be able to make money, and get benefits like medicaid and more which will make my life extremely better 

so my options.. 
1.) keep living with my parents and hope I don’t kill myself. living with my parents my chances of getting disability or any other benefits are slim, and the main reason I need disability money is so I can move out and get treatment that I need. but like I said it’s unlikely any of that will ever happen while living with them (because they have money and can pay for everything, even though they are going to stop soon). so really if keep living with them, then I need to just accept that I will have to continue living with them forever. which I just know there’s no way i can do that. I would really rather die than have to experience the emotional pain that I have to deal with from them everyday for the rest of my life. I just can’t do it. plus stress makes my physical symptoms worse, and my physical symptoms are worse than ever right now. 

2.) I could ‘runaway’, and live out of my car. I have $140, and I *think/hope* my parents would allow me to use their ymca membership still to shower and everything. I could stay at the library during the day or at the y. tbh id probably sleep in their changing rooms and pray I don’t get reported. I have to sleep/rest a lot because of my conditions. it’s too hot where I live to sleep in my car during the day if I need to. I would buy some blinders though and i’d stock up on water bottles. I’ve actually looked into this option and planned it lot because I really feel it’s what’ll save my life. it’ll just be miserable physically. but living at home I’m miserable physically and mentally. with this option, I would be able to get my application for disability expedited and could get approved under a year or even within 6 months. then i’d get medicaid (which I need because I’m losing my insurance next month and my parents aren’t gonna pay for anything anymore) and i’d be able to get a home health aide and more benefits that would just improve my life immensely. i would not be suicidal anymore, because my main reason for it is the emotional pain + physical pain (can’t change this) being too much. so without the emotional pain (what I can change by changing my environment), life would be a ton better. I truly feel like this is the best option, even though it seems drastic. 

I don’t have any friends or family members I can live with. and being disabled and unable to any type of work just makes my options limited. sometimes I feel like another option would be to try and check myself in somewhere for mental health help and an escape, but it’d be expensive af and I won’t even have insurance anymore and I can’t pay it, and I can’t let my parents be stuck with the money, plussss i couldn’t go anywhere in my city because my parents work in that type of work and my parents aren’t ok with me getting treated for anything at those companies where they know people. I feel like I have thought about all my options. and this is all I have. I don’t know what’s better but id appreciate some input if anyone can help

today was our hs graduation and she hadnt done much in the previous months but today she just so happened to be behind me on line. her friend said something about me so i turned around, stared them down to the point where they avoided eye contact and became visibly uncomfortable, and  i snapped at them for being so childish. needless to say, they were flustered. i hadnt responded to any of their shit for a whole two. fucking. years. it felt so good, but so mortifying. they continued to giggle as i stood in front of them, and at one occasion a paper blew out of my hand and i heard them scoff. i was infuriated. i still am just thinking about it.

78,"This day has taken a drastic turn for the worse, and I don’t know what to do... 

My roommate has a horrible gambling addiction, and he’s been playing lots of cards on the weekends, along with the Powerball, and even fell into sports/horse betting. He’s tried to seek help, but he’s relapsed a bit. I did my best to help him out by getting rid of any video games that encourage gambling, such as the ones that have loot crates in them. 

My roommate fell on hard times, and he’s had to turn to his credit card, only now he owes money to creditors. He thought he could solve this solution by going to an unlicensed lender. His rationale was that he could leverage the legal system against the unlicensed lenders. 

Me being the economics/personal finance major, I thought I had assured him that this would be a grave mistake, because he’s more than likely associating with organized crime syndicates. The same guys who don’t play at all by the rules. 

I’m out of college, and work full time with an insurance company as an actuary, and have been through the legal in’s and out’s as well as the personal finance and economics side of things. I’ve been trying to help build healthy saving and spending habits with my roommate as well. 

Anyways, things seemed to be going well, and two months pass by, my roommate informs me three nights ago that he’s going to road trip to New York City with some friends to go meet up with some college friends of his. I was ready to unwind from a hard day of work (I had a wedding over the weekend, so these days have been rough), and I get a knock at the door. 

I opened the door, and two gentlemen were standing on the porch, dressed in tux’s were there. I asked what they needed (my initial reaction was that they were having car troubles, idk), the one guy, had short brownish hair, and had a widows peak spoke up and asked if my roommate was home. 

I told them that he’s out of town, and that they can come back later in the week, I followed up with asking what concern my roommate was to them. The same guy mentioned they were the “collection agency” with the “firm” he was “lending from”, I mentioned that it’s illegal for collection agents to contact after business hours. The other guy spoke up, and he came off as dumb, he just mentioned that they’re “exempted” from “regular laws” (first off, wtf!?!?) 

I told the two that they’re better off just calling, like every other collection agent, because they’re wasting their time. I told them that they had to leave, and right away they pushed themselves into the house’s living room, where the door they knocked on is. The same idiot “agent” said that they’re going to wait until my roommate returned, and if he didn’t, they were going to “bruise me up” (his words, yes) in order to get money. 

I asked how much they needed, and they said $2,500. I offered the two a beer, and they accepted, I asked them if a paper check was fine, and they both agreed after I showed them my account balance. I asked who to make the check payable to, and they gave me a person’s name, and their “firm”, because they said either is find. I told them to sit still, because I was going to get my checkbook in my room. 

I wrote down the guy’s name, and “company” on piece of scratch paper, and then went to my safe, and pulled out my handgun. I was still in my shirt and tie on, still not thinking, and stuffed it into the back of my pants. 

I got a flood of courage, and went back to the guys at the living room (they made themselves at home!!!) I told the guys they had to leave. The two looked at me funny, and the smarter of the two asked for their check. I told them they weren’t getting one, the smaller guy got up, and he pulled out a knife. He says to me “wrong answer, pal”. 

Without thinking, I said, “you sure?” And pulled out the handgun. The color in the two’s faces flushed away, and they booked it out of the house. One of them dropped his knife. 

I did the obvious and called the police, but where do I go from here? I feel like I’m now in the middle of it all with my roommate. I feel like leveraging legal action is going to bring the obvious out for these sharks... they just try and ice me or my roommate. ",26Jun2018,0

About a month later, I asked if anyone would want to do something that day, and I didn’t get a single reply. Later that night one of the friends sends a picture to the group chat of everyone, except me, hanging out at his pool, with a caption saying “fun night.”

88,"There’s this girl who comes into my job with her baby son. Before, she was always with the father. Now she comes alone.  (I work at a doctors office)
I recently found out that she’s now living at the retreat. The retreat takes care of women and children in abusive homes or relationships, or generally people who don’t have the money to take care of themselves and their child due to an unfortunate situation.  
She’s sweet and we have conversations about how her nails look nice and everything, but she doesn’t know me and I don’t know her
As someone who’s going to be a mom in a matter of weeks, someone who’s been in an abusive relationship, I just feel the intuition to befriend her and make sure she has someone to be with her or by her side. 
I don’t want to make her uncomfortable. And maybe she’s someone who doesn’t want friends or doesn’t need that 
I just know personally I’d want a friend in this situation, whatever her situation may be.

90,"Hi reddit! First post here.

Im a student and im also going to teach a class on saturdays in a month.

I was working a weekday 8hr job but recently my contract ended and wasnt rehired. I knew i had the course im teaching in a month so i didnt panic, and since i was heavily delayed on the content i had to make for the classes, decided to hold on with my savings until the first teacher paycheck while finishing the content, so i wouldnt have to make it while on a full job while the course is catching up to me. 

The thing now is that i am working hard until late on this, and a couple of days ago i found having to wake up at 5.30 am for attending class as student and had gotten used heading off to bed at at least 2am, and knowing i would have a hard time falling asleep and probably woundt wake up, i pulled an all nighter. 

To my surprise, the next day i didnt go full zombie. I was quite awake, even. As a plus, that night i had one of the best work sessions in a while! No distractions, more peace and focus. Definitely a night owl.

The problem comes from the fact that staying into the wee hours on my pc is enticing and i attend classes twice a week that early, but im worried that a sleep 5 days out of the 7 ([so.. a week?](https://i.imgur.com/eXHc3VH.jpg)) seems like might take a toll on me.

Got any advice?

In particular, stuff has been up with her health insurance and now she's at risk for having no coverage (which is not an option given that she has no money and I cannot pay for her meds).

97,"So this has been happening for quite a bit, maybe 2 months. Anyway my coworker is this real loud/annoying guys that regularly likes to joke around but always takes it way too far with me specifically. Some examples of things he does is say ""go fuck yourself"". Not even any joke beforehand, just plain go fuck yourself, and he finds it hilarious when i tell him i dont think its funny and thay he should stop. He likes to challenge me to fight him by saying we'll bet money on who gets the first hit. I like to try to find a peaceful way to resolve things by saying something funny like ""ok yea lets fight mortal kombat style. This gets a laugh out of him but 10 minutes later and hes back to the same thing. I tell him that hes provoking me and i dont like it, yet he says ""its just how i joke around""  and ""stop being a bitch, you little girl"" even though im the only one he bullies this hard and speaks to in such a rude way. I try to have normal conversations with him and it always comes out the same. Plain and simple he does NOT like me, much less respect me. Anyway enough about that, today in particular he made me get to a certain point, we were arguing and he was pushing me down a long row of stairs we have at my job, right in front of a camera im not sure if it works or not, so i got the idea to record on my phone  and i confronted him. He didnt like that one bit, ""im not one to talk much, if you wanna go at it we can go at it right now!"" The only words that could come out of my mouth were "" alright then do something!"" I tried to provoke him as much as i could so he could let out his true colors. At one point during the argument i said "" i dont want any trouble, im asking you to stop. Are you going to stop yes or no?"". He then said ""i dont care if you dont like how i talk to you, im not going to stop"" at this point my manager stepped in and broke us up. I checked my phone for the video and i clearly caught the moment when he said that.



 Phew! That was a long story, thanks to those who read to the end, now at this point im asking for advice on what to do next given my situation and the evidence i have ( recording of argument and possible camera evidence of him physically pushing me into a very dangerous row of stairs which could have resulted in me getting injured, also my manager did hear what he said during the argument) 

Now im not a bad person, and i rarely want to cause anybody else any sort of trouble, but this asshole has made my worklife a living hell, the constant bullying and harrassment, fear of saying anything or speaking out (my fault i know) because of how i would look for telling on him, just a very nasty situation altogether, but i want him to get whats coming to him so that maybe next time he wants to do that to somebody else he'll think twice. Basically i dont care how i look at this point, i want to get him in as much trouble as possible and have him face the consequences of his actions. So please whoever can help, what should my next course of action be? Just very unsure of what to do next, what can i do legally? 


Please feel free to ask questions!

104,"I am taking an online course over the summer.  The other day I noticed that a file of an exam in the course had been posted and was available for 24 hours. . . one week before the exam was supposed to take place.  A friend downloaded it during this time and sent it to me.  The file is a makeup exam, and I believe that the exam was originally supposed to take place on that day, or possibly that students missing the actual exam were supposed to take it then.   Due to the way file uploading works in this course over the summer, quizzes (though possibly not exams) are uploaded day of and are fair game to download before your proctoring appointment, so looking at them ahead of time is the norm.  That being said, I noticed that the early post was made by a course admin (and was likely automatic), so I don't believe the professor realized that this happened.  Furthermore, the top of the exam has a statement to sign saying that you had no knowledge of the exam prior to taking it. While this seemingly doesn't apply in the summer, if everyone does well on this exam, it will look suspicious. Additionally, its quite obvious that the file was available to download, I just think the professor hasn't checked that section of the course in a while.  If I tell the professor before the exam, I may lose an advantage going in (as the format will likely change), and my friend may accuse me of telling the prof., but the prof. likely couldn't accuse anyone of cheating, as students simply downloaded a file that was made available on the course site.  If he finds out afterwards, he may have justification to accuse people of cheating as they signed that part at the beginning of the test.  There is also the possibility that he knows that the file was posted and that he's just very lax about it.  What do you think I should do?",26Jun2018,1

I really do, and I believe she still loves me but eventually her and I started thinking about ""taking a break."" We went back and forth on the idea and eventually, we were both down for it. Our thoughts were that doing this would allow us to find ourselves, and become better people. We also wanted eachother to find other people because we have only experienced eachother. We were thinking that when this is all said and done, we could get back together, as more grown individuals.

Well that brings us to about a week ago. That is when we officially broke things off. About 5 days after that I found out that she had sex with one of my friends. Now this friend I was not that close too, and I hadn't spoken to him for a couple months, but he was still my friend, and I've known him for a couple of years now. 

I went into this whole thing, thinking, surely it's going to take a while for her to get over us, and to move on to find someone new. Maybe a couple of months for example. But 5 days?? We are still on talking terms, as we still wanted to be good friends after the breakup, and after I found this out, I had talked to her. For hours. Basically her explanation was that there is nothing between them, and it just happened so fast and that he had just gotten out of a relationship as well. She said it's how she is coping with it, and I mean fair enough, but fucking my friend 5 days after we broke up really, really hurt me.

About eight months ago my ex broke up with me out of the blue. I realized since then that he had abusive tendencies and that he had sexually assaulted me.

I went to therapy and got really far with it and did a ton of work. My birthday passed recently and he reached out to me, despite the fact NC was in place. He hasn’t tried since, but it feels like everything I worked through is slowly starting to get undone.

117,"I have reached a new high in my career. I am currently heading a team of 12. I am reasonably well paid to work on a challenging once in a lifetime portfolio with a prestigious company that many would kill to get into. I’ve been here for a year.

The problem: I have risen to my level of incompetence.

- I made a number of bad judgement calls at a horrible cost. (They wouldn’t be so horrible if I didn’t also have peers who are very happy to inflate the issue and sabotage me though). 
- I make careless mistakes.
- I feel paranoid and get anxiety attacks.
- My bosses are not happy with me for the mistakes I’ve made. Based on my past experience, I should not be making these rookie mistakes really.
- I can’t fit into this culture. My previous workplaces have generally been blessed with normal folks. Here at this new workplace, it is really cut throat. I have peers who are like evil manifest. 
- I don’t get much support or understanding from my superiors. 
- The team reports to me so I am responsible for their deliverables but they have a direct line to my manager. I get bypassed quite often.
- collectively, this is a seriously challenging team. I have never managed more difficult staff.
- there is 3 years worth of backlog due to mismanagement before I joined. I get constant pressure to deliver as if my team is at full capacity but the processes are in shambles and I have an untrained team. They just can’t. 

I am seriously thinking of leaving because:
1. My pride. I don’t want to cling on to a job I am not good at.
2. I get treated badly by my managers and my peers for not performing up to par. They are extremely sarcastic and two face. I don’t want to work with people like that.
3. I feel stressed and overwhelmed all the time. I stay back a lot and resent the fact that others don’t have to. 
4. My time with my family suffers, my children suffers, my mental health suffers.

However, what’s stopping me is:
1. It is once in a lifetime! People would kill to be where I am! I couldn’t believe my luck when I was recruited. 
2. The pay! I might not get such a good package ever again. This company is practically a monopoly. The others are all small players. If I leave on a bad note (and it will be on a bad note because I was hired for a long-term project) I would not be employed in this industry again, most likely.
3. I would feel like a loser if I quit. 

I have analyzed this over and over but I still don’t know what to do. Redditors, any advice or fresh perspective would be great. Thank you!

TL:DR: I got a dream job (on paper) but I can’t cope with the workload or work with my colleagues at every level (subordinates, superiors and peers). Mental heath and self esteem suffering. Should I quit?

118,"👯👮If you look in the mirror and get worried about your looks, you are not alone!!! Millions of people are not comfortable with their looks and wish they were more pretty or handsome. 


Good news is that looks do not matter in your success path. Or do they ???


1) Natural Looks


Your natural looks are not in your control. You just got it from God. These are ""Not-negotiable"" looks. A look at the successful people confirms that these looks do not affect your future. Your features, skin color, nose shape, eyes size etc. are raw presentations of you. Some great people had very ordinary looks. People think Archimedes was ugly.

Just chill!!!


2) Negotiable Looks


The important part is ""what you do with these looks""? How you keep your hair, shaved vs. beard, shape of glasses and maybe, length of ear-rings. The negotiable looks can make you smarter or uglier in the eyes of world at large. It shows your attitude and people judge you based on your Attitude. Certainly affects your career. 
Watch out !!!


3) Smile...you are on camera


Whatever your looks are, a genuine smile on your face will make you look attractive. It is a a very simple but potent way to make yourself like-able. Moreover, it is believed that only Humans have been given the ability to smile. 
Start today !!!


4) Confidence


Confidence is the ability to feel beautiful without needing someone to tell you. When you are positive, have required knowledge, believe in yourself and trust in Almighty, a radiance appears on your face. This makes you look shining even with ordinary facial features. 


5) People remember your persona


As you grow older , you will realize that it is less important to LOOK good and more important to DO good. Anybody can fall in love with your temporary looks but it is your heart and personality that someone stays with you.

For careers, relationships or success, Beautiful has nothing to do with looks. It is how you are as a person and how you make others feel about themselves.

Now, smile in the mirror ....you are an amazing individual.

Come home at 8 pm and repeat; kids, clean, and anything else that needs to get done. Fall asleep around midnight, while my partner is asleep by 8pm the latest. 
My days off consist of groceries, laundry, kids, errands, cooking, and cleaning, while my partner sleeps, takes baths, or plays fortnite and makes my oldest watch the smallest child. 

Today I come home from another long 12 hour shift to the “man” laying on the bed while the smallest child has a soaked shirt from spilling water on herself , and as I point it out , instead of getting up and cleaning her , he yells at her for spilling the water. The house is a mess, I start to clean, he made dinner this once and complained about the struggle of watching the kids and having to take them with to the grocery store and also while making dinner. My response “welcome to my life, I do it almost everyday” his response? 
“I don’t want to hear your shit” storms off and goes straight for the “bath” because he’s had a long “day” while the smallest child is still soaked and there’s water all over the table. 
He doesn’t pay rent, he doesn’t watch the children for more than 4 hours from the time he leaves work to the time I get home. 

This time I couldn’t take it anymore. And I kicked him out, to which later he replies with texts :“fuck work fuck you fuck all of this bull shit” and “All you do is fight and bitch And then switch shit up, it’s all your fault your the only one to blame “

It was going pretty well and we started to kind of develop feelings (even though we both would never admit it to each other). Anyways, the fun ended when he decided he was going to try and have sex with a friend I was close with at the time and tried to lie about it. I broke it off because he made it into more drama than I wanted out of something that was suppose to be chill and fun. 

He ended up getting back together with one of his ex-girlfriends shortly after I ended things. He texted me about 2 months after he got back with her and I didn’t respond since we ended on really bad terms. Fast forward to now, he proposed to his now fiancé last month, which I don’t believe he thinks i know since I blocked him on a few things. Anyway, today he texts me asking to get drinks and I’m honestly shocked because he’s engaged and seems to happy and in love.

123,"I walk out to the kitchen. My mom is just finishing up her show in the living room and turns off the TV.

I walk to the fridge and open it up. I look inside and see absolutely no food, just condiments and all that junk. It's weird, because she said that she bought food two days ago. I then say out loud ""therreeees nooo foooood innnn heeere"". Not in a super jokey tone that would seem mean or a too serious tone that would see mean- a tone that is just right so she wouldn't take offense to it.

I don't remember exactly what she said to me, but she starts getting all frustrated and takes offense to what I said...which isn't unusual.

She starts going off on me and I'm just like, oh, here she goes again.

I say to here that all I was trying to say by that was that there is no food in the fridge, and that maybe she could grocery shopping to get food because it would be nice to come home once in a while and be able to grab something from the fridge instead of having to go get fast food.

She starts saying that I'm 20, and that I should be making my own food and that I'm lucky that she gives me her card to buy food and that I'm just a brat.

I agree with her and tell her I am always going out getting fast food or food from the grocery store and that it would be nice to be able to grab something from the fridge sometimes.

She starts saying that she has supported me for too long and that she shouldn't even be helping me ( funny thing, she fucked up my life for 5 years due to two different divorces, and moved me to 3 different states. I'm only getting back on my feet now from all the trauma...it was bad).

Anyways, she continues to go off. She says that something is wrong with me, how she never can do anything right, and how I always start fights. 

I respond that it is her who started this fight, and that she takes offense to everything I say, whines about it, and then starts fights.

At the end of the fight, she ended saying that there is something wrong with me, which she shouldn't say, because I've talked to her about saying this and how it affects me. I have suffered through major depression, still do, and she keeps saying that.

Anyways, she blames me, I blame her. Who is right? This fight was a mild one. She usually blows up, calling me every name in the book.

With these fights, I tell her that I get I'm part of the problem in some ways- it takes two to fight. I tell her I'm willing to work on myself and see my flaws, but that she won't work on herself.

She usually ignores this and blames EVERY fight on me and how there is something wrong with me and how I'm not right and just want to cause fights. But at the end of the day, she is the one always blowing up, calling me a ""fucking lying piece of shit"" "" little fucking brat liar"", stuff like that.

124,"A little while ago, I posted a question asking ""Should I ask again or move on"". Despite the responses I received, I am convinced I should move on. I've been going to the same school with this guy since 5th grade. We didn't talk as much until junior/senior year of high school, and now we are in college together pursuing the same major (for the record, I picked this major before him).  We eat, talk, walk, and study together often since we take the same classes. Not to mention that we also have to carpool cuz parking sucks at our university. 

Anyways...

I told him that I liked him in Dec 2016 or Jan 2017. He responded by saying he ""appreciated our friendship"" and that he wants to continue talking normally. And I agreed to that. But, (and this is where the reason for my decision comes in) every time we are on any sort of break (summer, Thanksgiving, winter, etc), he doesn't text me unless I text him first. So here we are, almost a month has passed and not even a ""how are you"" or ""sup"".  I put my heart and soul into our ""friendship"" and he knows that. In addition, I sent him a follow request on Instagram. Yes, he accepted it, but didn't follow back ???  I've known him since FIFTH GRADE. We GRADUATED TOGETHER. We took every college class and did group projects and pulled all nighters at the library  and got good grades together and watched movies and vented to each other and went bowling and shared playlists and drove back and forth from/to school. And all of this was after I confessed too.

127,I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post this but I really didn't know where else to post and just wanted some advice. 3 days ago my parents and younger brother moved from Texas to Florida and I stayed in Texas to be with my friends. I've been devastated since. Today was my first day back at work since and I felt like I could barely function and I had to catch myself a couple times from crying just because my mind would wander. For a little bit of background i'm 24(m) and my brother is 19 and we've always been close just like I have been with both my parents. Type of family who played games together and always had dinner as a family the whole 9 yards. We all lived together in Florida for 20 years it was where I grew up it was the only place I remembered. But when I was 20 my dad lost his job and my parents told they and my brother where moving out to Texas. I had an apartment of my own at the time while I worked part time and went to school so my parents asked me if I wanted to stay or go with them. I lived on my own but my parents still very much assisted me financial so I felt very nervous about staying alone not only because It was important to be with my family but because I was nervous about affording everything. Eventually after going back and forth I decided to move with my family. the first year and a half in Texas was one of the worst times of my life. I knew nobody had no friends and I always felt out of place. Eventually I met 3 guys who grew up together in small town near where we lived and I hit it off with them immediately.  We were all into the same nerdy stuff and got along great. I was so happy to have found these guys. I quickly became closer to them than many of the friends I had back in Florida. Fast forward about a year and again my dad loses his job. My whole family hated it in Texas so of course they wanted to move back to Florida and they told me that as soon as they made that decision. Again they asked me if I would go or stay. This time though I decided to stay with my new friends in Texas. I thought I had made the right decision.  Every since the day my family left I have been a wreck. I feel so depressed most of my day. Anytime I think about them I cry. I feel like a huge part of me is missing and I really don't know what to do. I know i'm not the first person to have left his parents but the idea of being this far away from them kills me. It's not like I wanted to live with them for the rest of my life but I did want to be close so I could see them.  I had no idea it was going to be this hard.

129,"Hi all,

I am 19 years old and have an overly controlling father (and basically household). I am a full time student at the University of Michigan college of engineering, and I am home for the summer.

My dad seems to be unlike any other on these types of posts. He likes to intimidate  me with the thought of ""working for him"". By this he means helping him finish our basement in our house that he wants to sell. While it doesn't seem like a bad idea at first, his definition of work takes it way further than a normal job. It means having to make him coffee and eggs in the morning, it means motivating him, ""getting him going"". Usually, I am on his watch Every day until 1 or 2 am, and he controls every free minute I have. We BARELY actually ""work"" and it sucks.

I constantly have to turn down friends' offers to hang out, even if im not Actually working because he says ""Youre working for me"". I can never spend time alone in my  room, either. I'm always being called to just be by his side. 

I have said I will get a job and he replies with, ""Youll go work for someone else but  you wont help out your father?"" He is always making plans for me and even when I am away at college he calls and nearly demands that I come home on weekends to help him out.

We live 20 minutes from my university and several times he has spontaneously  showed up to see where Im at and what im doing.

Now they are paying for everything in college and I DID have a full ride at Alabama but my parents convinced me to turn it down because it was ""too far away from home"" (I live in Michigan). I had an opportunity  to become independent  and lost it pretty much... damn me.

But I have no problem  working or getting a job, but I do have a problem being controlled and manipulated. And thats all my dads definition of work is: control. I've been controlled heavily all through high school, and Ive had enough of it since ive started college. 

When I was away for the fall and winter semesters, my mom used to say that my dad would almost break down at the fact that I was gone and he would be lazy all day, not do anything and sometimes not even eat.

I guess I need some advice because I have literally zero self esteem and I know I have a bright future but my parents are preventing  me from exploring  it. I am studying to be an electrical  engineer, not a builder like my dad. And I think im old enough that I should be exploring jobs that will help my career. What do I do and what  do you think my dad craves so much by making me ""work for him""?

Thanks for any tips and help.",26Jun2018,3
130,"So I started a FWB-style relationship with a guy roughly 4 months ago. We typically go on dates (at night) once a week &amp; have long conversations before engaging in sex.

132,"I don't want to feel like I'm seeking attention or anything and I apologize beforehand if that seems like the case, I promise you it's not. I'm laying in my bed right now feeling rather worthless with my dog laying against my stomach. And I just feel unwanted in every possible way.

A little backstory: I am 21 years old, I recently had to break up with my girlfriend because I figured out that she was once again hanging out with people who legit hated me and she didn't understand why that would upset me in the slightest. I was fired from my job last week, middle of the week, got called on my way home from work. 

I have another job lined up but honestly I feel alone like overwhelming alone. No, I'm not going to go kill myself because I could never hurt my father and mother like that but it sucks, it sucks alot and everyday u feel like it's nawing at me more and more. 

I tried to get out there got on tinder, had some good conversations with a girl. We set up a date ended up having sex and then literally right when I got home she messaged me saying it wasn't going to work and wouldn't tell me why. Which sucked especially because she had expressed interest in a relationship and I honestly thought everything had went well we seemed to click in my mind. 

I just can't seem to catch any break and I spent all day cleaning, applying for more jobs, and playing games. Then I go scroll through social media and see all there people from work who I thought were my friends who haven't messaged me or said a word since I was fired and I just I don't know anymore.

Am I that bad? Am I really just not worth it? What should I do? because u feel like a useless piece of garbage and part of me just thinks I should be thrown away already.",26Jun2018,1
133,"In grade school, where there was no alternative but to make friends with the people I was around, it wasn't very hard for me to find a modest circle of friends to play school sports, study, and occasionally hang out with. But during my first year of college I stopped wanting to be around others. Right now I usually spend my time alone, playing video games, doing house chores, playing music, and listening to podcasts. Whenever I do need to interact with people, I dread it, get it over with when the occasion arises, then return to my solitude. If this continues I know my mental health will continue to deteriorate.

138,"**tl;dr - In the past, I had a positive interaction with my girlfriend's sister [15F], but she is becoming very nasty to me despite me always being pleasant towards her. She only act like this toward me. Any ideas why or how to respond effectively?**

I'm looking to get some objective feedback on an issue I'm having with my girlfriend's younger sister.

My long-term girlfriend and I are both 27. She has a younger 15 year old sister that comes over almost every weekend. In the beginning (maybe ~2-3 years ago), the younger sister and I used to interact very positively. We would play games, joke, talk, etc. I'd even say that, at some point, we were fairly good friends.

But for the past 6-12 months, she has become increasingly nasty towards me for reasons I don't really understand. It's like she waits for any window of opportunity to try and put me down. She brings up negative aspects about my physical appearance on a regular basis - how I have a receding hairline, how I'm old and 'look like I'm 40 or 50' (which I really don't...), how I look like I've lost all my muscle. I'll crack a joke and she'll roll her eyes and day, ""uhh yeah... that wasn't funny at all..."". The other day I lost my keys and took forever to find them. Then she said she knew where they were and thought it was funny how 'I looked for them like an idiot'. I've started to respond to these incidents with a sharp tone, but she just let's it roll off of her and ignores me. The other day she asked me a question, and when I responded she interrupted me with, ""I really don't care, I really don't care, I really don't care"" in a disinterested, annoyed tone. I really can't explain that sort of response because she engaged me in the conversation!!

I've had my girlfriend talk to her about these things a few times (although my girlfriend is half oblivious to all of this - ""I don't remember her saying that..."" is a common response), and I've pointed it out to the sister directly in some instances. She'll usually try to deny or sidestep it somehow, and will try tp put me down in other ways or try to make it more subtle.

I really don't understand any of this, and have two main questions. First, any idea why someone would be acting like this? Some might think it is just teenager hormones, but I've never seen her act like this to anyone else - she's usually socially awkward and meek. Second, how should I respond to this kind of behavior. At first, I let it roll off of me. After a while, I started either ignoring her or snapping back at her, but this doesn't seem to be working either and doesn't necessarily feel right. Most importantly, I feel like my 'annoyance' at this situation is hitting a boiling point. Any suggestions?

139,"When reaching my longterm and realistic goals, I feel no emotion, relief, or excitement. When reaching short term or trivial goals, (be it in video games or personal projects), I feel amazing and it makes me want to keep going. But I can't seem to be able to replicate that for the things that matter or long term things that I want.

I'm so far achieving success by forcing myself to do things. But there's nothing that's actually driving me or motivating me every time I achieve something. There's nothing that makes me want to get up and get things done. It's also not perfect. I sometimes end up dropping some of my goals due to lack of motivation and will. The only time I can say I feel some small push is when I envision myself in the future.    

Even looking at where I am now and what I achieved, it feels like it's an average day. I understand that I've made it far, and I truly am proud of myself, but I never get any ""wow"" moments of realization. I feel exactly the same as before I got to where I am now.

145,"Hello guys,

First post here, unsure as to what I expect from it. Maybe simply to write it down will help me think this through.

A background explanation is necessary:

I am a 23, French boy who stopped a master's degree after the first half for a job that paid well, and I needed money to keep pushing through my studies. This degree is called ""international cooperation and multicultural relationships"". 
The jobs it leads to are vague, to say the least, it's a generalist degree with an emphasis on human and cultural behaviours, demographics, and languages.

I stopped after my internship because I wasn't too pleased with the degree. I did my internship as a translator in an international retail company, and I love translating.
The internship made me realize that I love translating, but it's a busy market with huge uncertainty regarding it's future because of technical advanced in Ais and deep learning.

I'd love to become a translator but my guts tell me it's too late for that job. That it might die soon.
Also, the internship and job that ensued let me see that despite not liking the degree, it made me grow as a person and taught me passive skills like managing huge workloads and crazy short deadlines. Everything I did in my company felt like a breeze compared to the degree. It is also very heavily research oriented and thus I feel very competent at learning anything on the go.
So not a completely useless degree I'd say.

It also offers a 6 to 12 months internship abroad to Latin America if I go back to it.

So here's where I ask for advice. Should I value the trade I love most and just go for translation since I love it so much and start a new degree, or should I keep pushing with the other one, and take benefit of the internship abroad, relying on myself to make the best of it with unclear outcomes?

What questions should I ask myself according to you?",26Jun2018,1

147,"I've been working at this place for about 2 months and it has become pretty apparent pretty quickly that my boss is not the best. At first it was small things that i could let slip by, like him showing me videos that made me a little uncomfortable but i just ignored him whenever he tried to show my others. He has his friends come back into the kitchen when we're working and they can get in the way. He also drinks with his friends while on the job , but nothing compares to what happened this past friday. most of this day was kinda shit but it really got bad in the evening when i was in the front busing tables. A man that i assumed was homeless walked into the restaurant and asked me for a cup of water. I obliged and walked behind the counter and handed him a small plastic cup to get some from the soda machine. Then i went back to cleaning. Pretty soon, i looked over at him and he was pouring Mt. Dew into his cup. Before i even had a chance to think of how to deal with this, my boss walks over to him and taps him on the shoulder to tell him he cant do that. As he's telling the homeless man this, the homeless man begins to yell, get defensive and starts making his way out of the restaurant. My boss is quick to follow him as he makes his way out, and the only thing i can clearly remember hearing being said is my boss saying, ""I'm gonna spray you!"" When i heard this my first thought was, ""does he has pepper spray on him?"" So i kept watching and my boss begins spraying the homeless man in the face and i get the answer to my previous question. As my boss was walking out the door, he grabbed the bottle of sanitizer i was using to clean the tables. My boss proceeds to spray this homeless man in the face MULTIPLE TIMES. I go to the door and tell me boss that he needs to come back inside and that he needs to stop what he's doing. My boss continues to spray him and then the homeless man starts to kick my boss and soon enough my boss starts kicking him back. At this point i run over and tap my boss on the shoulder and tell him he needs to stop and go back inside or he's going to get in trouble. This starts to get him moving toward the restaurant but the homeless man continued to yell and egg my boss into fighting with him again, but i continued to tell him to just let it go and get back inside before things get out of hand (which they already have). The homeless man got a good distance away from us, but he's still yelling obscenities at my boss. My boss yells back something along the lines of ""I could kick your ass!"" This pisses off the homeless man enough to take his shirt off and start charging at my boss. I didnt really think this part through but all that was going through my mind at the time was that i had to stop this because i didnt want either of them to get hurt or in trouble with the cops or something. i stepped in front of my boss and told the homeless man, ""let it go man, just stop, leave it alone."" The man stops comes toward us and yells ""you're only safe cause of her!"" proceeds to thank me for the cup and walks off. i get my boss back inside and i finish cleaning up and go home. I come back for the evening shift the next day and my boss comes up to me and tells me he ran into the same guy at the grocery store next door and started to harass and berate him about being a theif in front of everyone in the store. my boss was quickly kicked out of the store and, needless to say i was pretty upset that i went out of my way to protect someone who is stupid enough to start beef outta nowhere with A HOMELESS MAN IN A GROCERY STORE. I've been talking to a lot of my friends and family about this and they've been telling me to weither start looking for a new job or to report him.  i feel like i should report this to corporate because this is apparently not the first time he's gotten violent with a customer/person in his establishment. I dont want to lose my job though, because i actually love what i do. my boss is just a scumbag. He's also the owner of the restaurant so i dont know what would happen to the place if he lost ownership.

I'm moving forward in my life, change is happening. I'm optimistic.

About me: I aspire to be a film director of feature films, but I work in a 9-5 job because my dreams aren't paying the bills. I'm not sure if growth would help me pay the bills a different way.

I dream of living to my potential, I dream of waking up knowing that today won't be wasted. I dream of getting my life back on track.",26Jun2018,3

155,"Hello guys

I'm a 21 year old here having trouble with life decisions. I'm going to college for a computer system technology major and I also work part time at a retail store and do Uber on the side to make my ends meet. As of right now I spend 388.11 a month on car insurance, 200 on my car payment. 45 every 3 months for my prepaid phone plan and I pay my house cable bill which is 132.

This brings me to a grand total of about 740 every month to pay all my bills without counting for gas money or maybe outside food(which I totally try to avoid). I have no support from my parents. They do not give me any money and don't even help me get cheaper insurance rates by adding me to their insurance. And well honestly they completely 100% suck at managing their money even though they make wayyyy more than enough to make ends meet their credit is trash.

Now the thing is I got this nice job offer for a 8-5 M-F working as a TV tech inside a hospital paying me a nice $15 per hour salary.

 Now taking this job would be meaning that I have to drop college because so far I have tried transferring to 2 colleges and if I do I would lose 1 year and a half worth of credits which is a no no for me and driving to my current college after work is out of the question.

But I really want this job because this would mean finally not living a paycheck to paycheck life as long as I stay with my parents and not being stressed because I won't have enough money for one month or something. 

So I honestly don't know what to do. My mom doesn't want me to stop going to school and says that plenty of kids go to school and work part time and that's what I should do but she doesn't understand most of these kids get support from their parents wether is giving them extra money or getting them a car and adding them to their insurance. 

I'm so stressed out right now about this that I can't sleep. I told the hiring manager to give me a few days to think if I will take the job or not but i don't think he will wait forever. I feel like I will regret either decision.

156,"I don't really know what my body looks like (my perception of it changes drastically by the day). Even though now my size 0 and 2 clothes are sagging off of me now I just don't feel like I'm......there yet? On the days that I feel like I may be thin it doesn't feel real and the very next day I may feel, quite literally, like I look obese. 

To lose weight I count my calories. Recently my grandma has been very ill and I'm interning in a different state so I'm miserably homesick. I feel depressed and out of control. I used to puke on occasion but now it's an everyday thing. I'll eat up to my 1,100 calories, and then I'll have a few snacks with puke breaks in between later in the evening. 

The weirdest thing is now I'm losing weight a lot faster than when I was just eating to the calorie limit and calling it a day. I don't see myself stoping because I've wanted to be thin forever. I have a wild obsession with skinny bodies. I have thousands of ""thinspo"" pictures saved to my desktop. I know that if I stop and gain back weight, I'll eventually just have to go through the whole ordeal of feeling horrible about myself and losing the weight all over again. Don't really know a way out of this except just going balls to the wall (I'm talking two packs of doritos and two packs of ramen, then a couple plates of  whatever's around the house puked up in the toilet, with a healthy serving of diet coke and nicotine for good measure) and pushing forward until I meet my weight goal and will hopefully feel good about myself.

157,"I made this new account so my family doesn’t find this post. Tonight, I think I should ask for advice after my mother became abusive towards me after catching me downstairs at 1 AM eating a leftover McChicken. 

This has been going on for about a year now and I am very close to turning 22. Before I entered junior year, I’ve obeyed my mother by sleeping at midnight. When junior year came, my everyday life became packed because it was the year everything hit me. It was the year I started a part time job, became a board member of a big organization, applied for internships, struggled to keep my grades where they were, and stressed myself thinking about adult life. Of course, being a college student carrying that much weight, I started to sleep late. Some nights, I stayed up until 5am doing homework. The past year has definitely messed up my sleep schedule... but my mother still insists that I sleep at midnight. Because of junior year, I’m not sure if I have sleep anxiety or not but it now takes me 1-2 hours of trying to fall asleep when I try to sleep at midnight. 

Today, I’m on summer break and I’m basically working full time now that I don’t have to deal with classes. I only work night shifts (until 10pm) and once a week, work over night (6pm-3am). (My mother is completely okay with the overnight shift for some reason). These work hours play a pretty big role for my sleep schedule as well. When I get home at 10pm, there are lots of things I need to do that I couldn’t do in the morning, which causes me to stay up late. Showering, eating, working out, and browsing reddit are just a few examples. 

But that’s enough about me. Allow me to tell you a little bit about my mother. First of all, take into account that we are an Asian family and her main language is not English. It can be hard for me to communicate with her since MY main language is English and I have trouble speaking our native language. I speak English to her but she does not speak English to me. Her English vocabulary is limited but she will understand most of what I say. Although she’s very caring towards me, she sometimes can become VERY obnoxious, abusive, and unreasonable. Just today, while I was eating on the dining table, she comes to me and suddenly spews 1000 words a minute in a VERY harsh tone which caught me by surprise because I didn’t do anything that would really upset her except the fact that I was up late. She then threatened to destroy my laptop and video games if she ever caught me up past midnight again. What made me snap, however, was when she hit me as I was going back upstairs. This led me to write this post on my bed in the dark right now. It wasn’t a very hard hit but it was hard enough for me to know she’s pissed. 

My mother is also unreasonable and outright obnoxious at times. She will always think she is right even when it’s super clear that she isn’t. When I try to argue that she isn’t right, she will argue back in a way that reminds me of arguing against a kindergartener; repeating the same claim over and over, trying to talk over me, and sometimes she just says “No” and thinks it’s a valid argument. I never know how to argue around that and she always wins at the end. 

I’ve been quiet towards my mother about this for about a year now. Tomorrow night after work, I plan to try to sit her down and somehow talk her into calming down because I know she will be talking about what happened with the McChicken. That’s where the advice that you guys give comes in. I need everything that can help me convince her to stop telling me when to sleep like I’m a child. I’m asking for advice especially from other parents, sleep researchers, doctors, and others who have had similar issues. I’m never tired at midnight anymore. But I AM tired of getting hit and yelled at and then twisting and turning for 2 hours before actually falling asleep. 

Is it better to go to bed when I feel sleepy? Or is my mom right?

I spent an hour typing this as my mother thinks I’m sleeping 😏. I’m going to try to fall asleep now. I will check for replies in about 8 hours! Thanks!




TLDR: I’m a grown ass man who pays bills and my mother still makes me sleep when I’m not sleepy. She will spank me and throw away my video games if she catches me up past my bedtime again. What can I do to prove to her that I am in fact a grown ass man who does not need a bedtime? ",26Jun2018,1
158,"I feel some of my life stories are necessary to understand what I deal with and advise me. I’ll try not to write out my entire life here but this could be a bit long. If you don’t want to read it then just move on.

My whole life I’ve struggled with one thing: anxiety. Whether it be not wanting to wear a Halloween costume in the 1st grade cause I was nervous about what others would think or going to school living in fear of what people think, it’s been a major problem. In more recent years (since seventh grade) I’ve struggled with many social aspects. I don’t get along well with people outside my (surprisingly large) group of friends, I lack any sign of self esteem/confidence, I have a feeling that no matter where I am or what I’m doing I’m being watched and judged by others and I sure as hell can’t speak to anyone I don’t know. 

For a large chunk of my life i only dealt with a fraction of this. As a kid, some of the feelings were there but it didn’t affect me as much. Then fifth grade rolled around, I was on my 6th year of playing basketball; however, I’m not the most athletic person and that’s one of the reasons I quit. The other? I was heavily bullied. Personally I think it’s because I sucked, was a weirdo, and I’m just an overall vulnerable person. It ranged from insults to being slapped and had balls thrown at me. All the while the coach (who’s son took part in this) almost never did anything about it. I often attribute the start of my downward spiral into depression over the next 6 years to this. 

Next comes the seventh grade. My elementary school only went to 6th so I went to middle school in the same building as high schoolers. Therefore we shared the block scheduling and environment. For my entire first quarter I did almost no work. At my previous school I was regularly an A student, but at this school I was making C’s, D’s, and F’s. I was able to turn it around but since then I haven’t had a quarter of school where there wasn’t at least one C, on my report card (I’m now preparing for my senior year of high school). I’ve been told since that I’m an incredibly smart person, if only I would do my work maybe I’d amount to something.

Skip forward to freshman year, it’s been mostly the same stuff. I’m on my fourth year of tennis, and once again like basketball, I’m awful at the game and I’m bullied like there’s no tomorrow. I’ll leave out most of the details but near the end of the season things really started to take a turn and I began feeling rather suicidal, I got extremely depressed and it wasn’t looking too good.

A few months later, I find myself with a girlfriend, which was rather unexpected. Now I find it worth to point out, the three girls I’ve even been close to being with have all 3 initiated it. Me not being too social I can’t exactly start anything. Anyways the following 8 months are what seem to be the best of my life. After an abrupt end with a long story behind it I’m left spiraling even further into depression and she became a whore. 

I decide it’s time I see a therapist. After speaking with her I schedule an appointment with a psychologist—under her recommendation—to figure out what’s really going on in my head. I take a 7 hour psych exam and the results diagnose me with severe social anxiety and mild depression. For the next six months I was on an antidepressant that didn’t even affect me and after getting off of that my parents have refused to try anything else and my therapist is convinced that despite my results, all my problems stem from the possibility that I could have ADD. 

In the meantime of those 6 months I talked to another girl which we grew crazy close but for reasons couldn’t be together. We talked anyway and in the end it led to more emotional damage (again an extremely long story).

At this point it’s October of 2017 and I feel more done with everything than I have before. I continue to see my therapist who doesn’t seem to do anything. For some reason I feel that the only way I can come even remotely close to feeling happy is in a relationship. Although it may or may not be true, I don’t want my happiness to revolve around another person. So I decided back then to give up on others. No more crushes or anything, I was able to hold that for a couple months before there was this girl at work, there were multiple signs she was interested but then something happened that made me think not. This cycle continued for 6-7 months before she asked me on a date... long story short it didn’t really work. That was a few weeks ago and now I’m trying to give up again.

In lieu of all this there’s so much here that advice could be given on. And even more in all the details and other stories I left out. The point is I’m a mess of a person who is very lost. I’m not entirely sure what I want in life, but the one thing I’m certain about is I want happiness. That’s all I want. What should I do?

TL;DR: After a life of bullying and failed relationships, I struggle with anxiety and depression. No matter what I try nothing brings me happiness and I just want to be happy.",26Jun2018,3

170,"It feels so good to just blame my flaws on my parents😂.  I mean back then my stepfather was terrifying. He would just use verbal abuse because he couldn't physically hurt me, but verbal probably hurts more.  He would threat me over the homephone voicemail sometimes because my step sister was hurt and I was the only one to blame. I was basically ""blame center"" my brother was too old and my step sister was to young to have caused any problems so everything is automatically my fault. He would spoil my step sister and my mom would spoil my brother video games while I just watched both play and have fun.  My mom told my aunts that I was the failure child, when i was in another room, she doesnt know I heard. It hurts just remembering, I felt like just telling her off but I didn't. Everytime my step dad would go to work I would celebrate a little, he would hear me playing around over the phone when he called my mom and I knew he would be pissed because of how much noise I was making or because I was messing around. My mom always told me to tell her if he ever yelled or told me anything bad but how could I when my step dad said I would pay for it if I went on and snitched. He even told me never to huge or give kisses to my mom so I never do not even on her birthday, I don't even buy them anything or tell them anything.

172,"I am a Freshman in highschool and am doing an extra-curricular project with another team member. We originally had three people but one person left. This other person has generally been fairly condescending towards me all year, and I have just been silently taking it. She in general doesn't value my opinion and is incredibly stubborn, even though I have told her how I felt about her doing that before. She also does this thing where she purposefully puts me on the spot and in a situation where I fluster. Like once we were discussing something and I was pushing for us to include this one thing and she pointed out an issue with it, but instead of discussing alternatives or how we can deal with this issue, she sort of made me defend myself, and the way she did it she put me on the spot and starred be down, not giving me time to think, and I flustered and tried to point out something else, and she said ""no you're changing the subject"" continuing to push this even though I was visually uncomfortable. Later we actually ended up doing the thing I wanted to do, but we resolved the issue because at that point she was willing to communicate and resolve it. Our project involves doing a presentation, and several days before it we were practicing and got into a discussion about whether the content of the speech or the delivery is more important. We established in the beginning that it was too late to change the content of our speech, so the conversation was pointless, but because I said something that she didn't agree with, we got into an argument. I was trying to stop it and keep practicing, but she continued, and because I was trying to argue that delivery doesn't matter as much as content she called me overly confident and arrogant. I asked her if it was because I was acting so nonchalant (which I was doing because I was very stressed out a few weeks earlier for unrelated reasons, and the stupid speech 5 days away didn't seem like that big of a deal) and she said that I wasn't taking this seriously (which I was) and I said that my demeanor didn't reflect the way I felt. I felt pretty angry because I in general have actually been stressing over certain deadlines on the project earlier, and back then I wasn't especially nonchalant, so its actually quite a big step for me personally that I could be so calm in this situation. But she put me on the spot and said ""Are you taking this seriously?"" and I got angry and said that she's the one not taking this seriously because she wants to argue instead of practice, and she just repeated her question until I submitted and said ""yes"". There was also this one situation where we got into an argument over whether to include the company logo in the corner of each slide in the presentation. I said that I thought that it looked terrible, because she wasn't responding to my opinions before so I got a little mad, and I guess she got a little defensive. But she ended up saying something along the lines of ""if XX happens you can not put it in, and if it doesn't happen you'll do what I want"" even though that was not the logical conclusion to our conversation (and I got the impression that she wasn't valuing my opinion even slightly). I said ""We are a team"" trying to say that I should get some say in this, and she said ""okay if XX happens WE can not put it in, and if it doesn't happen WE'll do what I want"", missing the point of what I was saying. She also doesn't listen to me sometimes. I will say some information that I know will come up soon, multiple times until I think she heard me, and then she'll tell me to get the information or ask me for it. 

I very often try to calm the situation with humor, and it seems to work, but there is still this underlying aggression towards each other.

She definitely doesn't deserve 100&amp;#37; of the blame as I feel like I have made mistakes in how and when to confront her, but still I need some advise on how to deal and avoid such overly confrontational behavior. I also want to make sure that its not something that I'm doing that I'm not realizing. I have had problems with social interaction in the past, and am actually fairly socially awkward. I just want advise on how I can act and what I can do to minimize this aggressive behavior from her and from others in the future, and potentially how I can confront her about it.

In our store nearly every manager is a twenty something female that looks like 7's and 8's and since i'm an average looking dude who works out a couple of times a week I wasn't expecting one of my female managers who's a 7 - and 18 years old - to have chemistry with me but that's what happened. After a couple of days working together, some flirting, some body langauge from her, I was conconsidering asking her out but then her 19 year old sister - who looks slightly younger and is an 8 - gets a job there, and immediatly she starts constantly throughout the day talking to me and working for my attention. Truth is I think the older sister is hotter but my personality clicks more with my female manager. Btw both are single and as I saw from facebook photos used to be overweight (same as me, I used to weigh 250lbs fat when I was thirteen) and not so attractive. I grew up in a strict household raised by a very conservate-christian parents (my mother walked me to the bus and my cerfew was 8 pm until I was thirteen) and I wasn't such a popular kid in high school (my parents were poor and my step-dad didn't teach me shit before he split) so I'm still a virgin. One of my rules in dating is I try and not to get involved with my work-collegues. I'm worried if my judgement is being clouded or i'm too over-cautious? What's your advice on what I should do?

176,"**TL,;DR,:** Can somebody explain what it is about my comments/contributions, that seems to get me downvotes constantly? -99 Karma is quite a lot, negatively, isn‘t it? Just don‘t seem right to me. I‘ll say off the bat that I deleted a post in which I asked people their stance on selling their Nintendo Switch, when in my situation (basically college), because I wasn‘t sure what to do myself since I liked the system. I would go on to say that the finish of the console was, at least for my model, awful considering its price and that the system specs didn’t compensate for it either. That seemed to have pissed off a lot of fans and may as well be the source of it but could it be something else? In general I can‘t post in r/trees and other subs because of it, which is the only reason I‘m unsatisfied with my balance of karma.

Professional development
Currently in nursing school and was a prior corpsman in the Navy. Planning to commission after graduation. Will most likely not have debt after graduation either. 

Friends and family 
I have a lot of good friends. Few friends but very good friends. Some ive been friends with since 6th grade. 
Im pretty close with my family (including extended). Im the eldest of 4 kids. Mom recently passed away from cancer and father is incarcerated so my grandfather and I help take care of my siblings. (My siblings will always be my responsibility) 

Personally
Im on the shorter side (5’6. I know this is a deal breaker sometimes) and Asian. I keep an active life since i want to be an officer. 

Im pretty nerdy as well. I watch anime, play video games, and play in yu-gi-oh tournaments. I dont think my hobbies will change either since its what makes me happy (might be a deal breaker for some).

Current short term goals is learning a few of my grandpas recipes and learning how to play piano. Got 3 dishes down and i can play Shelter by Porter Robinson so theres some progress. Next year is learning some decent Japanese and learning how to draw (again im a big nerd)

Personality wise, i tested as an infp on the Myers briggs test a while back but i might have changed a bit. I like to think i am considerate with people along with being genuine. All my close friends are very considerate and genuine so i would think i would also be what my friends are. I self esteem issues as well but i always try to talk things out with people close to me and of course id do the same for them. 

Sorry for the long post but im just trying to figure out what to post on some dating sites or even if im material for a ltr. What i would think would be my biggest drawbacks would be my hobbies, my family situation, and my hight. Any thoughts?

183,"I am 25 and this is my first real-world job. I have been at the company for a little over a year now.

I was hired in a junior position at my company in a small team (3 people total including me). Immediately after I was hired the lead of the team quit. The person they have gotten to replace them is now leading 3 teams in the company instead of just one, so our team really only consist of 2 people who are actively doing work (myself a junior and my manager). Because of the small team and the amount of work we have to get done we are overloaded all the time. 

Last week I was called into a meeting and they told me they are looking at restructuring the team and it will basically make me redundant. I've seen the proposed restructure and they want to get someone with more specialized experience to do a specific task that they were going to train me on. And they are basically saying that all the stuff I do now will no longer be relevant. 

I feel completely demoralized by the entire process and from what they've said to me. I feel like everything I've done for the company in the past year has been for nothing since they are just writing my position out. To make matters worse they want me to be involved in the whole process and give feedback about what I think. Like I'm digging my own grave. Ever since the meeting I can't stop crying and have this empty pit in my stomach. I feel like I will never be able to find another job again due to this. Who would want to hire someone that has been made redundant by a past employer? I feel like I'm being kicked to the curb for someone who is suppose to be better than me and it makes me sick inside with anger and sadness.

I could really use some advice now how to bounce back from this. Whenever I start applying for places I get intense anxiety and just start crying because of how worthless and angry I feel now.

I am getting seriously impatient and annoyed at the fact that sex is paraded in my face like everyone is doing it and it is the 'in thing' right now.

I am almost ready to throw my convictions away and join the hoe club like everybody else in the world my age. Then I think about how much more pleasing and satisfying it would be to have a girl whom I love take it from me.

185,"13 y/o male here. I've been struggling with mental health for most of my adolescence with it flaring sometimes. Severe insomnia, anxiety, and OCD run in my family so it's been shocking to me that I wasn't tested sooner, or really at all. After having a bad mental break down my parents sent me off to see a therapist, but due to my struggle to emotionally connect with others or express myself I just ended wasting time. I convicted my parents that I was getting better after a few months so they decided to let me stop going, but after another fairly bad mental breakdown they sent me to my moms therapist(who had proved fairly helpful to her in the past). Unfortunately instead of seeking help again I merely wasted time with some bullshit about being afraid to eat things after one experience I had with choking on a piece of bacon. This went on for another few months, until I convinced my parents again that I was all fine. I couldn't manage to keep up that illusion for too long and ended up snapping again. They decided to try to send me to my mothers therapist again, and I decided to finally come clean. It was significantly harder now though as both of my parents were in the room and at my earlier sessions with her I found out that my mom was going to her to seek help struggling to deal with me. In about ten minutes she easily diagnosed me with depression and began recommending solutions to my issue. My parents have always insisted on taking the more natural route to fix things instead of medication, so when it came down to medicating me or regular exercise they chose to try to bring me to their weekly work out sessions. Now before continuing I'd like to say that this insistence on natural healing isn't to an extreme accent in anyway and with actual physical ailment doesn't really come in at all so it doesn't really affect me in any other way than this. On my first workout session with them I made it about 3/4s of the way through before my dad missed a box jump on a provided box that was a bit too high and a bit too jagged. He ended up cutting open his leg fairly badly and had to be taken to the hospital. This put a complete stop to me going to the gym and I was left without any way, effective or not, to deal with my depression. I truthfully feel that i need medication at the point I'm at and need help finding a way to confront my parents about this.",26Jun2018,1
186,"I have 24 years and I'm a straight male, I want to meet people that like this music but I don't know many bands and music of this type. I never really liked music, but I liked this type the most, even if I listened to some other. I like freedom and energy this music gives me. And people that listen to this tend to be easier to talk to. I had anxiety my whole life, so I wasn't able to go out and meet with people. Is it too late now to get in to this music, shave my head, wear black etc? Would it be foolish if I never did it before? I mean, I see 40 year olds dressed in that clothes, so it should be ok. But I dont wanna look like a late bloomer. I spend my life playing games on my PC and now want to live.

Do I just message someone that I don't know on facebook and ask for parties and things like that, or do I prep for that in advance?

187,"I [20M] have known this girl [20F] for about 7 to 9 months. We're from a North African country. I developed a crush on her and **got the wrong idea** that she had mutual feelings, so I got enough nerve to tell her after I got to know her better. Unfortunately, I got rejected, but we remained friendly(zoned). In fact we were very close to each other. Basically best friends.

Neither of us wanted to lose the other because of my attraction to her. Even before my confession we were getting along well, we shared a lot in common.. She could see in my behaviour how much I liked her but we opted for letting go. *""And then who knows maybe ignoring it will eventually make it end""* I thought. 

However, it didn't work out. As time went by I grew  obsessed with the crush. It went from a muse to a consistent thought that haunts me all day. I feel down when she's not around, as we usually chat all day and meet on occasion. Only when she's around do I feel relieved. I try to control myself, and at this stage coping with these red flags is getting draining. And I fear that if I don't better the situation I might start acting hostilely towards her. 

I'm considering meeting her to tell her everything that's in mind. That I love her beyond healthy boundaries and that we're better off walking different paths. That I don't want her to hate for giving up on her, because I'm doing it for the sake of my mental well being... And from that point on try to better myself and get over it. It had already affected my life badly enough, putting me on the verge of a breakdown. 
 
But I'm not feeling ready.. I'm not experienced with this (never been in a relationship). Separating with her will be another heartbreak, but I don't know of any alternatives. It's a dilemma. The rational part of my mind is asking me to walk away, while I don't want to let her go. She's someone important to me after all. 

Should I talk it out as planned or are there other ways I can handle this obsession without having to separate with her?

**TL;DR** Expressed my feelings to my crush. I got rejected but we remained friends ever since. I couldn't get over the rejection and I developed an unhealthy obsession with her. It's been haunting me for months and I want it to stop.",26Jun2018,0
188,"

Sorry for barging in like this. It's just I need someone to listen. A thing tht is hard to get in real life. Been feeling this way for weeks and it just won't go. I don't really know if it's only in my head, me making this all thing bigger than it is or it's not because of me. Been hating myself and everyone around me. Spewing ugly things, reminiscing horrible pasts tht i wanted to forget.


I don't rlly know how it started. But i just want it to stop. I want to love myself. I want to be wanted. I hated being mediocre. I want everyone to love me. It's stupid when i feel sad when people didn't respond to my jokes or my stories. I'd even cry when they refused to follow what i asked or wanted. I just want the ones who matters to me to love me more than they love others. But that's wrong. I can't force them. I can't help that others are more than me. I'm just me. I also can't force them to only focus on me. That's selfish but i want it. I don't know if its bcs im firstborn and i always feel like my younger siblings takes the attention away from me but images or memories of them choosing them over me rlly messed me up. It's like they always get better things than i get and to me it's unfair but i wanted to stop being jealous. 


The fact that I'm making up a world where I was always an orphan or with abusive parents is also fucked up. My parents are good people but I don't know why would i find solace in a made up world. The world will be about me meeting a man who will be kind to me but will only betray me in the end. Like why do i want to torture myself.


I also feel detached with humans. I don't trust them. I don't feel like i need them. I constantly need me times bcs i hated interaction. They'll only make me angry and being this stupid buffon who used force. And i want to stop it.


Sometimes I am also weirded out by my childish behaviour throughout these years. And I was afraid that I will never be mature enough for those around me. But then father said this today after one of my childish acts: she was always a serious child. Doesn't play much. That's why she's being this kid despite her age. And that struck a chord inside me. It wasn't because I didn't want to grow up. It's because I didn't have enough time to be a kid. Reminiscing my past will only bring memories of studying, restricted from doing kid stuffs and more studying. Even going to boarding school also pushed me to grow up. I hv to rely on myself rather than my family. And all of these created an ugly worldview. I believe tht I can only trust myself. No one rlly matters. It made me a selfish prick that hates people. Being a goody two shoes kid does not create good memories. And I'm tired of acting. 

  It also made me realise that it's already too late for me to undistance the gap btwn me and my family. Those time we were apart can never be replaced. I can't hope by being playful, acting like a child will bring us back together. There will always be a hole or barrier between us. Why? We barely knew each other anymore. Being an awkward family puts more stress to our bonds. We don't know how to communicate or even have a heart to heart session. That's why staying home rlly hurts. Because it is my own fault, for losing my own place, at home.

Again today someone said something that triggered ugly feelings inside of me. Was watching a video, Gumball: The Parents. And one scene was totally relatable and I started bawling like crazy. The fact that it is relatable to me was refuted and someone said that I am always feeling sorry for myself because it is over the top and annoying and I should not feel that way. Oh fuck. Why should I let someone condone my feelings? If I can control it why would I let myself feeling this way? It's not a fun ride okay. I can't control it. I just can't. I tried. And it failed.

My mental state is weak rn. The fact that someone didn't want to talk to me, saying that I am boring, that I'm a negative person and more these few days will bother me for weeks. Constantly i feel like unwanted, unloved and a waste of space. It just plays at the back of my mind. Heck. Never wanted to reach this point. Heck. Never wanted to feel all of these feelings. I'm tired. Honestly. I am

192,"Hey reddit, you helped me with my last predicament, here's hoping you do  it again.

**My friend found out her fiancee has been cheating on her and wants to break things off, but he won't let her.**

**My friend's background:** Pakistani, no parents or relatives in the picture, boyfriend/fiancee of 8 years, a 3 year old kid, and lives with her fiancee.

My friend **moved away** to the other side of the country **two years ago**. Ever since they moved, her fiancee and her have been working their ass off just to survive. Recently, she discovered that her **fiancee has been cheating** on her for almost the **entirety of their relationship**. **She confronts him**, he denies all of it. He either ignores the proof/facts she puts forward, or makes RIDICULOUS excuses like friends pranking him or a case of mistaken identity. She tried to have an honest conversation with for the sake of her kid but **he lies, lies, and just lies**. 

**She** finally gave up on the relationship and **wanted to break things off**. He went nuts. He told her **he wouldn't let her go** because he loves her too much and couldn't bear to see his family fall apart. When they have this conversation and she tries to bring up everything mentioned above, he doesn't really acknowledge it. On top of that, **he is emotionally blackmailing her** by telling her that she is going to be responsible for ruining their kids life and tearing their family apart. Yesterday, she told him that **she wants some space** and wants to move out and **he threatens her with suicide**. She was obviously worried, called him, his work, his friends to make sure he was ok and backed off from the conversation but he won't leave her alone. Today, **he broke her phone and took the car keys away**. He hasn't threatened her but she's scared. I offered to fly her out of there but for reasons unbeknownst to me, she won't leave.

**The Problem:** ***Everything is under his name (Car, Apartment, etc.). She doesn't have any savings. He told her that if she does move out, he would give her nothing. If she stays there, he won't leave her alone. She doesn't want to leave her kid there since he is unhinged. If she does leave with her kid, she can't work since she can't afford to pay for daycare, and if she can't work, she has no source of income. She doesn't really have anyone else besides me to turn to.*** 

The things I've tried so far: I've already offered to help her with the move financially, but I guess it's not enough. I spoke to the fiancee and tried to reason with him, but he's dead set on keeping his family together. I didn't argue too much but I did convince him to give her the phone and the car keys, and for the time being, he has. I've told her to check in with me via phone calls as often as she can. I've also advised her to call the cops if she feels like she's in danger. 

**Questions:** ***What are her options? What is her best possible move here? At what point, does she get the law involved? What else can I do to help or even make her situation remotely better? Any advice you have in general would be greatly appreciated!!***

THANK YOU ALL IN ADVANCE!!",26Jun2018,5

I studied the entire chapter and wrote all the answers in my notebook, however when my teacher asked me to stand up and answer the question I couldn't answer/frame my sentence without stuttering at the start, so I just gave up.

She'll also often wear really thin shirts which show off pretty much everything and think it's okay to wear them around the house when our (me \[18\] and my sister's \[16\]) friends or partners are here.

I've tried to tell her that her behaviour is gross and inappropriate but she won't listen and gets offended and blabs the whole ""I'm your mother, you should be okay with it"" line.

Skip one week forward and I'm a new person. The way I could stay at home and not go out for years was due to masturbation every day at least once, whenever I got horny, and I did that since I was 12-15 years old. So after I would finish with that, I felt lifeless and continued to game. After I stopped doing that, I felt so much energy and I just couldn't play games anymore. I haven't played for days and I never want to see any game again in my life. So, what is happening? Is it that I'm a late bloomer or just recovering from addiction? I mean, life became colorful. I loved rain my whole life more than anything, and now I cant stand it anymore. I fucking hate IT! Last time I felt like this was when I was 12 yr old, in a way how happy I am with doing stuff I forgot, like walking in the park, that for last 12 years was just pointless and I didn't feel anything.

She got me clean after a 5 year heroin addiction and got me back to being a functioning member of society. So i want to pay her back by giving her a worry free family life she's always wanted.

204,So basically me and my girlfriend broke up a good while back but we've stayed in the same friend circle. The other night she was talking to a mutual friend and they told me one of the reasons we broke up was because I was too immature which honestly I can understand I could act quite childish at times thinking it was endearing or for the sake of a joke but I now see that it was obnoxious and unlikable quality I had. I feel like I've grown up and became more responsible since we've broken up but I feel like no one else sees it and she doesn't see any change in me. It annoys me that the people around me think they know me better than myself and I want to show that they're wrong about me and that I have grown up. How can I outwardly express that I've matured without it looking obvious what I'm trying to do?,26Jun2018,1
205,"Stayed at a friends house last night and on my way home this morning i get a phone call from a private number. the caller told me that my mum was at the local police station and that she wanted me to know she was safe (mums phone seems to be off so i have no idea how they have my number). I stupidly didn't think anything other about it since my mum has been in contact with the police lately due to an event in her past. I told my sister who told me to call back and see if they can tell me why but being a private number i couldnt. So i call the local police station which is where the person on the phone stated she was being held. The person on the phone at the police station told me that they have no record of her being detained there. i then get hold of my teenage brother who was the only one with her last night who tells me she went for a walk at around 1AM and is not sure if she ever came back. She took her wallet with cards, money an ID. there is also an empty bottle of wine on the table. my sister says i should file a missing person report but im not sure if its too early to tell. i am also worried there is the possibility that she has been taken and i may have missed some hint in the original phone call.

my mum also suffers with PTSD which makes me even more worried.

feel like there is something else i could be doing or maybe im over thinking it and she will be back later.

210,"Hey all,

I'd like to explain the dodgy title real quick,
First-year Australian uni student here, handed in at least 17 resumes already and haven't heard a thing back. I knew from the start that if that was to happen, it would've been because of my experience. A lot of the opportunities I have cater to food etc. and the only work experience I've gotten paid for is a cleaning job where I helped clean buildings (throw away the trash, wipe tables etc.). I assumed it knocks me out of the competition with candidates who already have said experience with other places, me being in uni already doesn't help. I have a fair amount of volunteer work down but then again it's not paid work.

Is there anything I can say that won't be 'checked' via references that might help me get a slight advantage?

I'm open to really anything here. If you guys have any legitimate things that could help (online courses or along the lines), I'd appreciate that immensely.

215,"I've known this girl for about a month and a half.  She lives a few states away and we met on the platform most people probably know as discord.  You know I've dated before but have never fallen for a girl quite as hard as I have for her.  We voice chat just about everyday and occasionally fall asleep on call and wake up together.  I know a lot about her life and she knows a lot about mine.  So you ask why don't I just ask her out and give it a shot but there is a large catch.  

That simple catch is I frankly don't know if she likes me in that way.  She calls people darling and says I love you to people (she loves but is not in love).  From what her friends and she has told me she likes to hugs and cuddles people all the time that she has no real interest in dating.  Which is fine and I simply don't mind because I know it's out of purity and not lust.  And the distance isn't that big of a deal.  All the signs are there but are they really?  Frankly I'm just confused about the whole situation.  

And the distance isn't that big of a deal.  I have a car and a job and her the same so no real big deal.  I can travel every 3 months or so down there so it will still be long distance but not only like once a year.  Along with this I plan on moving pretty soon and frankly if we are dating I would move down there in a heart beat.  

Yeah know she has told me she loves me in the past and I respond with ""I love you too"".  What's funny about that is I'm not sure if she is in love with me rather than just loves me.  And I'm worried because I don't want to lose her to someone that geographically lives close to her.  Nor do I want to lose what we have and frankly idk if I could take that kind of rejection because I know it would get out to the main discord group of friends.  And I know that just sounds stupid and it probably is but idk this whole love thing is just making me dumb.

I'm frustrated and just need some guidance.  I'm really just looking for advice and looking on how to make this work.  Seeing if anybody knows a girl kinda like this and how they handled it.  How to make a long distance relationship work and what can I do to really just seal the deal.  And yes I know her address and she knows mine so I can send her stuff (if that matters)

Anyway thanks for reading and I'm sorry if there was any mistakes in this.  I type this from a voice chat as we speak with her slow breathing as she sleeps in the earlier morning. I love her but I mean it in a different way than I believe she does.  Or does she mean it in the same way.  Hell if my dumbass could figure it out...

She seems to be in a relationship (fb status says so) so I don’t know if I’m someone she would really want to hear from right now.

We broke up because we were long distance the last few months of our relationship and she ended up cheating, but that was also three years ago and I don’t have any harsh feelings against her anymore.

217,"This is a cross-post from three other subreddits. I was hoping somebody here could advise me on what I should do next.

I'll try to explain this as best I can. My friend and I have been talking for six years and are very close, despite never having met. I have her on social media, but we usually communicate via texting. We recently talked on the phone and she referred to a close friend of hers in real life. I remembered a photo that she had up as her profile pic once, which featured her and a little bit of a friend. I asked if that pic featured the friend that she was talking about, but she said that she'd never uploaded any pics of anyone but herself on her social media account.

Fast forward about a week, we were talking about her friend again via texting and I decided to ask about the photo once more. So I saved the photo from her social media account - which was 100% publicly available - and sent it to her via text, saying that this was the photo I was referring to. She was shocked and asked me where I found that pic, adamantly asserting that she had never posted it publicly. She then said, ""Be honest. You didn't find this photo on [her social media account]."" I was very offended because I felt like she was accusing me of lying to her, so I took a screenshot of her profile picture photo album to prove that it's on there and publicly available.

After two hours of waiting, she finally got back to me, at which point she doubled down by saying that she had never used that picture as her profile image, and accused me of invading her privacy by actively looking through her photos and social media profile for personal information that she did not consent to sharing with me. I was very frustrated at this point, but I still explained that I distinctly remember her having it up as her profile image (which is the truth, it absolutely was), and that the only reason I accessed her profile pictures and saved it was to ask her about it via text. I also explained that the only reason I took a screenshot of her album was to prove that it was publicly visible - anyone could find it. She remained adamant that she had never shared that image with me or anyone else, and that I had shown a flagrant disregard for her personal boundaries. I couldn't reason with her.

There was a time, years ago, when we argued frequently. Back then, I did overstep boundaries at times, and I did invade her privacy to some degree (granted, nothing I knew about her was non-public information). However, I've made an effort not to do that anymore. In this case I really, truly don't think that I behaved particularly inappropriately. If she doesn't want people to see a certain photo, she shouldn't have it up on her account, and she should have been more cautious about her account's privacy settings. If I don't want someone to see certain pictures of myself, I don't post them publicly to my account. I only saved and sent that photo to her because she said that she didn't have a photo of anyone else on her account, when I very clearly remember seeing it up as her profile image once.

It's been a few days, and I'm pretty sure she's still upset with me. I sent her a more detailed explanation of everything I've ​mentioned above, but she hasn't responded. We've been getting along very well until this. In case anyone is wondering, I do have feelings for her and am not confident that I'll find any other woman that shares as many tastes and interests with me as she does.

What am I to do? I don't want this situation to jeopardize our friendship.",26Jun2018,2

220,"Hi all! 

I live in Daytona Beach, in an up and coming neighborhood. I’ve been here almost a year and up until recently my neighbors, although they’re loud, litter, and smoke weed in the front yard all the time, haven’t really been a direct bother to my boyfriend or I.

As of the last month or two, they’ve continuously left their small shitzu(maybe a mix with something else) outside to sit and bark... nonstop.
These houses were built in the 50’s and some of my house still has the original plantation windows. I can hear everything! They will sit this dog outside for HOURS, starting as early as 5:20am. 
I work from home so I wake up around 7:30, but now I can’t sleep anywhere in my house with this dog barking like this! 

My city states they have a policy against public nuisances such as a dog disturbing the peace by barking. 

I don’t want to call the cops unless I absolutely have to. How should I go about bringing this problematic issue up?  They’re not very decent people- I’m positive this dog is also beat regularly judging by the way it acts when you go up to it and from what I have heard. 
I don’t know how they’d react to me telling them their dog is a problem, and I certainly don’t want the dog getting hit to be quiet, so I am trying to tread lightly. 
They are also renters. My boyfriend and I own our house, so at some point in my mind I stop feeling bad about wanting to call cops.

222,"Hi all, maybe this isn't the right place for this but I am a little desperate because this is kinda a stupid question, but anyway, here it goes. 

There is a good chance I'll be meeting a girl for coffee. I went to high school with her but haven't talked for years. We went to a private school that was largely segregated as far as boys and girls but we got along pretty well despite the fact they tried to separate the boys and girls. 

Recently I saw her at an event and started thinking that we might work out as a couple, so I started pursuing her. We might be meeting for coffee at a local shop. I'll probably be there before her and have my stuff already ordered. If I see her come in should I stand up and greet her before she orders? She I wait until she is standing in line to pick up her order or until she comes over to my table?

At that point I would probably stand up to greet her but do I go for a hug? A handshake? An awkward stand up with no physical contact?

A handshake seems a bit formal but also less risky than a hug but I know the rule of a gentleman not extending his hand to a woman for a handshake as well. 

Sorry if these are stupid questions but I have no female friends and I have no idea how to act. I'm confident enough that once we get past the greeting I'll be able to keep it together. Not sure how I'll close the date off, do I walk her to her car? A hug at the door? Do I just say thanks &amp; goodbye then leave?

I am a little terrified. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks &lt;3 ",26Jun2018,1
223,"I need outside feedback to gage my stupid quotient.

Back during the recession, I was working in a convenience store with a really stupid customer alert system, they installed a buzzer behind a soundproof wall in the cooler.  Due to the setup they had to increase the volume to 130-140 decibels or so to have the sound heard around the store.  I worked nights and wore earplugs but one day at the end of the shift I didn't take precautions as my boss was riding me and I was trying to avoid any further stupid, micromanaging commentary.  3 seconds exposure was enough!  Is my lack of assertiveness inexcusable?

224,"My ex [30sM] broke up with me [20sF] a year ago. For some background info - he asked me out and we had a really good 6 months, he was super sweet, we went out a lot, we connected really well. He agreed that we had amazing chemistry. It was just really good on both sides. This was also during the first semester of his PhD program. Here and there he'd talk about how much work/reading he'd have to do.

Eventually, during our 6th month, he almost broke up with me because he felt overwhelmed with the program and felt like he couldn't be in a relationship. But we sort of worked things out, I agreed and was okay with seeing him less. Weeks go by, and he starts communicating with me less and less, I didn't bombard him with texts, once to twice a week I'd ask how he was doing. He barely talked, usually turned down my requests to hang out for a bit but I always wished him the best. I would also see him in passing on campus, he always looked tired and worn down. But after that I got upset because it was around more than a month since we saw eachother. We agreed to do something for his birthday but he ended up going to his aunts place and that fell through. Thats when he called me one night saying he was selfish, that hes sorry, that he just needs more time to work through things. So i gave that to him again.

Thats when around 2 and a half months went by of complete silence and one word text messages, after that I called him, he wanted to break up saying I didn't deserve him, he isn't ""normal"", he has to focus. I obviously cried, told him I just wanted him to communicate with me more, silence wasn't healthy. The next day I just went over to his place, we slept together, I gave him the birthday gift I got him, and I guess it was understood that we were together again. Finally, another month goes by, in that time we saw eachother maybe 3 times? I send him a picture of a place I really wanted to go, and he texts me saying ""I'm no good for you"" and says he wants to break up. I go back to his place and this time I figured it was for sure. I tried telling him we just needed to talk about when and how to work around his schedule. But he was unwilling to do and after a lot of crying I left. That was last June.

I have not spoken/texted him since then (I told him I don't do the whole friends with exes thing) and he has not reached out either. I spent a lot of my time trying to forget about him, working on myself etc. It's worked for the most part.

Except over this entire year, I sometimes see him and it's super weird because he stares at me really intensely, especially when he thinks I'm not looking. I'm talking staring at me while walking past. Full eye contact, doesn't budge when I look back sometimes either. Until I feel uncomfortable and look away. My friends have noticed that he stares too. I was talking to a group of guys in my program and one of them later told me that my ex was staring him down. I've caught him over 5 times in the last week walking past staring at me, and once THROUGH A STAIRCASE. When I see him, he either quickly looks away or keeps looking until I do.

This has been happening the entire year. Basically every time we see each other in passing. Luckily, I'm usually at a distance whenever these situations happen, so there hasn't been close walking past each other where one of us has to say hi or something.

I don't know, I guess this is hindering me from moving on fully. I have to be on campus, and having your ex that you really tried to make things work with stare you down is weird. Any idea why he's doing this? Can I make it stop?",26Jun2018,3

231,"     Marching band camp has just started and already, my suspicions were confirmed. 

I hate it.

I have no motivation to get through the 12 hour day. I don’t fit in with my section (I’m a mellophone player who wanted to play trumpet because it’s what I’m good at, but because of my skills on French horn and their need for mellophones, that’s where I was put) even though they’re pretty nice. I hate being forced to eat, much less in front of over 50 people (self confidence issues). I hate the thought of having to march. I hate the fact that I’m giving up my summer for something I don’t feel like I belong in. I hate, I hate, I hate. 

It’s not that I’m lazy, it’s just that I already don’t like it and can’t find the drive for something I don’t like. Hell, I don’t even like the idea of being in marching band. So why did I join? Honestly, no idea. All my friends were and I thought it might be fun, so I tried out and got in. I have a lot of respect for everyone in the band, but I don’t feel like it’s something I belong doing, especially since I’m having a hard time understanding and liking it.

So why don’t I just quit?
I can’t. The fees (some of which are over 1,000 dollars) have already been paid and can’t be taken back. The dot books have already been made. My section has no alternates and if I dropped, the number of mellos would be oblong, which would mean another mello would have to be dropped. Essentially, I’m stuck. The thought of having to do shows on a Friday night while getting up Saturday for practice exhausts and scares me. The band doesn’t need someone who isn’t even into it. I know it’s partially my fault, but when I tried out I thought it would be fun no matter how taxing it was. That just wasn’t the case, and now I don’t think I can get out of it.

Basically my mother doesn't eat properly. I started noticing this when she started complaining about being always tired. I think she is obsessed with losing weight but she is doing it in a really unhealthy way.

She is 51 years old, 1.56m high and weights 60kg. (I am 20 years old).

She does not do any kind of physical exercise so I reckon she needs about 1600 calories daily (correct me if I'm wrong) and, doing some guesstimation with the help of the ""Lose it!"" app which I use for myself I found she eats about 51% of those 1600kcal on the 3 main meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner). And she definitly doesn't eat the other 49% during the day, and if she does it isn't with healthy foods. 
She doesn't eat enough protein, and then eats a bunch of carbs like bananas and sweet potatoes and fatty dairies like brie cheese. 

I have tried telling her what she is doing wrong and what she should be doing instead, but she just brushes it off. I have told her she should get an appointment at a nutricionist (one where my brother has been and found amazing results and learned how to eat properly) and I said I would even go with her if she didn't feel confortable, but all she says is she doesn't have time because of work. I sort of believe that she really has no time, but I also believe she is not willing to MAKE time for it. To make things worse, she is a workaholic, always has been.

I want to help my mom. I want her to get help. I want her to listen to the voice of reason. If she eats this bad and feels tired when she is 51, I don't even want to imagine what problems she might have when she is 60 or 70 if she keeps eating like this...

How can I help my mother?

239,"I just completed my first year of college. I have made a lot of friends and acquaintances. I'm African American. A lot of the people I have become friends with are White. I've never judged people by their race, I've always judged them by their character. The people I've become friends with are good people.

My father however is not fond of this at all. He doesn't like that a lot of my friends are White. He asks me, ""Have you've been meeting people in school?"" I'll say ""yeah"". He then asks, ""Are they Black or White?"" I say most are White. He then asks, ""Have you been meeting any Black people."" I say ""I have."" And I have. I have made friends of my own race and acquaintances. They just don't make up the majority. I'm a Biology major with a pre-med focus, and there aren't a whole lot of people of my race in my program, so I don't have a big variety to choose from. My school doesn't have a high Black population.

My father tells me, ""Never forget who you are. You are a Black man and you need to be proud of it."" I am proud of who I am, and I don't have any self-hatred. But I also am a lot more open-minded and don't think races need to be confined to their own race. I shared a suite with three other roommates, and I was the only Black person. My father didn't like that I was the only Black person there. But we all got to know each other and became good friends.

Before I met my roommates, I sent them all an email to introduce myself. I told my father about this and he told me next time in your email say, ""I'm effectiveking4. I am a Black male, etc."" I completely disagree with that. You shouldn't mention your race before you meet someone. It shouldn't matter.

My father isn't fond of White people that much. I'm sorry if I'm offending anyone, but it's true. He talks a lot of crap about White people and his White coworkers when we're at home. However he is very cordial and will make small talk with our White neighbors, in public, and even his White coworkers at work. He even met my roommates and shook their hands and everything. He's outwardly nice to everyone, but makes derogatory comments behind closed doors. This puzzles me.

All in all my father is very judgmental on who I make friends with. I don't actively seek out friends outside of my race, they just happen. My mother and sister are a lot more open minded and don't judge who I become friends with.

How can I get my father to be a bit more open-minded?

tl;dr: My father doesn't like that a lot of my friends I made at school are White. We're Black. He always asks when I meet someone new, ""Are they Black or White?"" That question gets annoying. He didn't like that I was the only Black person in my dorm. He didn't like when I didn't state in my email that I sent my roommates before I met them that I was Black. I wish he would stop being so narrow-minded. How can I get him to see past my friends' race and just look at them as people?",26Jun2018,2
240,"Hi Redditors,

I'm having a bit of a dilemma right now, regarding my career pathway. I'm F (23), Currently, I work as a contractor for a Federal Agency. Before this I was unemployed for almost a year after graduation. When I was offered this job, it was only suppose to be part-time. I now work the hours of a full-time employee. Here's where my dilemma comes in, I want to quit. Why? The reasons will be written down below:

\- Commute: The commute is long, if I were to count the hours spent stuck in traffic in addition to the 8 hours at work, it would be half of the day (12 hours). For some reason I also encounter horrible experiences when driving on the freeway, such as almost being hit twice by a Semi-truck, witnessing flying objects falling out of cars (hammer, rocks, boxes, and etc) and reckless drivers. I feel unsafe when driving and I had a traumatic driving experience that I am still trying to recover from that causes me to panic.

\- Management: I don't see my management as often because they reside in another state, but I do have supervisors implemented near me. I just want to say management is incapable of completing their job. I cannot get a hold of them via text, call or email. If I'm lucky, I'll receive a reply by the end of the day. But if they really need something, they'll constantly text and reply back promptly. there is no foreground on how to communicate. I have two supervisors, one who's upper and lower, various times I've had asked simple questions regarding internal issues (pay schedule, employee status and ID) most of my questions were left unanswered with ""I don't know"". They've lost my paperwork and keep asking me questions that I have no knowledge of regarding the internal dealings.

My supervisor is younger than me, but age shouldn't be a tool to deciding someone's character. But this case is an exception because I honestly do not know how he acquired this job. He has no supervisory experience, he carries himself lazily and he does not have any ounce professionalism. Recently, he tried to recruit me into his scam. I felt pressured and uncomfortable when I had to work with him because that was all he could ever talk about. He doesn’t believe that this is too good to be true and that it’s possible. The company is well known to be a MLM and apparently he’s done a lot of research on it, but I don’t think so because ever search result with (MLM Name) has “scam” next by it.

There was another incident. Recently I was under fire for reporting my work colleague for her incapability. Each of my supervisors were in cahoots and reprimanded me separately numerous times after apologizing for my” mistake”. There’s always a sense of secrecy between the two, such as “Don’t tell so-so, I informed you this”. As a contractor I’m already lost as it is and there’s really no one to talk to about any of my issues without feeling belittled. My supervisor (younger) told me that he (older) supervisor didn’t want to hire me initially.

\- Discrimination: Before I got the job, I had to complete a number of interviews. I found out from my co-workers that they went through a totally different process. One simpler and requires just a couple of interviews. I on the other hand went through five interviews just to get this job. Let me tell you, I was rejected at first for the initial position I applied for. On the day of my final interview they told me, that I had a high chance compared to the other two candidates. I found out that was not the case when I awoke to a rejection email. Not only that, they told my coworker the same thing that they've told me about being ""the one for the position"". The person that they chose instead, quit on the spot. That position is yet to be filled and I’m a filler for someone else at the moment.

When I reported that Colleague was incapable of completing the task and just snacked around, I was reprimanded and told that emails were sent out about my behavior. I was trying to help them, by fulfilling the task and completing my job. The colleague is a much older (69) and has a disability. The disability is more emotional rather than physical, but still they are incapable of completing the most menial task without questioning my authority. My management offers preferential treatment to those that are disabled.

Often times in conversations, my gender, age, education and ethnicity is brought into conversations. These are already pre-determined factors that I can’t control, besides my education, but I already graduated. It’s nobody’s business to question me about my qualities.

\- Heavy Labor: Where I work, there’s a lot of heavy lifting involved. I’m not big and fit myself, but I can complete the job, just give me time to lift my ass off the ground. In accordance to that, there’s also the ability to multitask, such as running around the building to help other employees. It begins to take a toll on you.

I was told that I qualified for health insurance, but my coworker had to wait 3 months for their card. During that time neither HR or our Supervisor was responsive.

\- Incapable Employees: As mentioned above management sucks and my colleague is not dependable. They barely remember anything I tell them and when I give them direction on how to complete my job, I’m questioned. I was appointed for this position for quite awhile now, I know what I’m doing, otherwise there would already be complaints and I know that I retain great memory. My supervisor looks like he's scratching his balls every time he comes in. He neither helps or is of help when it comes to completing the tasks assigned.

\- Late Payments: My paychecks arrive 1 week later than scheduled. Calculating it, I’m practically being paid once a month. This is supposed to be a fulltime job, but I’m only being paid for two weeks full of work a month.

There’s more that I could say, but it would be too long of a post.

I really like the federal facility but I hate my management. I get my own cubicle, can multitask (read and reddit) and have met the nicest employees, but I don’t see any personal growth for me. At the same time I don’t want to quit because this is heaven compared to my other job and I really hate how demeaning the job search process is. My boyfriend is supportive of my decision, but I can't help, but feel as if I'm a burden to him.

242,"I was in a really bad relationship that lasted for six years. It was physically and emotionally abusive: my girlfriend was a habitual cheater and a compulsive liar, and at the time, I was too naïve to really see through her bullshit and view the situation for what it was.

Fortunately, I made it out alive. But I’ve carried this chip on my shoulder ever since, which basically manifests as a what I call a “jealousy complex.

Anytime I meet a girl and we start to hit it off a little bit, I go into this hyper-manic state of happiness and excitement. 

I usually try to contain (or hide) the excitement because nobody likes someone who’s clingy or too attached, especially when you first start talking to someone.

Then again, that genuine feeling of happiness makes it really easy for me to socialize and open up to said girl (something I’ve had trouble doing my entire life). 

I experience what I call a “butterfly stage”, where I project a lot of charisma and am predictably at my most likable. Naturally, this makes flirting and getting closer to someone else really easy for a time.

Unfortunately, my “jealousy complex” flares up at the first sign of disinterest. The first 24-hour period when said girl appears disinterested in talking to me, a wave of self-doubt is created, which can quickly shift into self-deprecating thoughts. Eventually, I end up depressed.
 (And for what? I barely know this girl!)

This “jealousy complex” used to make me angry, but now that I’ve gotten older and a little more mature, I’ve learned to control snarky comments: regardless of the situation, I’m still always kind and polite to her; but the jealously I experience causes me to become reclusive, insecure and socially withdrawn, which tends to push said girl even further away.
(Of course, this only solidifies/expedites the end of hopes for a romantic relationship)

What can I tell myself in order to stop worrying about it?

I’d rather keep her in my life as a friend than have all contact end at once. But it’s difficult to go from talking and flirting to casual interactions, not least because she has all of these expectations built up about me as funny and pleasant – a persona that was essentially fueled by hopes for the future. (Making someone laugh is the only way I’ve ever been able to show affection for someone.)

244,"I’m on mobile so please excuse my formatting.

About myself. I am 15, live alone with my mother in England while also a Russian (so excuse any errors)

How it started;
When I was 11, I got access to £100 as a bit of a test. I bought some chocolate once and didn’t use it so I guess that was a good sign for my parents (Dad was in England at the time). 

At 12 I had 87 left over and they gave me a copy of the details of her credit card so I put it into my 360 and my Laptop. I was scared to use it so I never did except maybe once every 2-5 months for a cost of ~£10

At 13 I found out while translating for my Mum in a council thing that she had 57,000 from 100,000 that she moved here with. 

I transferred the details to my Xbox One and my slightly newer PC at 14.

A month or two ago I told my friend about how I never used it and he said that maybe I can spend a bit or so and get what I’d like to get used to it

Over the course of 2 months I spent 200-300 pound.

A few hours I came home to see a bank statement of the Microsoft Xbox transactions. 
She only had £200 pound on her account. I cried my eyes out in the shower. Especially since she has a decent debt in Russia because a house she was landlording (idk if that’s correct) had a leak in the roof.

What do I do?",26Jun2018,14
245,"As the title said, I have a family member (f/30+ lets call her S) who has schizophrenia for more than 6+ years.

S relationship with my entire family was never good except with probably my younger sibling, M. It was not like we fought a lot but more like S didn’t talk much to us.

When we were young, she would out of the blue just said that we would not get along (according to some superstition that she probably heard or read somewhere, I never heard of it or read about it). I thought it was weird but never paid attention but I did know that among all my siblings, S was and is the one that I could not get along. S would tell that I wasted money when I tried to buy some random on trend stuff when I was young (not expensive at all). Then on another occasion, there was a random funny event and when I said it was me, she said I was delusional. She also mocked me for saying wrong stuff or not good enough English accent (our first language is not English). So to shorten it, to a certain extent, I do believe that S’ attitude is causing our rocky relationship.

I don’t really recall any good memory with her. While with my other siblings, even as we fight, I still remember some good memories.

Then S moved to study abroad and had the wrong crowds. Started with drinking and spending lavishly to match her other rich friends. Then later on moving to drugs (which we didn’t know until later after S was diagnosed with schizophrenia). 

Anyhow, in the past years, all my family members had been a victim of S’ violence ranging from choking (while the person was driving), hitting, kicking on the stomach to basically trying to attack with a knife. Also some verbal, mean stuff.

S receives regular treatments from a psychiatrist and is taking medicine. My parents said S is improving but recently, I heard that my sibling was kicked in the stomach (I wasn’t there when it happened).

Today, I’m at my wits ends. I was doing some work when S entered the room and made some hot beverage with boiling water (the water dispenser was beside my table, I sat at the corner). Without warning S threw it at me, spilling all the contents on my clothes and hand, making me getting a third degree burn (those pus and melted skin basically). I couldn’t think because it was super hot (I felt my hand burnt to the core), so I just yelled “are you crazy” and took the glass (which already almost emptied anyway) and threw it back at her. And she jumped me, cornering me and ripped my glasses off and scratched my lips (it bruised and bled). Then my father saw it and tried to separate us. S basically overpowered me. S had been known to overpower people when in erratic mode.

I went to an emergency room and doctor said it might leave some scars. I’m getting married in a few months (didn’t tell her, couldn’t even talk about it in front of her as she was still not married at her age... no offense to people who aren’t married but I think she mind). 

So whenever something happened, my parents always tolerate S “because S is sick.” But really, if you stab someone and you are sick, even if you are sorry, doesn’t bring back the person and sickness doesn’t justify it. Should I just accept getting stab, kick, choke and all that “because S is sick.”

To be clear, I’m the one who has the least contact with her. We live in the same house but I don’t talk to S and prefer to stay in my own room to prevent exactly just this. I was traumatized when S tried to stab my other sibling, M. It was so close if I wasn’t there at the time. And my greatest fear is that she would leave a scar. A kick or a punch is not okay but at least it’ll heal but this... and when I’m about to get married.

My parents took S to a mental hospital before but since we live in Asia, it’s not really good. And instead of getting better, S got worse according to my parents. So they took her out and found a good doctor overseas (yes, S made a trip overseas every 1 or 2 months and countless of money is spent on her).

Tl;dr:
Schizophrenic family member threw hot boiling water on me unprovoked, leaving me with a severe burnt. I’m getting married in a few months, doctor said it might leave some marks. Parents could not find a solution every time S was being violent. All my family members and even my maid (who almost never even spoke to S) received some kinds of physical assaults. But parents still said that S is sick and nothing can be done and that “S is getting better.”

Some backstory - 

I'm 24. Graduated college in Ohio in 2016 - I do video production (music videos, corporate, anything).

Moved back to hometown (in Ohio) and immediately got a job with an up and coming videography company. My boss is my age and the company has been doubling in size every year (made 1m this year, 450k last year, etc). I was promoted from shooter/editor to producer and given a raise plus 401k and profit share. In new position I am able to grow, make my own hours, and I love everyone I work with. We do corporate videography like commercials and brand stuff. 

I would say I'm doing better than 95&amp;#37; of people from my graduating class (who also do video).

I love my city and my friends and on paper am very happy... BUT:

What I REALLY want to do is make big budget music videos for artists I like. Basically, I think I have the skills and connections to pull it off at this point. I know people in the rap industry and I'm pretty involved in that culture as well as other types of music..

I decided to say fuck it - so I signed a lease with two (well connected) good friends in North Hollywood and have been preparing to drive across the country with my cat at the end of august. Another friend from here who is a cinematographer is coming with me to start a company.

I've never done my own business before, or lived in LA. 

Basically, I'm looking for any possible advice from saving money - industry advice - places to grocery shop.. ETC.

254,"So this year as a senior in high school, I took digital art to fulfill the art requirement. My teacher was really involved in pushing us to enter contests, so I did a couple.

As stated in the rules, the prize for the division winners at the state level is a gift certificate for a computer/printer of the winner's choosing. As I'm going to college next year, I was excited for a chance to get a brand new laptop for use. 

The first problems came with the chain of information. I was in contact with my teacher, who was in contact with the local fire chief, who was in contact with the nj fire department. I found out mid May that I won the contest from my teacher, but yesterday (June 25) that the prize I was receiving a $500 gift card that can be used towards a laptop.

It's unrealistic and personally, I kind of feel embarrassed even thinking about it... One time I decide to decide on specific work to do, I can focus on it to some degree. But after I watch some movies, japanese anime, and series with lots of action, I have these strange desires to fight monsters, live in fantasy world...etc and start daydreaming. Although I don't really draw or play instruments, watching these fantasy shows and listening to music seem to be giving me some weird assumption that I want to learn to draw or play music because I like the visuals; I know it's weird. Music and anime have been my therapy for my depression which I'm coping with better now and I've thought of abandoning them to focus on work but I just can't. I tried cut them off for days, but during those days, I just could not focus on anything and just let times go by and bam, it's night time already. I've tried lessening the amount of times I watch or listen but they don't seem to be helping either.

I know I need to pay off loan and I keep telling myself that I'll get webdev job to support myself financially and do hobbies  on the side but after few days, I start getting anxious and getting these what-if thoughts in my head. It's seriously killing me that I hear about people doing something they like and I seriously hate myself for being in this situation that I'm studying web dev on and off due to doubts. It's like I'm forcing myself all the time. Due to this anxiety, I haven't even done anything regarding art or music as I feel just tired and not motivated enough to get work done...

I just told myself yesterday that I will try to focus on webdev and do music and art on the side for now as I feel like I have no choice, so I got up early, opened up my laptop and decided to start butt.... I end up stumbling upon this video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UnAxZHVcAM&amp;t=16s

Now I'm back to self-doubting myself again, seriously I hate this...

261,"Hello here's a little of background:

I'm 21 years old right now, last time I weight (April, 2017) I had 72kg and 1,80m. I stopped doing gym because I got sick for 3 weeks and felt terrible, demotivated with all those progress I made since January of 2017.

So I stopped going gym or exercise after that. I didn't become overweight but my belly is getting bigger and I'm starting to hate. 

I'm as well gamer and IT Person.

I don't know my current status of healthiness. My objective right now is getting abbs but I don't wanna go gym (First: Too expensive for me, I have no job, doing school intetship at IBM. Second: sometimes I think that someone is talking on me behind my back talking negative stuff which I hate to hear, Third: The Trainees on gym don't pay attention to new people and I never known if I'm doing the exercise well or not and having PT is way more expensive than the actual membership)

I have lack of starting, like pick up closes and go ouside and start exercise alone.

Any suggestions?",26Jun2018,1

264,"TW: Rape Mentions

My ex reddits so this is definitely going to be deleted. Hopefully this is a good place to ask, but if not, any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. TL;DR at bottom.

There’s a lot of background and I’m sorry in advance. I met my ex a year ago. He’s probably the most perfect match for me, and everything about him was amazing. I still even thought this a week ago before all this happened. That whole “butterfly stomach” feeling never actually went away. When I first met him, he was very upfront about his issues. He’s an alcoholic and up to the point of meeting me, he quit cold turkey for a month. He hasn’t had a single drink since. The way his job is, he has to go into bars, so it was really hard on him. I know next to nothing about alcoholism, and I thought maybe I should step away. But he was sweet, mature, truthful, and just overall a nice person. He really seemed like this is what he wanted and was doing a great job.

We’ve had minor spats along the way, usually stemming from him being a tad insensitive and a little uneducated (his parents were paranoid of doctors and dealt with homeopathic treatments instead, something he doesn’t really agree with but still weird about doctors because of this. This is important for later on). For example there was time where I was off a Monday, and because we don’t see each other outside of the weekends (more like 2 days, it’s been a gripe from me that he refuses to try and understand). Mondays are his “project days” where he would work on whatever he was interested at the time. Then, it was this big festival projection mapping show which he worked on for a couple of months. I was thinking cool, you can work on your thing, I’ll hang out and work on mine, and we can get lunch when you’re ready and then I’ll head home or something. He said “No, you’re a distraction.” Listen, I get it. If my presence causes you to not want to work, maybe say it a little less hurtful? There’s other spats but those are just examples.

Anyway, last week was….really tough. I lost a friend and Monday was the funeral. I hadn’t seen him in a very long time. About one and a half years, maybe, so I was feeling a lot of remorse and he was very young. Died at 25 healthy as can be. It was just an accident. I knew it was going to be tough for me. I was crying ever since I found out. I asked my ex if I could come over afterwards so he could support me and we can do something to get my mind out off of it. The projection show was done, so now he was just learning coding on Mondays. He said sure. After I get to his place, he is up and about, making coffee, and is talking to me about the funeral. I don’t think he was really listening, but it’s whatever. He goes to his room and I know what’s up. The ex has a sleeping issue; he can’t remember the first couple of hours being awake and he always gets up and like 1 or 2 pm. I’m begging him, please don’t go to sleep, you promised me you would support me. Goes to sleep…doesn’t even drink the coffee. A few hours later, I’m begging him to get up. We go to a restaurant and it is so awkward and quiet. I’m fuming, he knows I’m mad so he won’t say anything. It really added salt to the wound.

I’m really sorry, this is going on a lot longer than I thought. The next day, there was a Facebook post by his roommates ex, something like “blah blah blah all females are horrible”. I comment on it jokingly, like dude, drop your fedora? We used to be able to joke with him, but I think he was on something (he’s a known drug user) because he just blows up. He says that my ex and I are scum because we associate with the roommate. Apparently she tied him up and raped him. This was news to me. I don’t know if it’s really true, but I just tell him I’m sorry you went through that, but you’re acting erratic and most of what he wrote wasn’t readable. I do not like the roommate for multiple reasons; I think she takes advantage of my ex, and she talks about me. I treat her like furniture; I don’t talk or notice her. Its only two days out of the week so it’s honestly fine. The roommates ex then tells me “I hope she does to you what she did to me”. 

That was gross, and I make sure to make him re-iterate what he meant just so I didn’t “twist words”. Eventually, he’s like yes, I meant I hope you get raped. I block him, and the entire situation is crazy, so I show the screenshots to my ex. Do you think maybe he’s like “Oh wow, I can’t believe he said that? That’s nuts?” 

He berated me the entire time for “being mean to his roommate”. Doesn’t even mention the fact that someone, anyone, just hoped that I got raped. I didn’t even make a big deal about that more than my ex’s reaction, because words are words. We fight the entire rest of the week. His story would change (“oh I meant it this way, oh that’s not what I said” and so on). I said, please don’t apologize this time without showing me some sort of proof you’re making an effort to being more sensitive, because we’ve had this conversations countless times before. He would apologize, but they would be generic and copy-paste. I let it go to keep peace. We’d go on our merry ways. This time I wasn’t having it because it hurt so bad that he brought her up for no reason (later he says he thought I was being mean to her. What I said to her ex in the screenshots was “what do you want me to do, make mike kick her out? That’s stupid”). 

This made him loose his mind. He could not understand why I just wouldn’t accept his apology and move on. He showed up to talk, and we argued about it. I kept insisting of couples therapy, something that I really thought we needed and was going to front the bill. I was going to say again, I can’t accept the apology until I see effort and when I’m ready to accept it. He walked out mid-sentence. 

So anyway, the question I have; this was not a normal reaction out of him. Both the funeral and the roommate thing. I guess I didn’t notice, but his personality really did switch at some point in the relationship. Someone mentioned his alcoholism, and how he did act differently before that. They told me about “dry drunks”. I didn’t know what that was, so I looked it up. He matches every single point. He isolated himself and blamed his friends for ditching him, even though he doesn’t reach out to them either, he has very severe anxiety about relapsing, to where he even suggested just drinking so he didn’t have that fear anymore, he always talks about all the crazy stuff he did back in the day, and he’s always obsessing with other stuff (e.g., projects, and at one point, Kratom). I’m going back over and over and I just feel so stupid. Like I should have seen the signs. I mentioned AA before and he always shrugged it off. It’s like he’s afraid of therapy, but I think he really does need it. A lot.

I really do love this man. We were talking about our future and marriage before this happened. I feel like I dropped the ball this entire time and I should have insisted on therapy more, and been gentler about it. I thought he really was doing well with the drinking, but going back and thinking of certain instances, it’s clear that he really was struggling and maybe this was the reason he acted like this. I missed so many signs. Is there anything I can do to rectify this? Should I try writing him a letter asking him to get help? I don’t think he’ll listen to me. I can’t really go to his family, and I don’t know his friends well enough to know if they’ll rat me out or something if I go to them. Like, it hurts but if its over its over, but I still feel the need to at least try and help him? Please let me know if there’s anything I can elaborate on.

267,"I've been straight all my life up until a year ago when I watched gay porn one night and really liked (twinks) it. My good friend that I've had since highschool, came home after being in a bad relationship, and we started hanging out again. 

The first time we hung out we were with another friend then a few days later we hung out again just the 2 of us. At the end of night, I admitted I was kind of attracted to him, and he said he had a crush on me, and we kissed a little bit. Then we talked over text and said that we can continue fooling around jusy for fun. 

Well last night after had gotten lunch and dinner with other friends, when our mutual friend left we hung out in his car and talked a lot and the made out again we also made out in my basement earlier. Only problem is I think I think i'm starting to catch feelings here and I don't know how to feel about it. I work in a really masculine enviroment and a lot of my friends are hyper masculine gym bro types as am I. 

I'm not ready to come out as Bisexual anytime soon. I'm scared and depressed about it. Not about having feelings for another boy, but how my parents and friends would react and the future where I really want children and am still very much attracted to women as well, and do want have kids with one some day. 

Feeling really vulnerable at this time. I've haerd that bisexual guys arent really accepted by gay or straight people, and I'm also told that its just a stepping stone for being fully gay. I feel really ashamed for even making out with my friend even though I really liked it and felt amazing before and after it happened. As you can see I'm having a really hard time with this.

268,"So after being unemployed for about a year due to wanting to focus on school i concluded that being broke sucked. I used to work fast food during my first year of university and i hated it. I hated the commute and how i had to balance school and work. I know its doable but the fact that my old boss didnt care about my school needs amd made me work 40 hrs a week while school full time made me really want to move past that whole world of work.

I landed one of the best jobs on campus. Im a student advisor and the job is ridiculosly nice, easy, and simple. All i do is run some papers around and send a few emails here and there and give out forms. For the most part my ass is in a chair doing nothing lol. Plus the fact that i can put it on my resume is a HUGE benefit for the line of work i plan on entering after college.

My issue is my boss is an absolute BITCH!!!!!!!

Im 19 and ive only had a few fast food jobs in the past, i can honestly say ive never really felt that pressure of the normal adult sterotypical ""i hate my boss but cant do anything about it and cant leave the job either"" sitiation until now.

This job is providing me money, good hours, super easy, and a huge benefit on my resume. Yet my boss has tge potential to fuck it all up. She mainly hired me because i speak arabic and can communicate with the arabic speaking students that come in. Other than that i doubt she wouldve hired me for tge position because its mainly a graduate level position and im a undergrad. 

Basically i cant go to her for anything. When she trained me and the other guy that was hired with me, she just ran through all of it in 10 minutes. Its simple stuff but i still had questions, and still do when differing situations arise. Whenever i go ask her shell say some really passive aggressive shit without even looking at me, and with huge attitude, and all her answers basically have the same underlying message ""fuck off and figure it out by yourself"". After the first few times i decided im going to try and do everything without asking her anything. Literally just teaching myself from old emails and what i know and what makes sense so far its going good because i dont have to interact with her at all. However her office is right next to the front desk where i am, and whenever i say something wrong to a student shell call me over and correct me but with a ""your supppse to know this even though i didnt fucking teach you anything and youve only been working for 2 weeks"" attidute. 

There are a total of 5 other people that work in the office, but only one of them does the type of work and has the same responsibilites that i do, and his the guy that got hired with me so he alsi doesnt know shit when it comes to specifics. However evveryome agrees shes a bitch and they told me to just stay out of her way and be completly self suffient without needing anything from her. Im slowly getting there and it looks like its going to be ok once i get there. At the same time i feel like her hate for me grows with every passing week. 

I dont want to quit but if anyone can give some advice on how to deal with a bitch boss that would be great.

Just to clarify before you read, I’m very responsible with zero debt, savings account and a payed off car. 

I’m currently a medical courier for a lab and soon to be placed on a waitlist for a medical radiology tech program in February. My job now pays $16/hr and is a boring 9-5 m-f job. My days are pretty boring , but I’m able to listen to podcasts in my car and go at my own pace, which are nice parts of the job. I’m single with no kids and feeling depressed as the days go on. I originally wanted to work in the film industry and dedicated a good year or so trying to network and get hired on productions. Once I made a few connections, I was able to work on some cool union movies and shows, but it was far from fulfilling, and I gave up that career. I’m pretty set on my decision to pursue radiology and once I’m finished with my schooling, I’ll be able to work wherever I want and make a good income. I’m currently helping my mother out financially by renting a room and paying half of all the bills, including her cell phone and miscellaneous expenses around the house. It’s hard for me to date because I don’t want to bring girls to the house and I also feel embarrassed that I live in the same house as my mother, even though it’s more of a roommate situation. I don’t come from money, so I don’t have the luxury of having a family member pay for me to live in a cool city while I save up money. If I move, I’ll have to get another mundane job in order to live and possibly feel the same way I do now. My town is hot, lacks inspiration and it’s hard to date because a lot of people are married or have kids. I would love to step out of my comfort zone and do something wanderlust like. I’m looking to find something to do for the 2 years I’m waiting. I’ve always been a procrastinator and I’m getting really stressed because I feel I should’ve had my education done already. I do have very good credit and virtually zero debt, as well as a payed off car that is very reliable. I’m looking for advice on how to use my time wisely and possibly find a job that allows me to travel for the 2 years, thank you.  ",26Jun2018,1
270,"TL;DR at the end.

I live in the Kentucky, if it matters, though I'm registered as living in another state cause they charge to change addresses and only let you pay by credit card and I'm way too over drafted, which is why I don't think I can get food stamps even though I desperately need them. Also I was booted off Medicaid when I turned 19, I'm 20. 

Anyway, aside from losing everything important to me and everything falling apart no matter how hard to try, my mental health is failing. I looked up dissassociated and was releieved, cause it's spot on, I thought I was just losing turning stupid somehow or something. None of my thoughts feel connected, it's like I'm a different version of me every couple minutes. Also I'm suicidal, off and on. One minute I think I'm okay and my life will get better in a couple years if I just roll with the punches, the next I'm standing there with my belt around my neck sobbing about why I'm never good enough. I lost my job and barely have the energy to leave my bed. Rent is coming up and I have about $10 in quarters to my name, am in pretty bad debt. I just lay there depressed, can't sleep at night, I'm kept awake until the sun rises with horrible thoughts. The list of stuff wrong with me just would go on.

TL;DR:
Thing is I know I'm crazy. But I have absolutely no money. I might be homeless soon at this rate. Hell I thought about selling my car but I was worried I might need it to sleep in soon. Don't really have family to help the situation. I can't afford medication or therapy. There seems to be no options for that. My tax return was supposed to save me but I didn't have health insurance last year cause it was too expensive so the government punished me by making me more poor by withholding my tax return. I'm running out of options. Feel like I'm coming towards the end of my rope, I don't know how much longer I can tred water.

288,"So I literally have nowhere else to go if anyone can help in any way it would be greatly appreciated. My brother is 11 and shits himself like all the time. And it’s not even just little ones it’s entire shits. No one in my family understands or knows what to do, we thought he was too distracted on the PS4 so we’ve banned him for weeks and that didn’t work, we’ve tried making him sit on the toilet for ages and nothing would come out. He blames his schools toilets but he does it at home more than anything and the thing is he doesn’t even care. He’ll argue about getting in the shower once we’ve noticed it or I specifically will smell it and he’ll lie about it. I seriously don’t know why he does it or what we can do to stop it and it’s getting to the point where he does it at school and I don’t even know what I’m expecting but just anything at this point would be helpful ",26Jun2018,5
289,"I turned on my Xbox to see that my controller battery was low and found that my box of batteries was empty. Recalling that my mom had a box of batteries in her bedside table, I went in her room and opened up the top drawer of her bedside table to find a box of batteries like I was looking for. (Should have been an indicator, but hindsight is 20/20) The box only had one battery in it and I needed 2 so I put the box back and as I did so I felt a black sock that had a small cylinder in it. Curious, I pulled it out to find a small clit vibrator. (https://www.amazon.com/Blush-Novelties-Revive-Intimate-Massager/dp/B075S8MR7P) 

Side note, I have my moms email account on my phone. I use it for resetting passwords like Netflix or our WiFi because she sets them and forgets them. 

So since I have been in her email, I have seen spam emails from a website called Adam and Eve. Being the teenager I am, I know what the site is and I knew that since the emails were going directly into her inbox, it meant she has an account on the site.  I went into the deleted emails and searched by sender and found confirmation emails for an delivery she ordered at the end of April. The new concern was that the email listed the pink one as a bonus gift, and what she actually ordered was a blindfold and this https://www.amazon.com/CalExotics-SE-0782-45-2-G-kiss-Vibes-Blue/dp/B0054GUKHI?th=1&amp;psc=1

The obvious next course of action is to find the second one and I did, in the back of the second drawer. 

Here is the current predicament. I put everything back pretty well, but I’m worried she may notice and confront me about going through her stuff. I’m not mad or anything. Tbh I think step-fantasy porn is can be pretty hot, and while I’m not sold on the whole idea incest stuff I’m not disgusted by the fact that my mom masturbates and has sextoys to do it with. (No, I’m not attracted to my mom)

I’m not sure what to do at this point. My mom is pretty open and makes sex joke all the time, (She and I send each other funny sexual jokes and memes all the time) but I’m positive she will be pretty upset that I went through her stuff. 

I’m not sure if I should say something before she knows I went through her stuff, or if I should just do nothing and pray she doesn’t notice? Should I feel concerned that she has likely been doing that shit one wall over from me for the better part of 2 months? She’s walked in on me jerking off before, but because of my fantastic ability to hide it, I don’t think she knows she has walked in on me, but I know she thinks I masterbate. 

Sorry this was so long. I’m hoping someone who has been in a similar situation as me can respond, and if you are a woman, maybe you can offer some advice as well. Thanks for your help!",26Jun2018,1
290,"So I’ve been volunteering at the Boys and Girls club since March and I was just told that I would be getting a job there starting in mid August. I live in Los Angeles, California so minimum wage is 15 and I’d probably be getting paid a bit more than that for this position by a few cents to a few dollars, but for now, let’s just say $15 an hour is what I will be paid. So I was planning on going back to school at some point, as I dropped out after a year of college due to a health condition. But now that I have this job lined up, I’m sort of thinking I won’t need to go to school anymore. What’s more is that I don’t even know what to major in anyways and haven’t been able to choose anything to go into.  Basically, I really like the position and wouldn’t mind doing it as a career. It’s a great job and it’s rewarding as well. But I’m worried that’s just not really reasonable to make it a career? What do you think? For someone living in California, can I live off of this job? Keep in mind that 1. I am single but would like to date/marry in the future and 2. I physically can’t have kids so I don’t need to pay for any childcare unless I decide to adopt, which I’m not sure I will if I’m going to be working with kids every day anyways.

292,"Apologies in advance for a long post! 

Context: My cousin moved cross-country a couple of years ago and has been living near my university. Some pretty crappy things have happened to her both before and after she moved, but recently they've been more and more related to choices she has made. For the past year, she has lived with one of my closest friends in an apartment near our school/her work. Her behavior toward him has grown more and more toxic, including stealing his food from both the kitchen and from under his bed (where he hid it from her), breaking things in the house that belong to him, demanding payment for food of hers he ate and then pretending to forget about the money he gave her, not having rent money (and probably spending it on drugs/alcohol instead), and getting their building superintendent fired, just to name a handful of things. 

Without delving into detail, circumstances have driven her to start to move out early with some friends (nice girls who I know) and my friend tries to be in the apartment as little as possible. Because of this, he finally felt comfortable confronting her about all of this recently with evidence, and she reacted VERY abusively, threatening to hurt him and calling him all sorts of nasty things, including a slur for gay men (as he's gay). 

My main question is this: I've been told by my other family members to not get involved, but I'm seriously concerned about her future roommates. They're all nice girls who are probably going to get seriously screwed over by my cousin's behavior. Should I risk telling them what's happening? If so, how do I approach the topic, given that my cousin is likely lying to them about what's been happening? 

Tl:dr - My cousin is a terrible roommate to the point of being verbally abusive to my friend/her current roommates. Do I warn her future roommates?",26Jun2018,1

294,"Going into vacation, I was not expecting a job. I was planning to find one with my friends later into the break, but a few days ago, right before my mom started her job at a summer camp, she received a email about a open position as a day camp councilor. She quickly asked me if I wanted the job, and said it had a huge pay. I said I’d consider it, but she signed me up before I could give a definite answer. Well, after having started the job yesterday, and finishing most of the day today, I can conclude that I absolutely hate it. The people there all know each other from previous years, and while they are amicable and talkative, none really have any interest in me. This is fine, it’s work right? I’m not being payed to make friends or engage in conversation, I’m being payed to watch kids. The problem here is, once I got through orientation and looked at my salary, I noticed that I’m being payed far below minimum wage. We have to be at the camp at 8, and it doesn’t end until 3:30. By the time I get back home, it’s past 4, and I’m exhausted. This goes on for seven full weeks, which pretty much boils down to the rest of the summer. For all of this work, while 1200$ might seem nice at first, it doesn’t equate with the hours put in. I was considering working at Rita’s, or a Restaurant before, of which both have more manageable hours, along with equal pay. The worst part about this camp however, is that the activities and kids, well, they are truly mind numbing. It feels as if the day goes on forever, and I truly detest returning. I was thinking about quitting, but when a I told my mom this she freaked out. After telling her my grievances, she said I could quit, but would have to do so in person and by myself(I was planning to do so) and then proceeded to throw some veiled threats my way. I don’t want to leave the staff short handed, or upset my mom, but I can’t take this job for seven weeks. I had considered talking to the lead councilor about a three or four week thing, with a reduced salary, due to another staff member only working for two weeks, but am not sure how to go about this. Any ideas guys? I mean, should i get a new job, stick with it, something in between? Thanks for the advice in advance, and I hope you never find yourself in this situation.",26Jun2018,2

297,"Hey r/Advice

I'm 17 y/o, and I just finished this speciel school here in Denmark, where 114 other people same age as me attended, together with me. We started in August, and along the way I came really close with some of them. 

If you don't how this type of school works, here's how: In danish, this type of school is called ""Efterskole"" directly translated is 'Afterschool'. When I put the word in a translator, it reads ""independent boarding school for lower secondary students"". I don't exactly know what that means, but the school is basically built up the way that you live in a room with some other people of same gender, mostly 3 or 4 people at the same time, when you start at the school they're of course complete strangers, but you get to know them better along the way. You and your so-called ''Roomies''/the people you live with, and all of the other people attending this kind of school live close to the school, sometimes in the actual school. You eat meals, and have lessons. 

Well yeah, that just ended, and I now miss the people who attended with me. Now I have holiday for a couple of months, before I have to start studying. I'm meeting the people I attended the school with for a couple of parties during the summer. The first couple of days of vacation were nice, but I feel really bored. I feel, hmm, not bored, but kinda devastated. I don't have the same kind of energy that I had, when I was at the school. I get much more sleep now, but I somehow still feel like, there's more things now that I can't mind, than when I was attending the school, even now, when I get more sleep, I should be able to mind more things, right? I also feel like my mind, the way I think, changes when I get more sleep, I don't know why, but I don't feel like myself when I get more sleep. E.g. I feel like I can get a girl to like me, when I'm tired/back at the school, but complete the opposite, when I'm well-rested. How could this be?

Also now with my holiday, I have nothing to do I feel like. I don't have anyone to talk to, except my family, but I don't meet my friends on a daily basis anymore, and I feel like I need something to be passionate about. All I do now is just sit in front of my pc all day, doing nothing. I wanna be together with the people I miss and like, but I live in the middle of nowhere, where busses only drive through in the morning. Also, I feel like the people that I miss and like from the school dosen't like my 'self-rested' self. I just don't feel like myself when I get more rest.

I've got a job, before people mention that, I'm starting on the 10th of July.

What am I supposed to/ what should I do, and what should I become passionate about?",26Jun2018,0
299,"So, I met this friend recently through a mutual friend and hobby.  We did hang out a couple of times before she broke her leg.  Now, I don't really know much about her, other than she recentlyish (I think a year or two ago) moved to the area and that relations to her family is strained.  She does seem like she has friends, but through the couple months I have known her (so her leg has been broken I think 2+ months?)  she ended up part of my friend group.  That's fine, but since we met her basically around the time she broke her leg, she's been asking a lot of favors from mostly two other friends (since they live closest to her) and I (I'm the third closest, and about 15 minutes away).  She asks for a lot of rides to places because she can't drive, so she will ask the first two friends and then me.  Now, at first I was fine with this, but then I realize she kind of asks favors for things that were more inconvenient towards me and really convenient towards her (so she'll ask for a ride because it's 3 hour round trip for her through bus, but then she wants me to drive her to somewhere, so that's like 30 minutes drive there and back, I don't know how long her appointment is, and then she wants to go grocery shopping afterwards.)  Or if I do pick her up, she kind of dictates the day as opposed to me (so if I want to go somewhere, and she doesn't want to, she'll voice it). 

Also, in the beginning it was okay because it makes sense, but since two months has passed, the doctor did tell her that she can put 50&amp;#37; pressure on it (so she can walk), but she still asks me and us in general to get stuff for her (so we always walk to get whatever for her (like ""get me cookies"", ""get me a drink please"", etc) and carry for her since she does use crutches).  This may just be me being ignorant though, since maybe she should still be off her foot even though she can walk?  

I know this is selfish of me since she's a friend and I should help her, but I do feel taken advantage of because I guess my personality, I would try to do most of these things myself unless I absolutely am just super fed up (but I feel like she's the opposite, she'll ask us first and then when she has no other resources, does it herself?)  I also know she doesn't have any support other than us, so that also adds to the guilt.  Idk.",26Jun2018,1
301,"My work engages in some 3PL and 3rd party logistics support. My coworker is a passive aggressive bitter power tripping clown. He constantly berates and speaks condescendingly to our liason at Logistics Co. It makes day-to-day communication difficult as when he is openly rude via email to agents at Logistics Co., they typically take longer to respond to my teams unique requests or at times do not bother to respond at all. This impacts our service quality for example, orders meant to ship out 3 day magically go unchecked as standard.

Today an even ruder email was used by Bitter Coworker, after a discrepancy was resolved he said: ""Thanks A LOT, /u/hedgehogflamingo. You too, Logistics Person, THANKS A LOT."" WTF? Obviously this person has some stuff going on in their lives (divorce, balding, kids hate him, etc.) but he takes it out on everyone at our company as well.

I don't have time to go to HR to deal with his personality, but I really do not wish to damage our business relationship with people we work closely outside the company. Is it considered a faux pas to even send a small 2-line email to my Logistics Co. liason (we aren't close but have casually talked on the phone before) something along the lines of ""Hey, my team appreciates everything your company does to support our organization's business. I think you and your floor members do a great job, and when mistakes happen I know they are human and we never look to find fault. Please excuse any negative tones from Bitter Coworker, I appreciate everything you guys do.""

Is that overkill and over stepping it a bit? Our biz line gets insanely busy during the summer and I know a warehouse can get stressful / hot so upper management doesn't care about understanding the issues or lack of quality.

302,"Unfortunately I've been in trouble with the law a few times (drugs, theft), and instead of potentially going to prison for up to a year for this most recent offense, I was able to accept a sort of intensive work-release/rehab program offered by the court, which will involve 50-65 hours a week of labor on a massive pig/chicken farm.

It definitely seems preferable to prison...we get limited freedoms (limited internet access on weekends, a library, etc), $1/hour instead of the $.25/hour you might make for jobs done in prison (I'm sure some corporation is profiting massively from this), councelling programs once a week, aid in job searching once a week, etc.

On the other hand...I feel nervous...the limited personal space (our dorms will be all women at least, and I've heard they're generally well-behaved since one mistake could get you kicked out and sent to prison, but it's still rather crowded..) and moreover, I've heard the work can be absolutely exhausting, filthy, and downright nauseating.

304,"I posted some of this before. Just an updated revision. 

\-------------------------

Where to start. I am in my twenties and don't know where my life is going. Some of the things I am mildly sorrowful are, not having a girlfriend. Never had one. Not doing well with school, and doubting this happily ever after will exist. It's the internet. I know what is posted up will be posted forever. So I will try my best to be respectful. 

\------------

**Girlfriend** 

That's right. Never had one. I had the opportunity  to go on luncheons with taken girls. But that's about it. In the past, it's partially my fault. I was into porn. Though. Not as bad as what it used to be. 

Putting myself out there to girls also came with a risk. By risk. Risk by definition translates into danger x exposure. Sweet and short. Risk took me to bad depression. I was attending Christian college at the time and felt despondent. These were my actions. Because of my first limerence rejection, I lost it. I ran over my phone multiple times with my car, ripped up my Bible and other books, and in the end had unprotected sex with someone I never knew. With my parents at the time. I was honest and open about how I felt and ended up getting checked out by a doctor. I was also approached by the police about my action. They simply told me, never do it again. Thought I was going to get arrested. Thank goodness I never did it again. Had family support near. But unfortunately and still to this day, my friends don't know what I did. And don't know how hurt I was. Only have two to three friends.

**School**

I am studying at a new school. Don't have the drive to push through. Why? Got a degree. But took too long to finish. Try transferring a full year worth of credits to a new school only to hear, ""sorry. your school is not accredited."" Yep. That's right. I had to start all over again from scratch. Bottom to top. Lost motivation to continue.

**The happily ever after** 

I laugh because it's not possible for me.  I view myself as a vacuous person. The people I want to date would never want me. Even marriage has its problems. A common rule of thumb I like: Every flavor is out there, but we tend to stick with out favorites. I choose different flavors. But ones I like doesn't want that.

308,"Hi Redditors,

I'm having a bit of a dilemma right now, regarding my career pathway. I'm F (23), Currently, I work as a contractor for a Federal Agency. Before this I was unemployed for almost a year after graduation. When I was offered this job, it was only suppose to be part-time. I now work the hours of a full-time employee. Here's where my dilemma comes in, I want to quit. Why? The reasons will be written down below:

\- Commute: The commute is long, if I were to count the hours spent stuck in traffic in addition to the 8 hours at work, it would be half of the day (12 hours). For some reason I also encounter horrible experiences when driving on the freeway, such as almost being hit twice by a Semi-truck, witnessing flying objects falling out of cars (hammer, rocks, boxes, and etc) and reckless drivers. I feel unsafe when driving and I had a traumatic driving experience that I am still trying to recover from that causes me to panic.

\- Management: I don't see my management as often because they reside in another state, but I do have supervisors implemented near me. I just want to say management is incapable of completing their job. I cannot get a hold of them via text, call or email. If I'm lucky, I'll receive a reply by the end of the day. But if they really need something, they'll constantly text and reply back promptly. there is no foreground on how to communicate. I have two supervisors, one who's upper and lower, various times I've had asked simple questions regarding internal issues (pay schedule, employee status and ID) most of my questions were left unanswered with ""I don't know"". They've lost my paperwork and keep asking me questions that I have no knowledge of regarding the internal dealings.

My supervisor is younger than me, but age shouldn't be a tool to deciding someone's character. But this case is an exception because I honestly do not know how he acquired this job. He has no supervisory experience, he carries himself lazily and he does not have any ounce professionalism. Recently, he tried to recruit me into his scam. I felt pressured and uncomfortable when I had to work with him because that was all he could ever talk about. He doesn’t believe that this is too good to be true and that it’s possible. The company is well known to be a MLM and apparently he’s done a lot of research on it, but I don’t think so because ever search result with (MLM Name) has “scam” next by it.

There was another incident. Recently I was under fire for reporting my work colleague for her incapability. Each of my supervisors were in cahoots and reprimanded me separately numerous times after apologizing for my” mistake”. There’s always a sense of secrecy between the two, such as “Don’t tell so-so, I informed you this”. As a contractor I’m already lost as it is and there’s really no one to talk to about any of my issues without feeling belittled. My supervisor (younger) told me that he (older) supervisor didn’t want to hire me initially.

\- Discrimination: Before I got the job, I had to complete a number of interviews. I found out from my co-workers that they went through a totally different process. One simpler and requires just a couple of interviews. I on the other hand went through five interviews just to get this job. Let me tell you, I was rejected at first for the initial position I applied for. On the day of my final interview they told me, that I had a high chance compared to the other two candidates. I found out that was not the case when I awoke to a rejection email. Not only that, they told my coworker the same thing that they've told me about being ""the one for the position"". The person that they chose instead, quit on the spot. That position is yet to be filled and I’m a filler for someone else at the moment.

When I reported that Colleague was incapable of completing the task and just snacked around, I was reprimanded and told that emails were sent out about my behavior. I was trying to help them, by fulfilling the task and completing my job. The colleague is a much older (69) and has a disability. The disability is more emotional rather than physical, but still they are incapable of completing the most menial task without questioning my authority. My management offers preferential treatment to those that are disabled.

Often times in conversations, my gender, age, education and ethnicity is brought into conversations. These are already pre-determined factors that I can’t control, besides my education, but I already graduated. It’s nobody’s business to question me about my qualities.

\- Heavy Labor: Where I work, there’s a lot of heavy lifting involved. I’m not big and fit myself, but I can complete the job, just give me time to lift my ass off the ground. In accordance to that, there’s also the ability to multitask, such as running around the building to help other employees. It begins to take a toll on you.

I was told that I qualified for health insurance, but my coworker had to wait 3 months for their card. During that time neither HR or our Supervisor was responsive.

\- Incapable Employees: As mentioned above management sucks and my colleague is not dependable. They barely remember anything I tell them and when I give them direction on how to complete my job, I’m questioned. I was appointed for this position for quite awhile now, I know what I’m doing, otherwise there would already be complaints and I know that I retain great memory. My supervisor looks like he's scratching his balls every time he comes in. He neither helps or is of help when it comes to completing the tasks assigned.

\- Late Payments: My paychecks arrive 1 week later than scheduled. Calculating it, I’m practically being paid once a month. This is supposed to be a fulltime job, but I’m only being paid for two weeks full of work a month.

There’s more that I could say, but it would be too long of a post.

I really like the federal facility but I hate my management. I get my own cubicle, can multitask (read and reddit) and have met the nicest employees, but I don’t see any personal growth for me. At the same time I don’t want to quit because this is heaven compared to my other job and I really hate how demeaning the job search process is. My boyfriend is supportive of my decision, but I can't help, but feel as if I'm a burden to him.

What should I do?

tldr: Want to quit job because of management's scandalous behavior, but at the same time can't due to previous experiences of job searching and feeling like a burden to boyfriend. What should I do?",26Jun2018,1
309,"Depression is nothing new to me. That isn't a surprise. Nor are suicidal fantasies/ideations. It sucks hardcore, but it comes and goes and I manage. But this just started almost instantly as I began my job in IT yesterday.

I've been working at this bank for over a year now as a teller, and now I've finally moved to an IT position. I was pretty excited about it for the whole time leading up to it because I really wanted a more solitary job (no customer interaction, no pressure to balance my cash to the penny day after day), and because IT is something I sorta know how to do so I figured I could make it a living at least. But now I've just remembered that I really fucking hate working on computers, I'm working in a basement with nothing but artificial light and one very sad and leggy pothos and it's really bringing me down. It's as surprising to me as it would be to anyone, despite my history of depression.

I really don't want to have a job where I have to interact with people a whole lot because people scare me, and so does responsibility. The hours are kind of bumming me out too. They aren't really any different than they were before, pretty much 8 to 5, but they just eat up almost all of my time so I have no time or energy to do anything at all. When I get home, all I want to do is drink beer and/or boxed wine and smoke pot. I lived with my parents for 24 years and a good deal of that time was spent in a dimly lit basement. I don't want to go back to that kind of depression again! I can't and I won't go back to that! I'd rather fucking die! 

Another aspect of the job that I was not aware of was that I will have to drive a lot. Like, A LOT. Like, to Traverse, Gaylord, Empire, and I am not that comfortable with driving. My daily commute before was about 10 minutes and that was awesome. I mean sure, I have a GPS, but that didn't stop me from getting into a car accident this past February. I fucking hate driving almost as much as I hate existing. It scares the shit out of me and I have no sense of direction.

And yeah, I guess all these problems have been a long time in the making and largely of my own fabrication. And I know a lot of you are going to say that I should see a mental health professional. And you're right. I should do that. Talking about this shit freaks me the hell out. And it will mean having to drive quite a distance which is made even more difficult by the fact that I work until fucking 5:00 every weekday and that's the time that everyone is going home and it takes me at least an hour to get anywhere.

I just don't what to do and I feel trapped and crazy stressed out. Being here makes me want to just blow my brains out. It almost feels like being in school all over again. And I don't even know what I want to do. If you asked me what I would rather do than this, I could say maybe to become a hermit, or find a nice, shady spot in a green forest, with a soft, thick carpet of moss, lay down and close my eyes, never to open them again and let my body dissolve into the soil and become one with the earth. Or become a gardener, maybe. Those last two options sound especially nice. Being a hermit seems like it would be pretty hard. And lonely. Goddamn, I am so lonely, though. I can't get any pets at my apartment, so I have been amassing plants. So many plants. Weed and beer help numb the pain temporarily, but this new insanity is making my facade crack. I don't know what to do.",26Jun2018,1
310,"I live with 3 people.

One them is my roommates girlfriend.

Lately she's been trusting me with things she doesn't tell her boyfriend (my roommate) and we've gotten closer since she moved in. We've talked about deep things and have shared a lot about each other. We also have days where we hang out when he's away.

We all hang out and have a good time together though. They suspected I had a ""crush"" on her early on when I really didn't. Until now.

Call it a self-fulfilling prophecy, but I think the feeling is mutual. We've only discussed it once (while intoxicated) but I don't know how to address this situation to put it all out there to figure out what I am to her and what she is to me and how to proceed. 

Her and I have gotten physical (touching and kissing) on a couple of occasions and I've seen her practically naked. I should mention she made a move on me first if that puts anything in perspective.

I don't want to catch feelings and ruin a good thing, but I'm afraid everything is on a collision course to go nuclear. I'm afraid guilt will get to me or her and we'll end up telling him, ruining a good thing. I don't know how their relationship is doing (they've been fighting more recently, maybe that answers my question?), but I don't want to be a reason for it to go sour, along with our living situation. 

I've ran every scenario I can think of in my head and there are far more negative ones than positive.

I don't know what to do, or how to feel, or how to stop feeling what I'm starting to feel, or how to handle any of this, or if I'm being used/manipulated by her for some ulterior motive I'm unaware of; there's just so many moving parts to this and I'm stuck inside my own head. Help.

TL;DR- I'm catching feelings for my roommates gf and I think the feeling is mutual based on a conversation we've had, we've gotten physical a couple of times and she'll walk around naked if it's just me there. I don't know what to do or how to proceed from here, or how to address any of this further with her without it being awkward. Help.",26Jun2018,1

312,"It has been a full month since I went to Iceland with a group of acquaintances and we did the trip by splitting 11 of us between two vans (white and gray). We were notified of wind damage pretty soon after we got back and let Sam, (fake name) the guy who sort of lead us, handle negotiating it. 
The vans were not in great condition when we go them - doors were really hard to open and they flooded on occasion when using the kitchen sinks inside. I am guessing he used this to discount what he said was originally a 3000 Euro bill down to $2,066.83.
The bummer is that he disbursed it evenly to all 11 of us even though five of us very clearly stayed and used only one van.  Five people stayed permanently in the gray, damaged van, and one guy hopped around. 
I feel strongly I (and the four other people in my van) do not owe anything on this basis.

I've tried not having as much sugar and chocolate but that has made me worse because it makes me way too tired to be able to function normally at school.

314,"I am literally going insane

So me and my boyfriend have been together for 6 years, and the relationship was always great, until I met a guy my senior year of college. At that moment the relationship with my boyfriend was becoming boring and a routine, so I wasn't too happy. This guy started to make eye contact with me everyday in class until I noticed him. For some reason, I felt like if I knew him for many years. This guy one day approached me and told me that he left a flower outside my door. I was so excited to find out it was him, but at the same time, I knew it was wrong. As the school year progressed, I started to fall more and more for this kid, and I was changing my behavior with my boyfriend. My boyfriend was starting to notice, and I decided to tell him what was happening. I realized that my relationship was more important than anything else and I shouldn't risk what I had for the unknown. I graduated college, and I thought that not seeing the other kid will help me to forget him. However, it has been a year since I don't see him, but I still dream of him, die to see him again, and visualize myself with him. Things just got worse. My boyfriend proposed to me and we have plans to move out this summer, but I don't feel like I am making the right choice. I am so scared to make a mistake.

I currently live with two roommates - they are both blonde and I have black hair. One of them recently complained that my hair needs to be cleaned every single time I use the washroom. (They never take out the garbage or wash their dishes so idk why they are upset that I only clean my hair once a week, grrr). Anyways, I'm a person who goes to the washroom a lot because I drink 2-4 litres of water every day. I also shower every day or every second day. Most of the time, I keep my hair tied up but it sticks to my clothes and happens to fall off onto the washroom's white floor. I keep losing a lot of hair due to stress and weight loss.

323,"Hi, y'all! I really hope you're having a good week so far. 

The situation is basically what I mentioned above, but here's a descriptive TLDR in case I wrote too much: ex-partner won't communicate about cat but expects to be able to show up at any time on our custody change dates to get him.  I don't know what to do.

I know that this is going to sound silly, but please, please only offer serious advice. I love my cat and am so freaking attached to him, and I don't know what to do. 

So, like the title says, I have a cat named Richard. I adopted him with my ex (who I was with for around three years - I'll call the ex ""B"") about a year ago. I know, I know - hindsight is 20/20. Don't adopt animals with people you're not married or eternally committed to. 

Thing is, Richard's microchip is in my name, his vet stuff is in my name, but B's name and mine are both on Richie's adoption papers. I don't know how that would work out legally, like who would have legal ""ownership"" over Richard, but for all intents and purposes, we ""coparent"" our cat and always have. 

When B and I broke up, it was on okay terms. I mean, no long-term breakup is ever ""ideal,"" but it was okay. Up until now, we have communicated about Richard semi-effectively and politely, and have avoided contact outside of Richard topics. 

B, according to my therapist, is something called a ""covert narcissist."" He was sometimes mentally abusive  and very manipulative with me. Over time, he tore me down very, very much. However, he does not show this behavior to people outside our relationship, and I think he has so much potential and is very kind deep inside himself. I do know that he is typically a good cat-parent to our Richie. That's why I was okay with sharing custody. At first. Now, it's almost like he is trying to use Richard as a manipulation tool. 

So, about two week ago, B told me he wanted to cut contact completely when it didn't deal with Richie. I was completely fine with that, because though I love  B very much as a human, he is not very kind to me. So I said ""that's totally okay"" and didn't contact him since - until this weekend. Our custody change date is today, Tuesday, so I contacted him via call and text (one time each) on Friday and Saturday (respectively) with no response. I texted him again on Sunday, and received a response with a tentative timeframe for him to pick Richard up from my apartment. I texted him yesterday morning to confirm the time and also to ask about Richard's booster shots with no response. I honestly think he's trying to feel like he's in control by forcing me to wait around for him? Idk. 

I don't know what to do.  Like, morally, what is the right way to proceed? I feel like my options are to give him power and constantly wait around for him, or to keep Richard and accept the risks. 

 I am unwilling to contact him more than is absolutely necessary because the emotional labor it takes for me to deal with him is way too extreme for our contact to extend beyond cat stuff. My friends are telling me to just ignore all further contact, block his number, and keep Richard, but honestly I am afraid he'll either come to my home and do something unkind to me, or file legal chargers against me or something. I want him to still see Richard because I know he loves him, but I'm unwilling to deal with this ache for the rest of my life. I'm also unwilling to accept the risk of giving Richard back - B doesn't change his litter, scoop the box, and sometimes lets Richard's food run out. 

Please give me a little bit of direction. Really, anything. 

THANK YOU SO MUCH for your time. I appreciate you far more than you can know. ",26Jun2018,6
324,"I've recently graduated highschool, and have been been applying for jobs. I've had a few interviews but the hunt continues (it's been about three weeks). Today, a friend contacted me wanting to hang out and my Mum heard her bring it up on the phone. She was very angry and told me that I can't meet up with any of my friends until I have a job. She amended it to ""only for a short period of time late at night when you can't apply for jobs"" when I almost started to cry but I just feel utterly destroyed and hopeless about the situation. I'll give a little background. 

A few weeks before I graduated as I prepared for finals, my Dad asked me to apply for jobs. I asked him to let me wait until at least after finals and graduation was over. He kept on asking me, getting angrier and angrier that I wasn't applying for jobs, until on the day of graduation I heard him tell my mother that I was ""lazy"" and only talked about me getting a job at graduation. I got extremely good grades in highschool, and I worked really hard throughout the finals so I felt sort of defeated. Then in the week after, I was sort of dazed having gotten out of school and having no homework or finals to do. 

My mother started pressuring me, yelling and me and stuff, and the last three weeks since I've probably applied to over a hundred places mostly in person. I'm doing online applications now too. The last two weeks we've gone out to get groceries or other things and she's spontaneously pulled over to stores to get me to apply. Even at very early morning excercise she'll say things like ""You should apply there!"" as we go past businesses still closed. The last two days she's been telling me to just apply absolutely anywhere because I still don't have a job, including at a business locally notorious for its awful treatment of employees. I've got a call back from one job and have had two really good interviews so it seems like I'm getting places, which is extremely good because I've been told it takes about 2-4 months for most people to get a job here (by friends who have experience). According to Mum it's not good because it just means ""people are too lazy.""

Still the pressure continues, and she's amping it up. Today she told me this, and is threatening to take away my phone as well. I'm extremely upset because one of my friends is moving out of the country early next month and I want to spend time with her, and I also don't want to be Aspbergery hermit again like I was in freshman year of highschool. I want to be social. I'm aiming for a job that'll be social for that purpose and my Mum has told me to ""stop applying (for retail positions) because you're not very personable anyways."" I'm upset, and I feel my mood is eventually going to get in the way of me getting hired. Today I walked into a cafe and one of the people making coffee looked over me with a very concerned expression and asked if I was okay. I didn't realize that my face was showing my feelings. 

I'm scared to post this because I feel like a whiny teen but I'm deeply upset that my social life is being restricted at what feels like the worse time possible, especially for my relationship with my friend who is moving a whole contenant away. But I want to ask: is what she doing right? I love my mother, how can I calm her behavior down, and my Dad's? ",26Jun2018,4
325,"One of my friends, I am her only friend ever since she finished high school in 2016 she told me she would just distance herself from everyone else. I met her in Janurary so a few months ago. My mom was friends with her mom and said she was looking to hang out with people. Long story short, she has somewhat of a temper. She was in my band but got mad because the drummer showed up late(we weren't scheduled to play until 9pm drummer got there at 8:30) that mad her made to the point she told me I was horrible at music, that I annoyed her and that she is going to find ""better"" musicians to play with. I told her that was rude and then she went outside the venue and sat down. She acts high and mighty(not gonna write it over as I have posted about the other thing she did that day).

330,"Hello Reddit. I need to tell you guys a message about one of my neighbours that moved in a few days ago. His name is Sonja and he told me yesterday that he’s a registered sex offender over molesting kids back in India. I’ll tell you the story here.

Yesterday I got a knock on my door and it was from my new neighbour that moved in. He told me “I have to tell you something since I’m legally required to. I’m a registered sex offender and I’ve moved to the USA for a job opportunity. I did some nasty things in Iran and I hope you understand”, said Sonja. I told him thanks for telling and then he proceeded to tell the next house over and so on. 

After that I did some research and found his record online for molesting some of his cousins back in India 10 year ago. I got shocked that my neighbour was a pedophile and couldn’t sleep that night knowing that he could reside at that house permanently and I don’t want to live with that. I had a talk with one of my good friends today and he had the same reaction as me; shocked and disgusted. I want to approach Sonja and talk his ass down for molesting innocent kids but I don’t want to be rude since I think in India that’s part of their culture. As far as I know, he might follow Islam and maybe that’s why he acted on those feelings since in that religion pedophillia is accepted.

I can’t believe that my neighbour is a disgusting pig and I want him to feel remorse for what he did to those kids but not being rude. I need a way to get it through his skull that in the USA raping kids is not accepted.

332,"Hello,

My friend is a 16 year old in high school. His parents are seriously considering sending him to summer school for grade 11 math. He passed the course but the teacher was obligated to suggest summer school in an email. He is a a decent student, a better student then me, and is not pursuing a career involving math. He works 11 hours both days on the weekends with me already, and would have to go to a 7 hour math class every week day for July.

333,"I have a friend who started acting all weird and cold couple of weeks ago, I personally thought it was one of those down phases that he is going through again... But recently he started pushing me away and acting all distant. At first I was really hurt and confused but somehow some dots were connected and I can’t express how mad am I at myself for not realizing what he was going through.  So what I realized is that his closest friend kinda stopped spending time with him and now spending it with an another friend. 
It might sound like some kids nonesense but that’s because he values his friendships so much that if the other party messes up it really destroys his mental state emotionally and physically.
The thing is I know how much it hurts and I know how it can be the reason to just sulk in and ignore everything, so I can’t blame him for pushing the others away. But then, seeing the damages on him... I can’t help but worry and feel frustrated because I couldn’t help him yet with it. 
He would feel really triggered and conscious if I ever mention it. More likely he would overthink the fact that I figured it out and end up believing that i see him as a petty thing and what ever we would do for him is out of sympathy. 
I really have no idea how to help him out... I can’t describe how much damage this had on him. It’s like one of those precious and sensitive people that you will fight anyone who hurts them. 
I would appreciate it a lot if someone can advice me on how to help him out without making his mental state even worst. Because this is filling up my head and I can’t help but worry and think of how bad he must’ve feel all the time.  ",26Jun2018,1

335,"This is a long story. 

TLDR: I have past (and possibly present) mental health issues I should really address but I can't for fear of police being called and my parents disowning me. I can't afford therapy and I'm going to university in a few months without any idea where to from go from there. A psychiatrist is no longer an option as I don't know how to get one and the two places I have gone to: threatened to lock me away and call the police or told me to get therapy (that I once again cannot afford and my parents will 100&amp;#37; not pay for). If I go to a university counsellor will they call the police? Is there any point in addressing this or do I just deal with it?

Detailed stuff:

Both my parents value grades and don't really address mental health. I have a brother about 10 years older than me and my parents used to work a lot at a restaurant they owned. I never saw them much and mostly had my brother and a babysitter take care of me. Eventually my dad got a higher paying job and from there my mom became a stay at home mom. I always had to do workbooks and study because my brother was always the perfect child and I was constantly compared to him. Until this year my parents always brought up my brother's grades, how social and popular he was, and the fact that he got into a really good university and was financially independent within a year of graduating. I don't remember much of the good times with my parents because when I was around 6-8 they fought a lot; they threw dishes at each other, broke doors and made holes in the walls (sometimes the police had to be called to get them to calm down) so those events kinda overshadowed any good things. After my brother moved out the fighting kinda stopped.

I didn't have a lot of friends at elementary school either (I only had one but I'll explain that) since my mom wouldn't let me hang out with anyone (insisting that I had more work to do). My one friend I met in 6th grade because they were shunned from their own group, leading them to hang out with the creepy loner kid (ie: me). I wasn't actively bullied at school (no beating me up and not much gossip that I know of), just ignored by my peers. To escape from this I got into murders and mass shooters (okay not a great idea but too late now). During middle school I hated my school and my life, I rarely slept as I was constantly thinking of how to kill myself and everyone in my school. I had a list of people I wanted gone and plans to kill every one of them. I was literally the making of a school shooter. I had cut myself a few times but stopped when I realized the teachers noticed kids at my school doing the same thing (it was kind of a craze at my elementary school for some reason, or maybe everyone was just hella depressed). Everyday was just a cycle of studying, wanting to die, wanting to kill everyone else, and going online (reading up on murders, shooters, and some innocent roleplaying too). Crying was a pretty regular occurrence but I was also a really sensitive kid. I told my parents that I wanted to die and that I had no friends but I guess they thought it was  no big deal.

Enter high school, realize that my weird hobbies wouldn't get me anywhere and that I should change. I decide to get rid of every violent list, plan, and picture with the goals of 'fitting in'. I'm still a depressed piece of shit, but this time I have friends. I was still compared to my brother and I still spent most of my time doing worksheets or attending a cram school. I wasn't popular and most people knew me as the kid who was good at math, I still thought of killing myself every day but at least I had a couple friends who liked my personality. This kinda thing kept going until grade 12 where I broke down 1-2 times during school and was called into guidance a couple times. Mom gets called in, counsellor tells her about my possible depression but mostly about how I want to die, starts crying like she's *never* heard of such a thing. I get sent to emergency room and my dad leaves work early to see me there. He's never looked so disappointed and my mom tells me that my brother never had any of these problems. I break down again. My dad tells me not to be over dramatic since I can't miss a year of university. That day was wild and the psychiatrist there threatened to lock me up and get me arrested (since I did tell the counsellor a bit about me wanting to pour gasoline in the school and burn it down). I was told I'd get referred to a clinic, never did. I got a school counsellor but all she did was tell me to get antidepressants. I go to my family doctor about my feelings, he tells me to go to the emergency room. I change family doctors. New doc tells me that she's hesitant about giving me antidepressants (which makes a lot of sense, can't blame her). New doc refers me to a psychiatrist, they lose the email and by the time they get back to me they're backed up with new patients, they tell me to go get therapy. My mom sent me to the family doctor a lot during that fiasco and put on this show about how she's so worried she can't work or sleep and cries every time.

Now to today, my dad thinks I'm being over dramatic and my mom just complains about how my mental health affects her. I still don't have any medication but to be honest I don't have the energy to deal with this again. I'm already a disappointment to my family and all I hear are complains from my parents. I just want summer to be over so I can go live on residence. I've been told that my university has great mental health services but I don't want to be sent to the police or disappoint my parents anymore. I have no reason to be depressed, I'm going to a great school, I have high grades, and parents who buy me whatever I want. Maybe I am being a spoiled brat. I don't fucking know anymore. If I leave this mental health thing behind will it just go away? Will I grow out of it? I don't have those violent thoughts anymore.

This is a combination of asking for advice and venting (but probably venting mostly). Take it down for all I care.",26Jun2018,1
336,I'm a 24f. My parents live about 2 hours away from me. I was very close to my mom up until the age 17. My mom would nit pick everything thing I did. She became very condescending towards me. My dad and I never were close. He was always angry and would make comments on my weight and would call me names. I moved out when I was 18 and would always call my mom at least once a day. Even though when I called her she would tell me what's going on in her life and I would always listen without interrupting her but when I would try to talk about myself she would always cut me off and say she had to get off the phone or start talking to someone else when I was in the middle of saying something acting like she's so busy every time I call even though she doesn't have a job. When I would ask for help with money she never would want to help even though my parents are well off. I have given her money countless times over the past years.  It took my almost 6 years to realize this relationship is one sided. So I stopped calling everyday and it's been a couple weeks since I have talked to my mom. I haven't talked to my dad in months. They don't bother to call or even send a text. They don't know where I live and don't ask about my boyfriend who I've been dating for a little over a year. Somehow I feel like I'm doing something wrong and it's my fault we don't talk.

344,"My parents choose not to vaccinate me. I don't necessarily blame them for their decision because I understand that they were misinformed and doing what they felt was best at the time. However, I am a young adult now (22) with critical thinking skills and feel strongly that getting vaccinated is the right thing to do to protect my own health and the health of others. I transferred to a (UC) university last fall from community college and was required to submit proof of vaccinations. At the time I was caught off guard and had no health insurance. I had just gotten into my dream school and was scared about anything jeopardizing what I had worked for so I provided false records. This involved an online self report form with a section to attach official medical record documents. I filled out the form with standard dates and didn't attach a document, and my official registration went through without a follow up request for documentation. I understand this was wrong and puts other students at risk, I wish I had made a different choice in retrospect. 

I will be graduating this December and I wan't to get vaccinated now while I have a great student health insurance plan. My question is, if I go to my university health center and request vaccinations, are they allowed (or required?) to report that I was not previously vaccinated to other university divisions (i.e. admissions &amp; records)? I know doctor-patient confidentiality exists, but I am not sure if it would apply in this scenario. I just want to do the right thing to protect my health but not if its going to get me kicked out of school 6 months before I earn my degree. Otherwise, are their other public health programs that do low cost vaccinations? I know planned parenthood centers do primary care services in some cases, is that a potential option?

I still have that fear of rejection and making our friendship feel awkward, and the bigger issue is that I feel pretty shallow.

347,"I am doing this on my phone so apologies for any formatting issues. 

Right so almost 2 years ago at this point at tge begining of my secind year of college I was introduced to the girl that quickly became my best friend. 

During our time at college we spent out free lessons together talking, we talked back and forth everyday either in person or over messages whether that be about work we have to do or just generally random topics that we see. I can easily say she was the person i most enjoyed talking with each day. 

The time came however when the new academjc year was starting and I had to move away to go to uni whilst she stayed at home to do her second year of college (when we met she was a first year one as a second year). I think it's worth mentioning at this point that I had chosen a university that was half way across the country from where she was mainly as it gave me a great offer and had great feedback from student on the course one as choosing. 

This wasn't a big issue as we still talked practically everyday over messaging and Snapchat and we continued our friendship as if I hadn't moved away for my first term of 3 months. 

Throughout the whole time I'd known her we had this slightly flirtatious friendship which neither of us took seriously. Once I had returned home after my first term during one of our random conversations we both ended up confessing we had feelings for each other and had done for some time. Soon after we started dating. That was the happiest time of my life I can say without any doubt. So I was home from university for about 2 months and we started dating during the second month of me being home. Prior to anything about us knowing how each other feels we had long conversations about long distance relationships and how her part relationships had long distance and it just didn't work in the end. 

After the month of us dating and me being home I left for university again to start my second semester. We kept the relationship going as we both wanted to see how it would go and it was going alright for a time. I'd visit back home for a bit to see her and she would travel to me for some time. However as my second term was coming to an end we ended up breaking up. The distancejust ended up being too much as we both are her affectionate people and wanted to be with each other for more time than was possible. 

We both agreed we wanted to stay friends as we didn't break up due to arguments and such. Its been 3 months since we broke up and we've barely spoken. 

I really want to speak to her again like we used to but I don't know how to anymore. I'm so nervous to send a message. Over the last 3 months I've tried talking like i used to but it is usually met with limited response. I'm recent days we've had one or two actual good conversations almost like usual. I'm no where near as happy these days as I was before uni started and I just feel like I'm putting on an act half the time

351,"I've never lived on my own but I've got a stable full-time job and I can afford to move out.

I could afford both in my area. I don't have any plans to switch jobs necessarily, but that could certainly change. I would still be able to save money in an apartment (though not as much) so I could still eventually have enough to buy a place (theoretically).

353,"A little while ago, I posted a question asking ""Should I ask again or move on"". Despite the responses I received, I am convinced I should move on. I've been going to the same school with this guy since 5th grade. We didn't talk as much until junior/senior year of high school, and now we are in college together pursuing the same major (for the record, I picked this major before him). We eat, talk, walk, and study together often since we take the same classes. Not to mention that we also have to carpool cuz parking sucks at our university.

Anyways...

I told him that I liked him in Dec 2016 or Jan 2017. He responded by saying he ""appreciated our friendship"" and that he wants to continue talking normally. And I agreed to that. But, (and this is where the reason for my decision comes in) every time we are on any sort of break (summer, Thanksgiving, winter, etc), he doesn't text me unless I text him first. So here we are, almost a month has passed and not even a ""how are you"" or ""sup"". I put my heart and soul into our ""friendship"" and he knows that. In addition, I sent him a follow request on Instagram. Yes, he accepted it, but didn't follow back ??? I've known him since FIFTH GRADE. We GRADUATED TOGETHER. We took every college class and did group projects and pulled all nighters at the library and got good grades together and watched movies and vented to each other and went bowling and shared playlists and drove back and forth from/to school. And all of this was after I confessed too.

The Instagram thing might be petty, and I might be overreacting, but I've ruined my nights thinking about this dude and if we even have any sort of ""friendship"".

Today I went out for an ice cream at lunch and came back an hour later to find I had been logged out. 

Thankfully word had autosaved my work so nothing was lost. My new colleagues said Rog did it. They didn't stop him, but yet appear sympathetic. 

They said that I should log out when I go to lunch as it is 'hot desking (which none of them really do)'. 

I said that I would never log someone out. This is especially poignant as there are 7 other unused computers in the office today!

I got married when I was young and our libidos were always severely mismatched, mine being higher. He was my first and my only until the end of the relationship. We didn't have a lot of sex and towards the end we didn't have any at all.

Since that ended, I've only had sex with two other people and it was a threesome (M/F), so it was one single experience. I bet you'll hear that and think I'll be fine, but there was copious amount of alchohol and weed involved in that, plus I was still insecure and anxious.

She had been drinking with his sister and my gf asked him to take her home (12 mins away) because she was tipsy and didn't feel comfortable driving. He doesn't drink, party, and is seen as your typical ""nice, responsible"" guy. So on the way to her apt, she had started to nod off and he started to touch her sexually and try to pull her clothes off.

So as my screen name suggests, this is meant to be a funny account, but I do need legit advice. 

I was with a girl for 2 years who was incredibly abusive and manipulative....I ended up getting herpes from someone, not really sure who but it seems to have come from my current girlfriend. When she and I were seeing each other, I wasn't really feeling the connection, so I was seeing other girls on the side. I ended up moving away from the area I was currently in and I stopped seeing the girls I had been seeing except for the one who would eventually become my girlfriend. The other girls were rude, or didn't have much of an interest in a relationship so that's why o stopped seeing them.
I now live with my girlfriend, I really like her family and my family absolutely adores her, but I do not feel the connection anymore. I find myself wanting to stray and even lusting after her sister. There is absolutely nothing wrong with my girlfriend, but I no longer feel the connection, I want her to be happy and I want to make her happy...but it's in the same way you would want to make a close friend happy. 
We have been living together for about 4 months now and we have a cat together. In 3 days I am going on vacation with her and her family.
I think I ultimately ended up with her because she was the first girl who was seriously nice to me after my break up and I also felt that nobody would want someone who has herpes anyways. ",26Jun2018,1

I knew the field I wanted to succeed in, I knew where I wanted to work and I got the job. I am more qualified than anyone else who works there, not that I’m egotistical about it at all. I received specialized training and try my best to train up other staff to my par. It doesn’t help that we work in specialized industry with limitless technical knowledge. 

All of my coworkers love me, we are team, we are friends and we get the job done. Sometimes I am huge crutch for them but it’s okay, I’m not bothered to pass along the training as my boss has sent me out periodically to receive training from business we deal from to keep me up to date. She REFUSES to send any other staff with me because she doesn’t think they are worth the investment.

I’m the youngest in the field with full certification and have received much praise from me mentors and teachers. Encouragement to purse the field and be successful. I never told my boss this but some of these companies even offered me a job if I am willing to move from the city I live in. 

Many of these offers were open ended as they understood that I didn’t have any reason to move. It’s also important to have a cross country network and in my small area there is no one competing with me for my job. 

My boss has held over my head that she has kept me up to date on my training and for a very long time I was grateful. I can’t afford to travel across country to keep up to date and I’m not so grateful anymore because I could if she paid me appropriately. The few people I know who are at the same level as me, make double the amount I do. 

Anyway to make a long story short my boss has been mentally unstable in the last few months. We had 10 staff member quit. She refuses to acknowledge this has anything to do with her and stooped as low as to say a coworker was to entitled to work for her. Which is the furthest from the truth there is. 

It’s been 11 days since my boss lost her mind on me and I refuse to return to work. The argument started out of my control and I just couldn’t take the belittlement from her and stood up for myself. How it started was a client didn’t want to talk to her and kept asking for me, saying that she trusted my expertise and would really like to hear what I had to say. 

Somehow that made my boss livid. She came to confront me as to ‘Why her customers trust me more than her’. I responded telling her I didn’t agree that they trust me more, just that for that particular client I have been working with her since the beginning and I worked really hard for her to trust me and our business relation. 

She took it was out of proportion and started yelling at me never to contradict her or steal her clients away from her. I was so confused it’s not like I get a bonus from my clients it all goes to my boss. 

I knew even before this that she was mental unstable lately and couldn’t make clear decisions. Hell any problems we have in the business are her fault because she neglected all staff but me, and she has a spending addiction and can’t keep up her debts to our suppliers. 

She screamed at me for about an hour, sometimes I was snarky but not nearly as snarky as she was, she kept belittling me and telling me that I can’t steal her business away from her and that I’m not the owner. I gave up on the conversation after she said and I quote “You are so egotistical about your job and think you can do anything you want because your so smart, pretty, and young”. 

I can’t reason with that shit, I want to succeed at my job so I work hard. All the time, because I love my trade and my job. Really dislike my bosses attitude. I couldn’t listen to her anymore after I could tell this is just her power tripping and I really did nothing wrong other than trying to please a loyal client. 

At this point my snark turned on and I just kept repeating “we can talk when you can use your inside voice” and she couldn’t, she just kept yelling at me. I just took it because I wanted my job. 

Basically the argument ended with her telling me that I can’t act the way I do because she has higher position than me and she will always know more. I can never disagree or contradict her with my knowledge even if I know I’m right. Yes she actually said “even if you know you’re right”.  Oh and she said it as she could never respect me if I disagree with her.

Before I left I asked her if she was done with me or wanted me back, she kept giving me snark Telling me to just go find a competitor like everyone else who quite and that I should be smart enough to figure it out. 

My final words “this is abusive and manipulative and I wouldn’t tolerate it.” My shift was over at this point and I went home. She texted me a bunch begging me not to quit and that she will just put me on a leave of absence until I can figure out what I want to do. 

I told her I was very overwhelmed and would talk to her when I figured out what I wanted to do. That was the evening of the argument, 11 days ago.

I don’t want to go back anymore. I love my job but I don’t want to work for someone who is going to see me as a threat. I thought she saw me as a capable asset but apparently that is threatening for her. 

I don’t know what to do, I want that job but I don’t want to have to move across country even though I can start at 50k a year right off the start. I make about 25k currently, it’s get the bills paid. I still buy myself nice stuff I was fine with my wage working where I loved. 

Now it’s ruined and I don’t know what to do. I thought I would just go back to school but the course I need/want is full already. 

I haven’t formally told her I’ve quit. I can’t get EI anyway so wtf is the point. I don’t care if she feels dragged though the mud, I watched her drag 10 staff through the mud and then me. I just want the comfortable and stability I had two weeks ago. Now it’s all confusing and I feel lost. 

I literally bought a house 5 months ago and recently started family planning with my fiancé. Now all this garbage, I can’t take this away from him because I had an argument with my boss.

I either move and continue this career, or stay working a job just for the money. I’m just sitting in limbo because I can’t make a decision and it causes my inner turmoil to flare. 

Some of my family think I should just go back to my job but it’s not worth it to me. She’s so unstable this is going to happen again and again and I don’t need this shit. I take care of my life, her responsibility is to take care of hers and not be jealous of her staff members. 

This is all crazy probably to long for most to read now. I really need advice though everywhere is saying seek advice from someone and I don’t have anyone giving me proper advice. I know the options but I don’t know which one is the best for me. Bridges have been burned at this job and I’m not willing to rebuild them. 

Tl:dr my boss is crazy but it’s the only place in my city that offers the job I’m specialized in. 

I either stay and work for Satan incarnate, or I sell my house and move to a new city, or I give up on my dreams and work a 9-5.  And I don’t know what to do because I was so happy at my job and it’s all been ruined because my boss can’t get her shit together.

I could honestly list all day long the inappropriate things she has said and done and it just gets wilder as it goes on. I don’t think I’m masochistic enough to return.",26Jun2018,1

If she ever has a sad moment I don't know about it. She's always motivated keep things nice, she look at herself a lot and does her makeup a lot. Sometimes she calls herself the ""queen"" and treats me ok, but also isn't 100% of herself. But she's very sensitive, 

Othertimes shes kinda low and doesn't talk a whole lot, get frustrated easily. Like she's lonely all she wants to do is cuddle with me. And not do much

Then there's other times..... She's super happy, making a lot of jokes, being really weird in a funny way, kinda awkward, and acting like shes barely apart of the relationship. I can barely kiss her without her doing something random. Teasing WAY to much, like the whole get away from me and don't talk to me kinda thing just joking around.

i dont know what to do. i always end up distancing myself from friends like this until we're not really friends anymore because the relationship is always kind of unfulfilling and becomes a drain. some of the blame is on me i guess for attracting so many people like this but also i wonder what the hell is wrong them that they treat people like that and think its okay. they usually are really interesting people but they never have many friends, presumably because of this. its really strange to talk to people who seem lukewarm towards you except for when they suddenly and seemingly genuinely proclaim that they love you, youre their best friend, etc. i think they just like the attention i give them, and not actually me. its so frustrating.

381,"The question may seem simple, but I think there's more to it than that!

So a year ago (I was 21 at the time) I got a job as a manual machinist in an electric motor repair company. I didn't have much experience (or really any at all) but they gave me an opportunity and I thought I did pretty well. Low and behold I got into my own head. I didn't hate the work (good days and bad days, pretty typical), but I didn't like the job security too much. If this place closed, I would be pretty screwed since there isn't many electric motor repair places. So I went up to my boss and we parted ways. He was disappointed, but  told me he would contact me next summer to see if I wanted to do any overflow work. 

During this time I was going to school for welding. I dropped out of the program because it wasn't worth the cost. There would be days where we have no material and our teacher and us would watch funny fail youtube videos for example. There would be times where at the beginning of the semester, we didn't even have a teacher! It was just piss-poor planning and I was paying for it all out of my own pocket. I couldn't bear to spend another $3000 on BS, so I didn't finish it out. The electric motor company knew I was going to school, so they had me part time and let me pick out my own schedule. 

Anyway, a couple months ago I got a job as a plumber's helper. Its just the owner and myself. Every other helper has left before me, due to how my current boss treats his helper. Now, in the trades, there isn't any sugar coating of any sort and I get that. But my boss is incredibly tough to deal with. I'll get flak for asking questions, get called every name in the book, insulted on a regular basis, keep being told how much money I'm costing him, etc. There's more to it, but thats the general gist.

This afternoon I get a email from my old boss, asking me if I wanted to do that overflow work. It's incredibly tempting to just jump ship and go back to my old job. It really wears down on you getting yelled at and insulted all day. I just wanted to know what you guys would do.

382,"First of all sorry for any mistakes, English isn’t my first language.

Hey guys,

I‘m a 20 year old male and idk what to do.
I‘ve been playing video games since I was little and been always putting in a lot of effort as my ultimate goal in life is being a professional in the game I play. 

I‘ll start off by describing my current situation first and then get to my issue.

The situation right now is that I‘m doing an apprenticeship at a major bank in my country, I get good money, bus ticket and books for school paid for, vacation money, christmas money and 30 paid days off, they split the gym costs with me as they support a healthy lifestyle and I‘m like family with my work colleagues. 
Also they would support me through university if I‘d choose to study afterwards. I finish in 2020.

I enjoy what I‘m doing and I‘m good at it(that is what I‘m told), the problem is that as good as it sounds it‘s not my biggest dream. I‘ve been playing videogames through all my childhood and when I was 15 I got into esports. This resulted in me having arguments with my mom a lot but all in all I graduated high school and got a job so she didn’t really bother me anymore after that. 

My problem is that the video game I‘m playing atm made me fulfill my dream partially with me and my team getting paid and flown out to another country to compete in a 250,000$ tournament. This was were I knew I was capable to keep pushing for it and make my way into said game‘s Pro League.

So right now I might have an offer for said Pro League with a good salary, the problem is I would have to quit my apprenticeship (which means I have to start all over if I was to pick it up again) and move to the states. 
It is my biggest dream and I‘m passionate about it but I don’t know if I want to take the risk. I could be „fired“ within 3 months if I don’t perform or the league could end within 18 months if the sponsor doesn’t think it’s worth it anymore. It could also be prolonged but that will be decided next year. 

I could take the offer and move to the states with the risks said above or I could finish my apprenticeship and hope the league is still running in 2020. I really don’t know what to do. Deep inside of me I know I will regret it all my life if I don’t take that offer but on the other hand if it doesn’t work out I just quit on a super good company that really cares about its employees and offers good job stability and a nice career path ahead of me. 

I really have no idea what to do, take the safe bet and deny myself my biggest dream even tho I had the chance to do it, or take a risk for the sake of living my dream I‘ve been working for for 5 years now.

I really don’t know what to do right now...",26Jun2018,1

386,"I'm going to try give as much detail without giving too much away just on the off chance my boss browses reddit. I recently started this job a few months ago. I've been very enthusiastic about it and have been trying to learn as much as I can and can honestly say I learned a lot since I've started. I ask questions and even ask for work when it's slow. Everyone in the department as well as the office all play on their phones in between tasks or when its slow but as a team we all get our work done. I even caught my boss playing a game under his desk at one point. 

Today was the second time he said something to me about my phone usage. I still get my work done as well as the other things I mentioned.

388,"Gah, it is difficult to even admit this or let alone ask for advice regarding my situation, because I feel so incredibly vulnerable and just completely disappointed in myself. I am 23 years old by now and after finishing upper secondary school (I am Finnish) with decent grades, I went to do my mandatory army service and ever since that I have been trying to apply into an university/polytechnic. I tried to get into economics, I've tried to get into psychology, I've tried to get into just plain English translation and every time I fail the entry exam and I am left feeling absolutely worthless about myself. 

I don't really have an education so as such my ""career"" is limited to whatever jobs I can find in my city. I've worked at a warehouse and at an apple orchard for a few months, whenever those jobs are available. I still live at my parents and in the last four years I haven't managed to move anywhere in my life. I'm happy for my friends but I feel terrible for being the only one who hasn't even stepped into the next part of what is supposed to be my life. I don't even know if I would want to study those things or what I would like to do as my job. 

I'm really, really lost today with everything. I just would like some advice from different paths of life, people who maybe have struggled with similar feelings.

391,"Throwaway for privacy.  So, I’m posting here because talking to anyone I know personally is asking for a pity-party, loading my worries on to them and an admission of failure.  My head is stuck in a loop and I need a kick or some wisdom or ... something.  Maybe I just need to write it down?  Apologies for the length.

I haven’t eaten in two days and barely slept (Hi Reddit, thanks for keeping me company!!) I’ve so far resisted having a drink because my father is an alcoholic and I’m afraid to make that mistake.  I’m bouncing my wife’s calls because I don’t want to speak to her until I get my shit together (I did tell her what happened) - again lots of underlying reasons to that too, dancing around divorce for 3 years and her own mental and physical health issues being the greatest of them.

I was told recently that I was to be demoted from my Exec position - that I’ve operated at for a few years across multiple roles - always told I was doing so successfully- back to senior management within 2 days of new boss arriving. If they had just dismissed me I would have got a fat cheque and time to sort my head out.  Instead I have to carry on, hand my job ‘up’ to someone with no fucking relevant experience and work for them (but realistically prop them up to at least avoid compounding my own situation).  I am not capable of letting my team or my colleagues across the organisation down so I’m still working 14+ hours trying to keep the ball in the air while we go through the transition.  I don’t even think this demoted position is stable, I think it’s a route to push me out but avoid losing my experience and knowledge immediately and to avoid writing me a cheque.

If i take the new boss at face value I’m told they’ll look after my money but I’m assuming there is at least a bonus impact to come which will set back the family finances and mean I can’t afford to put my daughter in my preferred school next year as planned (see why I can’t talk to people in person about this until I sort it out).  Even if I find something else to do that then hurts the colleagues I’ve recently hired into my team who believed they were coming to work for me specifically who I talked out of other good roles to come to me, and to whom I’ve made commitments to support and grow. 

If I’d known this was coming I feel like I could have just moved jobs - I was on top of things and respected across my firm and industry - now I feel like I have ‘FAILED’ tattooed on my head.  My skill set is fairly niche and the relevant community at my level is very small so word will quickly get to prospective employers that I’m on a downward trajectory.

For the last 13+ years my career has been on a bit of a rocket and I’ve relied on that validation as my job being the one thing I am really really fucking good at.  That confidence and security has got me through lots of personal challenges including bereavements during that time.  Like, I just DON’T fail, and I NEVER let people down at work - and now I have and I am.

I’m really finding it hard to get up and go to work and face the team and not to just stay locked in this hotel room or run away.  I work away but have to go home in a few days and I can’t face that either.  I’m embarrassed, humiliated, shocked... I’m just completely knocked for six.  I can make lots of good excuses/reasons why it’s not fair etc (it’s not, BTW I’ve been completely fucked over) - but what I need advice about with is moving forward from here mentally - not how to go to war against the situation.

398,"Quick bio. I studied engineering for a bit at a state university but had some health issues and wasn't fit for the major.
Now I'm back home living with my parents while I study, work and try to get my own place again.

I get about $10 an hour, so it's barely above minimum wage. I work as a customer service/stocking person in a grocery store that sells a lot of specialty items and appeals to the older demographic. The problem is that, personally, I think I'm a pretty bad worker. But, I've gotten mostly positive feedback about my performance, and I need help identifying what is going on and why they haven't let me go or really even commented on my performance. 

So, when I was trying to get the job, I practiced a lot of interview questions and did a small amount of research on the company, which resulted in me interviewing well. Early on I was *super* scared because I had never had a job before and just had no clue what was going on, so as a result I tried really hard and did a pretty good job. Early on, they told me multiple times that I did a good job and they usually don't put people in my position right away (usually start people as cashiers).

Since then though, my productivity has probably gone down or stayed the same even though I *could* be very productive most likely. Basically, as I get better/smarter about my job but I do less and less because it takes so much out of me and I hate it. I do things like go to the bathroom extremely often to sit on the toilet and use my phone because I need a break. There is a bathroom in the backroom and I make sure to do *something* before I take a break so if anyone asks me I can explain what I've been doing. Also, I will do things like walk into the backroom and if nobody is around I will just go into the bathroom to give myself a break because I'm so bored/exhausted/dislike my job. 

If I didn't do this I think I would get a lot more work done, but I'm a pretty small guy so doing simple things like filling 24 packs of water and moving product around pallets is tiring for me, and also I have no interest in moving up because I hate working there so I just want to get by (the small satisfaction from getting more work done is thankless). I could probably work out and be less sore and more productive that way, but I'm too lazy I guess and don't want to start an exercise routine for my garbo job. Point is, I sit in the bathroom for a significant chunk of my worktime and nobody has said anything. 

On top of that, it's been 5 months and twice I've called in because I didn't want to go to work because sleep deprivation or something (made something up about being sick) and I've been late 3 or 4 times as well. Most of the time I'm there and on time, but I know that this is plenty to get people fired in a high turnover job. 

I guess I'm not totally useless. I never complain and I try to be polite with everyone and I'm quite good with customers I think. But as far as moving product I have to be like the slowest there... it only makes me guilty. I don't know why I'm guilty, because I don't even like my job, but that's just how I'm wired I guess. **I'm constantly in my head balancing and wondering if I deserve to keep my job**. 

My 1 and 3 month reviews were both positive, with the latter garnering me such praise as ""inventive cleaning techniques"" and apparently I'm one of the only ones to do a good job with the secret shopper (we have to go through customer service steps). 

The only negative feedback I get is from one of the managers. She is a new-hire like me but she is older and I think has prior experience because she instantly got promoted to manager after just a few months. When I got warned for being late she was like ""I like you, I don't wanna see you back in here"", meaning that she didn't want me to lose my job because I was late. Yet, she is the most annoying manager of all time and I feel like she tries to make things hell for me, while simultaneously trying to be nice and my friend. She's constantly checking up on me and has bad ideas about what to do, complains, etc. But she always rides me and double-checks all my work. Like I get that I sometimes half-ass things, but idk why it's *only her* that cares or ever points it out. I can't tell if she is singling me out for some reason or she is like that to everyone. 

Inb4 ""just quit your job"" or ""stop being lazy"". You're probably right but to me this makes no sense and I just want to know if it's normal to get conflicting signals from your work. 

tl;dr: I'm good at the customer service and logistical parts of my job, but I'm slow moving, unproductive with stocking, and spend time in the bathroom when I could be working because I'm lazy. I've even been late 3-4 times and called in sick twice and still have my job. Do they keep me because they don't care about moving product or what?",26Jun2018,1

401,"Or at least I and a couple other of her close friends think they’re out of their minds. To provide some context. I had sex with my girlfriend 5 days ago and unfortunately her parents went through our texts that night. The situation at her home is deteriorating by the days. Her phone is obviously taken away (shes communicating with me with one of her old phones). She cant hangout with any of her friends and with me for obvious reasons.

          Her parents have been verbally abusing her constantly (Calling her a slut and a whore) and they keep unlocking the door to her room every time she tries to create some sort of distance from all of the negative energy. She even has resorted to hiding in her closet which hasn’t really been working. I had apologized to her parents via iMessage, however I had thoughts of apologizing in person, but I had genuinely feared for my physical safety from her father so i decided to do whatever i could to at least show some sense of remorse towards my actions. 

          I can understand how frustrated and fearful her parents are due to the fact of my girlfriend’s birth occurring when her mother was only 14 years old. I understand that they wouldnt want the past to repeat itself. However, im not in anyway criticizing  their parenting, but there are more efficient means to solving this type of issue. Her parents actions have made me quite worrisome of her well-being. I was finally driven to make this post after i was informed that her parents are constantly telling her that “she was a mistake” or that “she’s been screwing up her parents lives.” Additionally, her father had nearly beaten her for talking back. I dont want to inform my parents of this matter due to the fact that im not allowed to be dating in the first place (I know, I’ve kind of put myself into this type of situation).

https://www.reddit.com/r/wemetonline/comments/8kj8vx/how_can_i_accept_rejection_and_just_move_on/

I am not going to repeat everything all over again, so just read one of the random post (mostly the first or the second) if you want a better idea.

So in May I decided to focus on my exams and not start any convo with this guy. I needed to distance myself a little since I developed feelings for him and he only considers me a friend.

Then he started randomly starting convos (by now I think he started convos like at least 4-6 times in a row in one way or another) but at the beginning I kept it short. I wanted to distance myself emotionally a little blah blah blah

He continued starting convos and he asked how my exams went etc, so I decided talk to him for a while.
After that he found excuses to start talking (like asking me about things he knows I am clueless about) or random questions, at the end we talked more frequently in the last two weeks. I started the convo only once as far as I can remember.

The issue is that I realize I still have feelings for him. When we didn't talk for a while I thought they were fading a little but it turns out it's not the case.

I am never sure when I can message him though since he is always busy so I wait for him to do and it makes me happy when he does. I feel giddy sometimes when I see a green dot near his name on Messenger.

He is usually online when here it's dinner time or really late (due to time zone), I check multiple times to see if he is on FB or not.

I restarted thinking about him like I did months ago. It's kinda obsessive and I also have MDD so it makes the whole thing worse.

A month and a half ago I considered stopping talking to him because I felt really depressed but right now I don't want to.


I crave his attention in particular and my depression/anxiety plays a huge role…

There's another guy I met on FB and he seems actually interested in me in that sense, he is nice and all and he told me he would like to meet me in real life one day (don't worry, I'm sure he isn't a creep) but it doesn't ease off the feelings for the first guy.


What can I do? I know this isn't healthy...I considered breaking off contact but idk if it would work out at all. I am not sure on how he would react and it wouldn't solve anything.

I don't really have a social life in real life so I don't have much of a choice...My daydreams are almost always about him.
 Considering how the situation nothing would really happen between us and he isn't interested in dating. (Please the posts above, everything is explained in there)

We started chatting on whatsapp.
What I found suspicious from the start,was she put she was in a relationship same day we started chatting.
I was like,wait,what?
Plus,she lives in Jordan,middle east.
I'm from Europe.
So far away.
I just liked talking to her,cause,she seemed sweet,caring,but as time passed I realized her bad sides.
She became so controlling,if I wouldn't respond same minute,she gettin mad,asking what I'm doing,am I chatting to other ""sluts"" as she said.
Once,she even blocked me cuz I didn't respond that same moment.
I tried everything not to make her mad or sad,sent her hearts,kisses,but in last month it became impossible.

She became depressed,told she is tired of her life,wants to sleep eternally.
Again,I supported her,try to cheer her up.
Started asking why I have few Facebook accounts.
I use,most of them for fun,nothing extraordinary.
But she got angry n mean,told me to kill myself.
I got full in that moment,blocked her.
She messaged me on fb,telling me ""don't let me sleep"",as in threatening that she will kill herself.
So,I unblocked her.
Yesterday,she wasn't responding all day long,she wasn't active since last night.
I was worried.
Today,she told me that she had an ""Accident happened"" to her yesterday.
Knowing how she can get,I asked what accident?
She didn't tell.
She told that she got another chance for life,and that she wanna give me another chance too.
She said she must lay for week.
Then,asked me to tell her truth.
Then,I opened myself.
I told her all,that I don't love her,that I appreciate her,but cant lie anymore and give her false hopes.
All of a sudden,she started acting mentally unstable,telling me ""my baby boy,you will remain my baby boy"".

Now,I am afraid that she might kill herself.
I mean,I can't even know what she could do.
I don't even know what she did yesterday,when that ""Accident happened"".
She is grown up,not teenager.
Plus,so far.
Please help me.
What to do about this?

409,"I'm 16, just finished school which included 4 whole weeks of exams. Obviously this is a stressful time for everyone and in the UK you're rewarded with an 11 week holiday. But in the first day of the holiday I got hit by a motorbike, fracturing my knee. Even though I have crutches I can't walk anywhere for longer than 2min without becoming exhausted, so I can't go outside. 

This is a major issue because I absolutely despise my family and always did everything I could to be away from them for as long as possible. Both my step mum and dad are narcissistics and don't support me whatsoever. If there's a problem they just come at me with anger instead of actually trying to get to the bottom of what's wrong. 

I have literally no friends because I lost them all right before summer (my own choice) I didn't think this was a big deal because I could easily go out more often and make new connections which I can't do anymore due to me being bedridden. I'm extremely lonely; the only person who talks to me is my boyfriend. 

I had my contraceptive implant put in about a month and a half ago which caused me to become so emotional I despise it. I'm beginning to hate myself because of how I'm acting and how much I'm crying (I used to be more on the emotionless side before so I have no idea how to deal with this).

Also I have tokophobia (fear of pregnancy) which doesn't really help when I've missed almost 2 periods in a row now (I know it's normal to not get your period on the implant, but the paranoia still stands.) I can't even get a pregnancy test to calm myself down because I can't walk. 

I have literally can't think of a way to relive all of this stress and I feel that my summer is completely ruined because of my fucking knee. I was planning on finding some new hobbies during the summer but I literally can't do anything now except from cry.

410,"Hello everyone. Before I start, I want to say that I’ve always been the kind of guy who says things like “I rule my own life” and “I’ll never get myself in a situation where I’m desparately asking for advice or help”. Well, here I am. 

Last year I was a high-school graduate, pondering on many different uni choices. As I’ve always been an excellent student, I had the privilege of choice (even though I never really studied much). So I went with science, namely, molecular biology. First impressions: great colleagues, good professors, balanced matter. There will surely be room for a social life. And everything looked well at the time.

I didn’t start very well. I underestimated the matter, failed the first exam. Soon, I failed the second exam. Obviously, I was doing something wrong. I went on, said to myself “don’t worry, it’s no big deal”. 

Couple of months later, at the end of the first semester, I came down with my first crisis. At that point many of my colleagues were already done with some of the courses. I failed another exam. And I felt really bad. 

With the start of the second semester, I told myself to start studying properly - no more slacking. And I did study properly for a couple of weeks. And then I fell into the same decaying routine I was in through the whole first semester. 

A couple of weeks ago, summer exam term started. Once again, I organized my time poorly. I passed the written part of an exam, though it wasn’t very impressive. I took four days off (I had time for none) and I’ve gotten myself in the same situation again. I feel extreme pressure coming from my parents and my peers (I’m not very competitive, but I feel very bad when I perform under my abilities) and at this point I just feel like giving up. 

I was raised in an environment where children feel forced to go to uni (hence the pressure from my parents and peers), but I sort of feel like I’m not the type of person to go to uni. Although I like learning all sorts of different stuff, I don’t like studying very much and even the best-case scenario of me finishing my courses doesn’t look very appealing to me. I haven’t felt genuinely happy for a year now.

One of the sources of my underwhelming performance, I believe, is the lifestyle I’ve been conducting. I live in a financially stabile family with very solid income, a good house in a good neighborhood and loving parents (sometimes too loving mother). I never really had to go through any of the hassles many young people have to. I never had to cook, never had to take care of anyone, worry if I’ll be able to afford anything. I just did simple chores around the house. That’s what I think screwed me and my perception of an individual life.

I am now standing at a crossroad where I see three options:
1. Continue with my studies, conceal the emotions, do my best to finish what I started even if I don’t think I’ll be happy at the end.
2. Drop out, find a minimum wage job and move out.
3. Take a year to recollect my thoughts. Take up a new hobby and try to find things that make me happy. Maybe travel around for some time.

The third option looks most appealing, but with the parents’ expectations it seems rather unreasonable. 

I have all the conditions to excel, yet I am extremely unhappy.

I would be very thankful to anyone who offers the tiniest piece of advice or anyone who shares their story or opinion.

However,  when I get stressed out or depressed I take my frustrations out on people.  Which happened today.. So for the last couple of months My friend and I had a internship with the Union in Utah. However I found out the internship was cancelled, and the people gave my friend a full time job starting Monday.  I was disappointed and slightly furious. For months I was told the internship is still going to happened, and then this happened. I'm not going to lie and say I am not jealous of my friend.  I wanted to join the Union so bad in Utah and now I'm not sure I still can.  My instructor told me I can still join the Union in Utah,  I just need to wait a little. Personally,  I'm thinking about getting a construction laborer job for a construction company in Salt lake City.  The reason why I didn't get a job offered with the Union is because I don't have a vehicle at the moment.  The problem with that is,  the Union offer car loans to new employees if they don't have a vehicle.. Honestly my instructor told me I can still join the Union, but how the way I feel right now It's not worth it. I'm always disappointed enough.  I don't won't to get my hopes up again for something that might not happen. This is why I always expect the worst in everything. I am tired of thinking positive and trying your best, and in the end it  leads to disappointment or stress.  Even if I did get the job I honestly believe I will get fired.  As a operator I suck.  I'm always making mistakes.  Big or small it doesn't matter.  It's not like I'm doing these mistakes on purpose,  I honestly try my best. My instructor told me I don't suck,  but honestly I think he saying that to be nice. All my coworkers catch on to the machines naturally.  While me on the other hand have a hard time doing a good looking trench . When my coworkers tell me I'm a good operator,  I think it's bullshit.  No matter how serious I take my job ,I will always be terrible to naturally gifted operator's. I'm honestly at the point in my life where I want to let things be and watch my life fold out naturally.. Everytime I try to control my life it leads to disappointment, major depression, and stress.  I'm am ready to give up.  I came to this subreddit so I can get some wisdom and life advice.  I'm am 20 years old,  and I feel like I already ruined my life.  Once again I'm not looking for pity or attention.  Just life advice.  Including,  do any of you guys work in construction?

415,"I am 16 years old, in Ireland and my parents, naturally, are Catholic. I don't really care for the group itself and generally I don't really care what people believe in, and I was indoctrinated into the religion when I was young, as is the norm for Christianity. Since 2016 I've been trying to educate myself on what *I* want for my religion, and I eventually came upon the conclusion that I can't really believe in anything. I'm atheist! Although I suppose agnostic would be a better suiting term.

Some background on my parents: My mam is VERY religious, and despite me not believing in Christianity, when I was terminally ill a few months back she chose alt-medicine over real medicine, this doesn't mean that I didn't get medicine, just that she focused more on alternative. I hated this, she would always tell me that  *I had to ***believe*** or it wouldn't work*, for the record I didn't believe, and despised that phrase, because IMO you can't believe in what you don't believe in. My dad is just pure religious, but doesn't go over the top, it influences his morals, but he doesn't do things ""for god"" explicitly.

Anyway, before this week, I had to lie to my parents face about my beliefs, but today it slipped, I was making a little bit of a goofy meme on FireAlpaca for some of the lads on discord, and it contained Padre Pio, the context doesn't matter but it had a gay flag, [set on the multiply setting over a picture of Pio.](https://imgur.com/a/ygrD19Y) Anyway, my mom saw this, and she went on a rant about how he was a holy man, and that they prayed to them for me. Things got out of hand real quick, she asked why I didn't give him any respect after he *healed me*, and then I couldn't contain it any more, I blew out that I didn't believe in him, they asked ""Why don't you believe?"" and then I asked, ""Why don't you believe in atheism if it's choice to believe"" after making that argument, I was fuming at this stage. 
Then I gave the burden of proof argument, then they said the whole ""But what if your wrong"" so I just said that if I believe in christianity and I am wrong and if there's a christianity-esque god existant and if that god has a first commandment-esque command I would be fucked, the first commandment being, ""Put no other god's before me"", then they gave the ""Everything's intelligently designed"" to which I said ""If everything's intellignetly designed why isn't god, the most intellectual designer, intellignetly designed"" and everyone was mad, at the end my mother burst into tears, I really didn't want this to happen but it did. She made the excuse that she had to go up to bed. Before this however, she gave this line.

416,"My question: what could law enforcement do in this situation? My friend is 17; i’m gonna call her jenny; and lives with her mom and her moms boyfriend- the owner of the house. Her mom is often super drunk and starts fights with anyone she can. Jenny is usually the target to her nastiness while she drinks. 
A few nights ago the mom was drunk and yelling and her bf and Jenny. She intercepted and told her mom to stop which caused her mom to be very angry. She called jenny a cunt and yelled at her, and threatened to hit her. Clearly this made Jenny super upset so this is when she started texting me. Mom and boyfriend started threatening to hurt jenny’s cat which made the situation really worse because of how much jenny cares about that cat. 
It became too much to handle so Jenny called the local police. They showed up and apparently told her that she 1. couldn’t go anywhere because she’d be considered a runaway 2. had to listen to her mom because there was nothing else she could do without getting into trouble. Her mom and moms bf were very angry at her for calling the police so they took her phone and cut the charging cord, possibly breaking the phone as well. 
I’m very very worried about her safety because her mom is known for drunken violence in the past. Jenny is also known for having intense suicidal thoughts and behavior and self harm. Jenny is completely isolated from anyone other than her mom and moms bf with no internet, phone, etc, and 5 miles outside any city. I have no idea if she’s okay and i’m wondering if there is anything local law enforcement can do to help her. And even if you don’t have an answer to that, any advice is welcomed and much needed!

I'm a generally smart kid, I have a lot of experience in engineering and technical fields. I was Valedictorian of a class of 550 and my ACT score is a 34/36.  But the problem is I'm not very approachable (resting bitch face), and I'm not physically strong at all. This means I'm not good for customer service or mindless labor jobs. Fast food is a definite no-go. There's also the problem that I can't work full time, so it rules out a lot of good trade jobs I could do.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation and found a good job? I'd like to use my brain at my job but I haven't found anything good whatsoever.",26Jun2018,1

424,"This is a long one, so buckle up. First of all, I (19F), admit that I am disappointed in myself lately. I’ve been roaming and existing on a primary level and I have abandoned everything that once held meaning or a permanent place in my life. At one point I valued long-lasting interactions not based purely on sexual or superficial gain, I had a family I could travel and spend time with as opposed to constantly bicker with, and my passions such as writing and photography which flourished and were not put on the back-burner. I want something, but I don’t know what exactly. I barely recognize myself anymore and I feel sad more-so than happy. The constant pressure from people around me and my family to keep up the image of the “good girl” who is very studious, never home late, and proudly wears a shiny chastity belt is finally getting to me. I cannot be who they want me to be, and neither do I want to. Of course, I do what I should and I work hard in Uni and I continue with my fitness program and the like, but I have changed as a person on a fundamental level. I no longer crave committed relationships like I once did because I’ve learned that loving someone (and I mean truly loving and investing in them) leads to unimaginable pain and loss and I cannot go through with it again. I now find myself in a friend with benefits scenario with a guy (20M) my narcissistic mother (another tale for a different time) does not approve of, yet I feel good about the whole thing and would much rather accept the current state of our interactions than live in la-la land and pretend he wants commitment and get myself wrapped up in such falsity (or lose him in doing so). The sadness, however, stems from something deeper within myself that I have not touched root with. Deep down I do want to have a functioning relationship, make my family proud, and continue with my hobbies, but there is a side of me I have discovered that has taken over. Don’t get me wrong, I am not out all night banging random men or doing drugs or drinking. In fact, I do not drink alcohol at all, I have never been to a party or had many casual encounters, and I have never done any drugs recreationally. This is what upsets me the most… I am inherently the “good daughter” and girl I am portrayed by my family, but this idea of perfection has destroyed my relationship with them because let’s face it, nobody is 100&amp;#37; spotless in their actions or image. A while ago I decided to have my first hookup with a guy who was decent enough and it did not go as expected since the condom broke and I had to take plan b. However, I did have a good time despite the incident. Later on I carried had my second hookup (however I was truly interested in this guy and thought he was into me too for more than just physical reasons) but he ended all communication afterwards. The pain from that lead me to quit the cycle and to search for something more meaningful. However, in a conservative family with an overbearing mother, I was guilted into admitting what I did and this changed her view on me forever. She began to count to me (out loud) on her fingers how many men I have slept with \*please note many of which I was dating at some point or another\*, and even though now the total is lower than most people nowadays (less than 10), she still shames me and tells me I am a disappointing child and that she is shocked I would express my sexuality so “freely”. The pain of this only leads me back into the arms of my friends with benefits, someone I get along with and actually do things with as opposed to just sex. But I am hurt that this image of an un-classy, tainted whore is what my mother sees when she thinks of me now. Apart from my sexual life, my grades are excellent and I keep up with my studies, I hit new PR’s in the gym, and I have fantastic friends who care about me. Why the hell am I so upset then? Why do I feel like my life is falling apart and my insides are being torn from me? Why do I feel like such a disappointment? I had a moment not too far ago when I took a kitchen knife to my arm and made a few dull marks on my skin. The feeling was almost liberating, and sometimes I wish I had gone through with it. When my mother found out she broke down and asked me how I could even fathom “taking myself away from her” or destroying our family, and I felt a smirk creep up on my face as I thought “good riddance. Maybe I could finally be free from your judgement and torment for once”. A part of me wishes she wasn’t around, but growing up attached to her hip has made me dependent on her emotionally and I am constantly oversharing my private life despite knowing it will only backfire on me. Sometimes I don’t even have to tell her, she can just look at me and know. The funny thing is, I am a smart girl… I am double majoring in Psychology and Neuroscience and have lots of insight into the human thought process and various behaviours (and their corresponding neuronal activities) but when it comes to my own thoughts and feelings, I don’t know any better. This sadness has made me feel like no matter what I achieve, my future will be bleak because I do not have a great relationship with the one person who is supposed to prime me for hardship and support me no matter what. Her judgements about my sexuality have lead me to contemplate suicide once more because I know that my “experimentations” (the hookup incidents and also my bisexuality which I told her about this year) have ruined any good she once thought of me. I’m at a loss, and I really hope someone can help me. I can’t even come to terms with my past because she keeps reminding me of it. This pain has carried over and has made me so upset I have stopped doing the things I once loved. Is sex really that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things and do the archaic stereotypes of the sexual woman still apply today? Or am I just unlucky to have a crazy mother?

426,"A friend of mines has been sick, coughing up blood and not getting much sleep. They're taking like 6 different cough medicines and said none of them are working. 

They said they haven't gone to the doctor's because they lack insurance. The thing is, we're in Ontario and they never got OHIP when the moved from another province. So I insisted that they go get OHIP, sent them a link to the service Ontario website discussing OHIP. They told me they're ""too busy"" so I went, checked and sent them the relevant Ontario labour law regarding personal emergency leave and that you're paid for 2 days leave. 

Anyways they seem put off that I would go through all this ""work""/googling to make sure they get the proper care. In the end they're just going to their pharmacist tomorrow and speak to them but I keep insisting they need to see a doctor. 

I'm really just concerned that they're not taking this seriously, but maybe I'm taking it too seriously. Am I out of line?",26Jun2018,3
