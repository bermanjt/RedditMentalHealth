0,"Ok so this was 2 days ago, so the memories a little foggy but here we go (I’m 17)

So in the dream I was on a school camp, choir camp to be exact, and we were at liek this super cool spot like a kinda fiji resort except without the beaches and a bit darker, and a pool table was there. Anyways so I’m walking up to my cabin, and I see one of my friends younger brothers holding a saw with blood on it lying on the stairs behind me, and he tells me he just killed someone, then I talk to him like saying it’s ok, coz I’m scared and I walk towards him to try take away the saw before he does anything stupid, then next thing he starts hitting me with the blades of the saw and it chops my fingers off, then I’m like what was that for, and I can’t remember what the reason was but I remember thinking, oh that’s fair enough, then I ran off

Sorry for long post but does anyone have any idea if this means anything??

Thank you",05May2018,0
1,"I’m in high school and there’s this really nice girl who goes to the same school as me, she is one year older than me and we have one class together. We follow each other on Instagram and briefly talked a few times in person but nothing to big. I would like to ask her out before the school year ends, it’s hard to ask in person not because I’m scared, but there always seems to be with a friend. So should I message her? And what should I say?",05May2018,1
3,"I have a 9 year old daughter, 6 year old daughter and an almost 2 year old son.

My 6 year year old daughter I have no emotional attachment to. It’s almost as if she’s not even my child even though I gave birth to her.

I was in an extremely abusive relationship with her father to the point where I was given anti-psychotic medication and was hospitalized for physical abuse once and mental abuse twice. 

I can’t even remember anything about when she was an infant and I’m sure I was going through PPD now that I look back on it.

Her father put me through hell to the point where I mentally broke down and had to be hospitalized for 4 days with something called “conversion disorder” because I was under so much mental stress that it converted into physical symptoms where I could no longer speak or even walk anymore.


This was 3 years ago and I still feel disconnected from my daughter and I love her with all my heart and I don’t know how I can fix this and I need advice",05May2018,1
4,"I haven't had this issue since summer of last year. Admittedly I had too much stuff plugged in, causing the breaker to pop. But once I figured it out it's been fine. For the last few months it's never had a problem. I'm running the same stuff as before. Now today, turning on the exact same stuff, the breaker keeps popping. Nothing has changed in my setup. Anyone familiar with this?

If it helps, the breaker that's popping is the same breaker for both bedrooms, they split the amperage between the two rooms.",05May2018,1
5,"So my wife first noticed this because she works at home. But a series of vehicles will park in an exact spot (across the road and maybe 30 feet to the right of our house) and will stay there all day and sometimes most of the night. It's usually two people that sit in the vehicle sometimes on there phone doing nothing (I noticed a guy jump in the back once), the windows are always all blacked out, they will stay for 4 to 6 hours and then leave and in less than 30 minutes another vehicle will show up doing the same thing, it's sometimes the same rotation of vehicles but every now and then a different one will be there.

This has been going on for almost two months now, I live in a very safe city and even safer family neighboorhood. So is this the cops? should I confront them?",05May2018,1
6,"Sometimes I will go to different porn\-related subreddits, pretty mild typical porn stuff.  I luckily have never seen anything really disturbing.  But there have been a few times where I can't really tell the age of the girls, and someone in the comments will be like ""she looks underage"".  When I see this, I get a pit of anxiety in my stomach and just leave the page.   But like, what am I supposed to do?  Should I just not watch porn on reddit, since there is no way of knowing that it is all legal?  Or is it just not a big deal and just move on and don't look into it?  I'm just paranoid like what if they intentionally put those pictures on there of like 17 year olds and then track everyones IP who sees it and then busts in your door and you go to jail for child porn and everyone thinks your a predator.

7,"Back story: I have this friend I met when I was in 6th grade and we got pretty close sophomore year of high school. We would spend pretty much every day together. Hanging out during lunch, walking around after school, go to each other's houses, etc. Anyways, she would always make comments about how my other friends were stupid and about how they're not good friends to me, which doesn't really mean much, she was probably just looking out for me. So one day she tells me that her family made some comment about how I would eventually abandon her and stop being her friend. After that she started to get more annoyed with me going out with other friends. Now, we're in college and (I don't drive) she gives me rides to school even though she has class 2 hours later (I have another ride I could take that has class at the same time). I keep telling her she doesn't have to but she insists. One day I told her I was getting a ride from another friend and she said ""you're taking my time with you away from me"" and then we were walking together to her car and she said something about ""I cherish these walks with you even though I know you don't"" I don't know man, she just keeps doing and saying things that are really concerning and annoying. It's like she expects perfection from me and when I do anything less she gets super weird about it. Like if I don't text her back right away she'll spam me or try to guilt trip me. It's just too much. And our friend group has parted ways (we still all care for each other but have our own lives) and I think that could be why she's being so possessive of me? How do I get her to stop? ",05May2018,2
8,"So let’s start with a disclaimer. I don’t write this post to get medical advice, I would however like advice on how to start living again after getting better from my illness. I realized some time back that my mind had been slowly deteriorating these last few years. It started out so innocently and then it got slowly worse. I suspected people of talking behind my back. I suspected them of plotting against me. I quit my hobbies. I dropped my friends. I thought they all had betrayed me. I barely trusted any family. I was sure there was a conspiracy against me. Then I had a breakdown and had to leave work. I didn’t know what was real anymore. I shut myself inside for weeks and was terrified to leave my house. And then it slowly turned. I am much better now. I realize when my thoughts are wrong. I am happier and getting treatment. I no longer fear people. But I am lonely and fearful of going back to work after the whole debacle. How do I rebuild my life again after this? ",05May2018,1
9,"I have always lived my life preparing for the next moment. I am 24 years old, I make almost six figures, and I have a lot in my savings. I'm adventurous in terms of vacations - I've gone abroad 4 times in the last year and travel frequently. 

However, I always have that anchor at home - simple home life with a secure high-paying job that wouldn't fire me even if I decided to stop coming to work for 2 weeks in a row. 

Recently my girlfriend (who is just finishing up college) has expressed how she wants to go out and explore. Not just in a vacationing way, but really soak up new locations, even abroad. 

I'm not comfortable with quitting my job, destroying everything I built in life, and moving to a different country and go wild. She's got an incredible support network - her parents are very wealthy and I pay for most of her stuff. Her major won't really permit her to be as free as she wants to be - she won't end up making much money. But my point is - I don't have a support network. Her parents aren't going to pay for my expenses. When we come back to the USA to start a real family I am not gonna be able to get my old job back. I can't find good opportunities in the countries she wants to go to - I can't even speak their language. 

But then I think to myself. Why am I so settled? Why can't I pack everything up and start anew? I don't mind starting over within the USA, because my work experience and language will carry over. But in foreign countries where I can't speak their language? Asian countries where work/life balance is extremely difficult? Where my work experience won't count for much? 

I don't even know what to do there. And the worst part is, if we go somewhere, I'm the one who will end up planning all of it. I don't even know what to do anymore. Move across the US? Fine. Move across the world? Not comfortable with it. But why not?",05May2018,0
10,"* obviously self harm trigger warning
This is my first ever post on reddit I am sincerely  sorry if I did anything wrong or broke any rules

       I am a kitchen manager, today one of my employees got upset and self harmed while on shift at work. I want to deal with this situation with compassion, understanding, and empathy but to be completely honest, I was not prepared to be put in a situation like this. Of course, her mental health and safety are the most important thing. 
      Starting from the beginning, this morning when my employee, lets call her Rachel, came into work she informed me that she had interviewed for another job and was considering leaving. This is a little disappointing as I’ve spent the last 6 months training her to be my #2. I had hoped that maybe she could take my place someday if I get the opportunity to move up higher through my job. Although inconvenient, these things happen and I told her there would be no hard feelings. She then began gushing about this new job and all its opportunities which frankly made me feel very awkward. I wanted to support her growth but honestly I didn’t want to hear about how great her new job would be, that’s sort of inconsiderate to me. 
        About an hour into her shift, I look over and realize Rachel is sobbing uncontrollably. I ask her what’s wrong and she tells me she just got the call that she was denied the job. I told her to go take a break to try to calm down, expecting her to be gone a few minutes. I’m sort of surprised by all of this, since before today she had never even mentioned considering other jobs. Rachel didn’t return to work for about 45 minutes, and when she did she was still sobbing and she had cuts on her arm. I first asked if she was alright, and then suggested she go home because I didn’t think it was safe for her to be on shift anymore. 
      I’ve been a food service manager for about six months, I’m still learning how to be the best boss I can be. This situation is something I never expected to be in. Rachel didn’t want to leave work because she said she didn’t want to lose her hours. This is when I start to get upset myself, the blood and knowledge of what she had just done was scary to me, I think I was mildly in shock. I leave her to clean her arm while I call MY boss for advice. My boss tells me not to send Rachel home because Rachel could potentially hurt herself more there. My boss then comes into the kitchen to check on Rachel, they decide to send Rachel on a coffee run for everyone so that she can calm down and when she comes back she wants to continue her shift like nothing happened. I felt uncomfortable with this, in my eyes Rachel is now a liability and keeping her on shift makes me feel like I need to supervise her every move. 
        My boss doesn’t want to take any action from this situation, she wants to go on like it never happened. I am shocked by this, I honestly would of thought that some kind of repercussion would be mandatory. I would of thought maybe Rachel would be required to have some kind of psych evaluation to be able to continue to work. She purposely hurt herself at WORK after all. I’m not trying to be insensitive, I don’t want Rachel to be more upset but I think there is a huge question for her being safe to continue to work shifts alone. I expressed my concern to my boss but by this point the matter had passed. Everyone seemed to want to go back to normal. I spent the rest of the day checking in on Rachel making sure she seemed alright and she did, but I’m still upset by this entire situation and I feel unnerved that everyone else seems to be okay with pretending this never happened. 

Should I just drop it? Should I go above my boss? Should I continue to check on Rachel or should I respect her privacy and pretend it never happened? Should she be reprimanded or even possibly fired for violating safety rules at work? Should I try to contact someone Rachel knows like a family member to make sure someone is is aware of her self harming? What if she was suicidal and I did nothing to help her? What if I report her and she gets fired? Am I overthinking ???? 

If anyone reads this, I am asking for any advice on how to deal with all this. I was reading about laws and I read that self harm could possibly be protected under the Americans with disabilities act. Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this as a manager? Or have any comments or experiences to share that may be relevant to what happened? Thank you in advance if you took the time to read his post ",05May2018,2

16,"First of all I'm not an incel, or a neckbeard, I believe women are people and should be treated equally. 

However a year ago I was in a pretty bad relationship. It was my first one and she gaslighted me, lied, and cheated on me. 

Ever since then I've just had a hard time with trusting women and ultimately going towards girls who have the same habits as her. 

Like I'm currently talking to a girl who's 22, four years older than me, and she obviously wants to have sex with me. I know this is unhealthy but I keep talking with her and I fear I might do it. 

I talked to an old friend a week ago and she's needy, a liar, and is far to invested in conversations, but I can't stop talking to her because honestly I just want to have sex with her.

18,"Hi Reddit! Throwaway account in case you're wondering. 

My mom told me tonight that she had an affair before I was born. In fact, right around 9 months before I was born. 

Right, bombshell. I'm not even mad. Actually I don't feel much of anything about this except curiosity. Perhaps that should be another discussion. After convincing her I wasn't pissed/disowning her/a furious ragemonster we went into more detail. She isn't 100% sure, but apparently my dad even thought he was infertile due to an unfortunate incident with a fence and gravity in his youth. The timing works out and she says I even look like this person. We did a little Google-fu and I was able to get a number to the company he runs. He's a strapping lad. 

Now before you grab your pitchforks, no worries: I have no interest in dropping in on this dudes doorstep and upsetting his family. Shit happens, and this shit happened LONG ago. My dad is still my dad, be that for better or worse. Besides a general sense of curiosity (I feel like the Scooby-Doo gang), the real reason I want to reach out is to find out if there are any medical issues I should be aware of (genetic dispositions, etc).

So Reddit, I stand before you with arms wide and sayeth, ""WTF?"" Do I have the right to intrude on this man's life? I have no need or want to bring myself into his family. But I do think I have the right to know about things I had no control over, like my genetics. Your thoughts?

Second question - Without involving either of the fatherly men in my life, are there any tests/medical documents I should look at? From what I understand, blood type might be an indicator but I haven't read much into it. I don't really want to bring this up with my dad at the very moment, until I have a better handle on it. 

Third question - How the crap do you start that conversation? Oh hey, I'd like to buy one of your products. Just kidding, I'm yer wee lad. 

Again, I have no interest in getting into this man's family life. If he wants to have a conversation, then for sure I would be interested in finding out who he is as a person (my dad and I are about as polar opposite as you can get). 

I appreciate your insight.

21,"I haven't seen the best friend I've ever had in person in almost a year now. We had a falling out, and I'm hoping there's still a chance that things between us can be fixed. Beware: this involves way more drama than I'm happy to admit. I'll try to give the long version and an adequate TL;DR at the bottom.

I'll call this friend A. A is female, I am male. I met A in elementary school, and we went to the same school through our senior year. As time went on, we had a lot of the same classes and similar interests. In high school, we started to get closer to each other. I would say that we became closest sometime around my junior year, but we stayed somewhat close through the end of our senior year. During our junior year, I dated a friend of hers. I will call this friend H. The relationship lasted about five months, from spring 2016 to the end of the summer. A didn't appear remotely bothered by this at the time. She even encouraged the relationship, giving advice to H and me. However, that relationship didn't really go anywhere. H and I broke up, but stayed on good terms. Throughout our senior year of high school, A seemed to become more distant to me. During our junior year, we would typically eat lunch together, do things outside of school somewhat often. However, throughout our senior year, she didn't talk to me or make plans with me as often. Furthermore, our conversations seemed different. I'm not sure exactly how to describe it, but she felt more distant. It seemed like she was eager to talk with friends like H, but she was often somewhat short-worded when speaking to me. That isn't to say we didn't get along; we just didn't get along as well.

At the end of the school year, she and I went to the beach with my family just to have a fun day. This was around June of last year, and the last time I talked to her. She felt particularly distant then, and it was enough that I texted her about it later. I was bothered by the fact that it seemed like she called me a best friend while acting distant. I interpreted her acting this way as just her preferring other friends like H over me. I got jealous. It was stupid, and I know it. When I texted her, I told her that it was okay if she preferred H over me. However, I asked A why she pretended like I mattered as much as H to her. She profusely apologized, and said that she had no idea it seemed like that. I tried to backtrack, because I realized that I had probably misunderstood the situation badly at that point. I clearly should have approached the problem differently even if my understanding was correct, instead of waiting until I was jealous and I felt resigned to a level below her other close friends. I pressed the matter, trying to understand why she seemed more distant with me, because I wanted us to be close like we used to be. 

Eventually, she said that she was romantically interested in me, but that she didn't want to date. She stated that she didn't think she was enough, and it was clear that she didn't think I was romantically interested in her. This was wrong; I was romantically interested in her. But, I can't blame her for getting the wrong idea at all. 

To begin with, we had agreed at multiple points to just remain friends. I agreed that we should remain friends, because the second I said otherwise I would have risked losing the status quo. If I said I was romantically interested, and she didn't, then that would have really made things awkward. I suspect she said we should remain friends for the same reason. Second, she flirted with me and expressed interest multiple times, but I was too stupid to pick up on it. I didn't understand the signs because I am not a very socially skilled person. 

She finished by saying something that crushed me. She said that she didn't want to stay in touch, because she didn't want to date or be my friend if we weren't dating. I said I'd be more than willing to date her, but she stated that she didn't think she was enough. She didn't view herself highly enough to date, in other words. It's worth noting she's had bad experiences with past boyfriends; particularly the most recent one who cheated on her. 

After that texted conversation, we went our seperate ways. I tried texting her in October. We made small talk briefly, and then I tried to apologize for what I said the last time we talked. She didn't reply to that message. She stayed in our hometown and is not going to college, as far as I know. I'm going to college pretty far away, but I'm returning home pretty regularly.

So, I have to ask. What do I do? She's still an important person to me, and I honestly miss her. I don't feel a need to date her or anything, I just miss being there for her and having her be there for me. I was thinking about trying to contact her once I'm back home after finals. How should I contact her, or should I try to mend things at all? Should I just try to let go? I don't want to bother her.

TL;DR: I haven't seen or talked to my closest friend in a very long time, because of drama regarding whether or not we should date. Should I try to contact her and fix things between us? If so, how? ",05May2018,1
22,"My temp job is ending in two months. I have a couple options. I live in a small town, so there aren't many jobs available in my field, but there is an AmeriCorps job I can do over summer that would be relevant and get me some experience, only it begins a month before my temp job ends. I was fine with this until my boss told me she would like me to stay on for another term. She could set me up long distance so I could move back home to my family (temp job is in a different city, AmeriCorps job is back home), and if I can wait for the processing to go through (possibly several months) she might even be able to promote me to a professional title. But I feel like it's a dead end, with little relevant experience to my dream job, and I'm not even sure why she thinks the project will last another 8 months (it's almost finished).

So, basically, I have 4 choices:
1. Go home, be unemployed until I find a job in my field
2. If AmeriCorps job is offered, take that, hope another job comes up by the time that ends. It will be low pay, but good experience
3. Ask my boss to make the position professional level, potentially take AmeriCorps job and start up the project again after. Timeline might not work out, I'd have to tell my boss I'm leaving before my time is up, and I would feel a commitment to a job I'm not into, BUT it would be guaranteed good money. Alternatively, just skip the AmeriCorps bit altogether and have no job for a few months. 
4. Ask my boss not to change the position level, stay through my term and continue on for another 8 months back home. Guaranteed job, decent pay, but also an 8 month commitment to something I don't want to do, that isn't advancing my career.

In one recent example, I wanted to start cycling to be healthier and for fun, and they have to mention someone they know who got into a biking accident and how it's dangerous, etc. I then said that driving is dangerous too but the rebuttal was that driving is generally more of a necessity when compared to biking, and by not biking you can minimize risk etc. I know I can be my own person and do what I want, but it's just the part of this being a buzzkill and killing my mood that annoys me.

I managed to get her up and she threw up a bunch of times and seemed okay.

27,"I feel so much like I fucked up my Life, even though I'm only 21. 

I didn't graduate high School and my grades were fucked. 
I'm incredibly bad at school and shit in general. My depression seems to get better but then I feel like shit for weeks on end, getting worse each time. 

I constantly think about killing myself. I know it wouldn't help anybody and it's only temporary problems, but it just feels so fucking hard. 
 I don't know how to even get started in the school aspect, I wanna get my GED but it feels hard to learn anything I don't entirely wanna learn about. I can't even take the GED test because I don't have a license. I failed my written test the first time and I haven't tried since. I felt like a retard when I failed that too. 

I know it's a lot of just self blaming and being harsh on myself. I Don't feel like I can build confidence. There's so much I wanna talk about, but I can't. It doesn't feel like it helps anymore to do it. 

Therapy has never worked. The pills didn't work. Marijuana only makes life harder because I can't get a job. Which means I can't pay for anything that helps me progress either. I have friends to help me out but then I worry about having to pay all of them back. 

I can't do anything, I feel so fucking stuck. 

I'm lonely, I'm scared. I just feel like I don't belong either. 

Yet the only comments I ever get for help is talk to a therapist. 

I've tried enrolling back into a program for school but got denied until sometime next year. Which just put off all my plan for this year. 

I don't know what to do.

Pretty sure I'm just gonna end up homeless on the street. I'm already homeless. 

Just not on the street yet.

I don't know anymore. Maybe suicide is the Answer? It just seems to hard to recover from here.


I can never be the things I wanna be or do the things I want now in life either.

I'll never be successful to a point where I don't have to worry about debt and bills. 

...
Maybe it's the end to my story, maybe that's yo dramatic. Either way. I feel empty broken and lost, I don't know if there is any fixing my life. Especially since I'm stuck in a city that's only meant for retirement or low income families. 

This might be my last time on Reddit. 

I guess a lot if this isn't really to ask advice, and that's probably breaking the rules. But I don't really have anybody to tell and i don't have any place to share me.

I told him ""go ahead, I'm a minor. Have fun with the cops""(wasn't actually a minor, just a scare tactic) 

I made the mistake of not saving the photo, so I can't image search it. Do you think he'd have the balls to post it somewhere? If so, what are the odds that this comes back to bite me in the ass?

This exchange was over kik btw.

Just have had this weight on my shoulders for a while and could use another opinion.

TLDR: if a nude w/ my face were posted of  without any ties to my name or any sort of social media, am I still at risk of someone finding them?

Also where might someone post something like that? 

Thanks",05May2018,1
30,"I started a new job about 6 weeks ago, and I was warned from the very beginning about one guy. He was fine for the first 4 weeks but in the last week it's been absolutely horrible.
Some put downs the guy has said included negatively commenting on my hairstyle when it wasn't down, telling me that the company's interview process was flawed because they hired me, telling me to ""gain weight"" because I was wearing layers inside, and him moaning and sighing because I was going to work drinks. All of this was done in front of my colleagues (which was quite humiliating), except the drinks part.
Advice much appreciated.",05May2018,1
31,"To give some background, I currently work in tech and am happy at my job, 

I recently had a recruiter reach out to me about a potential opportunity at another company for a similar role. I have gotten messages like this before and normally don’t reply. This one; however, seemed like a very good company and caught my eye. 

The recruiter has unfortunately been extremely unprofessional and non-responsive throughout the entire process. She stood me up for the first phone interview multiple times and didn’t really apologize, just said that they are hiring a lot so she’s been busy. Then I was passed on to an in person round, and it took her literally until 11:45 PM the night before to confirm it was actually on. 

I’m now at the final round, and have to prepare for a business case presentation on Monday to the head of the department. They gave me the materials to prepare today. It’s going to be hours of work over the weekend. 

I was supposed to have a prep call with her today to go through any questions I had. I called her at the designated time and she didn’t pick up. I texted her, saw she read my messages, and she didn’t respond. 

Over an hour later she calls and says “okay I have 10 minutes to prep you.” The call was supposed to be 30 minutes long. I told her okay, let me call you back in two minutes once I find a quiet spot. She says “I only have 10 minutes.”

Again, no apology whatsoever for standing me up. 

I have asked a few friends and family about this, a couple of them say that I should put my foot down and tell her enough is enough and I don’t want to continue. Some others are telling me that she isn’t necessarily indicative of the attitude or professionalism of the entire company. They say that I’ve made it this far already, and to still do the interview on Monday. 

I’m very divided. On the one hand I know that I’ve already put a lot of work in and it does seem like a cool opportunity. On the other hand I’m not sure I really buy that this isn’t indicative of a deeper issue with the company mentality. After all, she is one of the primary faces of their company, and I’m surprised they allow this to go on (or maybe just nobody has complained about it before)?

Any advice would be much appreciated!

32,"I have never leaned more toward the introverted or extroverted side- im right down the middle and really self contradictory.  On one hand, I love parties and being in big groups. On the other hand, I get socially exhausted pretty easily and like to spend time by myself recharging. I love meeting new people, but I usually don’t go to the extra mile to turn acquaintances into new, solid friendships. I’m great with strangers and very outgoing, but usually put a wall up once I start getting closer with people (not on purpose of course) and can’t connect with them on a deeper level because I sort of retract. I like being by myself but also get lonely easily.  

I think part of my problem is that I can’t be around just one person for too long at one time. Giving someone all of my attention is what feels so draining. I have 7 best friends but they aren’t all friends with each other. I would like to meet more people in my city this summer (a lot of my friends also left to go home after school ended).

Lately we haven’t been talking too much, but I want to be able to talk to her as much as I can, which can be hard. We share one out of 4 classes at school, so I basically have a class and lunch to be able to talk to her in person, since it might be awkward and hard to hang out with her after school. 

I was wondering for some tips to be able to talk to her more. Even though we’re going to prom, it just seems like she avoids talking to me and I have to get all the conversations going.

A male friend (25M) started flirting/sexting with me and we've hooked up several times. He is aware of the trauma I went through when I was 18 and the problems I have with orgasming. Today after some flirting (that he initiated) he told me he didn't want to have sex because he didn't want to be a disappointment.  I explained that I enjoy sex even if I do not get to orgasm. I do not get mad if he gets off and I don't. And I never have gotten mad at previous sexual partners for not getting me off.  I also explained that I can get off with men, it just takes some work.  (Also worthy to note that I have gotten off with him before but only a couple times) After explaining that he responds ""well it doesn't feel good for me"". Meaning that he doesn't like to have sex with someone who he cannot get to orgasm. This statement hurt a lot. I cannot help that I was sexually assaulted and I cannot help that the lasting effects are difficulty orgasming.  How do I get over the hurt of being told that people do not want to have sex with me because I'm broken? How do I fix the fact I'm so difficult to get off?

40,"ORIGINAL POST:
Listen, I'm all for teachers bonding with their students and messing around. But that's not the kind of ""unprofessional"" I'm talking about. My PE teacher is the kind of unprofessional that makes me and others uncomfortable and awkward. He's very sexist. For example, he has said that women can't drive and that all of them cry irrationally and expect you to read their minds. Those are three harmful stereotypes that I'm disgusted he would perpetuate, especially around 6th graders. He also enjoys insulting students. One of my friends, ""John"", is usually the victim. My teacher usually comments on how dumb, fat, or useless he is, through passive aggressive comments disguised as jokes. Most of which, the kids in my class feel compelled to laugh at. Though ""John"" acts like it doesn't bother him, we all know it does. Those insults have caused other students to join in on harassing him. Another comment that really got under my skin was about one of my long-time (male) childhood friends. He isn't in my class, thankfully, because he's very emotionally vulnerable (school has made him feel depressed). The teacher claimed my friend talks like, and is just about as smart as, Forrest Gump. And I'm pretty sure Forrest Gump wasn't written to sound or act like any genius. This teacher also acts like we're just there to vent, he's like those teachers from TV that never speak about the actual subject and are fairy inappropriate. All of which my teacher does. He spent and entire class (that was cut to 30 minutes from and assembly, but whatever.) talking about romance or whatever. He explained that 1) Cheating is okay as long as you're not engaged/married to them 2) That all women will friendzone you at some point (he's a real r/niceguys) and 3) You should be emotionally abusive and manipulative to your S.O. by not allowing them to have friends of the opposite gender if they're anything near attractive. Because insecurity is SO charming and there's no such thing as a platonic relationship between a boy and girl. He also likes to poke fun at two boys in my class that are close friends by implying that they're gay ALL THE TIME. He also likes to make fun of an overweight girl in my class. Whenever she says she's excited for a game, he usually gives her a face like, ""Really?"" Get it?? Because she's fat? Haha, he's soooo funny. She usually looks a little unsettled after he does that. Not only is he very rude, he also doesn't even do his job. Some days he will keep us in, when we're supposed to be out, because we were too loud or he's talking about the stuff above. He also laughs at kids that get injured, or boys that are outdone by girls.

So now, I'm at a bit of a loss. I really want to report him! Even though there's a promise of confidentiality from the principal, I know that my PE teacher would know because all the stuff he says is specific to my class. I know that much because my friends in his Tues. &amp; Thurs. classes don't get any of this. Also, I have a bit of a reputation of debating him on his sexist comments and peers can usually catch me talking about how unbelievable he is. Transferring out of his class is out of the question for me. As much as I hate him, I love PE and it's the only class I have with my friends that I can interact with them freely. And I can't transfer this late in the year without a reason, which I'm too scared to give. I really don't want to be persecuted by my fellow classmates, because I know some of them kinda like him and I'd just look like a wittle baby to them.

So please, I ask of you guys to give me some idea of what to do, or give me a reason/confidence to report him.

I am also a 17M in his senior year of high school.


I am constantly tired, like almost constantly. Even when I sleep well for a few days in a row, I get tired after a couple hours. It sucks. I swim almost everyday, and when I do I feel weak and tired, and have no desire to put in much if any effort at all while swimming despite my competitiveness as a person.

Also, sometimes when I take a deep breath I'll get a slight, dull pain around my heart/left chest area. To add on to this I tend to be really twitchy in the face (when talking to people usually) and sometimes other body parts randomly, and stress a lot about stuff, like a lot. Whether it be about school or life in general, I tend to worry far to much which I know is terrible for me. AP's are coming up, which has not helped the cause. Finally, and this has been as of recent and I am not sure if this in part is caused by allergies, but I've been having a massive headache, and have had pressure behind my eyes recently. Along with this, the area under my left eye tends to go numb occasionally throughout the day. It's odd, and I am not sure why it is doing that.

I tend to be a pretty healthy kid, minus the sleep deprivation (Which I am trying to fix), and I am not sure if these problems are caused from the consequences of pretty bad sleep deprivation, allergies, anxiety, or something worse? Should I get tested? Or what?

Thanks y'all. I don't tend to complain to much, but I've been a little worried with how I've felt lately.",05May2018,1

I just wanted to ask what I should do for my dad since I'm fifteen. He's just gone to sleep but I don't know what I should say or anything. His parents only told him an hour ago so it's fresh on everyone's minds. ",05May2018,1
47,"So let me first off say that I am not depressed. I have never been depressed before. I have a great social life, good grades, and have played sports my whole life, just like my two older brothers. I am 17, almost 18 and I am becoming more and more stressed with my mom and dad. My brothers went through the same thing i'm going through, but I feel like my experience is 10 times worse than what theirs were like. I feel safe and happy anywhere but in my own home.

Ever since the first day of preschool, my dad would ""discipline"" me when I didn't do something right. I would sit at the most feared and dreaded place in our house, the dinner table. My dad and I would sit for hours, and he would never help me on my homework, rather he would yell at me and hit me if I got the answer wrong. He would spit in my face, and pull me out of my chair and spank me if I didn't do as e told. He even swung a ruler at my face and broke one of the brackets on my braces once. This was his ""rigorous theoretical thinking and quasi mathematical inductive reasoning with creativity and practical concerns"" mindset, thinking since he is a Software Engineer that he is the smartest human being on the planet, and he makes the best decisions.

Fast forward to 5th grade, I would cry when I came home knowing that my dad would literally force me to do homework, but either way I would end up getting a real ass whooping. I tried to find reasons to avoid coming home, and I would try to persuade my friends to hang out with me so I wouldn't have to deal with the devil of a dad that I have. For many months, I would stay up till 2 am at the dinner table, only having finished a couple of problems on my homework, and you know what the best part is? My mom knew about this, and she rarely did much to prevent it. On the times that she did do something, they would argue and it ended up furthering the damage. 

Luckily, they got divorced when I was 11 but I live with my mom now. The only problem is that she is now threatening me that she will force me to live with him so he can ""straighten my attitude"". Ever since my experience with my dad, I have changed a lot, and I'm trying to improve my well being by myself, since I have a bad relationship with my parents. I just realized this tonight when I was sitting at a restaurant with my mom. I wonder why I am able to speak confidently around teachers, counselors, friends, even strangers on reddit, etc., but I cant around my own parents?  I wonder why I don't speak to my parents unless I'm comfortable \(rarely\)? Why does my heart beat start to race and why do I start to sweat when I tell my parents what they are doing wrong? I wonder why I never make eye contact with my parents when I speak to them? I wonder why I'm never able to speak up to my parents about a concern I have? Why is it that I am excited to see my brothers when they come home from college, but fear every time my parents come home from work? It's because I don't feel safe around them and I feel like they might become angry and hurt me if I don't do or say what they expect from me. For example, when your in the wild, you never want to look into the eyes of an animal such as an ape, as it might intimidate them and make them angry. This is how I feel with my parents. I let them become the upper hand so I don't feel in more danger than I already am, and I've played kiss\-ass my whole life and I have never had the courage to confront them about it. My parents don't respect any of my opinions and they think that their decisions are what's best for me, when from experience, they really aren't.

 I haven't called my dad in 6 months, and every time he calls me, I ignore it. Every time he talks to me, he judges me. He calls me lonely because he thinks that I have no friends. He unfairly compares me to my other brothers and says that I wont be as successful as them. He tells me that I'm a outcast because I don't have a girlfriend. I always tell him that I have one in mind but in reality, I dont give a fuck about girlfriends or part time jobs at subway or even sports, I have 70\+ years to work on them, I want to focus on my career right now god dammit. 

Im almost 18 now, and as bad as it sounds, I can't wait to move out of this hell hole I call home. My parents are trying to push me into things I don't want to do, such as forcing me into getting a part time job when my life is already stressful, or forcing me into a sport when I already have 6\+ hours of homework each night. They don't understand me, and I'm not willing to give them a second chance anymore. They have caused me too much hurt and I will not tolerate it anymore. My parents are toxic, and they are oblivious to the fact that the majority of their actions have caused me to hate them more and more everyday. Should I confront them about what they've caused in my life, or should I be quiet and just leave for college instead? ",05May2018,214
48,"Hey, so im an 18 yo guy and i really dont know what to do. When i was 14 i started having anxiety attacks atleast once a day. They were because i have a few learning disabilities like dyslexia and i was always slower then my classmates, everyone thought i was an idiot including teachers and my friends. There was a lot of other things contributing to the attacks and i think it all just got the better of me. Eventually the attacks got so bad i had to be taken out of school. My anxiety then developed to being afraid of leaving my house. Then i got depression which got to a point where some mornings i just couldn't find the will to get out of bed. I just wanted to die in my sleep. I did have one friend i could talk to and she really helped but unfortunately because of my problems we dont talk anymore. So this was all the same for two years until school was done. Because i couldnt attend lessons i only got one GCSE. After that i plucked up the courage to go to college. Unfortunatley my anxiety got the better of me again and i didnt finish the course. So since early last year i have just been in my house doing nothing. Because of my lack of excersise i now weigh 21 stone, before all this i was like 14 stone.

51,"TLDR: Live in a shitty off campus apartment with two random roommates who make life hell. Landlord/management refuses to handle them

So I live with my friend and two random roommates who were assigned to us. Let’s call them Jane and Becca. Both used to smoke weed 24/7 to the point where it became uncomfortable to breathe in the apartment. Apart from this, they were usually loud and screaming in our living room up until 4 in the morning. We’ve sent multiple emails and met with management so many times but the lady is always “super busy” and really not willing to help us. Our apartment has no security or anyone working the front desk after 6 pm so there’s no one to come stop them if they decide to go wild. B decides to move out randomly one day but before she does, she invites 2 friends over to hotbox our living room one last time and break glass while screaming. I call management up saying it’s an emergency. By the time 2 management people show up, they’ve hidden their bong and say that they can’t prove anything because no one actually saw them smoking weed. Management later tells me she feared for her safety because one of the girls was about to hit her. 

My friend and I leave the apartment every weekend to go back home. I come back last week to over 70 dollars worth of makeup in my bathroom thrown up on (we each have separate bathrooms). Management says they tried to hold both accountable, but J says she had nothing to do with it and B won’t respond to emails. Even though B moved all her belongings out, she still comes back occasionally to smoke and scream at her boyfriend through speakerphone. 


My question is: How do I hold these people accountable for what they do? I’m almost never home to witness what they do except when it’s late at night and I’m trying to go to bed. I’m worried about leaving my things in the apartment over the summer or losing my security deposit because these people might wreck things.

55,"Hello Everyone!

My name is Melissa and I’m here to offer the gospel of Jesus\-Christ. This may seem like a loaded gun for many as I’m sure that you have heard or perhaps even experienced disarming things about religion and Christianity. If you have been mistreated or judged by someone who used God’s name or their faith, I apologize on their behalf, this is not what the Gospel of Jesus\-Christ is. Forgive them.

I’m not here to talk about a religion, or some baseless cult. I am here to tell you about Jesus\-Christ, the son of God, who came to this earth as a meek and humble servant, to die for our \(mine, yours, theirs\) sins, and gives us abundant *and* eternal life. Jesus\-Christ is the Son of God, thus part of the Holy Trinity; God: The Father, God: The Son \(Jesus\), and God: The Holy Spirit, same Holy God, different functions. As you become a Christian, start reading the word, and become closer to God, not only will you understand these three functions, but they will be a living presence in your life and will manifest in different ways.

Life as a Christian can be challenging, despite what most may have you believed, you cannot buy or con your way to a miracle. Someone does not get more than you because they’re prayed more or behaved better, grace is an underserved gift. You are a miracle, a blessing that has been purposely put on this earth for God’s glory. Jesus does not care about your past, your mistakes, your family history, your illnesses, your criminal record, your sexual preferences, none of that. Jesus cares about you, his word says in *1 Peter 5:7 “Give all your worries and cares to God, for he cares about you.”* Once you become a believer, you are made righteous because Jesus carried the burdens of all our sins at the Christ. The devil, the word’s enemy, the evil prince of this world, has been battling for our souls since the beginning but he has lost that fight at the cross when Jesus died and resurrected. *\(Romans 5:18 Therefore, just as one trespass brought condemnation for all men, so also one act of righteousness brought justification and life for all men.\)* Jesus loves you, he’s waiting for you. If you are wondering if this message is for you, yes YOU who is starting to have doubt and coming up with the many reasons why you CAN’T become a Christian by accepting Jesus\-Christ or if you’re wondering if Jesus is even real, this is for YOU.

Now if you’re asking, what do I have to do? Well, easy. Recite this prayer, have faith, believe, and you will be saved.

“Father God, thank you for your sending your only begotten Son so I can have eternal life as stated in your Word. I am a sinner, forgive my sins Lord. I am accepting and believing today that Jesus is your Son, the Word made flesh who came to die for my sins, so I can have abundant and eternal life. My past has been erased and I am become a new creature. I am saved by grace! I pray in the name of Jesus. Amen!”

Welcome to God’s family! Congratulations on the most important and best decision you have ever made. What’s next you may be asking yourself? Well, start by reading the word of God. I will post a few links here that will help you, if you have a tangible Bible, you can use it too or you can buy one. Visit local Churches, then join one, and the rest is up to God.

58,"As the title states I am currently an exchange student in Taiwan, in my exchange program you attend school for a full school year and go back once its over.  I am 8 months into my exchange with going home in sight, however I am having trouble with my third host family.  My Chinese is basic enough to get simple concepts across but not good enough to explain actions or have in-depth discussion (I can tell you what I am doing, or how I am doing, but not explain why I did something or why something happened).  My third host father is a military man, strict with rules and has a rigid lifestyle.  This is not uncommon to me as in America my father is military himself.  I am aware of what the rules are in my home, but nothing I do seems good enough to please him.  I had little to no trouble with my first two host family's, but they understood enough English for me to be able to rectify a situation they didn't like or had trouble with.  In this host family however the language barrier combined with an unforgiving host makes my life much harder than it needs to be.  I feel like I am bending over backwards to try and satisfy his wishes, but when I comply with one thing I feel like I've made no progress.  When I do something correctly, or preform a task as I am told to preform it, I get 0 positive feedback, no emotion in his face, no positive reinforcement.  But when I make a single mistake he comes on me harsh and uncompromising.  What spurred me to write this post is that today he prepared me lunch, I ate and went to go do the dishes, carrying both of the plates to the sink and promptly started to finish them, as I am about to finish them to go back to the table to retrieve a pair of chopsticks and a plastic cup to recycle, he points them out to me before I finish as if I wasn't going to do them without his command.  After I do as I am told, he opens the translator app on his phone and types ""You are very impolite"".  I am unsure of how to proceed, I cannot properly explain my actions, and the father figure in Asia cannot be spoken to candidly, lest taken as a sign of disrespect.  As I am a human I make mistakes sometimes and it doesn't help that I can be forgetful.  Should I bite my tongue and bide my time till its over?  I cannot receive support from the organization I went on exchange with, as when they get involved they tend to be bias toward the hosts rather than the students.  Complaints about a living situation in the western world are taken at face value, and often tend to come with a solution or a way to have a conversation with both parties where they are on equal terms, but in Asia a complaint against a host, no matter how legitimate is taken as disrespectful. How do I get out of a situation where doing things right makes me neutral in his eyes, while doing things wrong is a grave misstep?  I don't need him to like me, I just need to not be scared to leave my room for fear of being reprimanded.  ",05May2018,1
59,"I have a 2016 Chevy that's being riddled with rodent damage, to the point where I've spent almost $1000\+ in repairs, but what's strange is the 2003 Chevy truck parked next to it, that hardly drives at all, is fine. No rodents care for that. They don't even care for the 1990 Lexus that hasn't been driven for over a year. No, what they're really into is the 2016.

What do you think of these situations? So I was walking out of the change rooms in PE and I had quite short shorts on cause I brought the wrong ones..anyway these 2 guys (Let's say Andrew and Pete)in my year,who never really speak to me just said 'hey darling' and I just said hey back all chirpy ignoring them cause they're probably just feeling confident and I dont want to ruin that. 

Anyway, yesterday on the bus Andrew was sitting in front of me and his friend was facing my way..anyway Andrew moved his head to the side so I was facing his friend, his friend said thanks bro and then I could literally feel his friend staring at me for the rest of the trip. Then that recess I was walking back from filling up water bottles and Andrews's friend from the bus incident and Kane (Andrews friend as well) said 'That's the girl on the bus' as I walked past.


 Then today in the canteen line Kane looked me up and down so much it was annoying. Like I do wear a shorter skirt but thats cause otherwise it's too long and uncomfortable.

Okay....NOW..In PE just this afternoon the teacher was telling us about the 100m sprint and Andrew stood right next to me, then he bent down and his hand brushed past my ass and his friend Pete chuckled. Then we just finished 100m sprint in which I failed cause I started laughing. Andrew and Pete said 'You did so good (My name)' 'good job' etc. Then I could just feel them looking at me the whole time. Then I was walking back from the oval, Cameron (annoying kid that Andrew was talking to) came up to me and started talking to me which is normal, anyway then Andrew and Pete yelled out ""Oi, are you guys dating"", I just walked ahead of Cameron a bit cause I don't like Cameron at all, and I don't want any rumours. Then I heard them say ""Are you on the pill?"" ""Are you a virgin""

Like what's all this mean?? All these dudes are in the same group btw. The thing is...I sorta have a crush on their friend who's a lot different, he told these dicks to stop when they were harassing me and he has just got a kinder nature. Any ideas on why they're doing these things? What should I do? We're all around the same age, they're around 15, I'm nearly 16. But we're in the same grade.

62,"May 1st was decision day-- I decided to go to UT Austin. It would be a few thousand a year/practically free, but the caveat is I would be undeclared. Trying to transfer into CS will be difficult and not even guaranteed as it is extremely competitive. I also had the option of University of San Francisco, a private school that costs about $30k a year ($18k with loans &amp; work study), where I got in for CS. I chose UT because it's more well known and I'll be debt free, but I'm sad that I won't be able to move to California, especially since I've lived in Austin my whole life. There's also University of Houston and UT Dallas, which I both got into for CS, but UH's CS program is lacking and UTD is known to have a depressing social scene. I'm not sure if I made the right decision... I'm not really sure what I'm trying to ask, but I guess I just wanted insight.

64,"Don’t know if this qualifies as personal or fitness but eh.

So I have this horrid habit of eating out. I usually study at Starbucks everyday so I get my daily cup of coffee there. However, in addition to Starbucks, I eat like no tomorrow at other places like panera bread or chick-fil-a. Moreover, I find myself buying really unhealthy items when I go grocery shopping.

To avoid this, sometimes I just buy solely granola bars and stuff to refrain from eating chips. But you know that isn’t a good diet either, I’m barely eating.

I’m turning 20 in a few weeks. I have no way to get a job (I still live with my parents they won’t let me) so I need to find alternative ways to save. I want to transfer far away for personal reasons and since it’s my decision, I’d rather not depend on my parents (plus they wouldn’t pay anyhow). Also, by the time I’m 20 I know my metabolism is going to slow down so I know I should at least have a better diet.

Used to have a gym membership but I canceled it since it was so expensive and I was just so self conscious going there without any prior experience. So, hopefully adapting a better diet will be a small step in the right direction and I can get back to the gym as well.

Bottom line, I’d just like to adapt a good diet to improve my health something inexpensive so that I can save a bit of money myself. ",05May2018,1
65,"Really just need someone to assess my situation. There's a TLDR at the bottom if needed

A couple of years ago I made a mistake. I met someone who I thought I could trust online(stupid me), and after some time we ended up exchanging heated photographs.

Initially all seemed fine, and then after a while he asked for one with my face in it saying he'd send the same back. I was struggling with my image at the time and wanted to be called beautiful, so I obliged (I understand this was dumb).

He threatened to share the images on my social media, although I hadn't used my real name and I also didn't have any form of social media at the time.

I told him ""go ahead, I'm a minor. Have fun with the cops""(wasn't actually a minor, just a scare tactic)

I made the mistake of not saving the photo, so I can't image search it. Do you think he'd have the balls to post it somewhere? If so, what are the odds that this comes back to bite me in the ass?

This exchange was over kik btw.

Just have had this weight on my shoulders for a while and could use another opinion.

TLDR: if a nude w/ my face were posted of without any ties to my name or any sort of social media, am I still at risk of someone finding them?

Also where might someone post something like that?

Almost every day they will all go out and smoke and I end up just coming along because my town is tiny and has nothing to do.

Thus, he moved to a friends house and everything was good up until he graduated. He left that house, started showing up late to work (eventually getting fired), stole alcohol from his aunts house and got kicked out there, and is now on a straight decline.

To make a long story short she is going through a divorce with her husband, and we started talking because I wanted to be there for her during it. Her and her ex were seperated for months before going through the divorce. 

Her and I both have kids from previous partners. Basically we started out as friends, and now the past few months we have been dating entirely exclusively.  We do everything someone with a title would do. We say goodnight, good morning, we sleep together. I make her dinner or she makes me dinner, everything. It's been like this for months and everything is absolutely perfect except for one thing. She says she is afraid to get a title. She says it's weird for her to go from being a wife for so long to a girlfriend. That it scares her because it makes it all real to her.

If we ever have a disagreement we simply discuss it and compromise. I absolutely trust her and I know she trusts me. Our company policy is we can't work together in the same office and be in a relationship without notifying a supervisor, but she got transfered today. She joked around that now that it wouldn't be breaking company policy we can be together. I asked her casually if now that she is transfered if we are going to be official or not. She said not exactly.

80,"So I’m a 12th grader in high school and I met this 10th grader over this year and we’ve gotten closer as the year has gone on. At first I only talked to him bc of a joke within my friend group about him (it wasn’t a bad joke and he laughed when we told him). Then we would always see each other in the hallways and I would just say what’s up or if we’re going in the same direction I would talk to him. It was mostly me making the conversation which is weird bc he talks a lot when with his friends but I thought he was just shy bc he didn’t know me well. Then as the year went on we saw each other more and he started talking a little more. Anyways my car was being repaired so I had to take the bus and I noticed he was on the bus and he asked why I didn’t drive and I told him, he then asked when I drive to school if he can get a ride. I said “sure” bc he only lived like a minute from my house and i was trying to be a nice guy. Anyways we would ride on the bus for a couple weeks and he would only sit next to me even if his friend told him to sit by him or if there was an open seat somewhere else he would still sit next to me. So we talked on the bus and it was again usually me creating conversation. Anyways we add each other on Snapchat and I only snapped him a couple times in the month. But then I start driving to school again and I always have to ask if he needs a ride. If he sees me in the hallway he won’t ask, it always has to be me. I gave him a ride to school everyday and he would have days where he talks a lot and days where he’s quiet and one time his sister (in my grade) said she could take him home but he still went with me. So I thought we were friends at that point and I asked if he wanted to start a streak bc I’m about to graduate and I wanna stay in contact bc he’s a cool kid and we go to the same gym. He said sure kinda hesitantly but I didn’t pay any mind to it. Anyways for a couple days I snap him and he would just send a picture of his face which I’m fine with. But he never snaps me first ever and he also ignored a question I asked him and just left me on read.

I don't know what it is, I suspect it's my age but we're all learning the exact same things and are at the exact same place, so my knowledge is the same as theirs. 

My work usually gets ignored to like for example, other students have had 2 jobs and worked late to earn enough money and they keep bragging about it. Whereas I've done the exact same thing, worked since I was 16, earned enough funds and have gained the same experience, but I get ignored or they just think that I haven't done it completely.

I’d just like to ask for some advice on how to not get myself down for days when I get rejected friendship wise. I’m 20 and I’ve moved to a new country and university recently (February), I’ve tried HARD to make friends. I have a group of acquaintances from university but no one I see on a regular basis. This weekend, my partner is away for a childhood friends birthday so I thought I’d take the opportunity to invite my study group over for dinner and drinks tonight. I posted an open invite in a group chat with 16 people, no one replied and I was ‘left on seen’. This has completely destroyed the confidence I have managed to muster to put myself out there (social anxiety) and I just don’t know where to go from here. My friends at home have hit that stage where it’s hard to keep in regular contact, my family isn’t close, majority of the people in my degree are fresh out of high school and I can’t rely on my boyfriend to be my only source of interaction. I feel completely isolated from people my age. I don’t have any hobbies apart from my chosen degree so joining a social group is tricky, I don’t work so I haven’t had the opportunity to meet people through that and I’m quite a shy person.

I used to be close to people who graduated last year, but I've kinda lost contact as they've moved on.  A few still live near by (as I'm near a major city) and one of them, who is the first friend I made here, someone I thought an extremely close friend, and probably the nicest guy I've ever met posted in a group that he would be at bar in our college town as he's moving to another city. I assumed it was an impromptu thing as he said it was just him and another guy who still goes to school here. But as I was about to head out, I noticed my friend posted a snapchat story with a whole bunch of people who know out at dinner and then bar hopping. I didn't even get an invite and I was closer to him than several of the people there. I felt like somebody punched me in the stomach. I've got a knot in my throat and I've finally realized I really have no friends left at all. Even this guy who sees the best is everyone, and I'm really not exaggerating, couldn't tolerate me anymore. 

There are a couple of problems here. The first, obviously, is how the fuck do I repair this (as this friendship means so much to me) and other friendships (if possible). I made mistakes that drove people away/partially things got blown out of proportion so maybe it isn't possible but I am aware I did a lot of wrong shit.

When I ask my friends what to do they say to get a hobby. But I don't really have any interests, or any interests that are helping. I've recently started working out, but this feeling is interfering with it. I get a really ""I can't"" and ""I need to stop"" feeling.

It's gone to the point where it's interfering with the relationships with my friends. They say I've become a clinical asshole, and they're right. I need help, something at least.",05May2018,1

My description is like:

&gt; Hello, we have deep cleaners coming in every two weeks, so we need help more with light cleaning, picking up &amp; organizing before my mother law comes into town this weekend.
2 Bed / 2 Bath apartment

I book it myself. (The way TR works you can book yourself based on the available tasker's available schedule / calendar). Then later that day or I guess whenever they get to it, I get notified that its been cancelled. I get a message like:

&gt; [name] can’t help with this task, please select a new Tasker

Other details:

- A one time task
- It’s fairly last minute (varies from a few hours to a few days)
- Their hourly rate is high, typically ~$50/hr

99,"hey guys.. I have feeling this will be a long post, I apologize in advance. 

my parents have never been parents, well they have but.. long story. my parents went from amazingly loving and supporting to cold and cruel from one day to the other. long story short, I was bullied in 3rd grade by my older brother. after a few months I grew the balls to tell my mom who at the time was my role model. she got on her knees so we'd be the same height, looked at me for a few seconds, and slapped me. she told me to never speak about my brother like that and to stop making up lies. according to her I was an attention hungry kid. in a few seconds my entire life changed. that fun and loving family I had and loved turned into a bunch of monsters. as time went by I stopped hanging out With them, I started to develop depression and social anxiety. later on I developed selective mutism too. I stopped caring about everything I didn't want to play or watch disney movies like other kids. my childhood had been stolen, so had my teen years. I grew up 100% alone. 

late high school senior year I noticed something was changing, I begun to be able to talk more and less anxiety. a year later here I am. I lost a couple of pounds fixed myself up and now whenever I see someone from HS they stare :) 

anyway, during the last year I've been trying to fix up my relationship with my family even though they don't deserve it. long story short I failed and I have no interest in trying anymore. my mother single handedly turned everyone I know against me. as the days go by she gets worse. 

every fucking day its the same shit. screaming yelling and insults coming from her. I have grown tired of her bullshit a couple years back but it wasn't nearly as bad as it currently is. she literally gets mad for everything. today guess what she got mad about.. nope? well she got mad because dad was showering and he didn't call her to wash his back.. my father kept yelling for her to come but she didn't hear.. I did I told her dad was calling her and she ignored me. so she got mad With dad for not washing his back then tried to use my brother to back her up but he said he heard him too so she got mad with my brother too.. 

this is the kind of bullshit I have to deal with every day. its not just that though. dad hates me for changing my name/lastname brother just hates me because he thinks im the one making mom mad for calling her on her bullshit sisters just follow along. im the bad guy in this family.

recently I've been seriously considering disappearing from this family. the original plan was to wait until I finish my community college but I feel like I can't take any more of this bull anymore. everything I do is wrong to them. fix your hair? you have identity problems. whiten your teeth? identity problems. you care about your appearance? you're gay. you like mustangs? you have identity problems. go to a gym? identity problems. im just fed up with all of this. 

my plan was to join the marines, ship to San Diego&amp; do my boot camp thing, get stationed outside of California preferably on the other side of the US. all of this without telling them what im up to. then as  the date gets closer get a new phone leave all my belonging where they are any bye. never seen from again. 

I don't know what to do anymore it seems like the military is my only option at this point but even with the military it might not be possible since I have some medical problems that might prevent me from doing so. other than that I cant move out since California housing prices r shit and min wage is also shit. I can't pick up and move to a different state since I would be charged out of state tuition on my college and California has better colleges. 

advice? tbh at this point im ready to just give up and go live under a bridge in New York. anything is better than this.",05May2018,2
100,"My mom is white and my biological dad is black, but he’s albino therefore I am white passing. I’ve asked a lot of people in my community if I’m just white or if I’m a white passing POC and they’ve all said I’m white since my skin is white and I’ve been raised by my white mom and step dad.

101,"From time to time, maybe once every couple weeks but lasting for a few days at a time, when I lay down to bed and the house is mostly silent besides a fan or whitenoise sounds (rain, waves, etc) I will hear random grunts that sound like someone trying to say something but it's super muffled. 

It happens just as I'm falling asleep, and gets louder and more clear every few minutes. Sounds like they're getting closer and closer, and ends up suddenly sounding like someone yelling into my ear, or a loud gasp right next to me (think someone coming out of the water for air after holding their breath for a long time).

We live in a house so it's not loud neighbors, and when it first started it scared the shit out of me several times, to the point of me bolting to turn on a light because I was sure there was someone there. Now I'm mostly used to it and actually kind of indulge the voice when it talks to try and hear what, if anything, it is saying. 

I don't feel like our house is haunted, as I'm the only one affected, though I have played with the thought that maybe I'm mildly schizophrenic, but don't want to talk to anyone about because of the label and stigma that go with it.

I also have times where I can't focus at all and it sounds like a din of voices in my head, bordering on TV static or a packed store around holiday times. Kind of like the sound of a crowd in a stadium. It ends up triggering a panic attack most times, though that is more rare.

Anybody have any thoughts or suggestions?",05May2018,3
102,"So long story short, I loved a girl(and I still do), but she's already in love with someone else. I told her how I felt about her. 

We had an argument last week, and she called me today to clear things out. But I just wanted to stay away from her, and I told her I need my space. We spoke for a long time, and then she asks me if I wanted to be friends or not. Because she clearly still wants to be friends with me. But I thought if I still remain as friends, it'll only hurt me more in the future. I'm still in pain because I just lost a very good person. 

I just want to know if I made the right decision by breaking the connection with her. I assume she might be crying, because she cares about me. But I can't set myself on fire to keep others warm.

Is anyone else the psycho? And I don’t mean psycho as in you’re a good person and a victim to some mental disease. Psycho as in you’re the perpetrator. You’re the shitty one.

Wants to see herself fail, wants to come after herself, has some WACK intentions, and thus, is a coward and scared of her own fucking shadow. I’m sick of the fucking panic attacks. Of seriously thinking that I’m gonna murder myself? like wtf is that???? My worldview is warped. I seriously can’t look people in the eye without freaking the fuck out. It’s like a mix of paranoia/disgust towards them.

Most of my other friends I would interact with on phone only which gets boring for both me and them because I want to actually see them in person but they live in another state or country so we just text only. I have many friends that can go months without contacting me if I don't contact them first and if we do contact each other its just in a text.

The interesting thing is that I remember many specific things that people said to me. Generally, it's hurtful stuff. I remember many exact things my dad said about how I'm this or that. Stuff to the effect of ""you're a piece of shit."" Okay, lovely.

But I barely remember my childhood. So many things that we did, I can't remember. My mom will talk about something that happened, or maybe my stepdad will, and everyone will remember it in detail; and I'll be standing there like ""wot."" Even family trips or events. It's sad.

116,"Really, how? 

Hear me out: I don't feel like I've been doing nothing. I've made lots of efforts. Not as much lately, admittedly; I guess I've become jaded. I have my stepdad to talk to and (sort of) my mom, but they work, and I'm in a relationship with someone who I really love - but we don't get to see each other as much as we'd like to. So I spend my free time alone.

I'm 18. I feel like it shouldn't be this hard. ""Get out more"", they say. Well, I have a job. I work at a grocery store and I have to interact with people throughout my shifts. I joke around with my coworkers, but that's it; it doesn't go anywhere. I started working recently, so maybe it takes time, but I dunno...I've had two jobs before and I didn't make any friends there, either. On my breaks I don't even hang out in the break room, I go outside because when I go to the break room everybody is just on their phones. 

I go do stuff...I go to the arcade a lot, but no luck there. So I just play games. The employees always talk to me/high five me/kid around, so that's nice, but we can't be friends outside of the arcade. I can't ask for their phone numbers, that would just be weird and would feel inappropriate. Most of them are 25+. 

I used to go to groups, like social groups/common interest stuff, but those were weird, too. They felt forced and awkward, plus it seemed like there were already hierarchies established. Blood ties. Histories. All that. I couldn't intrude upon that, so I noped out, because I wasn't included and I didn't feel welcome.

I even tried to take an art class, but it was full of 12 year olds. No thanks. Next time I shouldn't let my mom arrange things for me. 

I love to write. I'm done with Reddit writing communities - bad experiences. Also, /r/needafriend fuckin sucks, man. It's more like ""need a gf."" The classic line there is ""I prefer females to males, I just get along better with girls hahahaha."" Sorry man, I want frenz.

So, yeah. Is anyone in a similar boat? Or have you been in the past? A similar rowboat or kayak, maybe. How do you make friends? How do you meet people naturally without it feeling forced or awkward? How do you deal with sometimes feeling like you kinda hate almost everybody and only need a select few people and other times feeling starved for friendship?",05May2018,1

My situation is not good right now. I’m a junior in high school, and my family situation is messed up. My mom is an anti-vac and racist. She is an immigrant from her country as well as my dad. My dad is also racist and had a mental illness of his own. This isn’t solid because he hasn’t been diagnosed but his outbursts are obvious.  I also have a mental illness and tbf I believe I don’t have a strong mindset. 

A lot of times I do mess up and fight back and say mean things. That is my fault but it gets irritating with the nagging and screaming. 

The cycle is I have an episode ,grades go down, screaming ensues and then grades go even more down as I can’t put myself together to do the work.

It occasionally gets physical,ill also mention it’s because I have the mouth of a sailor but it isn’t really fair when they’re threatening to do shit to me. 

My older brother is strict but sort of nice or whatever. We had a giant family fight yesterday and he hit me twice and he’s more than a foot taller than me and weighs more than me. My mom knows I’m afraid of my dad and my brother so she provoke them and shows them my grade and then the “ I’m gonna fucking kill you” starts.  Then she panics because then they’re gonna hurt me an she can’t control them.

Tonight I couldn’t sleep in my room because of some other thing. I have a problem with my uncle because I find him weird and creepy and it’s whole other story but I’m wasn’t comfortable sleeping on the couch with him on the other one. I hate that my mom put him over me she always does.

I have a roof over my head among other things. They have good intentions but they execute it so poorly. 

My solutions are to study 3-9 at a neighbors house who goes to our church and avoid them. I really wanted to move in with my aunt in another state but they kept saying that they wouldn’t let me but before they said they would and changed their mind. I think it might still happen. My counselor heard my situation and she just looked me in the eye and said all I needed to do was tell her anything incriminating. She could get me out she knew they were hurting me .I don’t have the balls for that. It’s bad but it’s not that bad. 
My brother apologizes for hitting me yesterday but it hard because yesterday was a mess. I hurt myself because  yesterday.
Also my mom caught me smoking weed and that’s pretty bad. The thing is she keeps saying I should have beat you up for that. 

I smoke weed because I don’t know how else to cope when you won’t get me the mental help I need.

That’s all for now that’s all I can think of but yeah this sucks and I want to get good grades so I can leave.

It's been two months since I've been home, resting and starting on my medication, which hasn't been the easiest thing as my body's been adjusting to the drug, Escitalopram/Lexapro, for those curious. My mother is quite the narcissist, which is the opposite of my father, who's caring and loving; however, earlier this week I had an argument with my parents, and I'm not sure who's in the wrong. My mother came into my room yelling for an hour, talking about how I'm lazy and am no good like all the other kids, nothing out of the ordinary. My father comes back from work and hears the argument from upstairs, comes upstairs and attempts to help her simmer down, as he usually does. However, this time I told him my mother wasn't being 'sane' and that made him angry, my mother grabbed me and held me down as instructed by my father and he went on to beat me, I managed to get away from my father and gently push my mother aside to run away to the living room; both my parents chased me there and I threatened to break two vases if they were to carry on with the beating as they approach me from both my left and right side, but as they charged towards me I ended up breaking the vases and they carried on with the beating. At this point, it got pretty violent, I was blooded and bruised on my arms, stomach, knees and thighs. I tried to get away by running down the stairs, however, my mother pulling my hair and my shirt, coupled with my father holding me down made it difficult. I've had enough, I would never hurt a women, let alone my mother, however, I pushed her aside and ended up brawling with my father and throwing him against the wall and then pushing him to the ground and cussing him out for resorting to violence. I haven't spoken a word to my father since, I've been in my room mostly for the past week and don't speak to him, nor have I seen him as he's busy with work; should I bother apologising?

128,"I graduated a year ago with a business degree and have only applied to a few admin jobs here and there, interviewed on the phone several times, interviewed in person two times. There have definitely been a lot of ups even though i've been unemployed, but some days just seem to blend into the next. I gym very frequently, try to eat healthy, help out around the house, have a great circle of friends and a loving family, but I cant seem to get myself to continue and apply for jobs.

I think I do fairly well with phone and in person interviews aside from feeling very nervous. I sometimes feel like I'm productive in other aspects of life but lazy to commit to the change of getting a full time job and finally ""adulting."" Have any of you ever felt this way? How'd you decide you wanted the job you have now (or are searching for)? What kept you motivated after the interviews that didn't land the job?

I realized that I tend to get bursts of motivation and will apply for a few days but then stop. I know I need to become more DISCIPLINED about finding a job rather than relying on motivation.

I can't wait to make money and repay my family and friends for their continuous support. It sucks going through 18 years of structured schooling only to graduate and feel so lost in life. Please feel free to share your story about being ""lost"" in life and finding purpose. Thanks for reading, kind stranger!",05May2018,2

131,"Hello People! I want to start creating my own video game music, like the Snes and GBA days. However I have no clue where to start. I am quite a quick learner when it comes to getting used to programs. I would love to get some advice!",05May2018,1
132,"I have a friend who I have been having troubles with but I don't think she knows that, though I'm not sure. 

I'll start with the beginning.

In the beginning, we had known each other three years prior but only as the bare minimum as casual friends during high school. We didn't even wave to each other in the halls, and we only talk when mutaul friends were around. She has told me she thinks she's the most awkward person and I can see it when she talks with our friends. So after a year apart, I got her number from her sister in late May of last year and we began talking. She has a very uninterested-sounding tone so I thought she didn't like talking to me: responses are short (one worded). I though she didn't like talking to me until I told her sister, to which she said that she really likes the conversations I have and that she tells her about them. It made me happy so I continued. She would laugh at the things we did and we would talk about the things we talked about, which felt natural (us conversing about our lives).

Then things changed when I was too comfortable with her. I told her a lot in a short span of time, and I take full responsibility of it. After a month of us talking, I told her that I kinda liked her and asked to stay friends, to which she said of course, too. We continue talking and I open up about my depression, to which she was supportive and talked with me on my occasions about it. However, I asked her very dark questions and I regret telling her them because looking back, they sound very manipulative (which was not my intention). A month passes and we're still talking as usual, when I ask about why she rejected me. And I'm not gonna lie: I made a big deal about it. Not angry at her, but it was a long, thorough text about if there was something writing with me and what traits I could improve on for the next girl. I told her I was over it (which was a lie), but did because I didn't want her to be afraid of talking to me again. She told me why, which it wasn't me but she didn't feel that way because she's never been interested in anyone. But in our next conversation, I tell her about my recent suciide attempt, but it want because of her but I did not tell her that. It was because of my family situation and I didn't tell her because I didn't want to get involved with my situation. However, I didn't tell her why snd I just wanted someone to talk to out of fear of hurting myself. She was very unresponsive but reiterated her advice from our talks about my depression.

I feel like the dynamic change in our friendship that day, because she stopped laughing via text. She hasn't laughed at anything I said since late July. But she still recuperates the talks we have, but weirdly, there are longer than the ones we had before I told her. I apologized for my depression and I haven't mentioned it since. I apologized to her and  she accoted them saying ""Don't be sorry for anything I understand."" During the fall, the good things were that our conversations were longer and more meaningful to me, and that was adding the time that she began to tell me about her life, from my childhood to her family life. The longest was on Christmas when we talked for twelve hours, which I think is an accomplishment for two socially awkward people. The bad things were that she would ghost me several times from August to December. It started with hours and then turned to a day, and the only way to get her attention was to send a follow-up text.

The New Year's came and she was a bit different. After I told her of my grandpa's passing and tell her that I can even someone who she can talk to (which she didn't acknowledge), she was more engaged with me. Our casual conversations became longer, and our interpersonal conversations seemed more interactive. From our interests to taking about obscure topics like friend chicken for two hours. She seemed to enjoy my company and thanked a lot, and even wished me good luck in school and to have a good day. I even asked that if she wanted to hang out with me in the summer, and binge Netflix series, and she said that it sounded good.

All seemed well until as of recently. I've made our conversations very short because of school and obligations, but the way I did makes it seem like it's distancing instead. But the thing that really messed with me is that she didn't wish me a happy birthday, even after I told her and even the date. And when it came, nothing from her and it hurt. I ahvent even messsged her since and it's been three or so weeks. But I realized more things: she rarely ask me about my life and the things going on with me, and it makes me think she doesn't care about me. There are times where she ignores or doesn't acknowledge something I say and when I talk about myself, her responses get so short or she doesn't even reply back. She's started using someone of my mannerisms when I text but she is like it's being used against me. One day, I'll have a thoughtful tone and she'll sound so cold. But the next day, she'll be thoughtful and I'll be cold. 

I just don't know if she cares about me, or thinks of me as a good friend. I keep saying it's because she's awkward but even then, she tells me all about how she and her roommate get along so great and how she really like her, and it makes me think she doesn't see me that way as a friend.",05May2018,1
133,"I just finished my sophomore year of college. It’s been hell. I lost my girlfriend of 4 years, I have no friends, barely scraped by in my classes, I have anxiety and depression. It’s just been really rough. 
I recently changed my major and it’s really the only thing I’m looking forward to next year. It will be a good chance to finally make some friends. I’ve gone two years and hardly know anybody on campus AND I’ve lived on campus the whole time so that just kinda shows how pathetic I am. 

The thing I’m struggling with right now is that I have to move back home (4 hours away) for the summer because I can’t live in the dorm over the summer. I have absolutely nothing to do at home. I lost contact with all of my high school friends. I feel like it’s just going to be a depressing hell for 2 months. My home town is incredibly small too. To give you an idea, we only have a few fast food places, a couple of gas stations, and a tiny Walmart that’s pretty pathetic. 
I just don’t know what to do. I signed up for an online class to give me something to do, but it doesn’t start until July. 
The thing I’m most ashamed of is that I feel like a complete loser because my parents are the only people that I enjoy being around and talking to. It’s not them that make me feel like that, it’s just the fact that I don’t have friends my age so I feel embarrassed. I know that sounds horrible and frankly it makes me feel horrible even saying it because my parents (especially my dad) are like my best friends. 

I don’t even really know what I’m asking here. I guess I just need someone to give me ideas for what to do. I feel like I’m losing my mind.",05May2018,1
134,"I’ll keep it short, I work in an industry that tough no matter what or where you are. 

The shop I currently work at hasn’t ever treated me that well and I’ve never felt all that comfortable there, the pay isn’t terrible, but it just barely pays the bills. They give me a schedule I want (3 off 4 on with two doubles a week) I make a base pay plus tip share. They have worked with other people with their school schedules (college town) so I’m assuming they would work with mine. The shop has an overall lack of any structure and a lot of old problems and drama constantly clouding the air, the more tenured folks talk so terribly on people they haven’t even worked there in years, most of the women refuse to get along with other women it’s so strange. It’s a very mentally draining place to be sometimes and I am usually unable to be my full self. There had also been so many times I get treated the opposite of others or had rules that only apply to myself and no one else. There is not a single thing in stone there. 

The job I was offered is at a bigger shop, the pay is $1 more an hour and the tips would be a bigger pull. The only issue is the huge potential of them not work with my school schedule if it comes down to it. Although I don’t need multiple days off, I am going to try and get everything set up on my days off or before work like I do now. I like the vibe in the newer place it just feels a little better, there is still that nervousness of course. The new place I can’t take anytime off in the first year, I wouldn’t really need to unless I was sick anyway. It’s a far better structure, less gray area and I think I’d find less of a special treatment there. 

My idea is, go to the new shop and see what it’s like for a bit get myself established and see if I can gain the flexibility, but I’m scared about the school thing. It’s an important thing for me to finish for myself. I’m torn between a clean slate and possible better location for my mental health or having to smile through so much bullshit that it’s making me unhappy. 

I don’t know though and I’m losing sleep I have to make a decision today. Should I stay and make the best of it to get the flexibly I might need or move on and be flexible myself for a little bit? ",05May2018,1
136,"Since October 2016, I've been talking to an ex classmate via social media about her issues with depression as well as her suicidal thoughts and self harm. I used to call her almost every night from about 7pm to 2am with almost every call having me beg her to not take her life or to stop hurting herself. She's ended up multiple times in hospital from failed suicide attempts and she stopped going to her therapist because her (single) mother believes she is only doing it for attention. As selfish as it may sounds, I want to stop having these conversations with her. Talking to her has become both physically and emotionally draining, and I'm extremely tired of being her life support. I don't even know how to help her. I've recommended to her about seeing the school counsellor (I can't talk to the counsellor for her as she moved schools earlier this year) but she refuses to get help from anyone but myself. She takes the slightest rejection as a person attack and would definitely do something to herself if I told her to talk to someone else.

139,"throwaway because i don't really want this to be associated with me.

also there is a TL;DR at the bottom.

i have an uncle who is estranged to the rest of the family, doesn't talk to his mom, his sister, my grandfather has passed, and he doesn't talk to my dad (his brother) or really any of my family, except my brother and sister - who are young (around 10). this isn't crucial to the story, but is for context.


for reference, i'm 19. i got gifted a car (mazda miata) when i was 17, as my first car. although i knew it inside, i shouldn't have taken the car because my dad and my uncle really don't get along - it hurt and upset my dad back then. 


it was his first car, and was left basically abandoned under the elements at a house that he built, but lost access to through a messy breakup. i convinced him (i'll stress NOT FOR THE CAR) to get back the house and kick out his ex and her daughter. he did that, recovered one of his cars that were there, and the miata was also recovered however was in a really bad condition. would not start and the paint was awful. so my uncle spent $7000 total to get it back to a perfect condition. i took the car and was really excited for a while, for about a year. 


however, the car is embarrassing and as a guy i don't like the look of convertibles. so for the past year, i've been driving this for work etc (i work on the road a lot) however there is no air conditioning, its very loud (modified exhaust), and generally not suitable for my job (i work a professional job - i can't drive this to appointments). 


around january of this year i was overseas. i came back and i borrowed my grandmothers car and parents car just to not drive this around, it was embarrassing and as i said above, not suitable for my work.


important to note: the car is registered in my name, was given to me (not loaned, i wasn't borrowing it), and i have paid for gas, registration, and insurance for the past 2.5 years. my uncle also said around 2 months after purchasing it, that when i want to sell the car, ""it is not his car to keep"", and that ""i can keep the money"". 


a while ago i let him know that i no longer want the car and i think its time to get rid of it. he told me to drop it back off to my grandmas house (he still lives there - even though, as above, he doesn't speak to his mother). I dropped it off there and around 4 days after I picked it back up determined to sell it, as it is legally mine.


i listed the car online some time ago, without telling him, and struggled to sell at the price that i wanted so have kept dropping price. i'm starting to get some interest, so today i texted him saying thanks for the car, i really do appreciate it, but its not right for me at the moment and i am going to take the money 

he messaged me back to ""please return the car"". i messaged saying ""please send records of the engine work in 2016"" (i need that because a buyer is enquiring). he messaged back saying ""the car needs to be returned, i told you that a few months ago"". i replied with a screenshot of him saying that the car is mine and i can keep money when i want to sell it. he replied saying that he doesn't appreciate the way i have approached this, and again, to return the car.

thing is, i've been misled by this. i've saved to go on holidays for the past two years instead of saving for a car because i thought that, as he had told me, the car was mine and the money from any eventual sale is mine. he's completely gone back on his word.

i don't know what to do. advice is needed and welcome, please. i guess legally, the car is mine, i can do what i want. i just want some advice from an outsider from my impartial facts as to what i should do. thanks


TL;DR: uncle gave me a car in 2016, expressed to me that when i want to sell it, i can keep money. i want to sell it. now. i have let uncle know, he has told me not to sell car and to return it to him, when the car has been legally mine for nearly 2.5 years, i have been paying registration, insurance, and gas for it.

145,"I work in a kitchen that is part of a liquor store.  I have worked there for two years.  TWO years of putting up with micromanaging and kind of being treated like shit.  I have gotten admonished for things I did do (like slice too much lettuce) to things I didn’t do (like opening too many sponges).  Each week I’m blamed for something new or I’m being scoled for something in front of my coworkers and even customers.

I have put up with that part because this job is 30 seconds from my house and it’s a relatively easy way to make money (although I am paid at least $2 less than my male coworker who has been there just about as long as me).  I also have been a stay at home mom for over 10 years and am trying to get back into working and figured this was a start.

I am applying to jobs every day and getting interviews but so far nothing.  I was actually able to leave this place back in Sept because I found a 6 week temp project but when that ended and my boss found out, he asked if I could come back at nights (not my day shift).  I did that and I am more miserable.

I need and want to be home at night with my family.  I close 3 nights a week and am expected to work all weekend, every weekend.
Why is that important to me?  Well, my husband has Stage 3 cancer with mets to liver and lungs.  He’s doing okay and going through a second round of chemo.  This cancer has been aggressive.  Two major surgeries in one year.  I hope for many many years more with him, but I can’t help but get angry because I feel like I should be spending as much time as I can with him.  Is that wrong?

Lastly, I have a coworker who can not keep his hands to himself and constantly grabs me whenever he wants.  I have asked him to stop but he does not.  I had another coworker (he no longer works there) expose himself to me and grabbed my head to get me to go down on him (I did not).  
This is where I get mad at myself because if my friend was telling me this about her work place OF COURSE I would tell her to quit.  I do not know why I have put up with all of this for basically grocery money.  

I guess I did not keep this short, I’m sorry. I don’t mind working but this place has become too toxic for me and causes me more anxiety than I need.  I want to check that it’s okay to quit to want to spend time with my family and my husband.  Because there has to be something out there that will work with my schedule.

154,"So my boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years. In the beginning (as it always is) we were having lots of sex and intimacy in our relationship (I was on the pill from the start). Last year I had to undergo an operation and be on 3 months of medication before the operation. During that time I had to come off the pill. 

This is where it started to be an issue. Coming off the pill is like turning all your bodies hormones on again at the same time and makes you super horny. When I brought the topic up, my boyfriend would say from the beginning that he didn‘t want to use condoms, because „that‘s just not how he had sex.“ which I didn‘t understand.

We tried having sex with condoms once or twice, but it was always very weird because he would say from the beginning that it wouldn‘t work etc. and so (of course) it didn‘t.

Basically that stopped us from having a normal sex life ever since. 

I got on the pill again after the operation, but we would just not make enough use of it (maybe because of the awkward situations before) and I didn‘t want to put hormones into my body on a daily basis (also based on the operation I just had) just so he wouldn‘t have to bother with condoms once a month when we ended up having sex. 

I just don‘t get why condoms are so much of a problem? He compares it to the pill as if it was the same thing, which makes me really mad, as the consequences for me are so much worse (hormones, taking something everyday) than for him.

Now I really don‘t know what to do anymore. Every time the topic comes up, it ends in a fight or with us not talking to each other. The whole sex-thing has become so awkward that I don‘t think it‘s ever going to be normal again.

I enjoy many parts of our relationship and I‘m by far not a person with an enormous sex drive, but 2-3 times a week (or even once) would be nice.

Can it really be that bad for a guy to use condoms or if he is just putting that in his own head by telling himself over and over again? Or am I being the difficult one and not understanding enough? I just feel like if he really still wanted me and my body and actually would be horny enough to have sex, the condoms wouldn’t be that much of an issue.

155,"My best friend (21F) and I (21F) have known each other since kindergarten. She is pretty reserved and quiet, tends to be a bit of a people pleaser. She always took school very seriously and always got straight A's. She recently became friends (maybe last year) with a girl who is a couple years younger and she is a complete mess. This friend supposedly has a lot of mental health issues. But, based on what I see, she didn't graduate high school, she works at a nightclub, I believe she is slightly instagram famous lol and of course every picture is her almost naked. She is a girl with a lot of issues and she has said and done horrible things to my best friend. Of course, my best friend still chooses to hangout with her constantly and is even planning on living with her. 

My best friend is working to become a doctor and yet she would move in with a high school drop out who recently told her that they can't hangout anymore because all she wants to do is go out and drink and my best friend isn't really into that (but still goes with her occasionally). 

I feel very frustrated and hurt because I feel like I am a good friend and I always feel protective of her because of her personality type and how easily she can be hurt and taken advantage of. I feel like this girl is a narcissist and a manipulator and sees my best friend as a vulnerable person that she can mess with. 

Many times I feel like I want to cut my best friend out of my life because she makes me feel like I am not good enough. I tell her that her friend is bad news but, it is hard for me to realize that I can't control anything she does even if I know she is making a horrible mistake. 

How do I deal with this situation without pushing her away?  I always feel sad and jealous when she tells me about how she spent time with her. I am trying to work on my issues with being controlling and jealous but I feel very protective of her. 

I should also note that she is really my only friend, my boyfriend of 5 years and I recently broke up and I was left friendless. ",05May2018,1
156,"I'm 26 years old. I live with my mother. I am trying to get out but the lack of a job sucks. I have very few friends. No girlfriend and nothing going for me accept maybe music and youtube as long as I stick to it. 

I'm an easy target and I know it. I wasn't bullied much as a child so I think that's why it's so easy to target me. I know a lot of people would tell me ""You're 26, grow up and tell them to fuck off"" Sure, in real life, you can do that easily. But on the internet? People can fuck with you over and over with several accounts. It doesn't take much to make a fake facebook account or a fake reddit or anything like that. \(This is why I love IP banning\).

I don't understand and never have understood bullying in the least. What is so gratifying behind a being an ass to another person? What is so great about trying to get another person pissed off? ""Getting a rise?"" 

I had a friend some time ago, I asked him this same question cause he would do it to me, and he said ""It's just funny to watch a person get all pissed off!"" Maybe I'm autistic, maybe I just don't get it. But when you're raised to be nice to everyone and you don't like seeing people hurt because there's enough hurt in the world, it seems rather pointless to go out of my way to be a dick. r/advice, what I ask of you is why is it so funny for a person to go out of their way to be a complete dick bag for no reason as an adult...? I'm 26, all my friends are adults, I may have 1 or 2 teen friends. but hell, even then they know that bullying isn't cool.

157,"I really want to work as a summer intern at this company. In the past, this company will email us about internship opportunities.

Since there weren't any email notifications that year, I decided to contact them to ask about internship opportunities. It turns out they had already posted about it online and already hired interns. They will not be hiring any more interns in the following year.

I am already a junior student and I feel like I missed the chance to ever work there. They only offer internships during summer and next year I will be a graduate and not qualify for that. And if course the way to get your foot in is to do internships.

The other issue is that many other companies have also done the same thing so I feel like I missed out a lot. What can I do? Should I just keep cold emailing a lot of people? I know some companies which may be offering internships but they may be similar to internships I had in the past and I want to ""diversify"" my work experience porfolio. Should I just do then anyway?

Tl;dr: I really want to work at this company and they used to send email to all uni student accounts to notify internship openings. Since they didn't do this this year, I had to ask them about it. It turns out they already hired internships and will not be hiring anymore interns. Since I am a junior, I feel like I missed the chance to work there as they only have internship opportunities for students during summer and I am already a junior student - should I ask around for other intern opportunities and apply for ones which are similar to other internships I've done before?",05May2018,2
158,"Past couple of years I've usually been on 2 different moods, first one is pretty depressed, some times are worse then others, where i have no motivation and completely antisocial in this time. Or I'm the complete opposite, I'm full of energy and easily distracted/ impulsive. All I want to do is talk to people or go out. 

Sometimes I feel like I'm inbetween where I want to be productive and have a lot of thoughts racing around but I can't even find the energy to get dressed. 

I never used to notice it until uni started and it became a bit worse. But I really started noticing when I watched a video on bipolar a couple of months back and it kinda clicked. But I can't tell if I only think I have it because I'm thinking about it. Like a placebo. 

Here's an example from the last couple of weeks, I was really down, not upset just drained for no reason (didn't have uni for this time) , I found out my uni didn't mark my assignment even though it was handed in on time (sorted now) and that kind of pushed me into a small spiral I guess. Waking up really late, barely being able to eat or do anything. I managed to force myself to do revision but only because exams are coming up. And I really did not want to speak to people, I was really irritable and even simple messages pissed me off. 

And then a couple of days ago, our of nowhere I was hit with a full blast of energy when I woke up. I wanted to get shit done. But not actually revision. When I tried I kept getting distracted. I've brought a couple of ebooks even though I don't read at all, only brought them because why not there's a chance I'll read them. I joined an Italian learning group on Facebook because why not learn Italian. And I started an Instagram art page. I've also been messaging people a lot more asking to hangout. 

This mood will probably last another week maybe 2. Unless something happens which pushes me into another small spiral. 

And thinking back I've even been told about my moods, me and my mate were talking about the first couple weeks of uni, and he mentioned the first couple I was completely different to the next couple. From drinking and going out to hiding away in my room.

Well her mom is just as crazy as her and made an instagram account. she followed my bf sometime in the middle of the night cuz he got the notification. when we clicked on it to try to see her profile it wasn’t there anymore she deleted it. she literally made it just to stalk his shit. i don’t know what to do. i’ve confronted them before because it bothers me but they’re so crazy i don’t want to deal with the drama and bullshit. i don’t know what to do. what would you guys do?? ,05May2018,1

170,"Hello all, I apologize for any poor formatting in advance. 

It’s hard to pick where to start, so let’s just introduce everyone to J, my sisters husband, and my sister, S.

J and S have two dogs, a boxer who is 7 or 8 years old (J has raised him from a puppy), and a pit mix who’s 5 or 6. 

J has always been an asshole. I never knew it would go this far, but he’s always been an asshole. 

Lately when coming home I’ve been needing to refill the dogs water bowl every single time I come home. Coincidence, I dunno, maybe. 

I also notice that the dogs usually really need to go out or have already gone on the floor when I come home. 

Basically, since their kid (who’s now over a year old) was born they’ve stopped caring so much about the dogs. 

Long story short, I don’t think the dogs are being treated well at all anymore. Every time one of them has an accident J gets super pissed, slams doors, yells at the dog, and grabs them by the neck skin and throws them around and into the kennel. Which we only have one of. 

This morning, I hear J cleaning up dog stuff and he comes into my room, the boxer is sleeping on my bed, and grabs him by the neck skin (90lbs dog), drags him off the bed, his hind leg slammed into my dresser, and threw him into the kennel WITH the 80-90 pound pit mix! 

I thought J left shortly after so I took the dogs out of the kennel and took them outside and he almost immediately comes out saying “what are you doing?! They were just out, they’re in there for a reason” and proceeded to slam the fuck out of a few doors and say “put them back when you’re done”. 

I love animals, I can’t handle this shit. I’m only here a day or two out of the week now and I still see shit like this?! 

What should I do? I can’t let the boxers final years be full of abuse, but I don’t want to have to put those dogs through separation and adoption and I really don’t want J to find out I called Animal Services. 

I fear for these dog’s safety and I also fear for my sister’s. If he abuses his dogs, I feel like it’s only a matter of time before he hurts my sister. 

What should I do?

recently, my mother had to go trough Facebook's photo identification \(not ID\) process due to 'unusual activity' while she was editing her page which was converted from her profile. I'm not surprised, since she's been using the name of the page as the personal account's name as well. It's an account that she has created about 1,5 months ago which has no profile picture of friends...Her profile was reactivated after 30 hours and she has immediately suspended \(deactivated\) it by herself.

I was worried that because of she was using this profile in order to stalk on me and my father, our profiles could have harm because of the similar searches/views, but you guys calmed me down that it's not possible.

Now here's my question: what she should do with her account? She'll be able to change her name in about 28 days, should she start to use her real name and fill it with her real info? In this case, because of the name change, etc. will the system automatically suspect some suspicious activity again, or will it be likely ok?

Or should she just leave the account suspended? In this case, will it get investigated again \(maybe automatically\) even if she doesn't do anything?

187,"TL;DN: Overprotective/Helicopter mom ruined me (F mid twenties) and I want to take control of my life. She’s all I have and I am not cutting her off

If someone would ask me who my bestfriend is I’d definitely say my mom. She’s an amazing person and I love her dearly but I can’t help but resent her at times (more and more nowadays).

My mom was a teen mom when she had me after several complications, so I understand that she was very protective of me when I was younger. To be honest, she wasn’t ready to have a kid but oh well here we are.

When I was growing up I was an extremely shy and anxious kid. My emotions were all over the place and I used to cry every single day. I was also mean to other kids, which I regret a lot.
Growing up my mom was a helicopter parent who isolated me from the world. I wasn’t allowed to play outside everyday because “the neighbours would see me as a streetkid”. I wasn’t allowed to play with boys, if I did she’d get angry and call me indoors if I was outside. I always felt this fear of her watching or hearing about me doing bad things. So I eventually stopped asking to go outside and found it safer to watch TV because I couldn’t do anything wrong while watching TV.

I slowly developed a fear of boys, because she was very against me playing with boys or even talking to them because “boys are bad news”. She made me feel like I was doing things with them secretly. Around this time 10-12yo I came across porn on the internet which made my fear of boys even worse.
I lost interest in having friends too because according to her you don’t need people in your life. You only need yourself. She never had a lot of friends and was a homebody.

Now I’m in my mid 20s and I feel like a fucking loser. I never had a relationship, if I talk to someone online I become obsessed and want to talk to them everytime. I don’t know how to maintain a relationship and often disappear from social media because I’m overwhelmed. My mom has started to use me as her “therapist” and I’m getting annoyed as hell. Whenever I want to talk to her she makes me feel like I’m overreacting or she’ll make me feel like I’m being mean and she’s the victim. She even said that if I really wanted a relationship I would’ve had one secretly (like wtff??). She even has the nerves to ask me when I’m going to give her grandchildren... She has friends now who she goes and does things with and I’m stuck in this stupid house because I’m afraid of going outside. I’m so sick of this. She has apologised for isolating me but she still makes me feel like it’s my own fault because clearly if I did want it bad enough I would’ve have friends and a life etc. I know she’s partly right but fuck! And when I don’t know how to do a simple task she makes me feel stupid because I should know, but the funny part is she never taught me how. She probably thinks as I grow older I should magically know how to do things.

I’m ruined and upset because she was supposed to help me create my personality. She was supposed to guide me and help me become an adult who can function in life but she didn’t. She only installed fear in me. I don’t know what to do. I can’t afford a therapist, I have no one to talk to, I’ve read so much selfimprovement blogs but I just can’t. I feel frozen like this will be the rest of my life. I just want to know if there is hope for me. I want to be outside and enjoy my life but I can’t.

But I still love her so please don’t advice me to cut her off. She’s all I have. She’s a great person who just wasn’t good and too young to raise me.",05May2018,2
188,"About a year ago, a girl who went to my college was raped and murdered not far from the college. She was walking a route I would often walk when I had a free period and my friends were all in lessons.

Obviously, it had had a profound effect on everyone who knew her, but even though I never met her in my life, the fact that I was so close (about a quarter mile) away from the murder makes me feel like I should've been there.

It's completely unreasonable to suggest I had any reason to be there, yet I still feel so frustrated that I didn't choose to go for a walk in the same area she did on that day.

I feel like in the aftermath of her murder, a lot of people at the college pretended they were closer to her than they really were, so I haven't mentioned this to anyone, but even 12 months down the line I can't shake this feeling of guilt for something I had no part in at all.

Any tips?",05May2018,46

She doesn't pay for her gas, her parents do, and the place I'm performing at is less than 10 minutes from her house. I know her parents wanted to see it too because I'm close with her family but they can't this weekend. I know it's not her parents saying that she can't go.

I can see both sides of pretty much every divisive political argument, and I honestly don't know which side I lean toward on all of them. I've tried to do research, but I can't make up my mind, because I can see why people might hold both viewpoints.

The same goes for religion/spirituality. I can see there being a God, and I can see there being none.

This indecisiveness wouldn't be as big of an issue if it only affected me.

It has effects on relationships with my friends, since I have nothing to contribute to hot-button discussions and can't decide whether to support causes they are passionate about.

The nature of our relationship now is that it’s pretty nonexistent. We never do any activities together, I’m uncomfortable even looking him in the eyes when speaking to him. When we do speak it’s always about business. He’s such a serious person it’s hard to think of any thing he does enjoy.

He’s not a bad father, he loves and supports me. For the past 3 years he’s been under a tremendous amount of stress dealing with end of life care for his own father, and other family issues. I just find it really difficult to talk to him, but I want to change this before I leave.

So I just wanted to ask if I should do something or if I should be worried. Today at 2am I woke to a strange sound, I couldn’t make it out for a few seconds but when I got closer to the window I could clearly hear that someone is using a shovel and digging. 

I live in a row of apartment building but, small ones with 3 floors, I live on top floor. But on the other side of this street are houses, big expensive houses close to each other usually owned by doctors since this street is right next to hospital. And that sound was coming from the other side of the street ( keep in mind that it’s a small street so I was really close to the source of that sound), I kept listening to it some more, I looked out, I tried to see if I can’t find the person digging at 2am, but no luck. After a few minutes it stopped and I got scared and quickly went to bed and close my windows.

So what do you people think, should I be worried? Should I do something? If something bad happened I don’t want to just ignore it but I don’t want to get in trouble with some bad people.

198,"I was raised in a pretty well to do life style in my home country  but physical work was never an alien concept to me.   My parents raised me to be independent at a young age. When my family decided to move to the west for better opportunities, it was a struggle for all of us but i survived. High school was ok for me in the most part. Did average in school and did a lot of volunteer work. The goal at that time was to get into medicine. I felt very distant about the idea bc i know my mental capabilities and I am not as smart as what my patents would like to believe.  But anyway, i went with the idea going into university bc i mean, what else could i really do?  I've only been exposing myself to one field since high school.  What could go wrong right? 

First year of uni was a struggle but so was everything else. Met good friends who later betrayed me.  Went into depression as i realized how hard it was to break through the ceiling of staying average in university.  I moved to a different city for university so my parents we're unaware of my situation.  Saw a bunch of councillors and psychiatrist for help but nothing really made the difference.  Anyway,  i survived university graduating after 5 years with a 3 year degree.  I couldn't finish the 4th year anymore.  I felt stuck and told my parents that i can't do medicine. I realized that it really wasnt the field for me.  

Now, here i am.  Stuck with my 3yr premed degree at the age of 23. I have no prior work experience except for internships and volunteer work. I honestly don't know what to do.  I don't even know if finding a job with this degree is possible.

So I work in a warehouse, And I was at my station putting packages on a pallet.

I noticed my co worker struggling so I took the time to head over there and help her out.

So I guess she had a problem with me putting a package horizontally on 3 rows to avoid instability.

She said ""How long have you been working here a month ? Your not suppose to do that cmon, You do that were gonna have problems.""

And In my head I was like ""Wtf ru fucking serious ?""

And I told her I did that to avoid instability and she said ""Alright alright"" then I left pissed off and I took it as a insult because she implied that I didnt know what I was doing or that Ik dumb.

So I go to my supervisor and I told him what happened.

Now I kind of lowkey insulted her but my supervisor didnt seem to care about that.

But I started to become paranoid that when I insulted hes gonna tell the manager and thst im gonna get fired.

So Im thinking is that gonna happen or am I overeacting ? And what to do better if I encounter situations like that again ? Any advice Id appreciate it. Thank u

I can understand that so I decided to take a 2 month trip to visit my family in Florida to allow him time alone and hopefully he can come to a conclusion on weather or not he wants to be with me. 

On one side I am hopeful and think this break will bring us closer together and help us have a better relationship than before.

206,"Throwaway because people in real life know my Reddit account. 

Over the past year, a change of sorts has started to come over me. I don't know why, but I've become increasingly awkward around people in general and girls in particular, to the point where I have problems holding regular conversation at times. 

I'm 17. You'd have thought the part of puberty where I get the feels is long gone. And I think it is? I mean, I felt all that when I was younger, and then it got over. But now, I don't know, I've started to think of every female not related to me as a potential mate. It's uncomfortable and it doesn't let me think, and I've tried to shut it out for months, but it always comes back, and it leaves me unfocused and unable to actually talk to the person. 

And another thing that's been happening is that I overthink conversations, so much, so much. With everyone. I'm always actively trying to either appease everyone I'm talking to, or actively trying to _not_ appease them, so I always come off either as a pushover or a grade A asshole. And the worst part is, nobody's telling me this, I feel this on my own, every time I hold a conversation with someone I'm judging myself like crazy. Always, I'm thinking, ""Does that make me sound weird? Shit, maybe they don't like me now that I did &lt;mildly controversial thing like sending ""Thanos did nothing wrong"" memes&gt;.""

The tipping point was today when someone on Reddit linked to r/braincels being the new r/incels. I've been to incels before and back then, it disgusted me people could be like that. But now, I see myself _agreeing_ to those guys, being able to relate to the things they post, maybe not on an extreme level as they are, but still. 

I don't want to be an incel. I don't want to not be able to hold conversation with people. I don't want to judge people or myself, and I don't want to be unable to be friends with a girl. 

I've tried to put myself out and talk to people. And always, I'm well received by the people initially, but they don't like talking to me when they realize _I never talk._ When I'm pulled into the conversation, I always either blank out, or say something so stupid the other people are left staring at me awkwardly. I really find it easier to end conversations than to start them. 

The last, perhaps most interesting bit of all: I have none of these problems while texting. On text, I'm rational, insightful, even a bit funny at times. I like to think that this is because behind a keyboard, I have time to think - I type faster than average, so if I think more, it just takes the same about of time as a normal person. But increasingly this is waning away too, my replies being cut down to ""Oh,"" ""Nice,"" and ""Wow, okay,"" and ""lol."" And I hate it. 

This post is a bit of a mishmash of emotions and problems I think I have with my personality. There are more, but I don't feel comfortable putting them on Reddit, even anonymously. I don't want solace, even if I'm thankful for it. I want to know how to fix myself, preferably really quickly, because there are so many _absolutely amazing_ people I know who I want to talk to more often, if only I could talk to them at all.

I’m struggling a lot with where I’m at in life. 

I’m 24 years old and have been living in the same city my entire life that know every inch of it. I dropped out of college 5 years ago and have been working job to job since. I’ve worked 12 jobs in that span of 15 years, and am currently fizzling out in my current job as a marketer for a home improvement company. 

About a week ago, I came to the conclusion that maybe after 5 years of going job-to-job, that maybe that way of life isn’t for me anymore and considered going back and finishing my Associate’s degree. I filed my FAFSA, waited eagerly with this anticipation that my life was going to change, to find out that I can’t go back to school until I figure something out with my default loans (which I was under the impression were taken care of.) 

Now I’m sitting here wondering if packing a bag and moving somewhere different is what I should do. 

My boss says I can have a “good career” with the company, but the work/life balance I have now is already shit that I’m not so sure I want to continue it.

213,"Here's the thing! The girl that I've been falling in love with seems to show that she likes me but sometimes she shows she isn't interested in going out with me. At least that's what it seems. 

-Most of the time I text her first but lately she's been coming to me when she knows where am I or she sometimes asks me. 
-We talk a lot and have a good time. When I ask her out she says yes but then says she can't. 
-She's an independent girl in college. However, she still lives with her parents and she's pretty shy (just like me). This makes me think that the shyness may have something to do with the fact that she doesn't go out with me. 
-We are both inexperienced in relationships. I have never been so close to a girl before and she's never been in a relationship. It makes me think that she doesn't know how to react in these situations. My inexperience also doesn't help. I think I haven't been clear when asking her out.

To be honest, she does like me but I'm not sure how much. I'm her only friend in college. We spend time together when she's not busy (and she's a busy person in college). 

And the thing is, I'm falling in love. If this were not to work out, it would be hard for me. She's not a regular ""crush"".

220,"Over the past 5/6 years of me being in a friendship group, I can count on one hand how many times I have been invited to a group outing. 

Recently, our school year was having a party, and I asked in our group chat what people were doing before they went and none of them replied. Nothing was mentioned to me in school, either. When I brought it up to someone not in the group, the asked why I wasn’t going to _____’s house before, as everyone else in my friendship group was (_______ was in the gc). 

So I asked the person who I would consider my best friend what they were doing, and they said going to this persons house. And that was it. I was hurt as in other situations I have asked the person who is organising the party if my friends can get an invite if they don’t have one. 

It got to the point that another group who I don’t really speak to asked me on the night to go to theirs before the party as they felt bad for me. (I was unable to go due to their location). 

After that night, I brought it up with my the person who I considered my best friend and they apologised saying they should have made sure I had somewhere to go or tried to get me invited. I accepted the apology.

Skip forward 5 days and I notice my friends are all in the same location on Snap Maps. The person who I considered my best friend was there too even though they live around 20 miles out of town, whereas I live less that half a mile away from my other friends. My snapchats were opened by my ‘best friend’ but he didn’t reply until he was home later. 

At this point I was mad to the point that the next day at school I made to effort to talk to this friend only replying to anything they directly spoken too. That night he messaged me asking me what my problem was to which I replied with that it had happened again less that a week later. My friend then back tracked on their apology saying that I’m not their responsibility and that if I wanted to go I should ask and that it’s my own fault I don’t get invited. I replied asking how am I supposed to ask for an invited when I don’t know the thing was happening. 

I also have quite bad anxiety, so as we messaged I could feel myself getting more and more panicked, so we agreed to disagree, and we “were cool.” 

Well last night my friends all got together again, and  I wasn’t invited. That day I asked my friend if he would be watching our favourite TV show that night and he said he couldn’t as he was going to _____’s House. “______?” I questioned to which they replied “oh don’t ask about it he only asked me this morning.” 

From this I presumed that it was only the two of them. It wasn’t until afterwards that one of my female friends told me that she had overheard them talking about a party at ____’s tonight and asked if I was invited, which was when I realised that they were having more people over. 

After the party, I was told by other people that my best friend was talking about the party when I was there, and someone had asked if I was aware it was happening, to which he replied “no I don’t know what to tell him”. This person then told them to tell me sooner rather than later so I could ask for an invite. But he never did. 

What are my next steps? I’m honestly so conflicted as to how to act. I don’t know if I’m being needy, but it makes me feel so undesirable and terrible and then they are all talking to me when we are back at school. 

Because some people may say that I’m over reacting which may be true but it happens 9/10 times they go out somewhere, and this has happened over the past 5 years.

224,"So basically I've always wanted to sing better but I don't sound thaaat great right now. But I know there's always room to improve and get better.
The thing is my voice is naturally pretty deep and so I don't know which 'voice' to sing in. Sometimes I sing in my deep voice or sometimes I go higher or sometimes I sing a little more quieter. It's weird but I still haven't figured out what my natural singing voice is. I feel like once I find it I can move forward and practice runs and other stuff but  for now I feel like this is needed to be figured out first.
any tips on that or anything with singing is greatly appreciated! ",05May2018,1

226,"I work as a full-time leasing agent and we recently hired a leasing manager to our team. The other staff consists of part time leasing agents and 3 other managers who are above the leasing manager. My first impression of the new manager was she is shy and she is the type to focus on her work, not necessarily be your friend and your manager, which I understand. 

However, before she was hired, here is a little background on what it used to be like everyday at work: I loved going to work everyday, genuinely looked forward to it and so did my coworkers; There were 8 of us in the office altogether (managers included) and we all got along extremely well, all of us considered friends to a point and even would go out together occasionally, would always be cracking jokes and talking about anything and everything, even sometimes down to very deep, serious conversations; Teamwork with the 8 of us was flawless. We were always helping each other to get work done faster, or just to help the other person in general, and if we didn’t have anything to do we would ask around if anyone needed help; The main manager does not care, at all, if we talk amongst ourselves, get on our cell phones, or really do whatever we want as long as our work gets done, which we are good at, it’s just that we do have times when we are extremely slow and have nothing to do. I’m sure I could think of more to talk about but I am not here to talk about how awesome it used to be! 

There are SO many things I could bring up in regards to how this new manager is affecting my coworkers and me (not a team player, doesn’t want to do anymore work than she absolutely has to, will go out of her way to make sure you are following policy when she isn’t even clear yet on what all of our policies are (has made several mistakes which is to be expected when you’re new, but don’t be telling me what to do if you have no idea what the hell you’re doing yourself), etc..), but I want to bring up one BIG issue I experienced personally with her in hopes of getting some good feedback as to what I could do about it. 

I suffer from chronic migraines and missed a whole week of work recently but was scheduled to work on Saturday. It is policy to where if you know you’re not going to be able to make it into work on the weekend (only one person works on a weekend day) then you need to reach out to your coworkers to try and find someone to cover for you. If no one can cover for you then your manager is required to cover for you, which would mean she, the new manager, would have to work if I couldn’t. That Friday night before I had to work the next day, at 8:30 I get a text from her saying, “I hope you’re feeling better. I forgot you are working tomorrow. Do you think you will be able to work tomorrow? If you don’t think you can, please try and get it covered. Thank you!” Seemingly harmless, right? WRONG. 

At first I was actually glad she had texted me because I was in bed all day not necessarily thinking clearly thanks to the migraine, and I should probably start reaching out just in case I couldn’t make it in on Saturday, but regardless, I would have reached out to my coworkers either that night or Saturday morning whether she texted me or not. It’s not like I would just abandon my shift and no one work that day, I’m not that kind of person plus I would lose my job. I’m almost 30 years old and don’t need someone checking to make sure I’m doing my damn job correctly, especially when I’ve been doing it longer than her. It wasn’t until I started reaching out to my coworkers that I found out she already KNEW NONE OF THEM could work that Saturday and she was going to have to cover my shift. I was furious which only made my head worse and didn’t text her again until 6:30 am on Saturday to let her know she was going to have to go in because my coworkers couldn’t for one reason or another. Never heard back from her. 

Turns out, during that week while I was gone, she had asked my coworkers more than once (confirmed even by another manager) if any of them would be able to work on Saturday if I couldn’t. They all told her no, they could not work. After I texted her at 6:30 am on Saturday, she turns around and texted at least 2 of my coworkers AGAIN to ask if they could work, which why the hell she thought their answers would magically change, who knows. To her disappointment, she ended up having to go into work last Saturday. 

When I made it back to work this past week, I brought this whole situation up to my other managers, who then ultimately asked, “Do you think sitting down with her to talk about this would be best, to air things out?” I thought about originally doing this but had never been put in this situation before, so I decided to follow the chain of command instead. I did decide to sit down and talk with her one-on-one, but my mistake was that I was offered a mediator and thought, “No, we are both adults (her being only a year older) here, we can talk this out just the two of us.” She took advantage of that and this is what happened: 

I confronted her about everything in a professional manner. I never came out and said “you lied to me”, but I laid out the facts from my point-of-view to a point where it would have been obvious to anyone I was talking to that I felt lied to. SHE DID NOT DENY ANY OF IT AND OWNED IT. I was so caught off guard that she was in control of the discussion pretty much from there on out, which I’m still fuming about. She said, “I felt like I did my job as a manager and I was just making sure you followed policy.” She even admitted she already knew no one could work on Saturday and said, “I was hoping since they all know you better that they would give you a different answer than they were giving me.” Who the hell calls this “managing”?! More like “lazy ass who doesn’t want to take responsibility and work”. I get it, I mean who wants to work on the weekend? But we ALL have to at some point and this was her first time, so cry me a river. By the way, if you work a weekend day, you get that time off during the following week, so it’s not like working overtime. 

What makes this even worse is that the main manager knows everything and hasn’t taken any action to address this issue, so now I feel extremely uncomfortable around her. I feel like I’m going to have moments where I’m wondering “is she lying to me about this just to get me to do my job?” Oh, and get this: She’s such a stickler about following policy, and one of our policies is that we have to treat everyone equally, so if we do something for someone we have to do the same for everyone. One of my coworkers told the new manager this past week that she couldn’t work a particular Saturday a couple weeks from now because she will be graduating. I really like this coworker and have absolutely nothing against her, but per policy she would need to find someone to take over her Saturday for her, which wouldn’t be difficult given the amount of notice. HOWEVER, the new manager decided to take it upon herself to find someone to work her Saturday for her... Complete and total BS (I have no idea how much I can cuss on here or else I would really be letting loose right now haha). 

Like I said earlier, I could go on but I doubt you all want to read a book on this. Any advice or even some hilarious jokes that will make me laugh about this whole situation would be much appreciated. This has got me stressed out, which I never used to be stressed like this from work, and hoping to find a solution to this whole problem ASAP! ",05May2018,0
227,"Okay so about a month ago this girl I know gave me permission to use her mobile number create a gmail account or something I can't remember, but I didn't have a number at the time and needed one to create it.

The other day she texts me telling her to stop using her number for things, apparently she received a text from a loan company asking for a confirmation code. It's weird because she lives far away from me and the loan company is I'm my area, so I'm trying to convince her I never gave out her number or tried to apply for a loan with it but she wasn't buying it. So I ask her to phone the loan company to get some details on what name was used in the application, email. Ect.

Fast forward to today I get a call from her mother saying she'll phone the police if I text her again or some crazy shit. So I can only assume they're under the impression I tried to take out a loan in her name, or something greesy but that makes no sense at all if you really think about it.

So what am I supposed to do? Why was there a loan application sent to her number from my area? I can't exactly ask her or her mum to give me the details given the quite retarded threat now can i?

I do understand the situation looks sketchy. But I had nothing to do with it and it's freaking me out how they got her number, like maybe I've been hacked? Or maybe they're lying? Idk man

228,"Btw I don't actually follow that beta vs alpha thing I just didn't want to put ""pussy"" in the title. 

Anyways I swear I'm just a huge pussy. I'm kinda weak, I don't have much and I struggle with mental illness. There has to be some way that can help me not get so excited and it nervous in certain situation and have confidence and just be relaxed. I abuse nicotine a lot to help, but right now I'm out and can't get any for a few more days. Nicotine works for whatever reason doesn't make me confident just makes me relaxed and not give a shit.. alcohol just makes me really hyper. I feel like a child when It happens cause I'm all impulsive and really dumb. Weed makes me relaxed but EXTREMELY paranoid. Which makes me feel even worse about being a pussy. 

I barely have any aggression in me and when I do everyone takes me for a joke and laughs at me like ""wtf is he gonna do"". I always second guess myself. I have anxiety and depression which is just another reason to feel like less of a man. 

Lastly my physical appearance is nothing to proud of, I'm short, im not a twig but I'm not gigantic, I'm the kind of fat where you can only see the top abs(I used to be less fat but started eating worse and stopped working out), I'm small under the belt, small neck, feminine face, NO jawline once do ever. I'm just weak everywhere pretty much. 

I really don't feel like a man, and I don't want to live like this anymore but I can't fix it. I don't have the motivation or anything to change any of this. What should I do I'm lost again of course?

I have until about end of May to ask her out. If I don't, I'm not gonna see her for like 4 months. If I do ask her out before the end of May, I'll have about a few weeks with her before she has to go away for a while.

I don't think she's gonna be particularly fond of investing in a relationship with a guy she's just met, only to have to turn around and not see him for ages. I just don't see how it could work.

If I wait until later on in the year I won't have to worry about this. Not only that, but I'm also planning on recording a few songs over the summer, so I'm gonna be pretty much irresistible (jk) when she sees me next.

231,"     This is the first time I've posted in this subreddit. I need advice regarding a woman with whom I'm interested in. For some context, I am currently a college student who's still in class for the semester. Generally, I'm a shy and polite person to people that I don't know. The more that you know me, the more I open up and am outgoing. 

     Now, about this woman; she's a year behind me at my college. For the sake of the post, we'll call her H. I had never seen H before this week. However, I was introduced to her mid-week at an event that was occurring on-campus. She's funny, intelligent, friendly, and athletic. I am completely infatuated with her. Now, at the time I met her, I was with one of my closest friends; we'll call him J. J and I met her on the same day. 

     He ate lunch with her the next day and has explained that he would shoot his shot with her if he weren't afraid that it would ruin a potential friendship with her. All three of us were hanging out again the next night for several hours. I'm fairly confident that H is interested in me, but I'm not completely certain. Anyhow, I did not want to ask for her number or snapchat while my friend was there.

     It's also worth mentioning that J lives a couple states over from the college (and my home state), and H is from my home city. I told J that I wanted to ask H out. He seemed fine with it. J has H on Snapchat (he got it the night we met her), but I don't. As I mentioned earlier, I rarely see this girl. So, should I ask J for H's snapchat? I don't want to come off as creepy. Also, I don't want to hurt J. He's one of my most trusted friends. So, do you think that I would be doing anything unethical or immoral if I pursued her further? I'm on a time crunch as the semester ends in less than two weeks, but I feel as though I really need to ask her out because I've not taken many risks in my life, relationship-wise or otherwise. Since her and I are from the same city, it would be relatively easy to date.

Im 16 and i dont know why, but i still feel like shit. Ive been doing therapy for 10 years now, trying to get myself back up, but to no avail. I've always been introverted and socially anxious, but i always make an effort to socialize and go out sometimes, but it doesnt really help me.

I studied in the same school for all my life, having the same friends and people in my social circle, except i was never invited or asked out, no one checked on me online or invited me over to play games or go to a party, specially my guy friends, whom i was close in my childhood years. My last year of middle school was absolute hell, depression and anxiety eated me up and i couldnt manage to get anything done with anyone and, even if i did, nothing happened later, i never got invited, i always was the person to initate contact.

When middle school ended, i decided to change schools in hope for a better social life and it kinda worked, i get less anxious and i can manage to make conversations, but im unable to ask people out, i dont get invited and i was completely forgotten by all my friends that i had for years. Now i feel lonely, i dont have anyone that seems to want me as a friend, i just drift along what people are doing.

I feel like a piece of shit, like im worth nothing, since no one asks me out and when i do, it leads to nothing, im feeling more inclined to shut myself out from everyone.

235,"Made a new account out of shame. So the story goes: new girl gets hired, its only me and her in our department and we become close friends. After a few months i start to have feelings for her and trusted her enough to be honest about it. I knew the kind of guy she liked and that i was not it so when i told her i said ""i know i'm not the kind of guy you like, but i want to be.""  She respected my bravery to be honest and supported my decision to try to improve myself.""

With her support i was able to start taking better care of myself, how i carry myself abd have even started to recieve compliments from others who knew me when i was a mess. The thing is she was still going through a rough time with the father of her daughter but she has started to accept things wont work out and started to have feelings for me. She also wants to be married and i told her i'd love to be her husband. We started seriously discussing marriage but she said she she was not ready to commit (stop sleeping with her baby dad and focus on being with me) until we set a date. I accepted it. I understand she wants to end things on good terms with him for the sake of their child and maybe i'm a fool but the idea of starting our relationship with marriage and growing together is romantic as fuck to me.

Nows the part where i messed up. When we started talking at first we were happy just going to the court house and doing it, now she started discussing stuff like rings and it felt to me the date was getting farther away. I spoke to her about it, said i just want us to be together and if we could start sooner then whenever we have things ready enough for a date. The part i messed up was trying to validate my position and feelings. Explaining i dont want to see anyone else in the mean time like she sees the baby dad. I'm all in 100% in everyway, even financially helping support and provide for her because i want to prove i can be that kind of person in her life. This got her really upset however, she said it felt like i was throwing everything i've done for her in her face. 

I hate myself for trying to rush, i hurt her and betrayed her trust, spoke out of fear and insecurities. Now we've from seriously talking about being together to ""probably."" (A quote from her when i asked, a simple word that left me heartbroken. ) I know this post is probably riddled with red flags but shes an amazing, caring person who has been a great friend to me. I'm deeply in love with her and even if things dont work out; i trust she wont ruin my life. I know i need to give her space and let things fix itself but its hard, it hurts to want more but have no love or affection in my life while she gets affection from her daughter and baby dad. I'm lost. I need to stop feeling so strongly for her but don't know how. Avoiding is impossible because we work together and i dont want too anyway.

I can't get over how I mistreated my once best friend and now she can't even look me in the eye. I apologized, but she dropped me out of her life with no desire to mend things.

My ex\-boyfriend who I've been apart from for over a year is finding out the truth that I found it hard to see him as more than a friend \(for 1 year\), though he was my best friend and I tried to make things work but I had to break his heart. I hate how I kept my true feelings hidden but at the time I felt pressured and forced into the relationship.

I had feelings for one guy, but another guy came along. After I hooked up with the new guy we decided it was best to be friends, but he fell HARD for me. I had the idea of being with him out of my mind since I didn't want to complicate my life \(I had originally had feelings for the first guy\). Things with the new guy were alright as being friends after I told him I just wanted to be friends. The other guy ended up dumping me after I thought we would start dating, and now I just feel like I messed up with both people. The new guy rarely interacts with me now \(even liking my photos etc\). I just feel so distant from him and I feel like he was the better option after all.

I've had a job as a lifeguard/supervisor for almost 4 years now, but I am away for chunks of months at a time and barely know anyone who works there anymore. I had my supervisor keys taken away because I wasn't working much and wouldn't fit too well being a supervisor these days. My boss also asked me to question how well the job fits into my life. I don't feel like I belong there anymore anyways. The people who are around my age are all friends with each other and I am on the outside.

That last sentence actually applies to most of my life. I just don't make friends easily. I have a very specific set of hobbies/interests and I'm also introverted, so that doesn't help. I also feel like I come off as rude sometimes, which I'm trying to improve, but it makes it hard. My voice is low for a girl and I'm not naturally enthusiastic unless I'm talking about one of my passions.

I've been really worried about this thing lately. I lost my virginity late (23, and I'm a male). I had friends while in high school and college, and I didn't have any problems in talking to girls. I had a girlfriend and dated a few others, but I didn't get to sex. Now I'm in a relationship (I just turned 24), and I feel happy. But she is more experienced than me, she had a few partners before - relationships and fwb (she is very beautiful, so I kinda expected it). The problem is that she tells me that she won't be enough, because I'll want something else at some point. I haven't thought about this before, but after she told me this a few times, I started worrying about it.
I really don't want anything else, but I'm a little bit frustrated that I didn't get to do these things in college (it's a long story, I had faced some problems and dating wasn't on my priority list. I wish it was, but I was so concerned with other problems, I always told myself that I will have time later). I am a really mature guy, and I have always been very mature for my age, but now I feel that she is way more mature than me when it comes to relationships, and I feel like our relationship is a little bit out of balance.
I don't really even know what to ask, but I hope you might have something to say about this. Thanks, it's really occupying a big part of my mind and I wish I could get over these thoughts.",05May2018,1

My relationship with my parents have never been good. After some introspection about my life these past few months, I've come to the conclusion that my mother is just way too controlling. She's asked me for money many times in the past to help pay for rent (few hundred dollars in the past, probably a little bit over $1,000 in the past just for rent) and maybe about $100 worth of groceries. The problem is that I really don't know what our family's current financial situation is. I know they've borrowed money in the past from relatives, but I'm not sure how often currently. They tell me that we're low on money yet I constantly see them eat out, buy food from fast food joints, and sometimes buy random things for me such as new shoes or a shirt that my mother saw as a good deal. Throughout my life, she's constantly been irresponsible with money and falling for the dumbest sales tactics (""Oh, this shirt was marked down from its original retail price! Don't you know how much money I saved?) She still tries to do my laundry for me. She's constantly in my business asking me where I got this new job and such, and she seems to constantly put me under the impression that everything is dangerous. I'm sick of this. 


In the past, I've just assumed she's trying to be motherly and caring, but it's time to grow up. My parents don't seem to know basic life skills (my mother had to call roadside services to change her tire for her), and didn't seem to teach me any growing up.

Ever since she has been going out much less and stopped caring about her grades, and doesn't study at all. This completely contradicts her constant anxiety about the future and her high hopes for a scholarship in a prestige university. She's not too smart but with good effort can get into a pretty good university. She has no problem making friends, but is always under the impression that everyone is better at making friends than she is. She constantly cancels plans to go out with friends last minute ""because she doesn't feel like it"". She no longer cares about get hygiene and her room is an utter mess. She refuses to commit to therapy and doesn't like visiting the same therapist more than once. I'm not worried about suicide, because she is very religious, as opposed to me, and her religion states that suicide is a one way ticket straight to hell. Her mood swings are unbearable. She also has problems coping with our mother's death, and is too afraid to stay in our parent's room, \(which is now just my dad's\). She can't stay in the house alone, because she is too afraid whenever she hears any sounds. This video pretty much sums up everything she does:

I've just started to feel good for the first time in a long time and this put me back under stress and pressure.

247,"So to give some context to this. My current situation brings up a pretty similar behavior Pattern I’ve had for a long time. I recently joined the Army, and my recruiter has become a very very very good friend of mine. I consider him like a big brother. We work out a bunch together, talk, text a lot, it’s awesome. He’s one of my best friends here in town, (I’ve move around a lot so I don’t really settle and make community.) I recently just went through a tough time, so to have a mentor and friend unexpectedly come out of no where was awesome. We’ve been chillin for like 4 months now, and I leave in a little over 2 months. I now constantly find myself bummed out knowing I’ll probably never see him again afterward. And he’s admitted that the only way we will keep in contact is through email.

This brought up a thinking pattern I’ve had since I was a kid, whether it was a good friend, birthday, holiday, season of life, whatever, I found myself sad about how little time I have left to enjoy that moment instead of truly embracing it. It really sucks the joy out of life when you think like that, but it’s something I’ve always just thought about. How do I go about changing this? ",05May2018,2
248,"So I have an Amazon Prime account that I’ve let my friend use in the past. She’s told me every time she was going to make an order and she’s only used it about 3 times total.

Then she asked if her boyfriend can use it too, and I thought this would be a one time thing since she just asked me once.

However, he’s been using my account multiple times to make orders and I never know about them until I get email confirmations from Amazon. He’s using his credit card of course but I feel weird especially because I don’t know him very well and that he’s taking advantage of the $80 that only I pay to get 2 day shipping and all the other perks of Prime. 

Should I say something to her about this or am I just being petty??",05May2018,1

All this time I thought about getting a job im my hometown for summer, but few hours ago I got suggestion to work as an auntie in Spain(I live in Lithuania).

Firstly, I am going to study at university in autumn, so i would miss everyone too much because I would spent so little time at home. Secondly, i have a boyfriend and I cant imagine being apart for whole summer. Thirdly, I have prom in the middle of July. So it would be difficult to arrange travels to get everythere.

I feel like I wasted so much time worrying about being an adult that I ended up really ruining my ability to enjoy not being one, I felt and feel like I’m constantly wasting time and need to do something but I don’t know what or if I’d be able to. I just don’t know what to do and in what order or if I’m even capable. 

So my questions are: What all do I need to know in order to get by? 

And what are some good resources to learning?

262,"Alright reddit, here's the skinny on the sitch:

My friend lives with her partner of two years and presently, she's had enough with her partner's unchanging behavior and wants to move out and away from her partner. Unfortunately, she is very attached to their two cats, which they adopted since they were little. She's the primary caretaker of the cats, but they aren't actually registered in her name; they're registered in her partner's name.

Previously, she and her partner had a 4-month break that resulted in her personal belongings being held hostage by said partner. Somehow she was convinced that things would improve if she gave the other party a chance, and while things seemed to be positive in the beginning, their relationship eventually relapsed to what it was before.

My friend can move back in with her parents, but unfortunately, she can't even bring the cats to begin with because they're fighting with the pets that her parents already have. Additionally, I wouldn't put it past her partner to hold the pets hostage, since they're not registered to my friend, and also because her partner has done something like that before.

I am wondering if there's a way for my friend to obtain ownership of the cats without her partner being informed, because I am 100% sure that her partner will refuse to sign anything and hold the cats hostage if she tells her partner that she wants to break up, move out, and take the cats with her. Mind you, the partner barely takes care of them, and these two cats are like her children so she can't even fathom leaving them with somebody who clearly won't provide good care.",05May2018,1

265,"So I recently got an internship in a city and I  need help on where to live. I have basically two options. The location I'd be working at is right off the interstate that goes around the city. My internship goes from the middle of May to the middle of August.


The first: sublease from someone who goes to college in this city. This was my original plan because it was the most available option at the time. Rent would be $500 a month, two and a half months for $1250 total (Middle may to end of July). The biggest problem with this is that the college is literally on the other side of the city. To get to work I'd probably hop on the interstate and go around the city. Google maps says it takes 35 minutes, but I'm not sure what the traffic is like. I'll be honest, the main reason I want to live here is so I can download tinder with no strings attached. I'm a virgin, and I would probably never see these people again. I'd be right next to a college for the summer so why not. I've already started moving forward with subleasing from someone (He payed the subleasing fee, $400, and my dad filled out the guarantor agreement). Another problem with this is that, the lease would only go to the end of July, so I'd have to find somewhere to stay for the couple of weeks in August. I was originally gonna AirBnb, but I recently found out I could stay with my friend's Aunt and Uncle. 


This leads me to my next option: Staying with my friend's Aunt and Uncle. My friend told me about this after I had already moved forward with subleasing, meaning if I were to take this option, I'd probably reimburse the dude for the fee if it's nonrefundable. Rent would be the same $500, my friend said it would possible be less, but I'm not gonna count on it. The good thing about this is that I could stay here for the entire internship. They'd also be gone for 4 weeks of the time and said they weren't inclined to charge rent during that time because I'd be house sitting. Their house is out in one of the suburbs around the city, but the commute is just 15 minutes. However, I'm not sure how well the tinder thing would work out here.


I don't think the guarantor agreement binds me to anything because I haven't signed the lease agreement yet, but I'm not sure. In my head, the trade-off is tinder for commute time. I would appreciate any advice about this. Thank you!",05May2018,1

267,"I have a friend who we'll call Jade. To describe Jade, she's socially awkward but phone when there are other people around (well, around me). We were casual friends in high school and only talked with each other when there were mutual friend. We graduated and went our separate ways for a year.

May of last year came and I reconnected with her via text, but I met her at an unstable time for me. We had good conversations, and I talked to her often and her sister said that she really liked our conversations. Thing is I liked her at the time and I couldn't hold it in so I told her. She was cool about it and she seemed the same. Taking that, I opened up to her more because I consider her a good friend. She was supportive and like any friend. Time passed and our conversation for the month of July was 60-70% mutual interest and 30-40% of my depression. One day, I asked her why she rejected me: and I'm not gonna lie, I made a big deal about it. It was a long text about how long I thought about it and that it's burning in my mind, I told her embarrassing things how I've never told a girl I liked her before or even dated, and I said I was over it. I came off as paranoid and I asked if there was something about me that I could improve for the next girl. She said it wasn't me but she's never been interested in anyone. In our next conversation, I told her about my suicide attempt, but I didn't tell her why because it involved my family, and not her. But I didn't have anyone at the time besides her to talk to about it, and I didn't have a therapist and I had to wait to get back to college to get help. She didn't know what to say but she reiterated her advice from our talks. This all happened in early August.

Since then, she has not laughed via text with me since. I stopped talking to her about my depression so altogether immediately that and I apologized to her about my depressive episodes in November, and though we talked a lot more in the winter, she still hasn't laughed. It feels weird for me to just laugh so I tend to not laugh as much. There were glimpses that she cared about me before my fall semester started: asking me if anything interesting happened with me, asking how I was doing, etc. But the last time she asked that was months ago though we still talk weekly. I ask how she is doing everytime I talk to her and she seems to only talk about herself. 

However, when I asked her if she wanted to hang out with me, and she said it sounds good. She wishes me luck in my studies, and wishes a good day. And she's always been polite and never intentionally mean to me.

I want her to realize that it's okay to talk to me again like before, and to not worry about it. I convinced that it's because of the day I asked her about the rejection, but I don't know if it's also because of the day I told her about my attempt. I regret telling her during that time, and the way she's been treating me makes me feel like she doesn't care about me or  sees me as a friend.",05May2018,1
268,"First of all ever since I can remember I had huge social anxiety. I was not able to go anywhere without my mom I was too shy for everything. 

Now I am 18 (male, btw i raised up in a pretty fucked up society called Germany) and I have absolutely no self-confidence. It is so hard for me to keep living. 

* I am overweight (40-50 lbs too much) and 
* have perhaps one or two ""friends"" ( they are both very nerdy so it is impossible to do ""normal"" things with them ). I got invited to parties exactly 2 times. First time i drank too much alcohol -&gt; total disaster. Second time was okay though i also drank too much and annoyed anybody. 
* And since I was 14 I didnt invite any person to me at home.
* My marks in school are very poor and if I have bad luck I dont get my graduation. 
* I dont know my talents or the things i like. So i have no plan about prospective job and certainly not my vocation
* Since I was 5 I am addicted to food and playing video-games. 
* Since i was 13 porn addiction came across. 
* I dont even have a driver's license 
I dont see any hope for me. Why should I keep suffering so much? I just want a normal life I want a normal job and a woman who loves me nothing more. But there is no employer who would accept a person like me. (propably not even for a job as cashier) nor do I know a job which would not make me depressed. I just feel like trash and if i have fucked up everything in my life which could be fucked up. I just feel soo lonely especially the week-ends are hell for me because i have to deal with myself and my social anxiety. 
During the week it is also very though for me because in school I always feel like trash because i am in 3 of my courses the worst pupil.
It was always my dream to move to America because I like this country really much but even when I asked my mom about having an echange year there and she was surprised I became angry and was so demotivated that my anxiety overwhelmed. And since I am 18 it became so much harder to go there. I would not even mentally manage the bureaucratic stuff for a travel&amp;work year.

274,"Hello everybody,    
I need your help/advice/opinions please. I hope some of you read all of this, to really understand my predicament    
.        
I'm turning 27 in late July, I'm about to finish my Masters Degree and recently got back to living with my parents, because I couldn't afford the dorm anymore (no more grant)    
My mother has depression and has been jobless for 5-6 (or even more) years now, when she built our house with my dad she had an accident where she fell off the roof, now she has migraines and headaches almost every week. She has an extremely short fuse and can get angry or sad very quick.    
I few months ago, when I still was studying and living in the dorm, I decided to use the space in the attic of my parents house (which basically is the area of our house, but with roof slope) and build a flat up there, so I can be with my mother.    
Reason being, that she always tells me how good it is, when I'm home and how it's good for her and since I've gone back home she keeps telling me how hard the last 5 years were, because I wasn't home. So I was thinking it would be better if I was back home.    
So after a few months back home, I discovered that my naive way of thinking was false and she hasn't been noticably better. Her mood has changed a bit, but not much, my grandmother, which lives next door told me that, yes indeed, she got a bit better.    
But basically she still is really moody and can get unbearable from time to time.    
.    
That's the premise so far, now I was thinking about getting my own flat, because I can't stand the bickering of my parents and the constant negative attitude of my mother, I really would like to help her, but I just can't see myself living under the same roof, escpecially for the rest of my life.    
I just can't get myself to tell her, the main problem is, that since a few years it always seems like there is only bad things happening to my family, earlier this year the mother of my father (which is living somewhere else) had an accident and went fully demented, some people close to my mother died, a few years back she had suffered from acute hearing loss and now has to wear a hearing aid, recently my father had a minor car crash/fender bender, which is also costing money, the list goes on and on.    
It would have so many benefits of having my own place, I wouldn't have to be a monetary nuisance for my parents, because they have money problems anyway, I could take all my stuff and clear out at least one and a half rooms of our house, which btw is overfilled with useless stuff and trash (I think my mother is borderline hording aswell, at least it feels like it sometimes) this is also the reason why the building of the flat in the attic is delayed, because there is still so much trash and old stuff up there which she doesn't want to throw away, because of reasons    
another benefit would be, that I wouldn't bother my father with building the flat, since we wanted to do it ourselves (because of money) and now that he has his demented mother and my depressed mother to deal with I want to help him out aswell of course....
I just can't find the heart or the right time, to tell my mother that I don't want to live with her and risk breaking her heart even more so to speak....    
I really really need some opinions and possible solutions to this predicament.    
But please understand, that I myself understand that I'm old enough to make my own decisions and all of this ""you are your own man"" talk, I just fear the consequences of those decisions, mostly regarding the well being of my mother.    
I was thinking about talking to her shrink, suggesting a meeting where I'd come too and getting the shrink to say something like ""It's better for you if your son isn't living with you""    
I don't know if that is any good since she could lose faith and trust into her shrink and blame her for this idea and.... I just don't know",05May2018,1

Now fast forward to last month when we started working closely again. I mean he doesn’t talk to me much but there are some instances when we have a meeting and sometimes there are no chairs left, out of all the chairs to lean on (idk why he likes to lean on them in the first place) he has always chosen my chair to lean on and it feels quite intimate, to me at least. A friend told me maybe it’s to intimidate me? I don’t know about that. And we’ve talked 3x on Google Hangouts which is a work related thing but it’s like a dead end thing like he’s not interested? He doesn’t talk to me much in real life unless it’s something about work and it’s always brief. 

Anyway, today we were on the same elevator and and I was looking down on the floor but he stood so close to me I couldn’t help but look at him and he gave me a smile that made me melt. Like why doesn’t he talk to me and then he does cute shit like that? I talked to my friend and he said he definitely likes me because “actions speak louder than words”.

276,"So first post here, hopefully I get the formatting correct. Also heads up, this is gonna be a long post. I’ve been trying for a long time to figure out myself, and also my relationship with my dad. He’s always been a weekend dad, his work requires him to travel very frequently to central and South America. When I was younger my dad was a huge jerk, mostly because of his job. He’s a business man and been working at the same place for roughly 15 years. Before then, he was in between jobs and was trying to create his own business, which didn’t take off. That was probably the worst time in my life. I dreaded my dad coming home each weekend, even though I greeted him very excitedly most of the time. There was always something for him to pick on that me or my sister or my mother did wrong, and he blow it out of proportion and yell at us about it. He was very angry and a habitual drinker. If I did badly on a math test we would yell and get mad at me for failing to do well, I would be grounded and not helped with the problems. As and Bs were the only acceptable grades, C or lower meant I was a failure. It took until late middle school for me, my mom, and my teachers to convince him that a C was still a passing grade. Between this time and my entry to high school he suffered a heart attack due to bad stress and bad eating. It happened on Christmas Eve, and I remember not being terribly bothered because I wanted to open my presents. That memory still bothers me, I wish at the time that I was worried for him, but I just wanted to open the damn presents which feels very selfish. Anyways after that he changed, started eating better and exercising, and he became less stressed and started acting better with our family.  Through high school my grades got worse, and I got punished more frequently. The only thing I cared about through middle and high school was video games, so naturally that’s what they took away. I feel they were perfectly reasonable in doing so, but sometimes it felt a little bit excessive. I didn’t make many friends, only 2, and I’ve also been pretty fat some I was a kid (had to take steroids for asthma). My dad is a narcissist for sure, but we don’t dare bring it up to him. It still feels like he’s putting me down, and I’ve tried to stop being angry and resentful at him, which has worked well except I’m still a little resentful. Now I’m a sophomore at my community college because I flopped at a bigger university and had to come back home. I was depressed and drank heavily in college (my family has a history of addiction, not that I think I am addicted) but I quit when I came back home. I still play video games a lot, my parents have a big issue with it. I agree with them to an extent on how much time I play, but it’s one of the few things jay can hold my attention. Currently I’m getting tested for ADHD, I am pretty sure I am inattentive type. I’m pretty smart, but it’s hard to remember things, I have to read concepts a few times to understand, i get distracted in conversation and in general, I daydream, and I have most of the other symptoms listed for ADHD inattentive type in the DSM5. My father does not believe I have ADHD, and refuses to even consider it until the testing comes back. He has set up a lot of systems in my life for structure, exercising and doing hobbies and stuff, and punishments and rewards to follow those activities. We have done it so many times in so many different ways and it never sticks. I have tried to follow his plans because I think they are good, but I can never stick to hem because I get bored and unmotivated to do it. He believes what he does about me, I am lazy and I am apathetic and a liar, and I am not the person he wants me to be. I recognize that I am not the person I want to be either, I want to be better but wanting to be a better person is not enough. I believe that I will be diagnosed with ADHD, and I will get medication and that will help me to set good habits and be motivated and actually take steps to become a better person. I am so tired of him controlling my life with rewards like using my computer or punishments like no car, and both of these don’t bother me anymore, the rewards and the punishments aren’t worth following the plan, which should be it’s own reward for completing things anyways. So, I know that was really long and disorganized, but from what I’ve said do you guys think I am lazy and spoiled? Do I have a serious personality problem and something crazy has to happen for me to shape up, like my dad has to die or I have to go join the army or something to get motivated and disciplined? Or do you think maybe I do have ADHD and getting medicated will allow me to start acting and form good habits and be motivated and get my life together? Also if you need more detail or something let me know I’m sure I left something important out or it was disorganized or something. Thanks for reading, i know it was long and awfully organized.

277,"Idk where to post this so i guess ill just do it here. It's currently 11 pm. Will update with an edit if anything happens.

So basically my parents are constantly working. I'm not going to give too much away but they are in the food industry which can be very stressful.

Lately my mother and I have been butting heads. The point where shouting fits are a common occurrence in our household. I've figured that it's just the stress and exhaustion getting to her. It's to the point where she'll scream at you for simply not answering a text message in time or not hearing when she calls you. I'm in my teenage years and I've always assumed that ""oh it's just my hormones of course im going to argue "". But at this point I'm worried about her.

She keeps threatening that I'm ""going to end up killing her""(Idk if she means that I'm going to drive her to suicide or?). But anyways back to the main point.

Tonight my dad came home from work at about 10 because my mom got her monthly day off and he took over for her. My mom tried to call him to see how work was going (since she's always there and wanted to know how the staff were holding up, etc.) but my dad's phone was on mute so he couldn't answer.

By the time my dad got home there was a huge argument between them about how he ""always ignores her"". (Keep in mind my mom was drunk at this stage). She got super upset and my dad just went upstairs to bed.

About 10 minutes ago I hear a weird slashing kind of sound so I go down stairs to investigate. It turns out my mom was sharpening a knife. I felt like a wave of pure terror had rinsed over me. I asked her what she was doing and she gave me a drunken look and said ""Sharpening a knife."" I asked her why and she didn't reply.

I have no idea if it's just some sort of weird stress-relief thing or if she's planning something. I've been sobbing in my bedroom for 10 minutes typing this and flinching at every sound I hear from downstairs.

I love my parents so much and they mean the world to me. Idk if I'm over reacting or not. All I know is that I'm scared.

Not sure if I should call someone or talk to my dad/brother. I'm literally frozen in fear and I have no further resort other than Reddit. Hopefully I'll get some help here",05May2018,1

So I walk out of the house And was Looking around town what to buy and then i see a restaurant notice said fried chicken 6 pieces just $10 dollars I got in and buy some

Now I remember what happened before with my step brother

I was thinking how can I get this chicken in my room I see a old lady with a two small boxes

I ask can i have one please She said yes I put the chicken in the small box

I got home My step brother ask what in the box I smiled and said it was empty I run to my room but dad was in it Dad ask what in the box and said the same thing

Now I was thinking where can I eat this chicken and it come to me The toilet

I got in and start eating Five minutes I was done put the mess in the box and put that in the backyard

Now going up to my room Dad look at me and said come what on your mouth He look at it and said it chicken

It's a bullshit excuse, we hardly ever order anything online. I have no idea why he does it except possibly getting some kind of enjoyment out of it somehow. That's the kind of person he is.

It makes me nervous because he's a fat old man. He's not intimidating. There's high crime rates in this city, we don't have guns or a security system or anything. I'm only 5'5"", my mom is sick and frail, so he's actually the strongest person here and he's hardly ever home. If someone wanted to rob us for example they wouldn't face many obstacles once the door was open.

""Just move lol"" is not helpful advice. Is there anything I can tell him that will actually make him think about what he's doing? Whenever I voice my concerns he blows me off and makes fun of me. I think he can't accept that this neighborhood has gone to shit. Or maybe he really does think he's intimidating.

284,"I was in a really difficult situation in my teenage years, my mother forced me to move abroad and I didn't make any friends there at first, and then I just had the reputation for being 'the creep'.

The few friends I have are all from my country, after I came back we did hang out some, but the years without friends there, and particularly the last year when I didn't even have internet at home, so I was further disconnected, drove me a bit insane. I even got prescribed meds for what's killing me inside when I went to see a psychiatrist, but they don't help.

This year I'm going uni, it's a difficult time for me, because a part of my condition is crippling agoraphobia, which I can overcome, and I do, at a cost of migraines. And I would just like at least one of the people, my childhood best friend, my two best friends from early school, anyone to be there for me. But everyone has just given up on me, apart from one friend who's too depressed now, as he failed uni this year, and with him I understand why he wants distance, he doesn't log onto Facebook or anything often now.

I sometimes just want to talk to someone who knows me to feel normal, like I'm not losing it. But I have 5 people who have distanced themselves from me now, and I feel like I am losing it. I'm not depressed, I like to think my mind doesn't have the capacity anymore to handle depression. 

I'm sharing my mind with a kind of ""internal Tourette"", it's a type of OCD. And it takes a lot of effort to just think. What I am afraid of is that this insanity (some thoughts are amazingly profane, downright psychopathic) has leaked to my personality.

I mean, its such a difficult and personal issue, I don't expect anyone to help me. But I do need help.",05May2018,1
285,"Hello everybody,    
I need your help/advice/opinions please. I hope some of you read all of this, to really understand my predicament    
.        
I'm turning 27 in late July, I'm about to finish my Masters Degree and recently got back to living with my parents, because I couldn't afford the dorm anymore (no more grant)    
My mother has depression and has been jobless for 5-6 (or even more) years now, when she built our house with my dad she had an accident where she fell off the roof, now she has migraines and headaches almost every week. She has an extremely short fuse and can get angry or sad very quick.    
I few months ago, when I still was studying and living in the dorm, I decided to use the space in the attic of my parents house (which basically is the area of our house, but with roof slope) and build a flat up there, so I can be with my mother.    
Reason being, that she always tells me how good it is, when I'm home and how it's good for her and since I've gone back home she keeps telling me how hard the last 5 years were, because I wasn't home. So I was thinking it would be better if I was back home.    
So after a few months back home, I discovered that my naive way of thinking was false and she hasn't been noticably better. Her mood has changed a bit, but not much, my grandmother, which lives next door told me that, yes indeed, she got a bit better.    
But basically she still is really moody and can get unbearable from time to time.    
.    
That's the premise so far, now I was thinking about getting my own flat, because I can't stand the bickering of my parents and the constant negative attitude of my mother, I really would like to help her, but I just can't see myself living under the same roof, escpecially for the rest of my life.    
I just can't get myself to tell her, the main problem is, that since a few years it always seems like there is only bad things happening to my family, earlier this year the mother of my father (which is living somewhere else) had an accident and went fully demented, some people close to my mother died, a few years back she had suffered from acute hearing loss and now has to wear a hearing aid, recently my father had a minor car crash/fender bender, which is also costing money, the list goes on and on.    
It would have so many benefits of having my own place, I wouldn't have to be a monetary nuisance for my parents, because they have money problems anyway, I could take all my stuff and clear out at least one and a half rooms of our house, which btw is overfilled with useless stuff and trash (I think my mother is borderline hording aswell, at least it feels like it sometimes) this is also the reason why the building of the flat in the attic is delayed, because there is still so much trash and old stuff up there which she doesn't want to throw away, because of reasons    
another benefit would be, that I wouldn't bother my father with building the flat, since we wanted to do it ourselves (because of money) and now that he has his demented mother and my depressed mother to deal with I want to help him out aswell of course....
I just can't find the heart or the right time, to tell my mother that I don't want to live with her and risk breaking her heart even more so to speak....    
I really really need some opinions and possible solutions to this predicament.    
But please understand, that I myself understand that I'm old enough to make my own decisions and all of this ""you are your own man"" talk, I just fear the consequences of those decisions, mostly regarding the well being of my mother.    
I was thinking about talking to her shrink, suggesting a meeting where I'd come too and getting the shrink to say something like ""It's better for you if your son isn't living with you""    
I don't know if that is any good since she could lose faith and trust into her shrink and blame her for this idea and.... I just don't know    
.    
TLDR:    
my depressive mother is clingy and I don't want to hurt her, in fact I want to help her, but I can't keep living with her and want my own flat, how can I tell her without making things worse?",05May2018,1
286,"hi all-
i have a close friend who is a girl (im a guy) and she’s leaving for college end of July. we are super close and have a strong friendship. i want to get her a special gift before she goes away as a special reminder of our time together. idk if this helps but i have admitted to her that i have feelings for her but she doesn’t want to date because she’s going away for college relatively soon, but we are essentially “dating” and i can tell she has feelings for me too. so here’s some things we have in common:
-hiking
-tex mex food (american style tacos etc)
-music
-spending quality time together
-we are both christian
-being outside
-scary movies
I want to get her a little something that won’t be too much for her to take along to college. i am planning to write a very heartfelt letter along with it so something that could maybe compliment that? idk guys i’m not very creative when it comes to this stuff so any help is appreciated. but basically something super special is what i’m looking for. price isn’t an issue. thanks in advance.",05May2018,1

288,"I started talking to this guy over a dating app about 3 weeks ago.  He's a little bit older than me, had great taste in music, funny, had a good job, and didn't live with his parents. He seemed very polite and eager to take me out. I usually have a rule where I talk to guys for about 2 weeks because when they get comfortable, its easier for red flags to pop up. I'd rather not deal with any of that in person.  

Usually, around that 2 week mark, is when they start spilling. For example, one guy told me he just got out of jail (6 mo) and is on house arrest for assault... another guy had 5 kids, all from different mothers and child support ate up his entire check.

Anyway so 2 weeks pass and this guy is too good to be true. I got a gut feeling; Something wasnt right. He was getting antzy to meet me and had told me he dropped every other girl he was talking to.  I googled him. His name came up in about 4 different links all pertaining to narcotics.  He had been arrested on 8 different occasions for narcotics possession or paraphernalia. His last arrest was November 2017!! He had also posted on public forums about his experience living in group houses. (His last post was 9 days ago!) Needless to say, I was  freaked. I have dealt with addicts and I know all about the addictive personality traits, which he was clearly showing to me. I tried to slowly fade away, and became busy with work.  

He caught on and sent me this huge novella about how could I just ghost him etc. He wasnt accepting anything I would say so I just decided to tell him the truth. 
He said that it's his personal business and I had no right to snoop like that. He then proceeded to call me every name in the book and threatened me with bodily harm. 

When I told my friend she was upset with me! She agreed with him and said I ""shouldn't have been snooping and should have respected his privacy long enough for him to eventually tell me. I may missed out on a great guy...who just so happens to have a problem"".

I don't feel as if I did anything wrong. I feel like I saved myself weeks, maybe months of my time and dodged a huge bullet, seeing that he also showed an abusive side.  Personally, good for him for trying to get clean and live a good life. I just can't deal with that.",05May2018,278

The problem: I can’t speak to him, can’t look him in the eyes and he always says, “I have an attitude with him”.

I know I have an attitude with him because the second I moved in, he complained about me to my whole family even though they was lies, he lied about me all the time, and honestly he’s never said anything “positive” about me to anyone. Further more, I always hear him talking about me, for example: I woke up, my dad was on the phone to my mum about me and college, he said, “apparently his grades are this that and the other, it looks like they’re giving them out to everyone for free”.

My mum went into hospital (seriously Ill), the way I found out she was in hospital was by my dad saying, “myname, it looks like you’re going to be an orphan”

Those are all the reasons why I have a bad attitude with him and can nearly speak to him.

I can move past all this easily but my mind just isn’t doing anything, just remaining the same.

So how can I learn to talk to him and thus improve our father son relationship?

295,"The scoop is essentially this. I'm graduating with a joint undergraduate program in Business (Accounting) and Sociology. Technically it's two separate bachelors degrees – BBA and BA. Accounting is what I started in exclusively, and I consider it to be my 'main' program, but I love sociology too.

Graduation at my college is in mid June. The sociology grad ceremony is on Wednesday. The business grad is on friday. You can choose to go to one or the other, or go to both. My initial plan was to just go to the friday grad, because I know way more people in the business faculty. However, I unfortunately found out that my parents are leaving for an overseas trip on Thursday!! Obviously I was angry about it, but it would cost way too much to push back the trip.

For some reference, I don't have any real true friends going to the business grad either. My closest 5 or so friends all graduated before or after. I'm graduating a year late due to the combined program. However, I do probably have 50 or so acquaintances or people that I consider to be 'friends' – just not ones I'd grab beers with. Obviously I'd like to see them, but I feel like I should be framing this decision around the people that matter – like my parents and grandparents.

Also, I go to a commuter school and most people are staying here.

So my dilemma is this: should I just go to the Wednesday sociology grad, even though I don't really feel like that's where I belong? Or do I go to both, so I can walk the stage twice? I'd definitely choose the latter, but I have a new job and I'd have to get days approved. Not only that, but I feel like it would be very anti-climatic to go through the whole rigmarole twice.

297,"I have very little self esteem.  I guess the logical response would be, ""Then stop beating yourself up so much!""  But it's hard to find anything to feel good about myself about.  It's all stuff that other people have accomplished and then some at my age anyway.  I am a total failure.  I can sense something is wrong in my mind, and people are looking down on me often.  I often feel as if I am going insane.  I also have few interests but I have some things I want to accomplish in life to make me existentially satisfied, and having a boyfriend is one of them.  Still, I can't help but feel that he won't have all the mental problems I have (if he does, I don't think I'd be attracted to him in the first place).  I want to ""sell myself"" to someone relationship-wise but I feel that even though I like some interesting music and know enough about how the world works to talk to someone in a bar, beyond that, I am fucking boring as shit.  I don't know how to fix this.  What even is a hobby?  I don't like movies.  I don't like TV.  That's passive stuff anyway.  Input, not output.  And since I'll be a college student I'll be busy with classes and need to really triage what I want to spend time on.  All this to say, I don't think I'm worthy of being in a relationship.  But I really need that emotional support right now.  I need someone to love and take care of me.  To lift me out of my hole of low self-esteem.  But I am so flawed, why would anyone want that?

298,"She's not having second thoughts per se but it seems like she's been pretty combative about it whenever I try to give her updates of my progress. She told me I can do whatever I want, and it's my choice and it's my money but a little bit of insight from her would really help. Unfortunately, she's not the type of person who has that kind of capacity. She's family though and she knew me since I was two. She even took care of me when I was little. She lives with her three children, the children (my cousins) are hitting their young adult life, I also grew up with them at one point so we're really adamant when it comes to our family relationship. But she's a widow and had to work extra to pay the bills.

She's sometimes super busy, and she often has to work a little more just so she can pay the mortgage. When I move in, I assumed I will be rent-free for just a time so I can make the money back, she seemed fond of this idea because we also noted that I can possibly be better off with this so I can finally finish college and get my degree.

After my brief call with her regarding the painter and electrician I hired, she seemed quite combative. ""You do whatever you want, it's your money"". I try to reason out telling her that I intend on adding a standard sized fridge, she didn't like the idea and now somehow said that I could be living there for free plus the fridge is a terrible idea since her electricity and power will climb up. I understand, but temporarily, a renovated guest house should at least have a fridge... But I think I can come to terms with her on a small fridge and air conditioning, it's going to be like a microwave in the summer! 

I've already put in a lot of effort and time trying to organize and renovate the guesthouse. I don't think there's any other option. The only deal I need to get is to have a rent that's far lower than what I'm paying right now, and perhaps a peace period. I'm paying four hundred for my own room right now, it's far from my college, roommates always having a party, I've had enough of this. I've put in three hundred, plus eight hundred (for the final repairs) on the shed. This means I would need at least 3-5 months to make my minimum wage savings back. But I know I'm also essentially helping her, even spending my own money renovating the yard, upping the value of her property. The shed was there and it was working before her husband passed away, and I even lived in it during summer times.

The only other question is, if I can put a small fridge, a working a/c unit, my computer for studies and the like, a couple of lights and a mini portable heater for cold nights. Can I somehow get the estimate so I can slip her the paper on what the electricity/power will cost her? I called her while she was working, she might just feel hassled and pressured but she's often supportive and sweet. She's been dealt with a lot though...

Is this a good idea? I have no other choice to move into. Not another place, problem is, I might not even find a place as cheap as I have it right now but the stagnancy and the busy house really slows me down. Right now they're having a party for a friend I don't even know... Life is though and I need advice...",05May2018,1

302,"I say friend... but she’s my boss, known her 6 years in two different work environments. So, her situation is ex partner appears to be practically psychopathic, they split three years ago after what appeared to be a controlling and abusive relationship where boss lady was the victim/survivor. I think she has PTSD from this. Ex is currently taking her to court over fabricated money the Ex says is owed.

Boss lady... so my work day typically is, two hours of listening to her personal problems, maybe 5 minutes of my problems. Spending time with her is often like walking on eggshells, it becomes safer to just stay quiet and listen to her. She has no patience for others. Often she complains of people being difficult, uncontactable, uncooperative, (work relationships) and ignoring and difficult friends, or that she doesn’t have friends or no one wants to go do things or no one wants to contact her back with social media (personal relationships). I have relationships with some of the same people and have none or a small amount of these issues. I’ve had conversations with colleagues at both workplaces and also friends who share similar feelings to me - shut up and stay quiet. On my worst days I’ve called in sick because I cannot spend time around her when my own mental health is a bit fragile.

One friend has tried to address this, after dealing 4years+ with the behaviour. I heard both sides of the encounter, boss lady basically said friend was unhelpful and not on her side, friend said she tried her best to explain the issues. Friend no longer talks to her after this attempt. Heard through a work colleague (who I barely know and haven’t spoken about boss lady with) that work colleague’s friend is ignoring boss lady and advised to just shut up and stay quiet at work to avoid the stress. I’ve tried broaching the topic with boss lady a number of times, she just doesn’t understand what it is she she is doing and doesn’t want to give the topic a second’s worth of attention. I’ve suggested counseling, she insists she can’t afford it. 

So from my perspective her behaviour is isolating her from almost everyone around her, and she won’t have a bar of it. Another thought I have is that she appears to slowly be trusting me more and I wonder if just relentlessly being there for her is the only solution to her helping herself... that, and time... and just trying to accept her just the way she is. Or wait until we aren’t working together and write her a big long letter.

Personally I can handle her, so it’s not that I’m wanting to resolve my own shit, it’s just I see her with this negative pattern that makes her suffer.

306,"I rent an apartment in a multi family apartment building owned by a giant corporation in Florida. Since I've moved in, there has been constant problems and issues that the leasing manager has refused to fix, many of which are code and safety violations. 

Anyway, now that I've given you that background, here is my main issue I'm writing about. Because of all the problems, I can't continue renting here. When I signed my lease, I was given two options for early termination of lease. One was to pay two months rent and the other was to give notice and then the apartment would put my apartment on the market and rent it out for my move out date. That's the option I chose and gave my notice for May 20. Management said that someone already filled out the application and gave a deposit for my place. I asked if that means I'm out of my lease for May 20, and the the leasing agent said that I'm not out until the next tenant signs a lease. Yesterday I went in to ask if the next tenant has signed the lease, and the manager was there and said that even if the next tenant signs the lease, she will not let me out of my lease until the next person physically moves in that day. I said that that completely contradicted what I was originally told and it makes no sense that they would let the next tenant  out of the lease they have already signed and leave me responsible. She said that's what the rules are. So today I went in again to the office to discuss this because it doesn't make any sense to me. I was speaking with the leasing agent in a very normal and calm tone and saying that im confused why I received two separate  answers when the manager comes out screaming at me, ""you were just in here yesterday! Why are you coming in again to ask when I already told you. I'm the manager, this is my property, I make the rules and thus is my business decision"". I was standing there shocked as she screamed at me with such contempt and bullied me into silence. It was completely inappropriate and disproportionate. This is not the first time it's happened, but this was the final straw. 

At this point, I still have more questions about how this termination of leAse will work, and I feel I have the right to discuss without being screamed at and bullied. But I'm unsure how to proceed because I'm afraid of being bullied again and I've heard horror stories from other tenants of things she's done to retaliate against them including false allegations, and I'm worried she could make false allegations against me that I threatened her or some other bullshit to save her own ass. There were no other witnesses in the lobby except the sales agent, manager, and i, but there are security cameras. 


I am unsure if I should email her saying I am not okay with the way I was treated, and explaining that I was calm and rational and her reaction was unprofessional, bullying, and disproportionate, then asking my questions about the end of lease process and saying that I am not comfortable going into the office again so answers must be provided via email. This gives me the benefit of being the first one to have in writing to protect myself against any false allegations from the manager and have the information I need to make sure they are following the policy when I move out. The only issue with this is things can misinterpreted in writing and I am concerned about retaliation like her making up bs noise violations (although the timing would be suspect as no violations until after I sent this email?)

OR 

if I should have a friend come with me as a witness and speak with the manager directly about what happened, why it wasn't appropriate, why I won't tolerate it anymore, why I feel threatened now, and why i need and have a right to the answers to my questions. I would record the conversation. 

I'm just trying to keep peace until I move out, but it seems the manager is determined that that shouldn't happen, so at this point, im just trying to protect myself. So I'm wondering what you all think. ",05May2018,1

308,"Right so I've been with my girlfriend for more than 3.5 years now and things were great but recently I feel like she's been controlling/guilt tripping me into doing what she wants at the expense of my happiness and comfort.

We're both in university in different cities and with exam season approaching I'm staying at hers till it's time for my exams. Usually I would like to stay in my university's city after my exams to chill out and spend time with friends but she guilt tripped me into booking a train down to visit her the day after my exams end so I can help her revise for her exams which end a couple of days after mine do. Whenever I try and bring it up she says stuff like ""if you want to stay at yours you can I don't want to keep you here if you don't want to stay"" which makes me feel awful for wanting some time to myself.

And while we're staying at her place (which is a standard single bed university accomodation) we're literally in each others sight 24/7 but that's not enough for her. After a long day of studying I like to relax and watch some YouTube videos and have a beer to relax or whatever. She doesn't let me watch my videos because she wants us to watch something together so we end up watching whatever she wants to. And as for the beer apparently having 1 beer after a long day makes me an alcoholic.

I really do love and care about her but recently I feel like putting her happiness and comfort first means sacrificing mine. And if I ever put myself first she says I don't care about her or that I'm insensitive. 

P.S. I had to stay in the library late to get the time to post this without her asking who I'm talking to or why I'm typing so much",05May2018,1

310,"My boyfriend (17) and I (18) have been dating for a little over 4 months now. Think of every piece of advice you’ve been told on what to look for in an SO, and he’s the human embodiment. He’s incredibly sweet, ambitious, loving, etc., treats me like I’m the greatest thing that’s happened to him, and his personality balances me out perfectly, so we both have grown in places we are typically weak. We just work really well together, everyone around us has noticed it too, and we love each other and plan to eventually move in together. 

The problem is his parents. They’re incredibly strict, monitoring our text messages and how much we hang out. I’m already legally an adult, so to me it seems childish, but that’s how it’s been his entire life. He started sneaking over to my house, got caught, and his parents kicked him out, so he came to live with us for about three weeks. He planned to stay all summer at our house, and he was finally becoming more independent and free of his parents, which made him so much happier and honestly much more attractive to me.   

Earlier on this week was our 4 month anniversary, and we decided to stay in, watch some movies, and get stoned. Right before we went to bed, he got up to brush his teeth, climbed up on our toilet seat to reach for a washcloth, and fell backwards on his head. Cue immediate swarm of EMTs. He was conscious, he could talk, but he had a bad concussion and a lot of bleeding. He ended up needing 4 staples, but luckily there was no permanent injury, and he should be fine in a few weeks. 

But as soon as he was let out of the hospital, his parents made him come back home. He never finished the emancipation process, and since he is underage (by like 5 months) he had no choice. They took all means of him communicating, told our family that if he sneaks out to see me or I show up at their house they will call the police, and they’ve dedicated these next two weeks to “whipping him in shape” before college. Luckily he found an old computer to secretly send me updates on how he’s doing, but they’ve literally taken all his possessions from him (his acne products he laid for are a “privilege” he doest deserve), he can’t do anything (ability to play a game, walk outside, read, etc. are also privileges), they won’t give him any pain medication and they won’t let him fall asleep.   

I feel horrible for him. I don’t know what to do. Not only is this having a huge effect on him and his confidence, it’s putting a strain on our relationship. I love him, but I don’t have time all day to reassure him that I won’t move on to someone else even if I can’t see him, and to convince him of his potential after his parents put him down (I do do this quite often, but not enough ). His parents have been trying to convince him I’m toxic and to basically submit to them, and he’s not doing very well at subverting it. He’s expressed that he thinks I’m going to forget him, that he might not want to move in together anymore, and that he’s jealous I’m having a really amazing end of senior year experience while he’s stuck in something worse than prison. 

I’m not really sure what to do. Do I play along with his parents? Get mad at them? Talk to him a lot to encourage the love of my life in what seems a horrible situation? Or concentrate more on finals and spending time with friends before I graduate high school? I’m really lost and confused.  ",05May2018,1
311,"Approximately 6 months ago, I started talking to this girl. At this time, I was suicidal, self harming and depressed. Approximately 2 months ago, I started to date this girl. At this time, I was feeling good. Approximately a week ago, she dumped me to go and make out with another lad.


I'm ruined. I'm so angry and depressed all the time, I feel like I'm just used a place holder. I don't believe anything anyone says, I don't trust anything anyone says. A relationship that seemed perfect on the surface, all I needed to do was scratch away and it's all fucking lies, pure fucking lies covered in love.


I know this sounds like a poem. It's just that I don't trust anyone I know in real life. Every nice thing she said about me, everytime she said she loved me, every time she said I was the best. I didn't believe it at the time but I thought atleast she cares and wants me to be happy but now I know she didn't. All it took was one guy to appear and in less than a week I was next to nothing.

I’m not really sure what to do with my life right now. It’s the spring of my junior year of high school. I’ve been on and off feeling hopeless and bleak since December, and it was getting better and I thought it would go away but in these past few weeks things seem worse. I’ve never been the best student but I get good grades, I always do my homework and I’ve been really struggling lately. I’ve been blowing off my homework or just doing a crappy job. I honestly can’t motivate myself to do anything but lie around all day and go on my phone. I can’t focus in school, which isn’t really new but it’s making it really hard to take tests. I’m in a bad mood almost everyday, a lot of the time it’s for no reason. I have dreams for the future and a passion but that doesn’t seem to excite me as much anymore. I spend a lot of the time thinking things like “I should die”, but I don’t actually mean it. I guess I tried to hurt myself once a few weeks ago but it was only with a pen and water bottle and I didn’t actually end up causing myself any harm. The only times I’ve really felt happy these past few weeks are when I’m drawing or hanging out with my crush. I’m not really sure what’s wrong with me, I’m not suicidal or anything but I hate myself a lot and my selm esteem is in the gutter for absolutely no reason. I wish I was anyone else and I don’t really know why. I don’t want to die but I wish I could cease to exsist, if that makes sense. I’m surrounded by the most amazing friends and family but I still feel like life is meaningless. I can’t be motivated to do anything anymore.

I often feel as if I am going insane. I also have few interests but I have some things I want to accomplish in life to make me existentially satisfied, and having a boyfriend is one of them. Still, I can't help but feel that he won't have all the mental problems I have (if he does, I don't think I'd be attracted to him in the first place).
