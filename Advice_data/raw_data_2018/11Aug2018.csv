0,"So i was basically texting mg crush when she asked to see my new school i.d. and i responded with ""you first"". It's been a while since she hasn't responded and i have no clue how to make it seem normal again. Any ideas?",11Aug2018,1
2,"Today, I walked into my Dad's house, upstairs, into my bathroom, to find that it had been painted from a pale pink to a dark grey without my knowing. I called my dad out on it, because c'mon, that's my space, he can't just go and change it on me without so much as a heads up first. Not cool. He kept insisting that its ""his house"" so why should he have to ask me first. Which was mildly infuriating. Because yes, while he may may the mortgage, its still my house too, and that bathroom is my space. It has been for fourteen years.

So, question time. I'm seriously contemplating just buying new paint and fixing it myself. This isn't gonna fly with me, nope not at all. What do you think, should I?

In all seriousness, I really hate the grey and do think that it's really unfair that he went ahead and repainted without asking me at all. And that he's treating it like its no big deal, especially considering how badly I often do with unwanted change. It doesn't feel like my space anymore, and it' kind of claustrophobic in there now. But, I know that if I do repaint it myself, it probably won't go over well with him. ",11Aug2018,1

13,"For years I have been waiting for a specific company to come to my area. That company is now here and they have hired me as one of their opening employees. I would be in an hourly position with hopes for advancement. They said there was a lot of opportunity to move into management, but sometimes things don't work the way they are talked about in an interview. 
  
  I am very excited and called my coworker to tell her the news that I would be giving my notice tomorrow to take this job. She then told me that the gm had talked to her yesterday and they are firing a manager so they can move me into management. To be fair, I have not officially gotten the offer.

  I'm now so confused. The reason I even looked for another job was because of all the problems the manager (that's getting fired) was causing. And I wasn't getting promoted since there was a full management staff. But the company I just got hired at is a big name, something I would be proud to tell people about. I just don't know how long it would take to work into management, which is my goal wherever I end up.

  Now I am worried about what the future holds. If I do well at the new place, it's a no-brainer. But many more hours no matter what which affects quality of life. 

  Any advice on how to decide, assuming I get the offer and the salary is enough?",11Aug2018,1
15,"So I’ve (19F) decided to finally take the first few steps and finally get some help for my (possible) social anxiety and panic attacks. I’m deciding to go see someone about it. So this is where it might sound really stupid, but I don’t know whether to go with going to my doctor for it or just getting it done at my community college.

With the regular counselling, I could get it right away (minus waiting lists and stuff). Money also might not be an issue as I do have other disabilities. There would also be more sessions in some situations. The only bad thing would be telling my parents why I need the help. I live with them and I kind of depend on them to book appointments and drive me there, so I would have to tell them. I’d rather not do that but if I really must, I’ll figure out a way to bite the bullet.

Then there’s college counselling. Depending on the waiting list for regular counselling, I might be able to jump into this quicker. It’s free here and I found their number and email on the college website. I would also be able to keep these issues secret from my parents. The only bad thing would be that it would have less sessions/resources, so I don’t know if I’d get the best.

28,"I've been with a fortune 500 company for almost two years as an intern, my dad works here and everyone knows me very well. I get paid decently and the hours are somewhat flexible. My major is geology, which the company does have positions for, but I am in a business position for process improvement. I don't mind the work, however my manager micromanages everything. Me and my coworker can go weeks without her having any issues and suddenly she's making stuff up about us misrepresenting the company or lying about our time and redoing all of our work. She's also a very vengeful person so it's hard to bring this up to upper management. 

While it is a relaxed environment for the most part it can also be very stressful and it isn't even in my field of study. Most of our interns switch groups every few terms, I haven't done so because the upper management really likes my work. I do like the leaders within upper management, but I hate working within my group. It's getting to the point where I hate the company and basically would consider myself a disgruntled intern. I have repeatedly asked HR about positions within my field, but I don't want to get too pushy and have my manager get wind of it and assume it's because of her (even though it is)

Recently HR told me she would have to approve of me moving to a different department. I'm very tempted to tell them I want out, however I'm worried about the risk of her saying no and then letting me go (which is a move she would pull). There aren't many internships in my area for my major, especially any with such flexible hours. Should I tough it out for a year or two more? Or should I just say F it and risk losing this position for the possibility of being happier in a different role? I want to say I don't care if I don't work at this company, however I also am struggling to find any other opportunities, even with pay cuts.",11Aug2018,2
32,"Hey, I need some advice because I’m having trouble understanding why I’m having such an emotional reaction to this! 

Some back story: I’ve been with my SO for about 3 years. He is fantastic, I love him a ton, and we both really enjoy music. He has an ex who really broke his heart and they no longer have any contact with each other. I’m really not a jealous type, and have never been, so I’m so confused about what I’m feeling! 

My very favorite band in the entire world is a band who writes a lot about love (what bands don’t, really), and their music and lyrics have gotten me through so much. I also have always associated many of their lyrics and songs with my SO, and he has done the same back to me. He has also always teased me about being so in love with the band and referencing their lyrics all the time, joking that they are “overrated”, although he knows many songs and lyrics, too. I have always laughed at this teasing, but the other day when I mentioned a particular verse that reminded me of him, he seemed to respond with some discomfort instead of teasing. I left it at that for a few hours, but then asked him about it that night, wondering if those lyrics were connected to something uncomfortable for him. Then I jokingly asked, “don’t tell me your ex was just as obsessed with the band as I am?” And he, surprised, responded that yes, she was a huge fan, she had showed them their music, and our “band” was sort of “their” band. 

This made me kind of sad and confused. So all that time we had joked around and made references to each other, he had already made those about his ex? I wondered how many songs and what songs were connected to her, and I just feel so strange that I had spent the last 3 years referencing lyrics that meant so much to me regarding our relationship, when the references just made him think about his ex and his connections with her. 

He was very kind about it all, and comforting when I was confused and upset, and I thanked him, but I am still feeling uneasy after a week since our talk. I can’t figure out what I’m feeling. Every time I had listened to their music I had thought about my SO, and now I just can’t stop thinking about how that song, for my SO, was about his ex. I’m having trouble listening to my favorite band.

Does anyone have any advice for this? Can anyone figure out what it is exactly that I’m having trouble with? I want to get over this stupid thing, but I am just stuck. ",11Aug2018,1
33,"My apartment complex has a pool with a patio &amp; grill area for residents, 1 guest per resident and a limited number of kids per adult. I go a few times a week, swim laps, lounge and read, or grill with the fiancé. Typically, I am the only white person at the pool. I'm friendly and say hello to anyone I see, but I've always been pretty introverted when it comes to befriending neighbors, so I don't know most of the residents well.

As summer has gone on, some people keep pushing the ""residents only""  boundary further. I've watched vans full of kids pull up and wait for a resident with a key card to let them in, and large groups walk down from the bus stop to do the same. They routinely prop the gate open so anyone can enter. Someone hosted their entire 50+ person family reunion at the pool, while I overheard apartment management saying they shouldn't have (but did nothing). 

As a result, there's often trash around/in the pool, the grill is typically unavailable, and all the good chairs/spots are suddenly taken. (We've lived here 3 years, and it's never been like this before). 

I know I probably sound like the summer grinch. Am I? We do pay a somewhat higher rent for the area, partly for the 'amenities'. Also, I'm very conscious of the state of race relations in our country, and I'm hesitant to say anything, as one of the only white people at the pool complaining about how people are using it. 

Note: I wouldn't assume people weren't residents if not for them specifically discussing it-- for example, they'll call friends, give them driving directions, then a large group arrives shortly after. Likewise, the group from the bus will discuss how long it will take them to get home from the pool, and the van groups talked about the resident (singular) they knew whose key card they had. And the family reunion, I'm just assuming 50-60 family members don't all live in our complex, though I suppose I can't know for sure. 

Do I speak up? Do I just let it all slide? 

Tl,Dr: Residents are routinely bringing large groups of nonresidents into apartment complex pool, against the guest policy, and making a mess/using all the chairs. If it matters, I'm one of the only white people who uses the pool. Do I speak up or let it slide? Am I a summer Grinch?",11Aug2018,1

44,"Okay, so this may be a lengthy story but here we go. 

This all started when I went to my best friend’s brother’s graduation party. While there I was hangin with my friend and a couple of other people I knew, we were all 16-17. The brother had his friends which were 18-20. We all decided to go bowling after the grad party, this is where stuff begins to turn a bit. 

At the bowling alley I was put on a lane with the girl that was mentioned in the title and another kid. I’m on my school’s varsity bowling team so I’m reasonably good at bowling. Whenever I would get a strike or pick up a spare (9/10 times) she would give me a high five. I thought nothing of this at the time it started but around the third frame or so she kept trying to interlock fingers after giving me a high five. I eventually did after she tried like two more times. 

We got to the second game and things became more weird. At this moment she started hugging all over me and trying to always be at my side. I would deny it every time she tried to. After me not doing this she asked for my Snapchat, I said screw it and gave it to her. After our two games were over, my best friend could tell I was a bit uncomfortable and confused. He told me that they were planning on going to Skyline (local restaurant in my area) and they were telling the other girl they were going home. 

I was driving me and my friend over there and he was asking me about it and everything and eventually goes “dude, she’s 20” then things started to make sense. 

Apparently, this 20 y/o was my friend’s brother’s ex and she was trying to hook up with me to make him mad. 

After talking to his brother apparently she was always trying to do that to him but he got stressed out over it and didn’t want to put up with that and didn’t care anymore. 

I got home later and then started snapping her, she would always complain about stuff and I would just say “nice” or other generic stuff like that just to try and get her to leave me alone. 

After a while I talked to my one friend and apparently he works with this girl. At his next shift with her she said that she likes me. 

Later the day after she said she liked me, I asked how old she was. She was 20 and so I told her I was only 16. Her response was “it’s not the age that matters, it’s the love that counts” this is when I started to leave her on open more and more. 

I had never told her my number so I texted her and said that my name was “Rusty Shackleford” (yes from King of the Hill) and she believed it. She then professed her love to me but not realizing it was me. 

At this point we’re about 3 weeks after meeting and I decided to see how much I can do that she’ll put up with. I would block her on Snapchat and then unblock and see how long it took to be re-added. It took about half an hour. I made up some bs excuse on why I did and she believed it. I eventually blocked her for 4 days and within 6 hours I was added again. 

She started trying to meet up with me. There was a day when she went to a festival and I said I’d be there later and never showed up. I hoped this would give an obvious enough hint but apparently not. This went on for about 3 days. It was to the point where she wanted me to go through the drive thru at McDonald’s (where she worked) just so I could talk to her. At this point I understood the reason she was my Friend’s brother’s ex. 

She started getting more and more flirty with everyday and eventually sent nudes without me doing that or even asking for them. 

I talked to my friend that worked with her and decided we were going to get all of this stuff together and when he showed it to her, she was most concerned with that her name in my phone was “crazy bitch” 

It has been about 2 weeks after this all happened and it’s still happening, my friend is going to show all of this stuff to his manager this weekend in the hope of getting something done. 

In case you’ve been wondering, I’m also not the first 16 y/o she’s done this to. 

Thank you all for reading all of this if you did, I really appreciate it. 

TLDR: A 20 y/o keeps hitting on me even though she knows I’m 16. The response was “it’s not the age that matters, it’s the love that counts” My friend is showing this to his manager because he works with her and hoping something is done. She has done this to someone that she works with before too.

54,"Hey people, I’m 21 male in a bit of a existential dilema and I’d love some help be it practical, existential or...I dunno what another category would be haha. 

I’ve been getting to know myself better for these past few months, and have hit upon a realization that’s leading me to tire my brain out.

I found out that I am *really* introverted, I have trouble empathizing with people, social interactions tires me, my ideal day is sleeping half of it and the other half is reading/playing/watching interesting things for some mental gymnastics.

So far I have been denying all of the above, trying to pretend I can be social, a party animal, hyper charismatic and take lead in things. One might guess what happened: depression, panic attacks, existentialist questionings yada yada yada.

Not to say that I didn’t learn some tricks but I’m digressing too much. 

I like isolation, but am scared to encourage this side of me so that it could lead to eventual isolation of the world and its problems. And at the same time I do like people, I do feel like to experience new things, I crave for another human being’s warmth, laughter and smile; I feel terrible for being unable to sympathize with another one’s struggles.

So much so that the people I admire the most are the hedonistic/charismatic and intelligent type who just seem to float through life enjoying almost everything.

And...yeah I dunno where to put my chips basically. I don’t know what to do besides to stop keep trying to do things I know that aren’t me. Any middle ground? Would some alone time help me? Any argument that hasn’t been made yet that can convince me to chill and stop worrying? ",11Aug2018,2

69,"I dated this girl for a year and a half. She was my first...well...everything. First girlfriend, first kiss, first...*ahem* ...love. And well things went well for almost over a year. I was happy, she was happy. Everything for the first time in a long time was great. But eventually I made my choice to go to join the Navy. I made the promise to be with her through it but while I was gone her friend extended the offer to give emotional support. She invited the girl to hang with her and her boyfriend who happened to be her ex. And that where things changed. I got back (it's explained in the next paragraph) and she was not distant and it just got worse. No matter what I did, it got worse. Eventually it just got out of my control.

So earlier this year my ex girlfriend left me in January at the worst part of my life. I had been sent home for medical last September by the Navy 2 weeks before graduation, my grandma passed away, a friend committed suicide, and another one had died suddenly to unforeseen health problems. I had 2 friends outside her circle, stuck with my parents because I was trying to figure things out, and I had to vehicle. 

I eventually moved out February and I'm living okay now. I'm in the line up to get a management position where I work and I'm eager to move up. Through these last months I did my best to better myself as a person and eventually started dating one of my friends. I still had feelings for my ex because it was done over text without any real reason. My girlfriend understood and was willing to work through it. And today I found out that my ex cheated on me with her best friends boyfriend who was also her ex. The did **it** multiple times a week for 3 to 4 months while we still dated. I found out through someone who was a friend of hers but was looking to move on from that life. 

I went on to ask her about it, maybe see if it just wasn't true or if she could at least tell me the truth. I was cool headed going into it but after she wouldn't say much and dodge the question all the time I went off. Her boyfriend started being a jerk and I ended up telling that 3 people were gone from my ex's life. Me, her friend for 5 years, and her other friend for 7 years.

I'm obviously full of anger against her but I'm over her, I don't have any love for her anymore. My question is, are there any other steps to take to get this off my mind? I have work and girlfriend and more friends, just wanting to know if there are other ways to help.",11Aug2018,1

80,"Hi everyone!

I need some help with the how the maintenance should be handled in my apartment.  Right now, I have been dealing with my AC going in and out for the past month.  I have submitted four requests, two office visits, and multiple phone calls trying to get this resolved.  As I am typing, it is 83 degrees in my apartment even with the sun down!   The AC sometimes works and sometimes does not.  about 30% of the time the AC makes a loud hissing sound and blows out warm air.

Online Request 1: 7/17/2018, two guys came by and said it was a bad capacitor and replaced it.  The AC worked for about 30 minutes before it started blowing out hot air.   At that moment I went to the office and told them the AC was not fixed.   The two guys came back and told me they would call a vendor to have it fixed.

Online Request 2: 7/23/2018. Fast forward a couple of days, I have not heard from the maintenance guys and I entered this request because my AC is still broken and the vendor has not shown up.

Online Request 3: 8/2/2018. The vendor came out and performed work on the AC (I don't know what they did).  Now the AC works BETTER, but still has moments of failure.  (Loud hissing noise from the compressor?). After submitting this, one of the maintenance guys came by and left a note saying the AC is working 100% without problems.  (At this point I am losing my patience).

Online Request 4: 8/8/2018. I submit another request.  This time, the maintenance guy gives me a phone call and I explain the situation professionally and politely to him (although I wanted to vent).  He told me he would call the vendor and have them come out the next day as the work they did should be under warranty.  He calls me the next day, but I cannot answer because I was at work.  He leaves a voicemail telling me to visit the office or call to find out the status of my apartment.  I call, but no one answers.  The next day, today, I called the office and the guy on the phone told me he would get back to me.  Three hours later, no one shows up to my door and I don't get a phone call.  I call the maintenance office back on their after hours number and no one answers.  

Will make a fifth online today or tomorrow, but I am losing hope.  Is it possible for me to call a heating/cooling vendor myself and ask the apartment for compensation??  ",11Aug2018,1
81,"Throw-away account.  Long post, sorry. **TLDR** at bottom . This can be crossposted in so many other reddits but I chose r/Advice

\-----------------------

My ex (40F)  and I (45 M)  were together for 8 years. We were not married but had lived together for 6 years.  Since I made much more than her, I  supported her the whole time we were together; she lived rent free in my home (purchased before I met her) and the plan was for her to pay off her debt with her part time job while my salary took care of living expenses and such. 

I was diagnosed with cancer about a year and a half ago. When I was first  diagnosed I was told there was a 30% chance I would live 18 months.  I told my employer of 18 years and I was fortunate to get a nice severance package.  I had not worked since so my gf and I been living off my savings, the package and her part time job in the meantime. She looked after me and the house while I was getting treatment.  Few months ago, despite the odds,  I was given a very good prognosis by my doctors. ( I just have to go for tests every three months but things look clear for the foreseeable future)

My GF broke up with me a few weeks after that.

She told me  taking care of me had taken its toll and she wanted to live for herself a bit. I was shocked but not shocked as there had been issues in our relationship before I got sick. I was just so happy to be alive and thankful that she'd seen me through it that I honestly empathized with her. I wasn't mad and let her know that I was grateful and wanted her to be happy. She told me that she would be travelling for a while and would like me to not contact her as it would be too hard for her. 

It was bullshit. Last week  I got a foreclosure notice from the bank. My GF had handled the finances while I convalesced. Long story made slightly shorter, she hadn't paid the mortgage and most other bills in more than 8 months. My credit cards, which had been at about 5% utilization were now almost maxxed out. My credit is in the crapper. There are charges on my card for merchandise and expenses I knew nothing about. When I checked my savings accounts they were large withdrawals that had been made in the  weeks before she left.  I have not been able to reach her since. 

Its very, very clear to me that my GF thought I was going to die so she stole from me. So, for the love of all thats holy, there is no need to make that point to me in the comments. And I have no legal recourse since  she was on my checking and credit card accounts (I had been helping her rebuild her credit ) so we're good there too. ( And in all honesty I'm not even thinking about how I got played . A part of me feels like it was the price I paid for my life. But I do know Im at rock bottom ) 

The problem is that I have no idea what to do with myself. Im truly lost. I thought I would have about 2 years of savings left to pivot and get back on my feet (I was never a big spender)  but now I'm broke and close to being homeless.   As mad as I should be , though, I just feel like its all just **STUFF**  and doesn't really matter. The only thing I kind of want to keep is the house since it was almost paid off.  But even if I lose the house I know I can stay with family for a bit, thank god. 

Im only mostly freaking out about all this because I  have to start over **right now!** and don't know which way to point myself.   I dont have a degree. I dropped out college when I was 20. I'd bootstrapped my career. I was curious about technology back in the early 90's and I lucked into a technology job in banking. I  worked my way up from desktop support to an executive technology position in the financial sector.  If I were to try to get back into it today after 2 years out , with all the competition from CS majors 20 years my junior, I would get laughed out of the room .  And honestly I really don't want to go back to the sturm und drang of working in the financial sector.  

If I were 25 and doing it over I would finish pre-med, go to med school and go into medicine. But I'm not 25 so I don't want to waste any more time. 

I have no doubt that applying myself for a few years would get me back on my feet and put me back on track. I just dont know in what? Ive thought about getting my license and doing real estate , or taking some certifications and becoming a software developer so I could work at home,  doing pharmacy, degree or even writing professionally.

I feel like God gave me a second chance. And  my exGF may have done me a favor by forcing me to hit rock bottom. 

I don't know what Im doing and I don't know what to do. But Im happy to be alive. I could use some advice reddit. Any mid-life , broke , cancer-survivor , almost-homeless folks here who've bounced back ? (!)

Thanks for reading. 

**TLDR:** Got cancer. Girlfriend thought I was gonna die,  cleaned me out and left me.  I didn't die. Im at rock bottom and need some advice working my way up",11Aug2018,6

87,"So I [18] work tomorrow from 10 am to 6 pm but my buddy and I want to go to a town 30 minutes away tomorrow to hang out in a different city. I told my work at 3:00 I have an orthodontist appointment so they said I can leave early. Now my parents, would definitely not approve of this because they want me to almost never miss work. Anyways, I got work covered to leave early and go spend most of the day there, but now I need to convince my parents that I somehow got out of work early and also need to get them to let me go to the town. So, my plan was basically just to tell them that they let me out early because they had too many people there and not enough customers to need me (which My work has done to me before) and then just ask my parents since I’m out early if I can go to the town with my buddy. Does it sound like it can work?",11Aug2018,2

90,"Honestly not a trashy guy, I just need a sounding board.  However, this past January I was suddenly woken by the police at my door arresting my boyfriend of almost 7 years.  I had no idea what was going on, only to find out that well, lets just say he was accessing ""images.""  He just had his first court appearance, which I attended with him, where he plead guilty and got the date he will be going to jail, beginning of november.  Best case scenario he will be going for about 8 months.  We were supposed to be going to do a  whole Europe trip this past May, I had plane tickets and everything booked, then this happened.  Had to start lying to family and friends about why we weren't going.  We were hoping this was all going to be over by next summer but now its looking like end of summer, again best case.  We are now having to make sure our ""stories"" are straight for what we tell our families about why and where he is going.  Our parents don't live in the same city so we don't see everyone often at all.  I know it is selfish to think that I am stuck in this city, which I hate, longer now and my life plans have now been pushed back but its honestly how I feel

I think I am just needing some advice maybe even some encouragement.  I know most people would probably be gone right away, especially with these charges, but I stuck with him.  I know he knows how bad this actually is. I just can't believe that first of all this actually happening in my life and second that he is doing this to us.  I honestly do feel myself falling out of love with him, mainly out of resentment for doing this.  But I can't imagine making him go through this alone, I also can't stand the thought of him coming out of jail and no one being there for him.  I feel like if I did leave him he would probably commit suicide.  

Am I crazy?!  What would you do?

91,"First time poster here so bare with me.

I guess a small backstory is in order, to get ya'll up to speed.

My parents divorced many moons ago when i was around three or four. It was one of those ugly divorces.  Not the kind where they came out as friends in the end. Since then they have only been in the same room once.  That was my grandfather's funeral, about 30 years ago. 

It was always two of everything Holidays,  birthdays, and whatever else you can think of. Things were so bad that when my sister went to get marries she scratched all her palns for this awesome wedding,  jumped on a cruise ship, and eloped. Because she was sick and tired about hearing about who should or shouldn't be invited to her wedding. Then as her kids came along they had to deal with the whole double holidays and birthdays because their grandparents can't be in the same room. 

Now i must say that this animosity is primarily from my mother, towards my father and step mother.  My dad could care less if my mom is around, in the room,  or whatever.  

Now ya'll are current.

Five weeks from today is my daughter's first birthday.  And about two months ago my mother called me up asking to ""reserve"" the weekend. I was furious. My daughter isnt a pavilion at a local park to reserve.  Its her damn birthday.  My wife and i feel that we should just invite all of the family, whoever comes, comes and whoever doesn't,  oh well. 

I know whatever decision i make someone will be mad at my wife and i. 

Do i indulge in my mother's request and ostracize the rest of the family for her sake? Or do i put my foot down and tell her that the entire family is invited and she'll either have to deal with it or not come?

Thoughts?",11Aug2018,1
92,"I am dealing with some fairly bad depression, and have been for the last year or so. I don't have any friends or family I can talk to except my spouse, which really sucks when I want to talk about him.

My husband's job took us away from everyone we knew, and he has been working ridiculous hours for as long as we've been here. We were newlyweds when we first moved, and this distance and lack of time together has really been hard. We don't do anything together anymore. He comes home so exhausted he can't stay focused on a conversation. I am trying to make up for any gaps, however I've been having some really bad depressive days where I don't even leave the bed. I just mope around thinking of all the things I should be doing, and berating myself for not doing any of them.

I know my depression hasn't been good for our marriage, and the same goes for this awful job away from everyone. We've talked several times about finding new jobs and relocating, but on his end it is never anything but talking. He never even brings it up, only halfheartedly agrees when I tell him this isolation is literally killing me. For months now he will agree to go job hunting with me when it fits his schedule. Then he never has time and never attempts to find time. I get frustrated and eventually bring it up and he is apologetic and then agrees that THIS time for sure we will move forward. But then it NEVER happens.

I know that I haven't been very helpful in this marriage lately, but I am so upset that he never takes charge of anything. Especially hurt that he knows how much this situation is causing me pain but he still refuses to do anything about it. In the past I have always been the one to lead. I single-handedly found our new apartment, packed all of our things, and made arrangements to move to this place. I told him I don't want to do this next move alone and that we should work on it together. He verbally agrees but his actions say otherwise.

I am so sad, and so upset. I don't want this to be the end of our marriage but I can't go on like this forever. Is it possible this stems from my depression? Or is this a problem with us as a couple? I don't know how to proceed or even what kind of advice I need, but I know I can't seem to figure this out on my own. ",11Aug2018,1
93,"So in May of this year I bought a hat from a website and that since they’re handmade usually take about two to six weeks to complete. I forgot about it since I never really got any updates on it. Now it’s almost three months later and just remembered about and decided to email the company about a refund on the item. It wasn’t a cheap hat either as it initially costed $39.99 USD plus $10 in shipping as it was being sent from California to the North East US plus some local and taxes thus bringing the cost to about $53 USD. When I emailed them about the item in question they forwarded the email to the designer/maker of the hats and told me that the package was mishandled and never sent out. While they offered to send it to me, I declined the offer and told them I wished for a refund. I emailed the company a second time three days before this post and never received a reply other than “it was received by the company and a support representative will get back to me.” I also called the company with zero response and I feel they’re avoiding this and they’re holding my money I want back “hostage.” Is there anything I should do if this persists?

96,"Hello! First time posting here! I live with like 11 family members since it's more of a Filipino thing to live in big numbers apparently. Seems like privacy isn't a thing the Philippines values. Well that's not my concern, it can't be helped with a big family. Anyway, my 9 year old nephew just moved in recently coming back from his homeland. He's a nice kid, just a bit intrusive, but all kids are. Don't get me wrong, but my main gripe is he's only 9 and already addicted to social media, online games, immediately asks for my Instagram when I've deleted it a long time ago, it just makes me shrug who he might grow to become. That's not my business though... Elementary school should be starting soon for him if his dad, my cousin will let him... He's a bit paranoid about immigration stuff, so he's a bit inclined to reject a proper education in America. Everyone in the family would recommend he enrolls ASAP. I feel like a bad person for not letting him use my laptop, but he wasn't going to use it for educational purposes, but just gaming. It takes forever to download Steam games on my Wi-Fi, and I particularly don't want him to develop an early addiction, because I know boys at that age in my time would end up addicted. I wonder if it's the right thing not to let him on the computer. I'm just a 19 year old kid afterall! If he was like 13, oh yeah he can use my computer as much as I allow to when I need it for other projects. But 9 years old, I think that should be a big no no. Ideally, I would ask his father if it's okay to let him on, but he's quite a reckless cousin of mine and he would no doubt say yes. ",11Aug2018,1

108,"there was a instagram meme page of my town  which was pretty funny but everyone thought it was me behind it. The admin posted her petty teenage beef on her public story and thus started a bunch of drama with people who thought it was me saying those things. Even my friends thought I was the admin and I had to go as far as showing them my recently signed in instagram accounts. 

She directed a post at this girl with the same initials as a girl who had drama with me a while back, who also happens to be in a friend group with my ex best friend and my ex girlfriend. I get a threat  and a whine from her on snapchat about how I should've messaged her  if I had a problem etc etc.  I tell her I don't know what she's talking about and ask her what i did wrong but she ignores me.

I screenshot the message, send it to the meme page and tell them it's gotten too far. She then reveals her identity on a story post and says she's deactivating, yet people say they don't recognise her. I don't even know the girl myself and my town is so small that you know everyone your age.  I notice that the girl who threatened me had a story post but she deleted me as a follower so it would be weird if I looked at it but she'd also screenshoted our chat on sc and I'm almost positive that it's our convo with some snide comments because she NEVER posts to her social media. I'm anxious because I know my ex best friend saw it (who cut me off over a tiny misunderstanding about a year ago) and the thought of my image being shown in that way is so horrible to me for some reason.  I have been nasty in the past but that was years ago in school when I had a lot of negativity in my life. I've worked hard this year and last year to be a nice person and to be kind and friendly and more social and it feels like everything has been for nothing since this girl talks to EVERYONE I know and am mutuals with. 

I know it's bad that this bothers me. I just want to know how to stop caring so much about petty drama that 18 year olds should've left behind in school. If that meme page didn't insist on being anon for so long I wouldn't be in this trouble. 

How do I stop caring about what other people think?

131,"I have a friend I've been friends with for several years now. He's never held a job for very long and not really needed the money because he lives in an apartment complex his parents own so he has it fully rent free. His father has an alcohol problem and his mother is very controlling of his life but until recently it never caused many problems. Recently though there was a situation where he was on the phone with a mutual friend of ours and in a round-about way said he needed help for some reason. His mom immediately grabbed the phone and said ""he's asleep right now"", which was obviously a lie, and then hung up. About that time my friend got a very odd set of texts from the father that made no sense at all. That friend then called the police because he was worried but unfortunately there was nothing they could determine because it was hear-say at this point.

From that point on we hadn't heard anything from him at all, never saw him online (he was big into PC and PS4 gaming) until about a month later. We had been trying to call him to get him to hang out at least and one day he finally answered. We invited him to a waterpark and he actually showed up, but something was very odd about him. He didn't quite seem like himself, he's normally a very happy person and loves himself some dark humor and jokes and he didn't once laugh at anything, and actually criticized me on a joke I made that normally would have made him laugh hysterically. Like, this was some invasion of the body snatchers type stuff. He completely seemed out of it and just not himself. He also said he wasn't going to school and wasn't working and said he was trying to figure out what he wanted to do.

He's since hung out with some of us every now and then but it seems like he's got no motivation to do anything anymore. Every now-and-then he seems to go back to himself for a few minutes but he quickly reverts back to being this shell of a person again. We think he may be getting drugged by his parents or something, but we obviously don't know for certain. He obviously won't say anything to incriminate his parents if we were to get him out of his house and talking to the police or something, and we have asked him if something is going on but he just gets visibly annoyed and shuts down any conversation about it. We are all very worried about him but we all don't know what we can do to help. We have all been friends with him for 10+ years each and he's just not the same person suddenly.

156,"Been having an issue with my mailman for a couple weeks now.

2 weeks ago I forgot to check my mail for 5 days and it overflowed, annoying yes, totally my fault.

Since then the mailman's turned into a total ass, I've checked my mail every day since but he alternates between dropping off the mail (usually 1-2 letters) and then if that 1 letter is there the next day (say I checked at 8:30am, he drops off at 10am, then the next day I don't check until 11am so he still sees the 1 envelope the next day), he will leave a note saying I'm out of town or ""possibly vacated premesis"" and that my mail for that day is being returned to sender.

Been doing this for 2 weeks now and I'm freaking out because I'm expecting some expensive (for me at least) packages.

I thought of calling the local post office and complainingly but it's my understanding that it's basically impossible to be fired/disciplined at USPS. So if I complained I'll more than likely just increased their rage and never get mail again.

What should I do?",11Aug2018,1
164,"So it went out with my long time buddy from high school. He’s a little awkward and not the best with women. 

At our last bar hopping stop, one girl gave me the “I want you to approach me” eyes, along with glances with three of her other friends. I was already on the way to the patio with a cigarette in hand so I couldn’t just drop it to approach them in that instant (I think that would scream desperation).

A few minutes later we made another lap around the bar and she spotted me again and gave me the same intense look. 
By this point, my buddy had given up for the night and made it clear he wanted to leave. So I was put in a difficult situation. Being a good friend to him, we left and I felt I missed a golden opportunity. 

Should I have insisted and approached her?
I had woken up at 6 am and was feeling slightly exhausted from work. I think if I had approached her, I think I would have had to entertain her other three friends as well, I only had the energy to entertain a single girl by this point in the night. I’ve been told by women I’m a pretty smooth talker. I’ve also had experience picking up some women this way but obviously all women are different. 

Would it have gone south if I approached her and her group and made a warm approach to her group and then focus on the girl who gave me the look? Would I have had to entertain her AND her group the entire time to get with her?",11Aug2018,1

171,"I dated my ex back in high school, my senior year of hs and her junior year. We had a rough break up and had an on-off again sort of thing. We cut each other off right after. During the on-off phase, I helped her write/edit her essay to apply to our state college. It was also my dream college but I didn't apply because I didn't think I'd get in. However, she did get in. I went off to community college get my associates degree with a side trip to a University in the Midwest for a semester before my dad passed away and I moved back. At this time I was dating a lot more with a lot of little flings with other girls but I wasn't sure if I was totally over her.

I decided to apply to my dream college and I got in last year winter quarter. My first quarter there I ran into her. I said hey and we actually got caught up telling me about everything that happened since we last saw each other. The conversation actually solidified that I was over her. The main issue during our relationship was how much drama it felt there was going on and it was apparent that it was still the main factor in her life. I actually felt like my life was way more chill not dating her. She asked if I wanted to just meet up in the mornings to do homework and I needed a study buddy so I said sure.

That night I get a text from her bf basically angrily asking for me to stay away from her. I responded that I understand but he needs to know that I have no feelings for her and that she talked mainly about him during the meeting. I actually told her that maybe we should stop talking because he was uncomfortable and I didn't want to break them up. She was, of course, pissed at him about it. He backed off quickly and apologized to me.

We did study buddy shit for a bit and it got kinda weird because the main thing with her is she likes to test the boundaries of her bfs. She invited me to their apartment and I came under the idea that it wasn't just going to be me and her alone. But it was. No moves were made but I found out later that he didn't know until she texted him that she and I were at the apartment. Of course, I get an angry text later about how I needed to stay away. I again told her that maybe we should stop talking and she got pissed again. He back off right after.

At this point, she asked if I was available a certain day and I said I was. she wanted my help moving furniture. Sure whatever. Turns out it was going to be the first day I meet him. He was chill it seemed at least. Kind of uneventful except I was just helping him move the furniture.

We actually stopped talking for a while. I saw her on the street and we waved at each other. One day I was walking up to class and she ran up to me trying to playfully scare me. We talked for a bit and she said she had to leave and we talked on the phone about on hour. She was changing majors, blah blah blah. She does furniture remodeling and asks if I want some since I was moving into a new apartment. Sure I say she showed me examples and I paid for a table and some drawers. (Guys never fucking pay before you get it)

Next morning, I wake up to a text from her asking help editing an essay. I say sure. I also notice a text from her bf. This time threatening me saying he was going to bring a lot of drama into my life if I keep talking to her. ""I'm sick and tired of your guys waving at each other and her running up to talk to you"" Other stupid shit basically saying I better not tell her. I managed her basically saying we should probably stop talking because I don't want them to break up over me. I never mentioned him texting me but she figured it out. After an hour I got pissed because I don't understand why he was getting pissed at me for her waving at me/ running up to me. I just deleted him off snapchat and facebook so he couldn't contact me.

My ex and I stopped actually talking except to periodically talk about the tables and drawers. I moved into my apartment and am still waiting on it. I got an insta message request today from her bf and I texted her asking if she asked him to text me or is he texting on his own. She got pissed at me saying does it matter and that I make it so dramatic especially when I always bring her into the drama. I looked at the message in insta and was just about the drawers and that I can pick them up sunday. Me and her got into an argument though where she thinks that I'm just dropping all this drama onto her and that it was entirely his and my drama. I was pissed because that drama is all about her. If she waves to me I hear all about his insecurities from him. She said the reason we stopped talking is because I always drag her into the drama. Which I thought was hilarious because I didn't even realize she had decided to stop talking to me. She said she saw all of the messages from him, which I responded she didn't because a lot of it was in snapchat. She responded in all caps saying she doesn't care and that I was just dragging her in again. I eventually just said I won't drag her into it anymore.

191,"Hi there, before I begin asking for suggestions I’m not really looking for opinionated input regarding my decision, I just am after some objective advice. I’ve already decided to remove this person from my life, although the reasons I want to are difficult to explain to her so I don’t really want to have to go through with that. For context, this person is a crush of mine and a good friend. Her and I have gotten to know each other and speak often, but it’s clear to me my feelings are unrequited (I can just tell) and I’m not really interested in being platonic friends because I’m a 17 year old guy and there’s no fun in that, only torture. The best way to deal with a crush that’s not going to happen, I’ve found, is just cutting them from your life, but I think I’ll have trouble here because I inadvertently became very good friends with her to the point where we speak multiple times every day, and text regularly. It may seem a little heartless, but I think it’s better for me than to leave myself longing, pissing away time and money. Problem is, we have mutual friends and I don’t want to have to explain why I want to cease all contact with practically a best friend. I don’t want to be known to every girl in a sixty kilometer radius as a sex-driven shit person.

192,"For as long as I can remember I've always had the same re-accuring nightmare. Im about 6 years old wearing a tank top and these weird stretchy pants. I'm looking for two older boys I used to follow around, who I find behind the apartment Complex by our old home in California. They are messing around with a club house made of garbage, I can't say for sure how old they are but about 12-13ish. They see me ask me if I want to see inside, I say yes and go with them, then there is this vague hazy moment of me pulling my pants down and laying on my stomach. Then it jumps to me sitting in my oldest sister's bedroom, and she's asking me if someone has touched me ""back there"", my mother is in the door way they are both crying and looking at me. Then she tells me she had bad things done to her and I need to tell them if something happened. I've had this dream over and over and over in my life. And I remember as a small child knowing that my oldest sister was molested, so when she decided to finally talk to everyone about it when I was a teenager I wasn't shocked because I some how already knew . I also know for as long I've had that dream I've also been a very sexual child. I would constantly have these fantasies and day dreams where I'd get aroused and hump things till I felt the tingling of orgasms. That has been happening for as long as I've had those dreams, until I started becoming actually sexually active. I have diagnosed OCD, and my whole life I've struggled with severe anger issues. I also can not stand any anal play, when my husband attempts any it immediately kills my desires and leaves me feeling panicked.I have just told him I wasn't into it, not really explaining that it makes me feel that way. I've never talked to anyone about it, not my siblings, not my mother, not my husband, my best friends, not even my therapist. I think I may have been molested as a child, but I don't know how to bring this up with anyone, or where to start to possibly get help with answers for this. I also don't know how to talk to my husband about this. After having my daughter last year the nightmare has come back at least 3 times a week and I just can't take this anymore.

193,"I'm a rising junior college student who absolutely loves all that I do. My freshman year I did so much and excelled in all of it. The following summer, my anxiety worsened and I lessened my academic load come sophomore year. Regardless, by this past May, I was in shambles anxious all day and all night. It was kind of miserable because I want to and know I am capable of handling my life. But anxiety.

This summer, I tried lightening my load even more by taking a couple online classes while going back home for the summer. I left my other responsibilities behind at university for the time being. Despite this, my anxiety has only gotten worse. When I felt like I couldn't handle any more, I reached out to my mom for help (I don't drive - anxiety). A few weeks later, it was decided I would wait until I moved back to university to get help due to time constraints. That meant waiting another month.

Since then, I've been bouncing back and forth between being completely incapable of doing anything and feeling okay. Many times I've been having trouble focusing on even my one online class. Too often I can't eat, sleep, or focus on anything. I am worried about going back to school especially because I barely made it last semester when my mental health was better. Also, my apartment agreement appears to be falling through too, so I don't have a place to live come move-in day in about four days.

I'm really struggling in deciding how to approach this upcoming year. I love love love what I do. Especially my job - it makes me happy - yet it has given me never ending anxiety for the past few months. I know it's all in my head. I'm completely capable and I want to work it. The same goes for my other activities. Will getting help help me manage everything? Do I take a step back from my engagements and just do school? Should I take a leave of absence all together and focus on feeling better only? I feel like I'm struggling already.

249,"**Sorry in advance for the wall of text. It's a complicated mess.**

**TL;DR: 22yo Only child who's had to take care of two sickly parents for the past 12 years in various ways and wants to move out now, but is feeling insane guilt over how it will burden his mother who depends on him financially. Am I being selfish for wanting this / What do I do?**

I am currently a 22 year old working a full time job which pays well, but am still living at home with my mother.

My father went on disability for heart issues when I was two years old. From about the time I was 10, I was always tasked with helping in his care as his health slowly began to decline. At the age of 12, he had open-heart, 15; moderate to severe edema in his legs, leading to leg amputation and his needing constant care as I got older. My mom was the only one working during all this, obviously.

Eventually he was placed in a nursing facility for his care and unfortunately passed away a month before I turned 18. My mother was placed on disability (for neuopathy, but nothing serious enough to keep her from moving around and about) around the same time. So I basically have gone from taking care of one sickly parent to taking care of another over the span of 12-ish years.

My mother brings home around 1800$ a month. I bring in not quite double that (around 3k$). That being said, I've somehow slowly started to accumulate more of the financial responsibilities, such as paying for the electricity and rent, some months buying all the groceries, the cable bill, etc (all this in addition to paying my own bills for car loan and insurance). I'm currently paying more to live here with my mother than I would be to live alone. And yet with all this, she still is somehow completely broke at the end of each month.

As a result of the constant dependency, both financially and otherwise, I've grown to resent her in a lot of ways. I feel like I had to grow up too fast. Like I've never been able to just relax or something. Like I just missed out on a lot of things.

In the last couple years, our relationship has deteriorated to the point that I rarely speak to her and basically live in my bedroom. I struggle with depression and a lot of times can't work up the energy to care enough about the situation, but at the moment I'm not feeling too bad, and I've decided;

**I want out. And I want out now.** And so I've basically told her that I'm planning to move out within the month or sometime in September.

We've currently lived in this house for 8 years now, a rental. It's an older house, no insulation, electric bill is ungodly high in the summer and we're surrounded by fields so we have mice a lot. Being that I was 14 at the time, I had no real say in my parents deciding to move here. But whenever the topic of my moving out comes up, she always freaks out and absolutely does not want me to leave her in the house by herself. She's never lived alone before.

I understand she's scared. I understand that she will ultimately have to file bankruptcy (which would be the 3rd time in her life she's done so). But the problem is, after so many years of basically being made to feel responsible for her, I feel a massive amount of guilt about trying to move out without her.

In order for her to move out, however, I need (read: she wants me) to do several things. I need to 1) help her get a car (because her credit isn't too good, as could be imagined and she's currently driving my car to drs. appts.), 2) help her get a place to live (ie pay the first month's rent/security deposit for her) and 3) help her move. Only then is it okay for me to move out.

I don't necessarily mind helping her do these things. The problem is that I don't want to still be living here while I do them. I'm miserable here, I can't really stand being here anymore. That's why I live in my room. I'm willing to come back and help her clean the place up, let her use my car as she needs, whatever. But I can't get over the feeling that I'm just abandoning her / leaving her to rot / what have you.

It feels like i'm being selfish for wanting what everyone else around me already seems to have. Co-workers younger than myself are moving out, everyone keeps asking me when I'm going to stop 'mooching on mommy'. But it just isn't that simple.

I'm conflicted about her finances. Whether or not I help her move out first / get a car, she's planning on filing bankruptcy due to a large amount of accumulated medical debt and some credit card debt. It's just that if she has to file now, it makes getting a car / apartment much more difficult for her.

We've talked for years about cleaning the house up and moving out, but nothing ever comes of it. Out of desperation, she suggested we start this week, but says it may still take her til the end of the year to get everything sorted on her end. I'm personally tired of waiting, though. The topic of cleaning always gets us into massive arguments, because I work 12h shifts, and she does the chores and upkeep at home (which are dishes and laundry and some cooking if she wants to). But then when I come home, I don't want to do anything for my few days off because of being tired from work / depressed and then I get the blame for nothing ever being done about cleaning the house so we can move, even though she's always here. It's basically become a situation of ""I won't do it because you won't do it.""

And none of this even takes into consideration what her family will think of me if i just move out. For years all I've heard when I visit them is ""take care of your mom for us."" I have seven cousins, all but one are moved out, a couple younger than I am. They all have two parents in good health. My aunts and uncles were able to move out without these sorts of issues either. And yet I can just imagine their reactions when my mom tells them that I moved out. *""What a worthless piece of sh-t.""*

Am I being selfish for wanting to move out now? Should I wait a few more months to try to give her a chance to get her affairs in order? The guilt of basically trying to shrug off what feels like a massive responsibility is killing me. I don't want to sever ties with her / cut off all assistance, but I want my freedom already! What do I do? How should I feel?",11Aug2018,1
250,"Reference aside, yes. I posted here already, got...uhm...advice? Idk, more like a hard pill. And now I'm trying my best to focus, and trimming the fat.

I came here a second time, to ask for another advice.

I'm shit, and I mean really shit, at making convo.

I can't, I come off as awkward and fidgety, I can't keep eye contact and I'm blissfuly unaware of context.

Like, sometimes I can't tell if someone's joking or is being serious.

I try my hardest, bu I can't make friends. Going out and talking to random people is such a scary thought, and most if not all the people around my age left the town to go with their groups.

I tried to go to some kind of youth association, but I couldn't fit in so I left fast (it was depressing, really, I tried my hardest but they were a close-knit group and I felt like I didn't belong there).

But it's dooming on me, that the life I'm living isn't any good. I had so much fun when I went out with school mates at the end of the year, I felt like I lived for a couple of hours. But it all vanished, as they scattered with their own groups.

So I guess the advice I'm looking for is: 

How do I make friends? What should I do? How do I talk to random people, and about what?",11Aug2018,0
251,"So I just finished school a month ago. I want to  medicine, but that's not possible this year anymore because I failed the entry exam. Now I have a year to spare until I retry the exam and apply to more universities.

I want to keep my mind active, so when i begin to study in university next year, I still have the energy i have right now. 

I thought of studying biology, but this maybe is the last time in my life I'm so free to do what I want.

257,"I am 16. I'm a feminine guy, and I love kids. I've been super cool to my sister's son since he was a baby. He is 7. He remembers me from when I was also a kid. Calling me dad should be out of the question considering there's a living man with that title already, but he does it anyway.

My parents also divorced when I was young, both remarried, then our dad died of an OD. I can't relate to my nephew's need to call other men his dad. I wouldn't say that to someone because as bad at that man was, he was literally my sperm donor.

My nephew was saying at first that anyone can be his dad because mom made him inside of her. I read a sex ed book with him, and he was super curious, so I told him why his parents made him when they weren't ready. His dad is not very nice to be around, kind of like mine was, but they see each other and his dad provides for him.

My nephew doesn't like the truth of where he came from after his dad punished him harshly once, and he's been saying stuff like, I should adopt him, or ""Is there a chance you could be my dad?"" I told him I don't have sex with my sister and he thought that was funny but asked again if we did it on accident when she was giving me a bath. Like, he fully understands how it works and that I wasn't even old enough at the time, but it's a fantasy he has.

He was seeing a psychologist but my sister took him out because she didn't like the therapist. I don't know if he's mentally ill or what they even talked about at therapy. She said he might have mild autism and gifted IQ.

It  was a weekend, so I went to my sister's house to spend it. As I wasn't  really used to staying in the  residential camp. So I had to finish a  report that is why I grabbed my pc ( running windows10). And when I  logged in, I was horrified by my wallpaper being changed. The desktop  wallpaper was containing soldiers and saints (or some christian bishops) in a  forest looking at me, and it was the creepiest thing i have ever  experienced in my life till now.

I showed  it to my sister and told her how this picture mysteriously appeared to tell me  to change it . So, I quickly then changed the wallpaper. And now it's lost. Then went online to find if anyone else got the same situation. but unfortunately no one seemed to have did.

I wish to really investigate about this topic.

**So, I really hope there's someone there who knows how to find this image again since it was a wallpaper onetime.**

* if I manage to get this picture I will post it and who knows where it might lead.

The two choices that I have are either a local university where I could stay at home with my dog and where I'd have friends in similar degree paths that I could rely on for help/guidance, or a university that is further away from home and somewhat more prestigious, but also where I'd be completely on my own and also away from my dog (my parents will do their best to take care of him while I'm away). I would be living in the dorms at the second university, but I would still be able to visit home on some weekends. At the second university, I would also lose eligibility for my primary scholarship there if my GPA falls beneath a 3.5. With the scholarships and financial aid that I'm currently receiving from either school, they just about even out in expected costs.

So with costs and such being roughly equal, should I go to the first university where I'd be happier, more comfortable, and probably more successful in my classes, or should I pursue the more prestigious second university where I'd be opening better opportunities down the line, but at the cost of being on my own and having to deal with the stress of that while also maintaining my GPA?",11Aug2018,1

They are:

Do i actually like her? Or am i just physically attracted to her?

Does she like me? Or Is she just being nice?

Is she only talking to me because there is noone else? she seems really genuine and laughs at things i say.

Am i fucked up for thinking about a potential future (like 2 seconds of thought) with someone who is probably just being nice

Why is it harder to talk to girls(in general)? They are people just like me... but if i trip over my words i just feel my stomach drop like ive fucked my self over?

She doesnt usually start conversations with me but will continue them if there is noone else around. She is most likely just being nice but i am so confused with myself.

289,"So a coworker of mine who had been at this factory for nearly 20 years, doing various jobs, eventually landing on a saw for the past 4-7 years. He became rather proficient at it. These past two years, however, they attempted to double his workload-theres some prep work required thats a full time job, and they attempted last year(and failed) to double his work load, and this year they decided to try it again.

Its simply too much work to keep up.

Over the last 4 months or so they attempted it he kept falling behind. The solution the supervisor had to the problem was to chew the man out and demand he 'work faster'

Well, he walked out yesterday. And I, being the person who fills in for people missing, have found myself in that position. And already, ive had the supervisor poke his head around demanding I move faster. One of those times, he started with ""you better hurry up and not Fuck me with these carts. You have no excuses""

Clearly no changes have been made. The man who quit didnt report the issue or call the Labour Board or anything, so its just business as usual, only now im the punching bag.

What do i do? Ive asked around, and the people who work close to him confirm- he quit because of harassment. Should i make records of what they say, what the supervisor says, and contact the man who quit? Or is the fact that this is a prevailing problem irrelevant since i can only report my own harassment? Im not certain im quite at the point of being harassed, but i still feel its important to prepare myself for it and develop an action plan.

I was supposed to go to a party with some friends where I would be making drinks. My girlfriend had been in a mood all day and I had been in a event with some important people so I wasn’t able to talk. When I got out I called her because I wanted to hear her voice and because connecting over text is impossible. I was met by her being rather short and sounding like she would rather be doing something else. Suffice to say the call didn’t last long. Due to this I started thinking that I’d rather not see her tonight which put me on edge because I knew it was a bad thought to be thinking. When I got home, all I wanted to do was to be alone because I am an introvert and I was socially exhausted from the previous event. I messaged our group chat saying I might come a bit later and in a minute it so I got a DM from my girlfriend. She was mad that I wasn’t going to come on time and that I at least owed it to her because she made the drive to see me. This caused me to lose my temper a bit, realising that I had done this triggered a response in my brain which caused me to go into defence mode. I immediately left our group chat, stopped talking to her and skipped dinner at home to be alone. This made a lot of people mad at me because I had said that I was going to be making drinks. My girlfriend also threatened to break up with me for losing my temper at her and not showing up.

It really upsets me that this is how I deal with bad situations because it destroys what I work so hard to build. I’m not a very social person so a small friend group and a girlfriend is really important to me. I was bullied a lot through school because of my social inability which I think is what has given me this reaction. If they aren’t near you, they can’t hurt you right? Aha.

307,"Hi everyone, I am in a predicament. Currently I am a senior at my University studying Biology and Spanish. Initially I wanted to be a doctor but the MCAT is really stressing me out and making me rethink if I even want to go to medical school. I think I would enjoy being a doctor but I don't think I am going to do well on the MCAT and if the initial test is this stressful and annoying to study for how is medical school going to be? I love medicine so my back ups are all medically related. My first back up is becoming a Physician Assistant and the second one is becoming a Veterinarian two jobs which    I feel I would be happy to do. But since I am in my senior year of college, I don't have time to get the prerequisites or the shadowing hours I would need for these programs. I already have most of them for both programs but just lack a few classes for PA and need shadowing experience for Vet. There is no way I can fit the two prereqs I need into my schedule and still graduate on time with my bachelors  because I am double majoring and the course load is a bit heavier than other people's, and furthermore, just like med school, you are required to apply for these programs a year in advance. Which brings me to my questions and problem. In order to still be active and not just sit at home during the gap year I would be forced to take when applying for PA school or vet school I want to go to graduate school at my University and I don't know if I want to study Spanish or Biology. On one hand I love Spanish and would find it interesting to possibly teach Spanish at a community college/University/high school while I am in the PA or Vet program, it would also be a possible way to make money and support myself and my fiance while I am in these programs, further more I have connections at my university's modern language department because I currently work there as a student worker and have had numerous conversations with the department chair. He even hinted heavily towards me getting an assistantship which would give me $5,000 per semester and waive my tuition costs. On the other hand I could study Biology and have a Master's degree more relevant to what I eventually want to do. I guess I could also go find an internship some where and do my prerequisite classes while I work to support myself and then apply for the program that I want but I don't know. I found an interesting internship at  Disney where you get to assist the Veterinarian at Animal Kingdom to help take care of the animals maybe that would be good but I would be worried about not getting paid enough.

I’m not a naturally timid individual. I speak clearly, stand up straight, and don’t often get nervous or nervous to the point of being paralyzed. 

Something I’ve noticed, though, is that every once in a while when I meet or interact with other guys I immediately feel a certain amount of dread or I get uncomfortable. It’s almost like my spidey-sense starts tingling, so maybe it’s my intuition noticing something that I don’t immediately see. 

But this feels like it could be unnecessary or unnatural. I don’t like consistently prevalent fear.

320,"There is this empty plant pot that sits in front of my (rented) home. It's been moved several times but before this morning I thought it was the owner who moved it around. It had always been moved during the day so I really thought nothing of it. It hasn't been moved in about a week which is the last time the owner came by to work on the apartment next to mine. 

Throughout the night I was woken up multiple times by what sounded like homeless people arguing in the street. I didn't really see anyone but the yelling was from the opposite side of my front porch. The last few weeks a guy I used to date has been lurking near my house- I think to try to catch me with someone else. He's only sent texts &amp; lurked in the bushes- he hasn't actually touched anything though.

This morning I find that empty pot moved directly onto the center of my front step.

This freaked me out. I don't know if this is how homeless people in my area mark their territory, or some superstitious symbol, or a stalker using this as a sign to let me know he was here.

I even delay things as simple as getting up in the morning, and I'll either go back to sleep several times, even though it is morning, or lay in bed for an hour or more on my phone until I finally decide I've been there too long.

Since I got out I decided to do good, or try to anyway. So i got a job and pay my bills, have a car etc. The thing is, I'm still kind of fuckin up.  I'm still shooting up heroin and coke etc.

374,"As the title says, I was recently (and surprisingly) accepted for dual enrollment in my state's college. For now, I'm only taking a semester of Sociology due to financial reasons and time - my school is very upset about it, they refuse to let me leave the school and I have to work around that for now - and I hope to be a psychiatric nurse in the future. I know that my interests and job choice can change, and that I can switch courses if need be. I guess it's also worth noting that orientation is in a couple of days.

What I'm concerned about is actually doing well in the course. My school is not very great, and I haven't had to study much during my time in that school. In my freshman year, I picked up some study habits, like making Quizlet guides and studying until the material becomes easy to recall, doing exercise problems, and taking breaks, etc.; but I feel like all of that may be inadequate now that I'll be in a college course, and I'll fuck everything up. I'm also afraid that, due to the poor quality of my school, maybe I don't belong in a dual enrollment course, but that's probably something I'll have to figure out myself. Colleges don't fuck up, right?

I'm also slightly concerned about not having any friends in the class or being too anxious to talk to anyone after class, especially since I know I'll be the youngest person there. However, I'm fairly used to being a lone wolf in school, and I know I can rely on myself, so this isn't a primary concern.

 I know no one in college/who has been in college, so I hope I can get some advice here. ***So, what general information should I know about dual enrollment, or, if someone has the knowledge to answer, college courses in Sociology? Are there study habits I should know about? Should I even be concerned about friends?***",11Aug2018,2

And it’s so many that at this point I feel like the issues and not the other person was the issue because it keeps happening to me. I’m the common issue. 

Examples 

Girl I was real close with falling out happened cause her husband trying hooking up  with me and I told her about it. She called me a liar and a home wrecker and that I was jealous her. Etc big fall out However, she ended up finding her by cheating on her. She still hates me for it tho and still to this day swears I’m a liar and a home wrecker. 



Another girl (I work with her) I was pretty close with her and we fell out because she’s claims (from her side and what she told me) that I overreacted to her joke and that the “attitude” I gave her was unacceptable. 1st off on this one I didn’t give her an attitude I got very quiet and short with her on the rest of our shift because her and another manager started to wish me a bad vacation and bad weather and picking on me and saying it was gonna suck. I didn’t want to participate in the conversation so I just got quiet with both of them. The manager later apologized when my shift in behavior was noticed. She never did and than sent me a text calling me rude that same night which I explained why I was “rude” but that I didn’t mean to be rude I even apologize for coming across as rude but that how she was speaking to me was not cool. Than she ignored me and wouldn’t even answer work questions. Which i just try to be as polite to her as possible and I try to pretend like I don’t notice her behavior because I don’t want to cause issues where I work.

Literally what it sounds like she gave us the dog because he broke its leg than he started freaking out that we took it to the pet hospital and he called the cops and claimed that we stole it...... so we had to return it before we could even fix the dog..... I still speak to her because I think her home situation sucks and she’s my husband sister 



These here are just some of the few that I have. 


I’m a 25 year old female by the way. I really don’t know why I can’t keep any friendships.

429,I'm 32 and very far behind in life. I've worked since I was 14 and never did well in school so I'm just now trying to go to college but I'm having trouble making enough money with one job and school. I don't know what to do. Work two jobs my whole life? I'm not even sure I'll do well in college honestly because I had to even go an extra year of high school just to get through that. I think I'm too old and too far behind in life to make any type of life worth living especially later in life when I start to wear down and can't work as much. It's suicide a realistic option? Is it worth it to just keep struggling and starting over with vehicles and places to live? ,11Aug2018,0
430,"So we got drunk last night and my roommates didn't stop me. Instead I blacked out and woke up completely naked and asleep next to the toilet. So okay, I barely remember anything from last night and I ask them what happened... and one of them shows us last night on her phone...

So okay, there was videos of twerking and dancing of course, but also taking a shower together. Then butt naked started cooking random shit and mixing drinks. There was hugging and the crying about the floor knocking me over. The thing that worries me most is that there is video of me eating one of the girls asses. I mean we all did! Then decided to dare each other to kiss ass-to-mouth :l.

There was even grosser pictures of kissing while being on top of each other. Pressing asses together, groping, eating whipped cream off each other... One girl even licked it from my ass like what in the hell. I have never acted like this with anyone else, even though I don't get drunk often.

My roommates has to be gay... how does this just happen? I mean we aren't like childhood close friends or anything. We are like friends who like each other enough to share a house bill. But ugh... what in the hell. I feel some type of way about this... is there anything I should do? Anything you would do in this situation.",11Aug2018,0
434,"So I've been in a bit of a funk the last year or two. So to set the stage I dont have many friends, no family really in the close area.

I live with my roomate who has also been my best friend since high school. Were both 25 M. He has his gf who lives with us and I have my own room and single.

I dont really have any friends to have over so I usually rely on him for my social interactions other than work.

We play alot of video games together. He will ask me or I will ask him and we make plans. Almost everytime he delays it for HOURS. like everytime we have plans he gets distracted by some mundane like cleaning or garbage or will take an hour long shower, take his atv out for like an hour or two when we are supposed to have plans. All without giving me an update on what he is doing. He just dips  

When we make plans I clear my schedule, i tell other friends I'm busy etc etc. Well I've been getting upset over this because i feel like I'm being treated like a second class, and that my time doesnt matter. I've even told him this on multiple occasions and he gets mad and says it shouldn't really matter and ""I dont have to report to you on every little thing I'm doing"".

I feel like I shouldnt be upset over this. But its every time, multiple times a week.

And them him and his friend who had a falling out I guess are friends again (nothing major. Like didnt talk for 2 weeks) are spending the whole weekend together and even getting up early when he cant even manage to wake up before 6pm when I try and make plans.

I've tried not letting it get to me but it's so constant and consistent that it's hard not to.

I know alot of people will tell me to cut him out of my life or whatever but I dont want it to come to that. If anyone has any advice on how to handle it or if I'm in the wrong or something maybe that would help? Idk...just feeling like I cant get a win anywhere and need some advice. ",11Aug2018,0

443,"I (21M) used to love my job at a pizzaria has a driver/server, but it recently has become the worst part of my week. I love everything about the place except for one thing, a toxic co-worker. I enjoy myself and every aspect of the job when she is not there. The reason she is toxic is because we became really close really fast until I found out from another co-worker that she has a boyfriend of 5+ years. She lied about him to me and told me how they were not in a good place and she didn't even consider him a boyfriend. Long story short i cut her out completely after confessing feelings towards her and finding out that everything with said boyfriend is great. We talked about it for a couple of hours about how much of a positive impact we have on each other, but after all this stuff she has been nothing but a source of negativity. I have been miserable there ever since and she constantly tries to provoke me into conversations. She breaks the touch barrier all the time and it gets me upset, last time it happened I snapped. I know this doesn't seem like a big deal, but it is to me and it drains the living hell out of me mentally. I am too fixated on her and need to move on. I've tried to ""tough it out"" but this all happened in early June and it still effects my mentality and headspace daily. Should I quit because of one person?",11Aug2018,1

My friend made me a Tinder for lols. I've talked to a couple of really attractive girls that told me I'm really cute and straight up asked me if I'm DTF.

I bite my nails, chew the lining of my cheeks, sorta gnash my teeth but not really, chew gum, chew ICE, all that stuff. I have oral fixation.

I'm trying to quit all the ones that hurt my teeth (i.e. Not the lining of the cheeks one). It's really hard though

I *need* something to do with my mouth.

Does anyone have suggestions for non-destructive habits that I could use as a replacement? Gum doesn't cut it:(",11Aug2018,2

465,"all of my life ive struggled to find friends, but i always managed to find people that understand me. i have kind of a rage issue, its bever turned violent or anything like that, but i can get hot headed relativley quickly when mocked or my temper is worked at. anyways i made friends and over the summer i feel like ive been completley abandoned by them. they rarely if ever text me or talk to me. when they do, its usually through a group skype call wherein they spend most of the time talking about something theyre doing or did leaving me completley out. being out of this circle of people wouldnt matter to me so much if it werent so consistent with my other friends, i use discord for games a lot, and everytime i join a channel or a call within a few minutes everyone within said call finds an excuse to leave and does. which brings me to now. i feel like i have nowhere to turn for companionship or happiness for that matter. ive tried giving it my all, ive tried being fake, ive tried being myself, to no avail.i feel like everyone i know can and could easily go on if i werent around. i dont want to do anything drastic, as i dont want to hurt my family, but i feel myself wasting away as a social recluse and i cant figure out where to go.",11Aug2018,1

474,"I have very intense touch adversin or something similar. I can not be touched without absolutely spazing. When touched, it's almost like a panic attack, no matter how small or light the touch is. The only person who has been able to touch me and it been okay has been my boyfriend for some strange reason. He's literally been the first person in my entire life who can touch me, and I even constantly touch him when he's close enough to me.

It really hurts me how bad it is and that he can touch me and my mother can't. I know it has to hurt her probably more than it hurts me. I'm sure she'd love to be able to hug her only daughter, and I would love to be able to hug my mom. One day I won't even have the option of being able to feel her, and I know once that day comes I'm going to spend the rest of my life mad at myself for not being able to touch her. 

The touch adversin or whatever it'd be consider got much worse after I was raped a couple years ago. It before was pretty bad but if I prepared myself to be touched, such as giving a hug to a family member a good bit of the time I was able to hide how it made me feel to a degree and was actually able to handle it. Now since being raped, I can't even hide how bad it effects me. Its like a switch goes off in my head where I lose complete control, I become very irritated, anxious, and either angry or upset instantly. 

I have a very large house hold. One of my brothers friends lives with us and he helps us a good bit. He's a very sweet person honestly but he makes me very uncomfortable. I try to tell myself I should just see it as sweet and it makes me feel terrible that he makes me so uncomfortable. If he knows I'm alone in a room, even if the door is closed he will walk right in and start talking to me and hugging me. If I walk through the house and he sees me, he'll always say something to me to make it apperent that I've walked through while I'm very uncomfortable just walking through the house already. He will ask for high fives if others are around but if it's just me, he'll hug me. If my boyfriend is around he doesn't say anything. If I walk by to go to another room and he knows no one else is in there he'll come in so he can hug me. There's been other incidents that have happened while he was drunk that I try to dismiss as him just being drunk. I feel terrible that he makes me so uncomfortable. I just wish he'd back off me a little. It's gotten where I feel like we have some form of secret relationship which is absolutely ridiculous to me seeing as my boyfriend lives here and he knows I love him.
 Its seemed to have gotten worse since one day my boyfriend and I were arguing and he was in the room with us. I feel like since he saw us get into it the way we did that he thinks our relationship is going to end or that I'm looking for someone else.

There's a lot more too this whole thing but I keep doubting myself thinking maybe I'm completely wrong and taking everything the wrong thing and I'm in the wrong.. 
I was just wondering if anyone had any kind of advice on how I could explain to him that I really can't handle anyone touching me without him getting upset or hurt. I'm uncomfortable in my entire house at this point. There's no where I can be alone period or anywhere I can go where people can't just walk in. I'm a person of isolation and not having anywhere to be left alone has been getting to me badly, but now I can't stand being somewhere without someone else because he won't do certain things if someone else is around me. 

I just can't do it anymore. I've got a mental illness that is very hard to deal with, I have no insurance to be medicated or treated for it. Being so uncomfortable, and dealing with the mental illness without any assistance also, I'm seriously going out of my mind. I'm acting out so badly. I hate who I've become but can't control it. There's too much going on as is that has been effecting me, dealing with this guy to this degree on top of it is just making it so much worse. 

Any advice about anything actually would be greatly appreciated. About the touch adversin itself, about how I could try to talk to the guy, somehow to work on getting insurance, anything at this point would greatly help.


Tldr; intense touch phobia of some form keeps me unable to touch my mother even, but a guy who lives with us is constantly wanting to touch me or talk to me making me very uncomfortable. Feel like I can't decline as it's my brother's friend and my brother threatens to kick us out over the smallest things already.
