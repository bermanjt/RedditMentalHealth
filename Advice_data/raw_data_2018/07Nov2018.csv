1,"I went to a hiring event for Aldis yesterday morning, they texted me later that day to come in for a group interview on Wednesday at 8am. 
Problem is I have a whole foods interview that SAME morning at 9am which is about 35 minutes away from aldi(the interview is out of the way not the potential store I might work at). 
 i already switched the day my interview was for whole foods before I had the aldi interview and I don't think I should switch again cause it might make me seem irresponsible. 
Now aldis pays 12$ an hour &amp; whole foods 15$ both full time. 
What should I do?
I was going to go to the one with the most money. I have no one to email or call at aldi to see if I could change the interview so idk what to do. ",07Nov2018,1

I go to appointments fortnightly  with an employment advisor for the past month. I’m a 21 year old quiet guy who’s quiet and nervous and polite. She reminded me the interviews she chose me for that I had coming up and she subbed me for both of them (they get job opportunities) and she then turned upbeat and her voice also was upbeat (bubbly) she talked a little about it and then said ‘ok do you need interview clothes?' (THey provide vouchers for interview clothes) I replied politely (I’m very quiet)  ‘yes, Iv got all that' and she  said 'oh have you got all that?’ (upbeat as I said) I said yes then she went on to say 'ok well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes, (she moved her hands also while saying this like a checklist) make sure you get a shave, make sure you cut your nails..make sure you do your hair up all nice and that.....(then she paused as she was facing her computer) ..'and make sure you put some aftershave on aswell, for the girls make sure it's mens' then burst out laughing, she’s never even smiled before (I just smiled along with it) I a young guy and she’d in her early 30s.

3,"My friend was there for me during the worst of times when me and my abusive ex boyfriend of 3 years fought, when we broke up, when he cheated, when he abused me. Now this friend has added him on social media and is talking to him a lot, watching movies with him, calling him etc. She just broke up with her boyfriend over this, and she still continues. I've told her it hurts me and she says she ""understands"" but they're ""Friends"" and nothing will happen. She reached out to me asking to still be friends but if I want to end the friendship over it, she'll understand.

My ex is the biggest liar, manipulator, just all around abuser. He ruined my life for 3 years. This is the only thing he, or she, could do that could hurt me right now. Knowing him, he will try to have sex with her, he can't handle female friends, I've told her this. She swears she won't give in to him. 

They are extremely close now. It hurts so much that he actually speaks to her about his problems and not me the whole 3 years we were together. I clearly still miss him. But this is my friend who KNOWS what he's done to me.

I told her I'm sorry for overreacting and need time to accept it. I feel like I'm going to eventually find out they've slept together, or are dating. It's the type of girl, and the type of guy he is.. Am I over reacting? What would you guys do in my situation? Honestly I feel like cutting her off and forgetting about both of them. It hurts.

4,"Basically I would like advice on finding a place for my partner and I to live before baby arrives. This pregnancy was completely unexpected and we will both not have the support of our families. We have tried moving into an apartment but my partner has terrible credit and is basically on a renters shit list for not paying for a past lease from almost three years ago, he also has a lot of debt in general. I have no credit and make very little money. We live in the northern Houston area. I have been denied application solely on my income and I have NO ONE who can cosign for me . On top of that our income is further limited because my partner still is paying for a student apartment up in lubbock and can't get out of the lease. So our current living situation is living in a large home with roommates. We have a private bed and bath for 800 a month. I really doubt they will allow us to stay with a baby though :( we need a safe, private space for ourselves and I don't know how we are going to make it work. We can't afford much more than 800 a month for rent. I feel like such a failure and I'm so scared that I will not give baby the care and safety it deserves. I'm honestly scared all around and I don't know what to do :(.",07Nov2018,1
5,"This just happened:

I was reapplying to a college course (different system, too complicated to get into) and I knew I'm probably late but there's a couple of things that should work in my favour (passed similar exams, some recognition of prior learning, student at the University)

&amp;#x200B;

I had a shower, set an alarm, got everything sorted for tomorrow.. I was going to meet a lecturer over the department I'm looking at transferring to.

&amp;#x200B;

I said to my dad ""I'm actually looking forward to tomorrow"", I've a new phone that should be here by tomorrow, and the main thing is the meeting.

I checked over an email to see what room number it was and I saw an email I missed.. turns out I can't get in this year and I have to wait an entire year and pay more fees.. 

The last thing I checked before I was going to go to bed was an email saying there's no point in having the meeting but we can if you'd like.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course.. life feels like a sick joke half the time, I can only see so far ahead and just beyond that fog someone shoves something to trip me up..

  
I just feel like life is out to get me, I know how irrational that is but that's how it feels.

What the hell did I do wrong?

There is a girl in my class who wanted my snapchat because she said i seem like a nice guy. I was texting her last week telling her that i have a foot fetish and she said she thought it was cute. I offered to pay her money to let me clean her shoes and give her a foot massage. She agreed and i paid her what she asked for. (i do not feel comfortable saying the amount i gave her) but anyway, yesterday we were meant to meet at the park so i can give her a foot massage and clean her shoes, she ended up telling me she had other plans she forgot she had. so today we were meant to meet at the park after class. she agreed to it last night with my over texts. and today she didnt show up to class and has been leaving me on read all day. I'm scared and it looks like there's nothing i can really do. Is there any advice on how i can talk to her about it? i'm super shy in person that's why i asked her thought text.

8,"So a month ago I moved to college, and my best friend I've made here is a girl I connected with on the first day. At first we were just friends but now I've started to feel more towards her. Whenever I hear about her hooking up or even see her talking with other guys it makes me really sad. The signs towards me are really mixed, like we regularly sleep in the same bed and sometimes cuddle but we have never seemed close to hooking up. Because I am living with her so am around her for so much of my time, and I don't have many friends here let alone any as close as her, I'm really struggling to cope. Bearing in mind there is also a guy in our building she is sleeping with but insists it will never be anything serious, do you guys think I should tell her how I feel and risk making getting hurt and possibly ruining our friendship (and also I hear a lot of bad things about college relationships), or if not how can I deal with the struggles I'm going through?",07Nov2018,1

12,"To start all this off my wife and I recently had a baby. By recently I mean less than 2 weeks ago. So were still getting adjusted for everything. (Sleepless nights because his sleep schedule is messed up, feeding, and mainly just ourselves getting enough sleep.)

The start of the issue I'm having started yesterday. My mom called me at about 8 at night asking me what 3 meant. I had no idea and she said to ask my wife so I did and she said she could come over at 3 tomorrow. Okay no big deal. 

I forgot about it completely(important later). Not a big problem since I worked today (im a factory with no cell service) and didn't get off until about 4.

The moment I get in the parking lot I have nothing from my mom. But I have 14 messages and 3 missed calls from my wife. I skipped all of the messages because I just called her instead. 

Basically my mom had came over and and when she did my wife was giving our son tummy time in his room and all my wife heard was our 2 dogs barking. She didn't think anything of it because it could have been the  mail man. My mom calls her and texts and my wife saw it and went to the door. So my mom was on our porch for maybe 5 minutes at most. When my wife opened the door( according to my mom she flung it open) and went back into his room to make sure everything was okay. My mom and step dad stayed in our living room. The only time my mom went to his room was to ask if she could hold him and my wife said yeah just 10 more minutes. My mom went back to the living room and just stood there. 15 minutes went by and mom went back to his room and said she has to leave and get gas?  She left so my wife called her and asked why and my mom started going on about how she feels like shes a problem and it was a bad time.

My wife is extremely exhausted and stressed out with a few things that have no relevance to this but only added to it. So she started calling me. 

After she told me all this I went straight to my mom's house and asked what happened. She tells me pretty well the same story but adds that my wife doesn't talk to her.(she barely talks to anyone right now because of exhaustion and everyone and their brother coming to our house)then I tell her that I said she could come over after I got off work(forgetting about coming at 3) and she latched onto that like a leech and started saying that I'm lying to her which  inevitably all of this turns into a screaming and cussing match (I said she needs to be more understanding and she says ""i am but this is my first grandchild"") and it goes on from there. Gets to the point where she tells me to get out of her house and I said while leaving you'll never see him again. 

I had no issues or involvement in what happened today because I wasn't even home. I've had 8 hours of sleep in 4 days and am also exhausted so when I got off work being bombarded by everything going on I went in blind with a knife to a gun fight and ended it with my mom not seeing her grandchild again. 

What do I do? Or do you have a similar experience? Help.",07Nov2018,1

14,"We started out friends, then FWB. I’ve always been attracted to him and somehow he’s attracted to me so we started sleeping together. A lot. We’d hookup four to five times a week. And it’s probably vanilla to most people but we’d get kinky-bondage, restraints, wax, role play, spanking, that sort of thing. We explored our sexuality together and it was fantastic. Honestly he was the only guy who was able to keep up with me, not bragging just truth. 
I fell head over heels for him and told him I wanted to be exclusive. He agreed! And we’ve been dating for six months now.

We spoke of moving in together which is a big step. But now a monkey wrench - he has been transferred to Denver (we live in Charlotte area). He’s leaving in four weeks. And he’ll be gone on the weekends because he’s looking for a place to live.
Here’s the thing - he asked me to go with him. We’ve known each other for about two years? Been dating six months but “together” (sexual) for nearly a year.  
I want to go with him. Sexually? Without question the best I’ve ever had. He does things to me I didn’t think could be done. Emotionally? I think it would take a long time to get over him if I say goodbye. A LONG time. He’s the only person in my life I’ve ever seen myself married to, and I was hoping that proposal would come soon. And I shouldn’t say this but financially? He’s got a great job and he makes a lot, even helps me budget what little I have. 

But I’ve never been out of this area. All my friends and family are here. If I leave, I’m leaving everything and starting over with just him. That’s kind of sexy and exciting , but scary as shit too. 
So I don’t know what to do. I’m not concerned with finding a job. He has a head hunter I think it’s called helping me if I want it. Advice please? I’m willing to listen to anything at this point....",07Nov2018,1
16,"Reddit probably isn't the place where I should post this, but I honestly don't know what else to do. This will probably be a bit long, so bear with me. It's hard to keep a consistent post when I have a thousand other things trying to be the focus of my thoughts. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 22, and I'm at a point where I'm unquestionably a failure. After graduating high school in 2014, there have really only been a few things I've done that helped progress me somewhat in life. I've done a year of college, and had 3 jobs. Now, I've posted here before, so some things might seem repetitive, and I apologize for that. I'm not what people would consider a normal 22 year old guy. I'm unbelievably timid, have anxiety on a level that shouldn't exist, and am stuck at a wall that keeps me from helping myself. I don't drive because every time I get behind the wheel, I get a panic attack. I worry that, because I'm really dumb and can't function normally, I'll end up crashing into someone via my dumb choice, their dumb choice, or both. In order to keep those people alive, I just don't drive. On top of that, I hate myself and my will to live practically doesn't exist. At most, it exists on an instinctual level, and nowhere else. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's just a bit of who I am, but the reason I'm making this post is because of what I did earlier.

&amp;#x200B;

My living situation is a bit messed up right now, so I'll go into detail about it later, but right now, just know that I'm supposed to be getting a job because my dad and I might end up being homeless (maybe) if I don't. Earlier, I received an email for setting up a job interview, and I emailed back telling whoever it was (I imagine HR or something) that while I appreciated the opportunity of a job offer, I am not a good candidate for the position because of how timid I am. I told her that my anxiety has crippled me to an extent. She emailed back almost immediately saying that she appreciated my honesty and said that I could be a dishwasher since I would have little interaction with people (Btw, totally fine with that position, I have no issues with being a dishwasher). What astounded me was the fact that she was responded positively and wanted to help me. What I did next is the reason I'm writing this post. 

&amp;#x200B;

As much as I had appreciated her response and willingness to work with me and get me to a position where I would be comfortable working, I emailed back this message:

""Those are just a few of the issues I have. As badly  as I need the job, as badly as I need to earn money, I can't and won't  lie my way through the process just to have a job. I'm not the perfect  candidate, and I don't even consider myself a suitable one. I'd rather  not waste your time when there are more highly qualified individuals out  there, either. I'll always be grateful and appreciative of you giving  me an opportunity, but it isn't one I can take without violating a part  of me that I value. I couldn't do that to you or myself.""

&amp;#x200B;

The issues I mention at the beginning are the things I listed off above. As I was writing this message, I started crying, and I'm not exactly sure why. Maybe it felt like I was disappointing her, or because I was digging myself deeper into the hole I've resided in for a long time now, but I started crying. I kept thinking about why I would do that to myself. Why would I ruin my chances at a job? Maybe it's the part of me that I value. Maybe it's self-sabotage. I don't know what it is, but I need to stop it, and I can't. I don't know what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Besides all of this, the possible medical issues I might have need to be addressed, but if I can't pay for tests, I'll never know. I need a job to pay for tests, but I can't get a job because I can't bring myself to even do an interview. My best solution for everything is to just die because there's really nothing else for me to do. I don't think I was made for this world. I'm an incompatible piece that needs to be purged from this world. I don't fit anywhere, I don't serve any other purpose, and I can't serve any other purpose. I'm this 22 year old little shit mooching off of his parents because I'm unable to function in society. Their issues would be easily solved if I killed myself, but I can't bring myself to do that, either. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do anymore. I need help. I don't know where to go for help. I've tried looking for help, but have found nothing. My dad doesn't even acknowledge my depression as a legitimate thing (yes, it is diagnosed). What can I do? ",07Nov2018,1

21,"Hi everyone. My first reddit post!  


A few months ago I decided to make a career change after a decade in my field (teaching). The last few years the job has helped trigger my depression and anxiety (I was seeing a psychologist last year until my benefits ran out). When my contract was up 5 months ago, I did not renew.

But I've spent the last 5 months searching for jobs where my skills are easily applicable, with no success. I've signed up with recruitment agencies, employment services offices, gone to job fairs, had my resume evaluated... and every day I'm searching and/or applying for jobs online. I'm still unemployed.

Recently a private school found my resume online and contacted me. Even though I know it's not what I want to be doing anymore, I went for the interview and they offered me a job. Now, I don't want the job, but I only have enough savings left to pay my rent and bills for the next couple of months.  A horrible thing to say as a teacher, but the only reason I would consider accepting the job is for the money.

I know I could take the job and just sweat out the year. But when I think about taking it, I just get that tightness in my gut... that feeling. I think about all the anxiety, stressors, every little thing that teaching takes out of me, and how trying to deal with my own issues made me less of an effective teacher in my last years. I know I don't want to take the job, but the 'rational' part of me just keeps reminding me that I do need income.

What do I do?

&amp;#x200B;

35,"I moved across the country in my early 20’s to escape the lull I was in.  I didn’t have any real job prospects, I essentially ruined a long term relationship I was in because I decided it made sense to hook up with a mutual friend.   I drank too much... I wasn’t in a great place so I packed up and moved.  I was able to start over on the other side of the country and found a profession I became very successful at, had a wonderful group of friends and met my current husband.  We have Child and another on the way. 
We decided to look into a job prospect that would take us closer to family and very close to my home town where I’m dreading the idea of facing my past.  I’m a completely different person in my late 30’s and am a really good person now.  I keep telling myself that I’m being to hard on me but the idea of the possibility of facing  certain people makes me want to barf.

36,"So full disclosure I’ve posted here about my roommates weird behavior before, but over the last couple days things have started to point more towards abuse issues. 

For some background, one of my best friends moved in with me and a couple other friends about six months ago. We just found a big house and all moved in together and for the most part it’s been great. We’ve had a couple issues with gamer rage, music, and chores but nothing that wasn’t quickly resolved. But the friend in question has been getting weirder and weirder. 

Normally, this friend is the nicest guy you could meet. He’s very good at making friends and has always been selfless. A couple years back he started dating this girl and they were perfect for each other, at first. But that all changed when she moved away briefly for college and started falling for another guy. For a second they ended the relationships but then immediately came back together and she dropped out of school as a result. A couple of the other friends and I had confronted him and mentioned this was all very suspect and he shouldn’t jump back into a relationship just because it hurt too much not to be in one. That ended him lashing out at us and us promising that we wouldn’t mention his relationship again. 

Fast forward to him moving in and we’ve had several problems that feel like signs of him hiding something between them. I’ll just list a couple of the big points:

- they leave the house multiple times a night claiming to go to the store, but come back empty handed
- they’ll sleep for up to 12 hours a day. 
- neither can hold a job for very long without getting fired or quitting for little to no reason usually. 
- their snake that they owned together just died after a little under 2 years because they forgot about it despite leaving to get a mouse multiple times a week but coming back empty handed. 
- the snake smelled like it had been dead for awhile but the room smelt bad already
- they sneak around the house sometimes acting like we don’t see them. 
- they lie about trivial things mainly to the questions about why they are late. 
- they leave a mess that they are blind to in every room they enter. 
- they sometimes cannot control the volume of their voice and will switch between a yell and a whisper multiple times within the same sentence. 
- they won’t acknowledge other people around them anymore. 
- she pretty much lives at our house rent free despite us telling him on numerous times that she can only be there so many days a month. 
- he claims to have no time for anything but they both sit around all day doing nothing. 
- he’s failing a class but won’t drop it. 
- they’re both sexual people but don’t ever have sex. 
- she has been found sleeping in random areas around the house in the morning but will lie about it. 
- their points of conversation have changed from intellectual to psycho babble for lack of a better term. 
- they want to move to LA so she can be a famous actress despite her saying she’s never had a callback  
- they’ve both pushed away most of their friends and family
- neither of their parents will let them sleep at their place together despite knowing they don’t have sex, and neither having religious or cultural convictions. 


And to top this all off I had a simple conversation with him yesterday, just a heart to heart, to figure out how I could help him keep on schedule with chores and prioritizing his household a little bit. A conversation that I used to be able to have with him even 4 months ago with no problem, but he seemed like he had been crying or maybe even sick.  During this talk he shelled up and tried to shut me down by only saying a couple words and half assing his excuses. After the conversation I told him we all have to find a way to schedule the house in and if he was having any bigger issues, that I’m here as a friend to talk to him. He brushed me off and went to his room to call his gf. They were on the phone for an hour and then she picked him up and they left. He just showed back up not that long ago according to another roommate. But this is strange because he has never slept away from the house (lack of funds and no where else to sleep since she lives at home).

Is it normal to still feel terrible sometimes after a break up that happened 6 months ago? I got dumped after 4 years of being with him and he never contacted me afterwards.

It’s just so difficult because I loved him so much...and to be dumped out of no where after all the time it still kills me, and he never asked to see how I was afterwards knowing how heartbroken I was...wtf.

48,"Okay Reddit, so recently (about 3 or 4 weeks ago) I have found out my dad has been cheating on my mom. I first noticed it when my dad took me out to a concert. I just happened to glance at his phone while he was on it and saw a bunch of love messages (words like baby and love emojis) and I think he saw me because he then started trying to hide the screen from me when I was around. Yes I know this is a bad thing for me to do but my eyes just wondered but then I got curious. When I got home, I decided to check Facebook and I couldn't believe what I saw. I saw things going on between my dad and some other woman and this goes back about as far as mid-September. Not to mention he's been missing every weekend for about a month and a half. Now for a few years, I know my parents have had problems but I guess I'm just shocked because I figured they would've tried resolving this instead of my dad resorting to such a dastardly thing. The main thing of all this is my thoughts I'm having where I think one day, my dad will just leave the house to go live with this other woman and leave me to take care of the family. My mom has multiple health issues that would prevent her from getting a job that pays enough to support a mortgage, 2 kids, etc. This is probably the thing that scares me the most. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I just feel like all these thoughts are driving me insane.

53,"I'm 19 and live with my mom, single parent. I have a half brother who is 27 and he splits rent as mentioned, with a friend. They're not renting an apartment, though, but a warehouse room. Due to his income it was either that or rent a proper apartment. 

Reason they rented a spot in the warehouse is to build a studio to make music and avoid possible noise complaints that come with making music in an apartment. He wants to turn a career out of it and make it big. Incidentally that is his ""sacrifice"" to being into music. 

His studio doesn't have a kitchen or a private bathroom so he frequently crashes with us if he wants to sleep beside the studio which is rather inhospitable (it's not for living, after all). 

He takes showers at the gym or whenever he sleeps with us. Problem is that my mom is getting tired of it because sometimes comes in unannounced, crashes in like an airBnB, sleeps most of the time and when he eats or showers he leaves a mess that he doesn't fully clean up. She's getting tired of cleaning up after him.

I don't know what will happen or what can happen to ease the friction here. Should my mom charge for some stays, maybe not to get money from him, but to discourage him coming here? He has alternatively slept at a friends' house but he greatly prefers going with our mom.",07Nov2018,1

Brunette: “excuse  me...excuse me” 

Me: *stops to look over*

Brunette: “how do yer get a job in here?” 

Me: “oh just online application form and sent it from there”

Then they asked me about a girl who worked in there (where I work) i walked over t their table and I said yes and she was saying they don’t know her that well just by sight and then said ‘yea she’s bit weird like’ (which she is tbh) as she was talking with the blonde girl too but the blonde girl was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ or something like that then the brunette then said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know’ and then looked at me after she sipped her drink with a straw then grew a smile and said 'she likes you' quipped and they all burst out laughing I just walked away (she meant the girl at work who said she likes me. She doesn’t as these girls never seen me before) then I then went back to finish cleaning the table and it went quiet again: 

Brunette: “excuse me”

Me: *looked over*

Brunette: “can I ask you a serious question” (she pointed at me saying it nervously and politely) 

Me: “yeah”

Brunette; “have you got a gf?” (she said it really pleasantly )

Me: ***ignored her because I didn’t know what to think of it***

Blonde: *watching the whole thing and after a pause between anyone talking again*  “awww leave him alone, he’s dead cute” looking over smiling and “he probably has” (probably has a gf) (she said it out loud while looking over at me like as if she made sure I heard her idk)

Brunette: “have yer, have yer got a gf?” (Pleasantly in a wanted to know way)

Me: *ignored again wiping the table looking annoyed because I didn’t know how else to act*

Blonde: laughs a bit  and says ‘aww leave it, he’s fuming now’ laughing a bit (I wasn’t fuming it was the coffee stain on the table I was wiping was not coming out lol) 



 . On their way out by the door when I was cleaning other tables the brown girl looked a bit drunk walking out with her hand on her head and the blonde girl who seemed normal walked towards me and went out of her way a little to say ‘byyyeee’ loudly smiling politely idk they looked like pleasant well spoken girls not loud drunk girls

66," I'm an American that moved to the Netherlands after marrying a Dutchie. We've been together for years, and he's definitely not the problem. He genuinely tries the best he can, and bares no blame on this subject. However, the loneliness of moving thousands of miles from my friends and family has been overwhelming, to say the least. I'm still learning the language after about two years, and really don't have any friends to call my own on this side of the ocean. I recently started a Dutch class, which has been a nice place to socialize and actually have a goal again.

I'm a worker. I always have been. I went to college and worked three jobs. Suddenly, I'm left with nothing but free time. I can only work as a self-employed person in freelance journalism. This may sound like a dream for many of  you. I understand. If I was in the position I was two years ago, I'd roll my eyes at the thought of someone complaining about this. But it's so dark and restricting. I have 18 hours alone time with no purpose. I live in the ghetto, where they don't really speak English, so going out alone can be stressful. On top of it, soon after moving, I started getting really sick.

At first I ignored it. I thought it was my spondylolisthesis acting up. But the symptoms kept changing. Some days, I had too much pain to move. The Dutch doctors totally ignored me, so I had to fly back to America multiple times to try and figure it out. I had my period for 5 months and peed blood, and the Dutch doctors asked me ""what I expected them to do about it"" and it was probably nothing. They also told me to ""stop googling my illnesses"" when I told them I had spondylolisthesis (basically an illness where your back is a bit off-hinge and hurts like fuck sometimes). I literally had the MRI scans with me that clearly say I have it, among other minor things. I was peeing and shitting blood. I was vomiting. I had great days and horrible days, where I just couldn't seem to find relief. The symptoms were always different, but the worst is when I'd start sweating and get horrible cramps. You could physically see my body tensing and releasing. It would feel like stabbing pain. Not to mention, I haven't been able to have sex in nearly a year because the pain was unbearable. I can't seem to wake up so many days. I have no energy for things that brought me so much happiness. It genuinely didn't start as depression. I've had it before, I understand what it is, but it was just because everything always hurt. As the clock was running out on my American insurance, the urologist, gyno, and uro-gyn seemed to agree it was endometriosis, with my doctor adding that I may have fibromyalgia . But my insurance wouldn't cover a laproscopy for several months, so it's still unconfirmed. I just got Dutch insurance, but I don't really know how to find a doctor in my area that speaks English and doesn't just seem to act like I'm just an American wanting painkiller (which I don't want. My dad is an addict and I'm well aware I can't ever touch the stuff).  
I guess my question is... how do I become me again? If there are any expats, do you have advice on finding a decent doctor? I mean, even if I'm sick, how do I start having interests again? It's hard to make plans when you don't know if you can leave the house the next day. I don't really move. I used to read all the time, draw, sing at weddings, and I worked at several small news outlets. But I feel like I don't know how to do those things anymore. I don't want this pain and loneliness to define who I am. I'm adventurous. I'm fun-loving and sociable. I'm trying to take steps to learn more Dutch and blend into this society more, but I feel like I'll always be the expat who has nothing to say. I want to take this time to better myself, but I genuinely don't know how to right now. I want people to talk to who I feel like I won't be a burden to. I know my sickness affects my mother and husband. I don't bother mentioning it to my friends. I just don't really know what to do.

I see other people chatting away to multiple people online while sitting waiting for a bus, while I maybe have one conversation with one person once a month or so. I don't get to meet new people often, in part because no one seems interested in talking to me or trying to get to know me at all.

Title basically explains it all. After any sexual encounter where an act is performed involving my genitals (sex, blowjob, handjob, etc.), I find I always feel like shit mentally, very comparable to how I felt when I went through a bout of depression.

It's not an issue of poor performance at all, those I've been with have decent experience and can definitely get me going... But I always feel like shit in the end. These are straight male / female relationships, and while we're getting to it, my partner really gets into it too.

Has anyone else dealt with this? Could part of the reason be a fear of getting caught in the act, or potentially a lack of self confidence?

I know this is probably the wrong sub, if so I apologise... and I'm sure I haven't answered all potential questions. Feel free to ask anything you think could help.",07Nov2018,1

73,"Background- I’ve been friends with this person for three years. Her and I started becoming closer this year though and we both talked about dating each other, but we never really did anything about it. Our argument was about how I put a lot of my problems on her. I do have bipolar disorder (it’s no excuse) and this is one of the first times she’s ever been caught in one of my manic episodes. I can’t control it and it’s dreadful and embarrassing. 

I have the problem of being an over-sharer and an over-thinker. I assume she doesn’t like me and all sorts of other incorrect things. I share too much about my personal life. She has more than enough on her plate without my issues too.  I’ve been taking new meds to control my mania and I’m talking to people about improving my confidence as that’s where this comes from. I know I can improve, but I’m worried she won’t care to see if I can. We haven’t talked in 7 days and the last thing I said was an apology that was all over the place (I shouldn’t text when I’m not in a right state of mind.) 

My Concerns- should I send a more coherent apology that is honest about my problem, telling her that I can fix it? Or should I be more natural and talk to her without bringing up my mistakes as much and just showing that I’ve improved? I had an idea of getting a gift that’s more sentimental and not a “I spent money forgive me” gift. I thought about buying a cactus from across the country since she’s into plants and succulents and I thought it’d be a stupid sweet gift lol. I’m leaning more towards just mentioning my mistakes less and just showing her I’ve dropped those bad habits instead. My biggest concern isn’t that i won’t be able to do better, I’m concerned that she wants me completely out of her life. I think this is me just overthinking, as we’ve been friends for a long time and our argument was very tamed. Any advise is appreciated. I’m just kind of venting here so I understand if I’m hard to understand lol. Thank you ",07Nov2018,1
74,"  I am a university senior in political science who’s currently taking 5 courses. After I discovered I had a lot of free time early in the semester, I decided to get a job so I would feel less useless, even though I didn’t really need the money as I had earned a lot over the summer. The job is an on-campus dining job, I work a little over 11 hours a week serving and then closing (meaning I clean). However, this job has gradually made my chronic anxiety and depression worse and worse until I began to have difficulty focusing on my work and anything else, as whenever I think about going back to work I become overwhelmingly anxious and depressed. Even though the job sucks, I know it’s not logical. For some reason, this goes on for most of the day, it’s a constant presence. I already struggle with controlling procrastination, which over the past year I have improved, but I feel this job has made that worse too. I really want to quit so I can focus on my heath and schoolwork, but if I leave before the semester is over (In a little over a month) I’ll feel like I’ve “failed” and I might be disappointed in myself for a while. I see people who have harder classes than I do work more hours. I’m also afraid that because they are already understaffed for closing I’ll make it harder for everyone else. My ideal situation would be to stick it out till the end of the semester, but to do this I’ll need to find a way to manage my mental state and have a different outlook on work. Any advice? Has anyone been though anything similar? ",07Nov2018,1

79,"So I won't be saying names just to give this dude the benefit of the doubt. But I'm a 17 year old high school student and I was going through Instagram, liking comics and stuff and I like a guy's comic. The guy has like 40k followers and is followed by several other artists that I like. 

Anyways, the guy starts talking to me, and like in a friendly manner, not in a creepy ""send bob and vegine"" thing. Like actually talking to a person conversation. And he wasn't pushing for nudes or anything. 

So tonight, we're just goofing off and he sends a picture of himself with messy hair. This guy is clearly older. Like old enough to drink older. In response, I said a pic of me with messy hair (I have short hair). The guy then asks how old I am and we make the awkward age exchange. I tell him I'm 17 and he says he's 30. He then asks if I'm turning 18 pretty soon and I say in January, (because I am). I then go on to say that if I make him uncomfortable to just let me know and we both make an agreement not to send private pics, like selfies and stuff, but memes are an acceptation. 

I make an attempt to clear the air and send a few memes, he's read them, but his response is just lol or laughing emojis. Am I too young? This was clearly a start of a friendship and not a relationship because neither of us were flirting or anything, at least I don't think so? But then again, you wouldn't be seeing a 17 year old hanging around a 30 year old unless they were family or family friends.

82,"My friend recommended me to post how I feel online, maybe it will help, I'm just trusting her judgement to be honest.

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, I'm sorry if anything I say comes off as conceited or just as some stupid first world problem. There are loads of people out there with way worse issues, and I don't mean to make them seem less important.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 20 year old second year maths university student ( This is relevant ). And right now I guess I know I want to go into some financial job that pays well. But recently in life I just feel like I'm incapable of actually achieving any of my goals. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to study more things outside of my modules, somewhat more relevant to the jobs I'd end up getting, but also just to diversify myself and Improve my knowledge. I genuinely value self-improvement in every sense. 

But I'm genuinely not good enough, I can't study long enough to achieve what I want (Which is beyond the highest grade, some would probably say it's pointless, and they're arguably right). I can't stick to being efficient, delegating my time properly. Keeping to a strict diet whilst go gym. Basically, I can't commit to anything, I hold myself back from doing what I know I'm capable of doing and it sucks. I'm genuinely not sure how to change this. 

I have so much planned too, internships to apply for, volunteering and charity work, changing jobs to diversify my CV and for something that's more convenient, arranging events for the society I'm apart of. Socialising with people and trying to actually enjoy life. Spending some time playing the 150 games I bought and basically never touched. 

So yeah, that's one part of my life, not exactly sure how to change it.

&amp;#x200B;

Part 2 of this mess. 

&amp;#x200B;

Socialising, I did just say I enjoy it, but it's such a surface level thing. I have quite a few 'friends' (I don't mean to sound like I'm some popular cool dude or anything, I'm not. I'm a fat little kid), a lot of them are really nice people but it's impossible for me to say I'm genuinely myself around 90% of them, I'm acting most of the time. My two closest friends moved away due to university and I never get to see them. 

I just feel like there's no one I can genuinely be myself around. I try and meet so many new people in order to find someone I can be like that with. I'd be happy if it was just one person, but it's no one. Usually it would be a girlfriend but I've been single for 2-3 years and it doesn't really seem to be changing anytime soon. I have no one to vent to, or to help keep me on the right track when my morale is low. And to be honest it just sucks, I genuinely just want some proper friends and I don't know what to do. I literally have conversations where I ask questions I know the answer to, pretend to act interested when it's something really superficial. Idk.

88,"I am a 17 year old girl and my mom is taking me to the doctor's tomorrow for my physical. 

To be brief, ever since I was around 12 years old, my mom has abused me and yelled at me about my weight even though I have a very healthy BMI, just because my sister is naturally skinnier. I am 5'6 and 135 lbs but my mom has tried ""dieting"" me (but I always get really hungry so throughout the day I end up eating more than what she gives me) so she thinks I should weigh around 125 lbs.  I have struggled on and off with eating disorders including binge eating, the last time my mom weighed me I was 130 lbs but I have suffered a lot of binges in the past few months and gained 5 lbs. That's still a healthy weight but I am trying to improve. I am doing a lot better now but when my mom saw I was 130 she said I was a fat bitch, that I was disgustingly overweight, that she was going to severely limit how much I was eating, etc. So I can't even imagine what will happen when she sees I have GAINED weight from the last time she checked.

I tried to not eat anything for the past 2 days to try and lose at least 5 lbs of water weight, I checked the scale today and I was 133.7 lbs. So basically I haven't lost any weight at all. I am scared to death of how my mom will react when she sees my weight, I am literally on the verge of crying every time I think about stepping on that scale tomorrow. I know she won't get physical but the thought of the continued verbal backlash is enough.

 I am 17 so I have no legal control over my medical information.

Does anyone have any tips on how I can at least make myself a few pounds lighter tomorrow? Like is there a certain way to stand? It's an electronic scale, not the balancing type. Should I drink a lot of water now or sneak out and go for a walk at night or something? I am really scared, I wish I had starved myself for the past month to lose 10 lbs.... ",07Nov2018,1

94,"Hello everyone I’m in a tough situation, I’ve been feeling more and more suicidal everyday and I don’t want to be feeling this way but it’s getting harder. 

Some last year my girlfriend and of 8 years found out we were expecting. Now this is actually a miracle because she had some issues with her uterus when she was 12 and told she would never be able to have children. We were both in college at the time and I dropped out and managed to find a decent paying job not enough for two people but enough. I loved her and  I was excited for the baby so we got married. Now due to her earlier issues she had some complications during the pregnancy and she was unable to work so we could not afford a place to live on our own. Besides the desire to finish school we moved in with my parents as they had a small studio that they weren’t using attached to his house. She didn’t want to do this because she didn’t want to live with other people but this is all we could afford. My father and I agreed on a very minuscule rent and things went fine for a while.  After saving for a bit I managed to re-enroll at a community college completely online. She eventually had the baby early due to the complications but everything was fine we welcomed our new boy. Now it’s been a year the baby just turned one and I hate my life. I’m working really hard at school taking as much credits as possible so I can finish up as well as working at the same place. She really wants to move out but we can not afford too. I also want to but it’s not financially possible as well live in a major metropolitan area. If I took a second job I could afford it but then I’d have to drop out of school as I can nearly keep up now. I’m a very relaxed guy, I don’t like getting into arguments or anything and I give her a lot of freedom, she doesn’t work, she can essentially buy anything as she pleases and I promised her that it wouldn’t take much longer as I long have about one year of school left. She isn’t happy about this and is constantly belittling me and saying things to get me down.

Now I admit I’m not the best but I am trying I go to a job I hate every morning and go to sleep at 2 am every night doing school work I spend about 2% of my entire check. It’s hard to get around to everything since I’m so busy. She’s constantly telling me that I always want to live with my parents cause I don’t make an effort to move, that I’m giving away my money to my dad that I shouldn’t have to pay rent. since he is my dad. I’m a bad father to my son, and I love her a lot so this always gets me down. I sometimes sit in the bathroom and cry because I feel like I’m not doing enough or not good enough. If we moved out like she wants we wouldn’t be able to afford anything else, so I take this pit stop as a temp situation while I finish my education. But to her she’s like trapped her forever. Lately things have been rough it’s constant rude comments and putting me down. I go quite when I’m stressed or sad and that’s when she is the meanest. The other day the oil light came on and she asked me to change it and I agreed to. I’ve been so busy with school and work and the time I spend with my son (wish it could be more) that I went almost two weeks without doing it. I know this is bad but I have my mind wrapped around 100 things it’s hard to maintain keep track of everything. She took it to an mechanic and changed the oil but beat me with the fact that she had to do it. The problem now, is that the toilet tank cracked. Again it’s been a a month it was leaking for a bit and now it’s stopped I asked my father about replacing it and he agreed to when he had time as it’s not immediate need to replace. But she doesn’t want to wait and stuff and wants to do it herself so she told me I told her no my father or I will do it and she said she was going to do it anyways. This is when I flipped out and told her that it’s my money and I don’t want to spend it on a plumber. So she flipped out and started verbally assaulting me, it hurts be so much though coming from her since I love her so much. Now she’s saying she’s going to get a job so she doesn’t have to use my money and she’s going to move and that she’s going to take my son and leave. 

I’m really sad now from constantly being called stupid or a loser. In the last 4 months I’ve thought about ending it all maybe 5 times a week.. it seems like such an easy way out but I can’t cause I love my son very much.. the few times I get to spend with him I adore, and it makes me sad that I can’t spend more time with him in between work and school and sleeping. I want to end it all but I love him I want to see him grow up. But if she leaves and takes him I don’t know if I’ll have a reason not too. I might be over dramatic or just really down right now. I’m just stressed everyday at work and when I get home and it’s getting harder to pretend everything’s okay everyday.

97,"this is an odd story and I feel slightly uncomfortable telling it but I could really use opinions here.

I (f19) had a friend all throughout middle school; the friendship was rocky, in hindsight we were constantly in passive-aggressive competition w each other, normal 13-yr-old girl stuff that could’ve been resolved, right? well, that’s what i assumed when i saw her last — over five years ago. 

like i said, the friendship had lots of ups &amp; downs and we ultimately ended up having a falling out towards the end of middle school. we *kind of* talked through it right before school ended, but then, she just fucking disappeared. seemingly changed her phone number (and did not share the new one w any of her friends), deleted all social media, did not attend our high school come 9th grade the following year, and just ultimately withdrew from our “society”. 

my initial guess was that she moved. she didnt. (wont explain how ik this but i do) none of her other friends have spoken with her in these five years so im pretty sure she isnt just ghosting me. everyone is curious about her, a girl I haven’t seen in years brought her up to me at a party the other day; she said she tried looking her up on various social media and was surprised to find nothing. 

this leads to my overall question: is it weird of me to lurk/try to find her? she wasnt the greatest friend to me but it makes me feel uneasy that she just disappeared and has no online presence whatsoever? any advice/similar experiences?

99,"Today the news spread around a student at my school committed suicide. It was awful to hear, and there were so many posts that honored her memory. It was sweet, aside from the incident. I didn’t plan to share anything, as it’s a difficult subject for me and many others.  

I never knew the girl who committed suicide, but news came out that she was getting bullied. Many more posts came out after that, including one of my own. 

Mine was relatively short, staying on the subject of how she would be missed, how suicide shouldn’t be joked about, and that we should re-evaluate the way we look and treat people. Many others were similar.

My close friends post said:

“As a lot of you know, (name) killed herself. someone or some people were bullying her. i didn’t know her very well but we had a couple conversations on the bus my 8th grade year. she was a really good person to talk to. i just wanted to share this because i understand her struggle and that’s why i sent out so many photos last night as i could cause nobody should have to go through that”

I didn’t get a picture or anything from her, but my art account did. It stated “Just telling you that i love you and that you are appreciated. even if you don’t know me thanks for being alive”

Regarding her original post, I feel like it is so insensitive. Starting out with “(name) killed her self” is so impersonal and almost spiteful. Isn’t it an unspoken rule to say that someone committed suicide instead of killed themself because it comes across as inhumane? I also felt like she took the death of a young girl and turned it around to be about her. The only acknowledgment of the passing of this girl is with the “she killed herself” line. 

Regarding the photo she sent around, it’s also so insensitive and impersonal . It was a half-assed “i care so give me brownie points” type of picture too. There’s nothing special about it, and is basically the equivalent to the quality of a streak on snapchat. 

For a bit of background info on this person, they’re the type that fakes having depression and anxiety for attention. All her friends also fake depression and anxiety. She often excludes me because I haven’t been diagnosed with either, but brags about me being her friend to everyone she meets. She tries to act like she knows everything about everything and is so involved, and tends to one-up everyone.

100,"I really want to save money for the future, for things like graduate school, buying an apartment, or both. If those are the things I want for the future, is the way I'm saving money right now the best way? 

I'm 19, still in college, and living with my parents. Thankfully, my parents don't charge me rent or utilities and my tuition is covered through scholarships (with about $2000 left over from each semester). I do have a job, but I only work a maximum (sometimes less) of 12 hours a week (due to the days we're open, it's not possible to work more) and get paid $10.50, which means I make about $400-$500 a month. 

I've been putting half of my paycheck into my savings account, and the other half for personal use. However, I'm paying for my gas and commute between the places I go to is quite far, which means I get gas every week or week and a half (so about $35 per refill, which becomes about $140 a month). That means I only have about $60-110 left a month for personal use, which generally is not enough.

&amp;#x200B;

I grew up in an Asian family where education and prestige were hammered, which isn't a bad thing in itself. My childhood was pretty rocky and my family situation was never the best. We were on welfare for most of my life, and my family still is. I was a pretty average high schooler, I ended with a 3.8. I was a Sal, and was involved in a multitude of things. I ended up applying to multiple schools, got rejected and am now attending a pretty decent 4-yr university on a full-tuition scholarship. I wouldn't say I fit in here immediately, because I don't, but I'm sure I could find a niche if I tried hard enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to transfer for the wrong reasons but I can't help but be miserable. I KNOW the way I'm thinking is wrong. I should be content with what I have, I'm being challenged enough in my courses, I love my professors, the science department could be better, but this school genuinely cares about you. My sister also lives close by so I have family close by. The only legitimate concern I have is that this school is 78% white and there's a culture here I don't fit in with but not fitting in is a part of life right? 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, to sum it all up, I've dug myself deep being miserable because all I can focus on is transferring. I did some soul-searching today and I don't want to admit it, but the reason I want to transfer is that I feel like I can do ""better."" Obviously, the coursework here is challenging because I won't end with a 4.0 this semester, maybe a 3.5.  I know this way of thinking is wrong but it was how I was raised, I'm an ambitious person so I'm always going to be looking for ""better,"" but it's making me miserable. I understand I'm essentially looking down on the people here and I am by no means better than them but I don't know how to rewire my train of thought without feeling like I'm essentially lying to myself.",07Nov2018,1
107," In mid September he dumped me. He said he wanted to be friends and we've kept in touch. We skyped in late october one day because something happened to me(we were long distance so skype was our only way of talking) and he offered to talk to me. We discussed stuff and he said the way he dumped me was impulsive. He told me he still loves me and about a dream he had where we were about to have sex and he bit my neck and sand came out and another where he was in a car talking to someone about how he of course still loves me since we dated for 2 years. He told me that he wants to keep in touch and he's not saying it out of pity. He's not comfortable dating anybody and has even asked me if I have(showing signs of jealousy). He told me about how someone tricked him into practically going on a date and how he hated it. He said that he wants to stay in touch and maybe we can try things again in college.

Now I sat there feeling good and then a day goes by and I'm like, ""so should I not move on??? Am I supposed to wait""? So We called again when he was available and I asked him. He told me to move on. I let it sink in and we talked about how we've felt since the breakup. I clarified that I'm not asking for him back(even though I do miss him), and he told me he hasn't deleted a single picture of mine because he just hasn't looked at them. He also hasn't taken down a drawing I made him or an embroidery I made him in his room.

I posted a long thing on my snapchat(which has only my closest friends and him) just about how I've realized a lot of stuff and I'm in a really good point in my life, and that I know that eventually I'll meet someone etc etc, a bunch of stuff, and he replied saying ""I love you"". I texted him two days ago asking why he did and he doesn't remember. I then told him he didn't have to tell me that we could try things again. He said okay and that he did mean what he said about maybe trying things again in the future.

**Why would he tell me to move on if he suggested maybe trying things again in college(We both graduate in June)??? Is he just telling me to move on because he's indecisive and feels bad telling me to wait? I don't understand his thinking.**",07Nov2018,1

I've been burned by so many friendships so many times that I gave up on humans. For about 2 years I've had literally no friends. Also, I suck at apologizing and ot never sounds sincere.

About a year ago I met this guy who is 3 years older than me, but we were just acquaintances since I wasn't interested in being friends. About 5 months ago he kind of started seeping into my life. He would like my social media posts, and sometimes comment. 

I finally decided to give him a chance, and we ended up being pretty good friends. We text each other almost daily and see each other twice a week at events. 

This afternoon he texted me to ask if I wanted to go to a slam rock concert with him (mind you i don't listen to that kind of music). We both are religious people and I was absolutely disgusted by the lyrics of the songs. WAY worse than the lyrics in new rap. The lyrics are disgusting even for non-religious people.

I explained to him that that the lyrics were disgusting and I would not be attending. He tried to tell me he doesn't go for the lyrics. 

He doesn't get offended easily, but we argued about his choices for about 45 minutes. Any advice on how I could apologize for being a jerk about it?

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a small circle of houses next to a hospital. It's a popular place for older folks to live, and my husband and I are odd ones out as we are a fair bit younger than them (25 and 26).

&amp;#x200B;

I figured it would be nice to be a good neighbor, so when the lady catty-corner to our house reached out to me with an invitation for coffee I obliged. Let's call her Marsha. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was alright at first, I figure she was treading lightly as to not scare me off. (I get the feeling it has happened before, she tells me often that if I stop talking to her it will hurt her feelings.) But recently I'm coming realize that I just don't like her.

 

Marsha treats me like a therapist, talking about subjects I'm not really comfortable with. She talks in detail about her sex life and complains about her husband and how she doesn't love him. She complains that her youth is behind her comments on how jealous she is of my complexion. She makes racist comments and is unkind to waiters and other people in the service industry. I worked in the service industry for years and the things she says and does when we go out makes want to cringe my way out of existence. She's begun to ask for favors that I'm not comfortable agreeing to, like driving her to another state for the weekend. She often stops by the grocery store when driving me back from dinner or coffee. (I don't really want to shop for groceries with you?)

&amp;#x200B;

It's gotten to the point that I'm not really myself around her. I feel like I'm putting on an act. It's a very one-sided relationship that I get nothing out of. I get such anxiety every time she wants to do something together...

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do about Marsha? It'd be one thing to just stop returning her calls, but she lives across from my house...

112,"I’ve made a couple posts talking about parts of this but delete them soon after because I thought I can do this on my own but with all that is happening I can’t think straight. On what to focus on.  I will break this up into parts so I will be easier if you just want to give advice for some. 

My dad passed away 10 days ago, it feels like it’s been forever since I first heard the news I’ve managed to get myself back together somewhat but certain things just make me fall apart for a bit, I’m staying at his house to watch I guess my dogs now. Every morning I still expect  to see him but its the same empty house over and over. I’m falling way behind  in my college classes. Any time I see my work I try but my mind just can’t get past this block to do anything. I haven’t even emailed my professors about what happened because I again lock up and don’t know what to do.  The time to withdraws has passed but I’ve been told that late withdrawals and other things are in place Incase something happeneds. I don’t want to have to do another semester of these classes and fall behind  but I can’t do my work so I am worried, what is my best action?

Next is my best friend or kinda best friend now, the day my dad died I texted him asking if we could talk but I just ignored his text asking me if I was okay. I just told him I was drunk and it was nothing, since I knew something was up between us, I thought we were best friends still so I just asked how good of friends are we and he said goodish, I was taken back since we have been best friends for 8 years, we hadn’t  hung out  in two months but we still texted, I asked him what happened, and he explained how balancing work, school and his girlfriend was taking all of his time up so He cut me out , which it’s his life and he had to make a decision, I just didn’t think it would be me, since me and him are the closest friends and had the us against the world mentality,  but a girl he dated for less than 5 months was enough to Throw me to the side, at this point I’m really fucking hurt, but I just tell him it was okay it’s just life. None of my friend know of my dads death but he was having a memorial on the 14th and I asked him if wanted to come since it would be nice to have a friend, I leave him the dark about most of it. Though he kept poking and eventually I told him if he wanna know what happened but it’s some heavy stuff he agreed and I just lay down everything in my mind my dad death how I’m pissed off and how he cut me of fucking is a punch to the gut. He tried comforting me and also telling me that we would always be best friends since our history I even told him about how I let down my dad before he died and how I have this overwhelming guilt and that can’t forgive myself and I’ve never been the emotional type so this was all new and he told me that he wants to help me get through this and said we should hang and talk about this sometime but then I realized he would have never given me his time to hang and talk if it was not for my loss. In instantly told him that Don’t want or need pity since I need a real friend so if he should tell me now if it is just pity and there will be no hard feelings. He said he was genuine with wanting to help. But after a while he started kind talking funny and said some weird stuff about how he has his own problems too, so Offered to help but when I asked about them he just dodged the question I realized he was high but then he accidentally sent me a snap and since it was 2 am I’m sure it was to his girlfriend although the caption didn’t seem related unless it was some inside thing, I blew it off but in the morning I realized that he could have told he the whole thing, since they are closer than me and him ever where apparently. I actually used to be friends with this girl we were good friends until she replaced me an old friend she started talking to and eventually even blocked me.  She is a pretty manipulative type and my kinda best friend falls for girls so easily.  I told him that I would appreciate it if he just  kept it between us and even from his girlfriend he gave me his word, we were talking on Snapchat and I even noticed he deleted the messages since he  always saves a force of habbit but not only that but everything else like all of our old convos, eventuality I asked him about the problems he talked about earlier and he just talked weird,his sentences were just weird he eventually told me it was an loneliness he felt and Asked if it hand to do with is girlfriend or some people. He replied no me and her are fine and we won’t be breaking up, it came off kinda ass hostile but then he said the felt nothing at all for a while and was just coming out of it. He also talked about a depression yes used that to describe past tense. He always cared about his grammar a lot so I was pretty confused also it seemed that every problem he spoke about was all in the passed and his explanations were cryptic and lacked a lot of details some thing didn’t even add up. I can’t think of why he was acting so weird, I want to be best friends with him again but I’m not sure how I would feel being second place to someone like his girlfriend I feel like I can never fully trust him if she is #1 since I know no matter what his loyalty will belongs to her at the end of the day. Should I even trust him? some things just seem like straight up pity while other times he just acts weird sometimes especially with his “problems” nothing really made sense: any ideas on what it is up with him and wether l should take a chance and trust him or not. I really do want to be friends with him but not if it’s pity or some second ahead shit.

I’m a junior in HS and I’ve had a crush on a senior ever since I was a froshie (so back then, she was a sophomore) 

She’s always kinda liked me (I think) , always touchy and seems happy to be around me

I’ve also always wanted to make a move but unfortunately now she’s dating someone, but now her feelings for me are more .. um.. expressed ? She’ll openly call me a cutie pie, ask to hold hands with me, touch my shoulders and stuff like that. But, I’m 10000% positive she’s dating someone! So, what is going on?

I’m sure this has happened to some people, so if you can I’d just like to understand her feelings better. I mean I doubt she wants a romantic relationship with me since 1) she’s already in a relationship and 2) calling someone a cutie pie usually just means they think you are cute and well I’d assume the word your looking for is hot and not cute but... 

And if she breaks up with this dude should I make a move ? I’ve never been in a relationship before and I’m 16 😨

I opened my bathroom door to find a cockroach in my shower crawling on my shampoo. I immediately grabbed my hose shower head and flushed the sob down the drain( i flund out they can come through the drain so that was useless). 

I texted my sister in law about it because there are roach motels(traps) in certain spots around the studio from her cousin(was the previous tenant) and she told me its mainly due to our next door neighbor who is a hoarder. They have experienced before and even their buddy who is an exterminator said the rosches will stick around as long as my neighbor hoards. 


To my surprise, I was about to get in the shower again and guess what? A roach was here again (looked like the one I flushed, and hope its the same one). This time I squished it (have video if anyone wants proof) and grabbed toilet paper and flushed it down the toilet. 

Now I am fairly clean because I hardly am home and barely cook here or leave food out, and keep the restroom fairl spotless. I know its not me. It kills me to know it isn’t my fault. At this point, what can I do??? I feel vulnerable being naked in my shower with a roach being here. I will get more hotels and toss out the old ones, but as far as my neighbor goes, what do I do?

I thought this was a strange reaction but knew that I needed to do something to reassure her that her child is safe with me. 
I meet with her today and she made a few comments that seemed, well, extreme. She said she has, “no compassion for me.”
Her, “child is not safe with me and these incidents have nothing to do with the staff that were supervising the children.”

But a huge reason why I ended our relationship was because of the stress and lack of motivation I've been feeling in my life lately. I felt it would be unfair to him for me to not be able to put in as much effort into our relationship, when he was putting effort into our relationship. But my ""lack of effort"" I guess wasn't because I didn't like him. But ultimately we ended up breaking up, and he told me he probably wouldn't be able to take me back in the future if we still had feelings for each other, because of the pain he would've felt from our break up. He really wanted to work things out, and he really wanted to stay by my side to help me with my stress. I didn't want to break up with him but I figured it might be for the best.

127,"I’ve been working a job at a local, independently owned movie theater for three months now. Since September I’ve started at a new high school, which takes six days out of my weekly schedule. 

To sum it up. I work four hours every Friday night, attend whatever event I must for school on Saturday, and work 6-8 hours on Sunday, on top of 5 days of 8 hours worth of classes and 1-3 hours of extra-curriculars.

I haven’t had a day off of both school and work since my birthday two months ago.

I was professionally diagnosed with an anxiety disorder about a month and a half ago, and I haven’t even had the time to see a counselor or seek professional treatment for it. I’ve struggled with anxiety for a very long time. But it wasn’t until I felt the weight of my current state that I decided to reach out to someone about it.

I gave up a lot for this job (obviously). I was even an editor for a website I’d created along with a close friend that was consistently doing better and better and I had to leave that behind. I see my friends and family less and less often, I come home from work every Sunday with the sickening weight in my chest of “I’ve really gotta do this all over again starting tomorrow morning, don’t I?” 

Also among all of this I’m trying to get my drivers license, and I haven’t had the time to prepare for my (fourth :/) road test now. I need my license to get to and from all of these places and I’ve just too much going on right now to keep this all. At this rate I could’ve had it a year ago.

After speaking with a coworker, I’ve learned that 4 out of 6 of the current staff members (that aren’t managers) are quitting inside of the next month. This could potentially really hurt the business. Like, it could do devastating damage, especially since absolutely -nobody- will come work for us. It would sicken me to contribute to this but I want to put myself first for once. Especially now where I feel like I quite literally have no choice but to. Should I quit?

128,"TL;DR  thinking of moving to a new state, start fresh, and figure out who I am. advice/experiences from people who have done it before?

After a recent long term relationship break up I have come to the realization that I dont have much keeping me in my hometown.

I had a really good/big friend group before the relationship started 4 give or take years ago, and ended up going out of contact with basically all of those people, and at to in a couple scenarios  directly tell people that I chose my EX over them. 

I've had other fall outs with other friends and struggle to keep in contact with people now scince I was sort of in my own world with this girl for almost 4 years.

Now that the relationship has ended I've found myself re emerging feeling lost and confused about who I am now, and struggling to form good relationships with people. I go to school and have a part time job where I get to interact with a lot of people and regularly get Invited to go out and stuff, but I'm more just feeling unsure of myself and typically decline.  

I've lived in this city my whole life and have only lightly traveled outside of it. I just feel like I've done and seen everything around here, and I have a lot of history included tons of bad memories, and all of these failed relationships and friendships that in constantly reminded of anytime I drive around or go anywhere. 

It causes some anxiety for me and I feel like im always reminded of this person that I think I am, or maybe that I was, and it makes it hard to become who I want to be.

So I've come to this conclusion that moving to a new state would be really good for me after next semester is over. I live with my family in a large house right now but have lived on my own before. I get a lot of grants and scholarships at the school I'm at now and I get about 5000$ back after my classes are paid for next semester so I'll have a good chunk of money to rely on for a move, and good resume to have a few options of jobs to work.

I guess I'm just looking for advice from people that have been through something similar, in moving far from home.

I'm hoping to have some people just share what moving to a new city or state was like.

Basically, I had a talk with her saying that I wanted to start making different friends because I felt like she wasn't a good influence on me (thinking back, I know it was a really dumb move... I should have just distanced myself slowly if I did want to move away from her... like we've only known each other for a month so a serious conversation was not at all needed, but I can't take back what I've done. Also, I realize now what a total asshole move that was too). Since that day everything has been weird. We still hangout a lot, but there's an underlying tension. 

I don't think I should hang around her anymore, not because it's been weird between us lately but because I was an actual asshole and basically said I don't want to hang out with her anymore (or at least that's how she probably took it as). It almost feels like I'm not following through with any of the things I told her that night. She definitely deserves a better friend than me. I'm not going to cut her off or anything, but I need to not hang out with her everyday. Honestly, I'm kinda confused on why we keep making plans and she is cool with hanging out with me still??? There are moments it goes back to normal and also moments where I can tell she's pissed at me. It's a weird dynamic and I don't know how to handle it. 

I feel like it's also important to explain why I decided to distance myself with her in the first place. The more I hung out with her, the more I felt like I was getting myself into deep shit. I had to go on an ambulance with her and spent the entire day at the hospital with her (she ended up being okay). We talked about really deep shit too; I spilled my fucked up life story to her, and she did the same. These are the moments that brought us really close together, but the things that made me question everything were after she had a really bad date, she told me that if she was alone she would probably cut herself. I spent the rest of the day with her. One night when I was hanging out with her room mate (who's a guy; they live in an apartment together), while we were sitting in the living room, he got a knife and a first aid kit and went into the bathroom to try and cut himself. The knife wasn't sharp enough so it didn't cut his skin, but I was still super freaked out. That night I slept in the living room, to make sure he didn't try to get a kitchen knife and cut himself again. This was also triggered by a really bad date. 

A month in, it sorta feels like I'm trying to make a new best friend when everyone has already found their groups. Should I stick with this girl and try to fix it... in that case how? Have another talk or just hope it gets better? Or, follow through with what I said and try to make new friends? ",07Nov2018,1

138,"For context, am 21 and my cousin is 30. I and my parents live in a different state than him and most of his side of my family. We have never been super and I haven’t spoken to him in years, but we always got along well. 

He is an orphan and has struggled his whole life with mental health issues, alcoholism, and most recently heroin addiction. He has OD’d multiple times and has even gone so far as robbing family members, which had made most of the family cut him off except my parents, who agreed to pay for him to go into rehab. Except, of course, he has made every excuse not to and has OD’d again, kept leaving the detox place, etc etc. Lately, he has started threatening to commit suicide, but my family doesn’t believe him and after his latest flake on rehab my dad has decided to cut him off as well because “the only way he will learn is if every single one of us cuts him off”. Everyone thinks these threats are just his latest manipulation tactic. However, I have had a lot of experience myself with mental health issues and I believe they’re a serious cry for help. 

My issue is this: should I contact him even though it may be a setback in the rest of my family’s plan to get him clean through cutting him off? I’m afraid he may see it as condescending (as he thinks everyone else is being) or that I’m being put up to it by someone since we haven’t talked in forever, but I’m really worried and I’m scared that if everyone cuts him off he’ll kill himself. I want to be there for him so he at least has someone. I have other cousins who I could also ask to talk to him but I’m not very close with anyone on that side and apparently their attempts with him have already been mostly failures.  

I also have people close to me who have cut off addict family members to no avail, FWIW.

141,"So basically at the beginning of the quarter there was a girl in my class. I was starting to ""like"" her and i started to feel kindof like a sense of wanting to ask her out and stuff like that. Then during about week 4 i had a pretty bad panic attack (maybe caused by anxiety of over thinking about this girl) and for the next week i had to deal with my heightened anxiety. Over this week my emotions were pretty much gone and i kinda felt just depressed. Now its week 6 the anxiety is like 70% gone and for some reason i dont feel the same way about this girl. Like i feel like the connection i had with her is kindof gone. Its almost as if i associated the anxiety with her so when i think about her i just feel anxious and nothing more. So basically my question is, is that could a panic attack which leads to heightened anxiety (which happened maybe because i was over thinking things about this girl) cause you to kindof lose the feelings you have for them?

I don't want to go because I don't appreciate academics at all. I skipped a grade during high school because I wanted to get out that much sooner, so this is my last year.

150,"Tl;dr (sort of??) I can’t tell if I’ve had some horrible friends, if I’m moving on from my friendships because of my growth as an individual/my new relationship, or if I’m just a horrible person.  

Hi guys, this is going to be a long one but I’m feeling pretty wound up right now and could seriously use some assurance and advice. 

I’m a 25F (will be 26 *very* soon) and have cut a few of my friends out before here and there, however, more recently I have cut out/considered cutting out girls that are very close friends of mine. One  friend of mine I told a little over a week ago that I needed space and we just stopped all communication from there. She never asked why or apologized and I never expected she would. The reasons for this decision: A. She has lied to me multiple times B. She has flaked on plans with me and/or lied about why she has left multiple times (ties in with A)  and most importantly, C. Because she has stolen from me and told my roommate (who I’m mentioning next) that she wished I had never found out about it so she could have kept the item and D. Because I have always been a support system for her no matter what and have not received the same treatment, ever. While she is very young (21), age doesn’t justify this kind of behavior at all. 

My second friend who I live with is a 23F. We have always had a pretty solid relationship, but since living together for almost a year, I feel my patience running thin with her. She has no consideration for me or my other roommate. She leaves dirty dishes for WEEKS but blames my other roommate, leaves crap all over our common area as if it’s her bedroom, parties and shrieks until late hours of the night during the week, and has her best friend (also a friend of mine) over almost every night. This friend has a key to our apartment. Aside from that, the more comfortable she gets with me, the more she has snapped at me and I just can’t take it anymore. Not only that, but suddenly now that I’m not friends with the girl I mentioned prior (21f), she is suddenly “bffs” with her and I can see her intentionally trying to get under my skin at this point. I just told her that I’m moving out before our lease ends with plenty of time for her and our other roommate to find a sublet and she’s very clearly upset. Although I DID mention to her prior that this was a possibility due to financial reasons. 

I need to add that I just started dating someone a few months ago who I am so incredibly happy with and I’m wondering if that has anything to do with all of this. Once I spent more time with him and his friends who are closer in age (much more mature), I had way less tolerance for the BS from both of the friends previously mentioned. 


So, my real question here is, am I being rational or am I being ridiculous for making these decisions to end these friendships? It seems like I’m cutting so many people out in such a short amount of time, but I just can’t deal with it anymore. There are more details to this but I wanted to spare any readers as much as possible. I very much appreciate any advice and/or constructive criticism, ",07Nov2018,1
151,"Joined reddit in hopes of getting some feedback.. I'm sorry that this is pretty long

So, background, I'm a senior in hs, extremely introverted, takes a fair bit of time to warm up to people (need a lot of one on one time). The last close friend I made was in eight grade, in which it turned what some could call abusive and toxic and I cut it off about a year and a half ago. I also now go to an ""alternative"" high school to get away from the overwhelmingly large school I used to go to, where I met a girl we'll call M, and a boy we'll call J. 

Anyway, so my problem is that I want to become closer to both M and J, but don't know how. I kept M at an arms distance a bit when we first met, part due to my natural time to grow close to someone (we had no classes, just lunch, so no one on one time) and how she has a similar personality to my abusive past friend (minus the toxicity), which I only just recently realized. 

While it took some time for J and I to start talking,  it became a lot easier to talk and chill with him, partially because we had a class together where we could talk outside of the group. I've developed quite the crush on him, and am not sure if he likes me back or not, but I'm more focused on becoming closer friends with him. His friendship is more important to me than being in a relationship with him. 

Anyway, so my problem is, while I was a bit more hesitant to become closer to M, J wasn't, and they're pretty close now. During lunch, M is mostly talking to J and they're hanging out a lot more outside school, to the point where it's difficult for me to hang out with either of them. I feel like M is taking up all of J's time (not to purposefully exclude me, but just she's more extroverted and J goes along with it). I don't know how to include myself more now that I feel more comfortable with J and want to grow closer with M without coming off as annoying, and I'm starting to feel sad and hurt that there's no time for me. I also haven't told M about my abusive past friendship or that she used to sightly remind me of her. 

How do I get closer to them? I'm having M over tomorrow to watch a show, and J and I are watching lotr on Saturday (he hasn't seen them, a damn travesty), so I just want to know what I should say to them about this, if anything, or what to do to get closer to them in general? I'm graduating early, in December, while they're both graduating at the normal time, so I want to figure this out now while I still regularly see them. ",07Nov2018,1

153,"I’m 23 and finished a degree, and back in college currently, and my only goal in life is to make enough money to move to where my friends live.



For some back story, I never had a friend I’m public school and high school I basically didn’t talk to anyone. I’m male and obviously I didn’t have the confidence to even consider talking to a girl. No joke if there was a female cashier in her 60s I would get flustered and not just avoid eye contact but avoid facing their general direction. Like I said, I was a massive loner with 0 confidence.


I always thought that was just who I was, because you either have confidence or you don’t, right? Definitely wrong. Once I got to university it took about two days for me to make my first real friend, who introduced me to more friends, and even though I don’t think any of them would say I’m their best friend I had a solid group of people who I could hang out with whenever I wanted.

My confidence absolutely sky-rocketed. I would test myself and see how long I could hold eye contact in conversations with girls (I was still super awkward) and my overall quality of life got better.

I live in Canada, and all of my university friends were in a different program and moved to California together with similar jobs. I have no money and no way of joining them. I thought I would be fine going back to college to try to get a well paying job so I can go visit them, but it’s nothing like university and I’m back to my complete loner self.

I have no idea whether I should try to move to California and find work or if that’s even possible, or if I will eventually find friends like the ones I had, or if I should move back in with my parents.

Something about listening to people I know sing is too much.  Especially if someone is ""serenading"" or singing to me. It makes me want to jump out a window. I know I had experiences as a kid where I was shamed for singing multiple times, maybe that's what plays a part. I feel so strongly and haven't had anyone relate before. I'm ashamed because ive had relatively talented partners (one a musician) want to sing me songs and play instruments and honestly I'd rather step on legos than be sung to. I feel like that's most people's dreams and I'm ungrateful. I've never told a partner because I know it brings people joy and wouldn't want to make someone feel bad for doing something they enjoy. But it's hard to fake being okay while being sung to as well.  Can anyone can relate or am I just a weirdo? ",07Nov2018,1

Is it normal to still feel terrible sometimes after a break up that happened 6 months ago? I got dumped after 4 years of being with him and he never contacted me afterwards. He still said he loved me up until he broke it off, as well as still having sex with me. He blocked me on Facebook but then unblocked me a few months later...what would that even mean? Sucks so bad. What did you guys do to get over a horrific break up?

It’s just so difficult because I loved him so much...and to be dumped out of no where after all the time it still kills me, and he never asked to see how I was afterwards knowing how heartbroken I was...wtf. He also gave me a promise ring and few months prior.  
 

Edit:

i made a list of all the things i didn't like about my ex after he dumped me after 4 years together, please tell me if these were red flags

\- hung out with his friends more than me (alot of females) and would never tell me or invite me  
\- went to other girls parties and didn't let me know (i was never invited to my knowledge)  
\- his family never liked me staying over at his (his mum and sister would always ignore me)  
\- he would always hide his phone before we went to sleep

165,"We’re both in grad school, and we’ve been dating for only about 6 months. I just got a job, and I’ll be moving 4 hours away from her soon. She still has 7 months of school left, and she’s not sure where she’ll be working after she graduates.

Currently, she works a lot of weekends. I’ll be working full time during the week. I don’t know if we’d get to see each other that often.

We get along great and enjoy spending time with each other when we can. Breaking up is something that we don’t want to do, but I’m wondering if it’s something we should do because of the logistics of me being so far away. Thanks in advance.",07Nov2018,1

167,"throwaway due to obvious reasons. 

a year ago last year my ex and i broke up. our relationship had been shit for a long time but we kept drawing it out due to reasons i’ll never really know. before everything in the last few months of our relationship it was okay; he was sweet and all, but never matched my energy and now that i think about it, he was pretty manipulative and toxic and made me cut off all my friends and isolated me. by the end of our relationship he was all i had. 

anyway, on to the main point. last halloween (2017) has quickly become a day marked with trauma in my head. thankfully my current amazing boyfriend was able to make up for the horrible experience of last year for this year, but this realization literally just popped into my head within the past week and a half and i can’t stop thinking about it, mostly because i don’t know what to think of it. 

i have been assaulted before. abused too. most of my past relationships i’m able to define very easily in terms of what happened to me. but this time, with this ex, i don’t know what to do. we were very high. i was higher than him. long story short, he coerced me into sexual acts, and then took my clothes off when i was too high to move and stop him and had sex with me. i cried. it hurt. i kept telling him this. he didn’t stop until he finished. 

i know what to call this. i know what i would tell any of my friends if they came to me and told me this happened to them. i know it’s rape. i know i was raped. but i don’t know if i can even say that. eventually my body started responding to him but i was crying and my brain was screaming. i didn’t overtly tell him no. and he was a shitty boyfriend, not a rapist or an abuser. 

but i was raped. 

i don’t really know what i’m looking for here. my current boyfriend knows and so do two of my other friends but there isn’t really much they know what to say. i’ve never been on this subreddit before but i was hoping someone, anyone here could give me advice about this. what i can call it instead of rape. assault doesn’t sound extreme enough for me but rape sounds too extreme. i don’t want to ruin his reputation or anything. i’m not going to be public about this. i just want to hear someone tell me it’s okay and help me process this. i have a therapy appointment on thursday and will talk to my therapist about it. 

thank you. ",07Nov2018,1
169,"I'm a junior in hs rn.  Im trying to get high SAT/ACT scores and pass AP exams.  Next yr, I am going to pass more AP exams to lessen the financial blow that comes from college.  I am not sure what I want to do with my life, and I know there are other ppl who are in the same boat I'm in.  I think college is good, but it's hard to compare it to job experience.  Instead of college, I could hop into the workforce and have more things to add to my resume.  I could work my way to the top of a company.  I could go to a trade school, too.  I am overwhelmed by these options bc I want to pick the correct one now, instead of finding out I fucked up later down the road.  

I want a job that makes me happy.  A job that, when I wake up in the morning, I am excited to go to.  I understand all days won't  be like that, but I don't want a job that I hate going to.  
I want a job that allows me to remain financially stable. 

I've thought ab what careers I'd like.  I used to want to be in graphic design or become an illustrator, but I would prefer art as a hobby.  I don't want to hate art just bc it is now my job.  

I liked the AP Psych class I took last year.  I can see myself going into that field.  I dont know what branch of psychology I could go into.  I like behavioral psych.  I also like the brain and how dopamine and other chemicals and neurotransmitters affect us.  

I love animals.  In the end, I feel like I want to work with animals.  I thought of being a trainer or a groomer, but they don't get paid much. I also would not want to be a vet technician.  I think being a vet would be cool.  I wouldn't want to be a surgeon, but I don't know what else a vet is supposed to do.  Areas I've thought about include vet anaesthesialogist, vet pharmolgist, behaviorist, vet opthamalogist, vet radiologist, vet neurologist, animal physical therapist (PT),  &amp; vet practitioner.  I don't want to do surgery with these jobs, but I still think they're interesting.  Like I would be okay with confirming the diagnosis of animals.  

I've been looking more into animal PT bc I think that would make me happy since I'd be helping animals recover.  I wanted to become a vet or animal PT, but I got scared over how expensive it is.  The schooling for a vet is 8 yrs.  

After HS, I plan on going to a 2-yr community college, where I'll finish my general education credits &amp; take a few other courses to test the waters.  I am interested in animals, psych, theatre production (like how things are run behind-the-scenes), media &amp; communication (I don't know too much about this, but it seems practical), &amp; engineering (I have to dig more into engineering fields). I would tack on art, but I don't think I would be happy in the end w an artistic job.

I know some animal jobs allow people to travel, and I think that's cool bc I want to travel all around the world.  

Now, once I finish community college, I do not know where to go or what to do next.  I know I might figure out what I wanna go into when I'm actually at that part of my life, but I don't want to rely on that.  

If I choose to go to a 4 yr college after, then try to get accepted into a vet school, and then try to become a certified vet, I'll have massive amounts of debt.  I recognize that I won't go to college and come out w 0 debt, but it all stresses me out anyway.  

I think, after referencing what I've typed before, I want a job that makes me happy, has a liveable salary, and does not require an immense amount of education.  I have this innate feeling that I want to work with animals.  I also would like to have the liberty of traveling around the world.  

What are some steps I can take to discover what career paths suit me? 

How can I save money for college, aside from taking AP exams, scholarships,  and summer courses? 

After HS, it is more than likely that I will be living an in apartment with my friend.  With all the extracurriculars/sports I am in right now, I do not have time to get a job and save up.  I know senior yr, I'm going to get a job and save every paycheck, but in the end, that won't be enough for renting an apartment.  My parents are paying for some of college, but my older brother is already in college and so that means less money for me. I still have to pay a portion of the college expense, even though my parents will be helping out.  

How can I earn enough money to rent an apartment with my friend &amp; still be able to put money towards college?

170,"Hello everyone,

I’m new to Reddit, but I have an issue. I found out today I have a 14 year old brother who’s a trump supporter. Now I mean trump supporter as in he seems to be against the caravan (ie wants closed borders which is fine, but we’re immigrants as well), believes the women from the Brett Kavanaugh case were lying and that the media is evil. 

He seems misinformed about a lot of things. I don’t mind if we have a difference in opinion in politics (whether he’s republican or democrat), I’m just afraid he’ll have these opinions without being fully informed for the rest of his life. I come from a mixed policy house. So once again, I don’t care if he’s a trump supporter, I care what he believes are the exact issues and what he believes is right. We already got into a fight about it and I definitely don’t want to fight. I want to sincerely hear his side. How do I do that without this bias I have for trump? I’m a college educated female. How do I show him the middle? Does anyone else have this issue? 

If I sound ridiculous, I apologize, my entire family got sucked into our fight so I am incredibly tired.",07Nov2018,1
171,"Staying up late trying to solve this issue myself and finally I’ve decided I need some help. My roommate, who s definitely an alcoholic, very depressed, and is super lonely has been continually having a friend over. She comes over probably 4-5 days out of the week, sleeps on our couch and is a constant annoyance. She drinks with him (his alcohol), smokes his weed and bums off of our couch. Recently, I noticed my shampoo was missing.... odd item I realize, so I asked my roommate about it. He had no idea where it went, and I surely didn’t misplace my shampoo that I only use in the shower, so I ask the girl. Of course, “she hasn’t seen it.” So the other night my girlfriend and I are sleeping, my girlfriend who’s a pre med student has a massive test at 8 am, and I work early the next day get awakened by this girl talking loudly on her phone. She does this often, and normally I’m like, hey my roommate has a friend, let it be, but tonight we both need sleep and it’s frustrating me. Then she says, “and his roommate thinks I stole his shampoo, isn’t that funny?” Which I’m damn near positive she did, and she’s keeping me up at this point. It’s 5 am so I come out of my room and I’m like “1) you took the shampoo, 2) be fucking quite in my house I’m trying to fucking sleep.” I go back in my room, and I think both my roommate and her thought it was funny so they get louder instead of respecting my wishes. So I go back out of the room. My girlfriend, who is already stressed about her test is also quite frustrated and is listening in on the confrontation. I say, “hey, what’s the problem? I told you I’m trying to sleep, either shut the fuck up or get out of my house.” I know, very aggressive, but I’m fucking mad. The girl replies “if you wanna talk shit, then square up,” as well as some other ratchet shit that no human in the world normally says. I would never get in a physical confrontation with a girl, and normally not with any living being for that cause, so I’m super confused. My roommate says, “I got your back, girl” and comes to her defense and I’m stuck listening to this shit until literally I have to go to work and my girlfriend has to go take her test. I haven’t spoken to my roommate since and have stayed at my girlfriends because I don’t know how to handle the situation properly. He stated, “she’s my friend and will be over here,” and I feel uncomfortable as fuck about that. What should I do/ how should I go forward trying to handle this situation? 

Just to better understand the situation, I’m 24, my girlfriend is 21, my roommate is 30 (we met at work), and his friend is 27. 
I know age doesn’t matter much, but I feel like it helps with perspective in some sense.

Partner started drinking to excess and staying out all hours of the night. Fast forward to a week and a half ago, I revive a call from her boss, a friend of mine, who says this bad influence is getting fired over an incident at their job involving alcohol and the partner is receiving a write up. But it will take time so I can’t mention it. Then three days later another accusation is brought on my partner and I hear about it. That night I confront her and explain her job is on the line. She flips the subject and says she’s leaving me. An hour after we talk she up and quits her job with no notice. I spend the next week trying to make amends, buying dinners, and flowers etc. come to find out this girl who has never shown an interest that way is now in a same sex relationship with this female friend. Basically the problem is everyone close to my partner (or former partner) have observed she isn’t herself and her decisions aren’t making sense.

Monday to Thursday we have my stepkids so we live with her mother
Friday to Sunday we stay with my folks

We are both mentally exhausted

Every day is a fucking chore and just a drag to get through it

Because the shower in her house is not working and i work a very dirty job every day after work i drive to my folks for a shower then pack my work clothes up and head up the house

The house is an absoloute shit hole

Her mother is a disgusting lazy woman with a 'victim' mentality although everyone does every thing for her she is a 50 year old woman who lives like a teenage child

We clean up ourselves and the kids yet she just makes it a misery there because she is happy to sit around in mess she made.

With the amount of work my partner has i think she may be close to a mental breakdown and I am feeling the strain because My existence is 10 hours in work then drive to shower then drive up there. 

Get the kids tea and in the bath then read with them before bed

We have no space at all and every night i just sort of read or mooch about not really being able to help because it's not my house and my MIL to be doesn't like me and even acts resentful to her own daughter.

We are fucking surrounded by clothes because we don't have the room to put them away



The relief we do get is weekends when we stay with my folks. They try their best to help us out but there's only so much they can do

I am a 30 year old man working in a factory and i feel close to tears writing this

We had our own place renting before but a  screwed us over and we are now saving for a wedding and a deposit for place

I feel like i can't breathe and i know my partner feels the same

180,"I'm a freshman in college and I thought that once I left high school, my parents would finally stop obsessively checking my grades and yelling at me about them. My parents spent my entire childhood screaming at me and punishing me over my grades and it ruined our relationship. Now that I'm in college they somehow have found a way to access my grades. I have A's in three of my classes and one C+ in a math general education course (I've always been terrible at math). 

My dad called me to discuss the grade today and although I was frustrated that he still wasn't giving me my space academically and letting me grow up, I stayed calm and told him I would try harder. Later, I got out of the shower to see two missed calls and two texts from my mom saying ""where are u? can u talk?"" I thought she wanted to say hi and catch up but it was both of my parents on the phone. My mom expressed her ""concern"" about my C+ and told me that if I finished the semester with that grade, she wouldn't allow me to return to school next semester.

This phone call infuriated me for a few reasons:
1) I'm in college now and I want my parents to allow me to develop my independence and trust that I have my life under control. They seem to always want power over me, even though I'm doing very well in all areas of my life right now.
2) My mom's tone, although calm, was very condescending and made me sound like a disappointment. I felt like she was disregarding all of my other successes to focus on this one grade.
3) My parents NEVER obsessed over my other siblings' grades like they do mine. I have ADHD so school has always been more challenging for me. I definitely don't do as well academically as my siblings but I do as well as I can. I feel like they're unreasonably biased against me because of my ADHD. My mom even compares their grades to mine quite often.
4) They're blowing the situation completely out of proportion. One class won't make or break me. Math has just been tougher for me. This is the last math class I will ever have to take and I'm passing.
5) My dad had already called me earlier to address the issue and we had come to an agreement. Why must they call again and get me all upset?

I'm not sure if I'm the one being unreasonable in this situation. I understand my parents are coming from a place of love but they just don't realize how much their obsession over grades has frustrated and hurt me. Are my parents out of line or am I just being dramatic? And, how do I handle this situation?

185,"I'm a 23F, have been with my anxious partner 24M for two years now. We both started the relationship at a very needy and lonely point of our lives. 

I was just realizing the crush which I was desperately giving all my love and hopes didn't give a single shit about me and only used me for the free appreciation and he was off and on trying to get his mentally unstable ex back. We both had all our friends telling us how the situations were hopeless but only one another could make believe we were both walking dead end roads. Then one day I went to a party at his place and he declared his love for me. Until that moment I was - pardon the language contradiction - straightly homo but that night I slept hoping he climbed into my bed.

A few months went by as our friendship and desire grew without breaks. I've been all my life trying to connect with others through my weird taste in general but had never felt such a strong connection with anyone before. One day I had a big family discussion and couldn't bear sleeping at home. I talked to him, he came to pick me up, have dinner with his family and spend the night. I was feeling pretty bad and he offered to cuddle on bed with me. From that moment on we poured every single drop of love, affection and aflictions into a relationship.

From our first fights I got the message we were desperately dependant on each other and since I'm a avoidant in terms of attachment the least heartbreak we had I tried to end all. In the other hand, his ex always broke up after fights also and he carries this trauma of sudden abandonement. His behaviour went increasingly more aggressive, after half a year of being together, he started to block me from going home at the middle of discussions. First he offended me and the more we understood each other, the more we knew how to piss each other off even unconsciously. 

We've both been anxiously depressed and constantly getting high on weed, alcohol and ocasionally acid. I stoped smoking everyday just last year, when I graduated from college, but kept getting high with him almost every single time we met. He dropped out of law school the year before we started dating, focused on getting into the music production business but blowed off his first chance by not being able to arrive on time.

We both being totally free of work and activities this year spiralled into a toxic relationship. I stayed with him more than with my family this year and poured into him all my worries and anxiety about being jobless and hopeless, I'm an international relations bachelorette and there's little opportunity for both of us here in Brazil. 

If our lives weren't anxiously depressive enough, the political situation in the country went from ridiculous to beyond pessimist. As we both saw it coming, Bolsonaro achieved to unite more than half of the country in the name of prejudices as class hatred, sexism and racism and the political persecution is just growing exponencially. Brazil was a country full of hidden hate and visible genocide of minorities before and now the president elect glorifies this murderous mentality through the country. We've been lazily planning to move to Canada but we're both hands-tied terrified.

Politics apart, we couldn't be more uncertain of and anxious about the future. Our discussions got more and more personally provocative and agressive. One day last month he called me crazy and screamed at me for hours and I couldn't bear it anymore. I spit on him and almost hit his beautiful face. He bit my arm as I shoved him to the ground. I couldn't believe I was capable of doing all that, for me it was over there and then he forgave me and acknowledged he provoked me into it.

For two weeks I felt dissociated while with him and guilty the whole time. I'm never certain if what I feel is really love but I kept doing my part on this high maintenance relation. Last week we spent a few days at the beach to keep our minds away from the political tragedy of the capital and into one of the strongest sativa strains we got our hands into. From the first toke I realized it messed up my head too much, but he kept smoking more and more. He also took some acid the day before his parents went to spend some days with us there and since the morning after his mood went berserk. He only talked to me to complain about every single available point to hurt me and stayed in his room getting high the whole time except for the meals. 

We planned to go to a music festival last saturday and every single day he made sure to demonstrate he wasn't going to be mentally able to go. That saturday he woke up saying he couldn't bear stay with his parents anymore and was going home to stay alone. I knew if I went with him we were going to fight nonstop the way back so I refused to go with him and avoided staying even near him the whole day. Dinner time comes and he kept complaining about me at the table. The discussions go on and his parents decide to take a walk outside and then he fights with me and violently holds me. I shouted what he was doing and his despair just exploded. His parents heard and came back, he screamed in front of them that I was completely crazy and he would do them the favor of taking me home. Off and on we discussed the whole night and neither had reason nor emotional conditions to stay together. At the lowest point he threatened suicide if I wouldn't stay with him.

The next day we went back and I asked for a few days on my own, he agreed to not bother talking to me. I talked about all of our agressions with my mom and my best friend and both agreed I was risking my life in the relationship. I spent the next days calmly and sadly considering it couldn't be over-er. 

Then today he said he misses me and was much ashamed of what he had done. I said we had to talk and immediatly he figured out my mind was set to break up. He came here already desperate. I said I didn't love him anymore and could never trust him again. He had a panic attack, threatened suicide again and shoved me out the way. As he was almost running away I called his mother to say he was threatening his life and he pushed me to the ground, bruising my elbow and thigh. As it escallated he got more desperate and I asked for the guards of the building to help me keep him away.

He stayed for a time outside asking for me to talk and apologize while i waited for his mom. Their parents did next to nothing, but my mom called him to ask him how he was and offer support. He insisted on talking to me and after some 40 messages declaring apologies and desperate love and a few calls I answered him. He said he couldn't make it without me, many more times that I'm the love of his life, as he always said and that he needed some sign that there was still a chance, or at least that I keep my mind open to it. We talked a lot and he showed further appreciation that I was still trying to help him after such pains and betrayals. 

Then it clicked me: I can't really tell what are my sentiments towards him right now as it was always difficult to me to know my true feelings. I hadn't given the exact promise he asked for but can't help showing my affections. He agreed we need some time apart and promised he would get better only if it would be, at least a flock of a chance, to stay with me.

Now the more I try to keep my mind away from it, the more I remember how we combine. I can see growth in his life and how I helped it make real. Few things in life are more important to me than being able to help and eventually succeed. Our sex life was close to heaven and that's really rare given our kinks. He also was never violent in this aspect and I felt totally secure opening up to him.

Well, I know that even if you read it all and thought deeply about it you can't tell me my feelings either, but is it possible a life together where we avoid this level of aggressiveness? Can we repair these traumas and eventually lead a healthier relationship? Can we, if anybody, make it work and not kill each other?

For the past few months iv been trying to think of what I want to do with my life and nothings coming to my mind, I don’t want to work a dead end job that pays minimal wage for the rest of my life like everyone els who lives around here.

190,"I’m in college and my aunt sent me a care package. It was midterms so I set it to the side knowing I’d have to call her when I opened it.

Flash forward two weeks. I realized that I have been procrastinating for 14 days without addressing my problem. This is one of those “the longer you wait the worse it gets and the more you want to wait because of that” situations. She knows I should’ve got it two weeks ago and is probably wondering why I haven’t called. I feel really bad and I don’t know what to do.

I have generated the following solutions:

It got lost in the mail and I never got it (it explains why I didn’t call, but is also a horrible excuse)

I apologize and say I should’ve called sooner (this displays that I devalued her gift and was not grateful by not calling immediately)

Tell her I forgot about it and explain everything that I told you guys about being busy and then procrastinating (this is arguably the worst even though it is the most true, because it’s what happened)

In conclusion I am a shitty nephew and should probably take the L and suffer the consequences of my dumb actions, by apologizing.

Is there anyway that I mitigate negative effect on my relationship with my aunt.",07Nov2018,1
191,"My husband and I have a moderately close friend (known for less than 5 years but taken a few trips together) who lives in another state but is a frequent traveler. He has often found himself spontaneously in our state/area and will text on short notice and ask to either stay with us or at least drop by. We haven’t always been able to accommodate him, especially because I’ve been chronically ill so sometimes the stress of having even a friend staying with us was too much for me. 
He just texted my husband and said he and his two sisters (who I have never met) are in town for a sports event, and asked if they can stay at our place. He said “we would hardly be there, just a place to sleep.” He also mentioned that he knows we are going to be out of town ourselves this weekend with our parents. So basically he knows our house will be empty and is asking to stay there. To be frank, I simply feel uncomfortable with anyone staying in my home while I’m not there.

199," I have 6-12 months of living expenses (depends on my spending) and will be living with my SO in NYC. I've been looking for 7 months and applying online hasn't worked despite all the resume critiques I've gotten from PM hiring managers.

I have a non-tech background trying to break into a health tech startup in PM. I feel that my resume isn't competitive enough against tech and formal PM candidates. On top of that, I feel there is more supply than demand for PMs. I have 5 years of experience in engineering/PM in the life sciences industry which I believe is relevant for a health tech role and makes me qualified.

Moving to NYC will allow me to build my network and find a job through connections. I've only gotten one job applying online, the rest I leveraged my network. I'm building my NYC network remotely through e-mails and phone calls. I believe the next step is to relocate, meet these people in-person and attend tech events to meet more people to get my name/resume out there.

I'd love to hear that this is a dumb idea. Yet, I don't foresee anything else I could do to get a job at this point other than waiting for more job postings. I'm open to suggestions.

200,"I recently started a new job as a Starbucks barista. It's the first job I've ever had where I really love everyone I work with, and everyone has gone really far out of their way to make me feel comfortable. 

One of the other baristas is a trans girl. I will absolutely go out of my way to refer to people with whatever pronouns they use, and I know that failing to do so can trigger a lot of pain and dysphoria. However, this girl still has a masculine sounding voice and slightly masculine features because she hasn't been able to get hormones or surgery yet, so I'd have to keep actively reminded myself to refer to her as ""she.""

But then I accidentally referred to her as ""he"". When it happened, I wasn't facing her, but I felt the reaction. In less than a second, all the laughter and relaxation that was in the air between us instantly vanished. We both went quiet, she turned to make a drink and I turned to complete an order on the register. For about an hour we avoided each other.

I still feel pretty sick about it in my stomach. A lot of Redditors disregard trans issues or even pull the whole ""facts over feelings"" type of schpeel and thing they're being intellectual for it. Please understand that this is not something I'm willing to debate or entertain in the comments. I hurt my friend, and that is the bottom line. I personally am not trans, but I have dealt with intense body issues my whole life, and having people joke about things like my weight or my hair would literally wreck me for the rest of the night, if not longer. It would be especially hurtful if it was done by someone I trusted, or in a place where I felt safe. So knowing that I did this to someone who was kind and wonderful towards me, literally makes me want to die. (*Literally* literally, because I'm suicidal and I've been using this screw up as a justification for killing myself since it happened. I know this is bad).

For the hour that we were apart, I kept debating whether or not I should apologize. I know that it seems like the obvious choice, but I wasn't sure if maybe she'd rather just ignore that the whole thing ever happened to begin with. Also confronting people is terrifying for me.

In the end, I did go to her and say sorry, and she's such a sweetheart that she did more to reassure me than I did for her. She could tell that I was wrecked over what I said, and she even came in the back during my break to ask if *I* was alright. 

Even though we made up, I still can't help but feel like complete and utter shit. A lot of this is just because of the person I am, I have intense anxiety and I haven't really been able to get therapy for it. I pretty much live in a constant state of paranoia over how others view me, and the mistakes that I make play over and over again in my head for years. I'm terrified of the thought of hurting anyone, and any time I do so I feel so crippled that I can barely move. I also feel guilty because I feel like, in a way, I'm more concerned with how this has affected my conscience than how it's made her feel. I feel like that's selfish.

I know that this is something I should seek professional help for, but it's gonna take me a while to be able to get actual therapy appointments set up for myself. I would really love if anyone had some advice over how you can forgive yourself after you've hurt someone, because it's been hours and my stomach still has a painful knot in it. I think this girl's working tomorrow too, and I dread seeing her. 

Again lol, I feel like I'm caring more about my feelings than hers.",07Nov2018,1

202,"Okay so I am in a friend group with four guys and I am the only girl, I have been dating one of these guys for 4 years, lets call him Joe. We have had a really good, strong, healthy relationship but these past couple months it's been a little bit rocky, and I started to become closer to one of the other guys in the group. Don't get me wrong, we are all really close, but just closer to this one guy in particular. His name can be Adam. Basically, me and Adam started getting closer at the same time Joe and I were starting to drift apart. I just felt like I got along the best with Adam out of everyone, even though I should get along the best with my boyfriend, Joe. 
One night, Joe couldn't hang out with all of us, so me, Adam and our other two friends all drove around and got food. This night, me and Adam were in the back of the car together and we started getting kind of intimate, more so than is normal for our group in general. I thought maybe it was just this one night, and we were all high, so maybe it didn't mean much, and I decided to brush it off. BUT, this trend continued for the next few times we hung out, which all coincidentally were without my boyfriend, Joe. 
It never escalated to the point where Adam and I did anything that could really be considered cheating, except I thought about the possibility of like, hooking up with Adam a few times but it never really happened. Before this started happening, I never thought of Adam as anything more than a friend. I acknowledged that he was objectively attractive but never anything more than that. But at this point I felt like there was a weird tension between us and we would always do this intimate stuff when we were alone together. 
My boyfriend ended up noticing and he confronted both me and Adam, and it's pretty much resolved between the whole friend group at this point. I am just still thinking about it because Adam told Joe that I'm ""not his type"" when they had their conversation about it, and me and Adam never really explicitly talked about why we got so close or felt comfortable with being more intimate with each other. So now I am just wondering what the things that Adam did meant/if he considered them. When I think about it, it seems kind of impossible for him to not have thought about the stuff he was doing, because I am one of his best friend's girlfriend, and it was like pretty obvious flirtation/touching kind of stuff that isn't normal, even for a close friend to be doing. I am not interested in Adam as a significant other, given I would consider if me and Joe never dated, but I just can't stop my curiosity about why things changed like they did for the time. 
Should I bring it up with Adam so I can get some closure about the situation or should I just let it go and be happy that my boyfriend and I are still together and trying to make things better?",07Nov2018,1

208,"So, I met someone on Facebook last year. We kinda talked and we noticed that we were starting to like each other. Eventually in march we sort of started a long distance relationship. The thing is, her mother is super religious and even though she's old enough, has a lot of control over her, doesn't let her date etc. So her mother found out and she couldn't text anymore, she secretly texted every few weeks to tell me she's ok. We finally got back together in August, but at that time I was reluctant. Eventually I really fell for her. We share a real bond. We know that our future is uncertain but we're just going with the flow. So. In these past weeks she's been having some issues with her phone data and connenction, meaning she sometimes couldn't text me for a day or two. Now, she's been offline on WhatsApp and Facebook for a week. I don't really have a way to contact her, I'm worried sick because I don't know what's going on (maybe her phone broke) and it's driving me insane. Would it be a good idea to ask one of her schoolmates/friends on Facebook if they know anything? I just want to know if she's ok. I just don't wanna risk her potentially getting in trouble if someone tells her mom. ",07Nov2018,1
209,"Okay so, 2 months ago I went on a month holiday overseas and came back to find my best friend as a completely changed person. To add some context my friend is 15 (Female) and we go to the same high school. As soon as I first saw her again, I knew something was up. She looked really depressed and wasn’t acting like herself at all. By this I mean that she has a very extroverted personality, she loves to joke around and join conversations etc. But recently she’s been extremely quiet and lethargic, as if she doesn’t want to make conversation. I thought it was just a bad day or something at first, so I let it pass, but after about a week everything seemed to just get worse. 

I noticed how irritable she was, and how little things seemed to stress her out more. She’s not interested in anything anymore and doesn’t get excited about things that used to make her happy. This behaviour is completely out of the ordinary for her, hence why I became very worried. This lead to me asking her if she was okay, and if something was wrong or if she needed help. She brushed me off and just said that she’s been a little tired lately and everything will be fine soon. But what made me even more worried was that no one (Excluding very close friends) else seemed to notice anything odd about her.

It was at this point where I noticed how small she had gotten. We’re both about 155cm tall, and weighed about 55kg in August. We were exactly the same, but then when I asked her why she had lost weight, she proudly told me about her new healthy life style and how she now weighed 48kg. This statement shocked me, not only because she seemed genuinely excited about something, but because that meant she lost 7kg in the span of about 2 or 3 months. Keep in mind that she was never a particularly unhealthy person in the first place. In fact she used to exercise 3 days a week and eat decently healthily. Something about this change didn’t feel right, I didn’t know why, but I just had a bad feeling about it.

So I talked to one of my closest friends and she said that she had also noticed that something was up. We talked about it for a bit and eventually came to the conclusion that she may have an eating disorder. This lead to my close friend asking my best friend about her diet and stuff like that. When she mentioned food, my best friend almost lit up with excitement and proceeded to explain how she counts calories and drinks tea to curve hunger. It was so unnerving to see her so excited about something after being lethargic for a fortnight, it was almost as if she had gone back to normal. After that however, she went back to her depressed self and nothing much happened. 

This conversation left my friend and I more concerned for her well being, so we created a list of things we noticed and compared them to some articles about eating disorders. Here is all the stuff we noticed about my best friends behaviour:

- Has previously admitted she doesn’t like the way she looks
- Is always tired, or drowsy, especially during lunchtime
- Doesn’t talk much or get excited about anything other than fitness and dieting
- Has mentioned that she loves the idea of calorie deficient diets
- Currently exercises 6 days a week for at least an hour, and gets upset if she misses a workout
- Eats only one small cup of salad at school (she’s at school for at least 7 hours)
- Admits to drinking tea to replace meals
- Sudden interest in food (think Instagram health foods)
- Appears to have lost quite a bit of weight
- Less muscle definition (even though she exercises more)
- Drinks an awful amount of water instead of eating
- Doesn’t show up to group hangouts anymore

This seems like a long list, but the real reason I’m writing this whole post is because I noticed a few more worrying changes today. Here is the list of things that I noticed today:

- Portion size looked smaller
- Was so tired she basically slept through lunchtime
- Lips were blue (the weather was about 18C)
- Skin was paler
- Just looked very limp in general
- We were shooting hoops in basketball and she couldn’t even throw the ball hard enough to score, and even mentioned how weak she felt. Btw she’s usually very good at basketball especially with shooting hoops
- Shivering and wearing a jacket even when most of us were felt fine. (Usually she’s the type of girl to wear a tank top in winter and not feel anything, so this made me particularly concerned)

So yeah, there’s my long list of things. And now, after looking back on everything I wrote it makes me feel pretty guilty about not confronting her about her potential eating disorder. However, I’ve already asked her about her well being twice, and my other friends have also attempted similar confrontations, but we all received the same general answers like “I’m tired” or “it’s nothing” etc.

I have no idea what to do, I don’t know who to tell and I’m still not sure if it’s anorexia or not. Part of me thinks that it could be some kind of sickness she doesn’t want to tell us about, or maybe she’s just depressed (also not good, but it would be easier to help in this case), or really stressed about something. Because she does have stuff going on behind the scenes, I know her dad had heart problems at the beginning of the year, and that she has a casual job, and her brother just moved out, and its currently exam week (or fortnight I guess) so she already has heaps to worry about. So I’m not 100% sure that all these things I’ve noticed are because of an eating disorder, or not. 

Either way, I have no idea on how to help her, or talk to her or anything at all really. She’s so unresponsive and it seems like she’s just getting worse. I don’t know who to tell, or if I even should involve other people, especially if it turns out to be nothing.  And I most definitely don’t want her to feel embarrassed or betrayed because of me telling her about her actions. I guess what I’m trying to say is, I just want my best friend back, and I don’t know what’s happening exactly, or at least how I can help.

I was so overjoyed when I found out I was pregnant with my first baby. The father left so I'm doing it alone but that's okay. 

Yesterday I went for a scan and found out that my baby has a severe case of spina bifida and I have to choose to let him die now or when I give birth. 

He will only survive a matter of hours once I give birth. I was recommended a termination which is completely against my beliefs, but I've booked it anyway. I don't want to watch my newborn baby suffer and I don't think I could mentally survive after. I still feel like a monster for booking it though. 

They're going to make me a memory box with hand/foot prints and have asked if I want to see him. I don't. I can't handle the pain.

It's so unfair. This is not my baby's fault. I would have coped easier if it was a miscarriage but he's actually alive and growing... Just not right. 


I guess I just need advice on how to keep my head above water, how to deal with the loss of a baby and how to cope with going against my beliefs and having this termination.

I don’t know what to do without directly asking him because I’m not up for the humiliation if I find out he doesn’t like me (although I’d be relieved), or worse, hurting his feelings out of the blue if he does. I see him all the time.

After that week I had several messages from friends but I noticed one of my friends (I'll call her Susan) did not message me. I thought this was odd as we tend to talk pretty much daily for the last 3 years. So I held off messaging her and it's been 3 weeks and she finally sent me a message along the lines of 'you dead or something? I haven't heard from you haha'. but she could have messaged me and didn't. I feel like I'm usually the one that starts the conversation or that our conversations tend to carry on from day to day without an end so naturally both sides respond to continue the conversation. However, these three weeks have had me thinking that this whole time I thought we were closer friends than we actually are, I mean, she didn't even think to message me until 3 weeks later. I feel petty for thinking this way but I also feel like she doesn't really care that much about being my friend as I do. Honestly not sure how to respond to her.

My wife and I got into an argument tonight and she went upstairs and I went into my gaming cave. I came out 2 hours later and as I was walking up the stairs I noticed her tossing and turning in bed through the door crack. But what was weird was that she was doing the same movement over and over and over for 5~ minutes. Every 30 seconds she would lift her head and look around. I thought she was masturbating maybe? So I watched. After 5 minutes I couldn't figure it out so I went in. She was completely out of it. Her eyes were completely dialated, her speech was slurred, her chin was bruised and cut bad (she hit her chin on the night stand I think), the floor by the bed was wet, her mouth was white when I asked her to open it(dry), and she was not herself at all. I have no experience with drugs or alcohol. I found diphenhydramine pills (allergy) on the nightstand and some in all of her purses. Empty bottles. She has done it all a few years ago:Coke, acid, drinking, x, mdma, shrooms, and weed. (no heroin or meth) so I'm told. She was a model and hung around the wrong people. Her entire family had drug abuse history. She also has a history of siezures. Was this a siezure? Is she tripping on diphenhydramine? Is she abusing other drugs? She said she took 4 pills. (100mg) she's a small but tall girl. She doesn't remember hitting her chin or why the floors wet. (didn't wet herself; I checked) 

Sorry for the novel. Please, any advice. I'm scared. Should I take her to the doctors? I've never seen her act this way (her personality while high/amnesia). ",07Nov2018,1

His work has been pretty tough on him throughout his life so whenever he has down time he pretty much just watches tv, goes to the pub or goes into town with my Mum on weekends. We're all wondering what he's going to do with himself once he's retired and he has so much spare time, and I think there's a worry that he might just end up sat in front of the TV all day, every day. I want to find a gift that might actually encourage him to do something with his time. It needs to be something that's maybe creative, active, gets him thinking. It can't be anything too physical as his joints aren't great these days. He doesn't really have many active interests - he likes football but he doesn't go to matches; he constantly talks about music but hasn't bought a new album since the 70s. I'm completely at a loss!

231,"I recently got away from some friendships that were really bad for me and started talking more to another friend and several months ago I asked her if she thought it would be okay to maybe hang out with her friend group sometimes. She agreed and said they would all probably love to have me, especially since most of them are aquantinces. She told me, in fact, that they might be planning a trip to NY and I could come!

We hung out once, for her birthday. And even that day I got the impression that they were all in a group chat together to make the plans (they all knew what exactly we were doing, but I was just told to show up at her house). I asked about it, but they all kinda got silent. That was in September. I asked her about NY a little while after and she said she didn't have the money to go.

In October, I know that they did a lot of Halloween things. My friend went to Hawl O Scream on a Thurday, Halloween Horror Nights with them Friday, had a bonfire Saturday, and then carved pumpkins Sunday. A few weeks after they rented a cabin out in the woods for the weekend. I wasn't invited to any of it.

Now, I am not saying I have to be invited to everything, but I talk to this girl every day and I haven't been out with her or her friends in two months. I asked if we could go to the zoo one day (definitely cheaper than any of the other things she's done), but she said she didn't have the money.

Last night, I get a text from her asking me not to hate her, but she is going to NY with some friends. She said it was out of her control and she couldn't invite me, but that it shouldn't be a big deal to me because I ""didn't know 3/5 of them anyway."" Someone is covering her hotel, but I know she is paying for the rest. I told her I understood, but I don't think I actually do. I don't know them because I don't get invited to anything, not for lack of trying. It just felt like a cover-up.

So a few months ago my distant relationship girlfriend cheated on me with someone that beat her, she manipulated me (still kind of does in ways she still can like liking tagged photos of me even when I’ve made it clear I want nothing to do to her) and lied to my face about the whole thing. I already have bad separation anxiety from my less than stellar family situation so as you can imagine long distance relationship and lies equals me turning into a paranoid monster because I begin to think every woman wants to cheat on me and I’m not worthy of love.

I don’t want to be paranoid anymore.

Honestly I want to be able to have trust in a relationship because I’ve never felt pain that bad ever. I was already quite depressed at the time and had my first suicidal thought which terrified me.

I’ve been sort of seeing someone who I think I really like. We both established that neither of us is ready for a relationship right now but I think this is someone I could see myself being with, not in a rebound way but to truly like and trust.

I want to get over my personal issues and the things that would stop us from working (my anxiety and paranoia mainly) but I’m not sure how. I’ve been burying those thoughts in drinking (not dangerous suicidal drinking) and smoking a lot of weed. Only thing is is that I’m essentially just suppressing my feelings instead of combating them.

How do you think I could go about becoming more at peace with myself and trusting of others when it comes to relationships?

For the past ~12 months I have barely studied (I am a college student in a really good college) or taken care of myself, and it is not even like I'm out socializing or partying. I know I need to do work, but don't really feel like it. I get extremely overwhelmed whenever I start working, and most of the time don't even make it to opening up assignments because I feel that I've already gone past the point of no return. 

I know I'm not stupid because once in a blue moon, I will be my old self and I'll listen to class and I'll actually understand most of the things taught, but my memory is pretty bad and usually my mind is cluttered by other unimportant things so I forget these important things. I don't really have any good friends or study groups or anything like that, so I can't really study with other people. 

You may be wondering how I've let myself get into this situation. I usually just sleep all day and don't eat so that I am really hungry and tired (I feel tired if I sleep all day lol. I think it is because I don't use my brain much at all, so it isn't used to doing any work) and I don't really have to think about my life. Some days I do think about my life, and I feel pretty pathetic and the hopelessness creeps in again which is not pleasant so I'd rather just be hungry and tired.

So I will preface this text with this: I do not believe she has carbon monoxide poisoning because she lives with my step-father. 

About a year ago, my mother, 56, started experiencing some very weird symptoms. 
She experiences moments where she “slows down”, almost like she is settling into a sleep, but it’s while she is doing things like eating or socializing. She will not remember these episodes or realize they are happening. 
She is expressing extreme paranoia. She marks her bottles of lotions and make up where they are currently filled, and swears that somebody is either using them or stealing the product out of the container. She believes she has clothes that go missing. When she asked me about it, she said that she believes somebody severely hates her and is doing this to spite her. 
Part of this suspicion leads to her relationship with my step-father. She is convinced he is having women over to the house. Even went as far as installing security cameras inside the house. She asks me for his text and call logs (they are on my Verizon account) and she will mull over those logs for hours to figure out who it’s to. 
She has seen doctors for the episodes of “slow down” but they can’t seem to figure out what it is. 
Alcohol seems to impair her almost immediately as well.

Everything I do is almost always at night because my days are spent at school and work, which is why this feels so freaky to me.

The other night I had a dream I was kidnapped walking alone a sidewalk that didn’t register as any particular place to me, all I can remember is that it was night and I was standing under a streetlight before I was yanked out of plain-view.
But my dream was from a third person point of view- I was watching myself be kidnapped and taken out of frame. 

So I chock it up to be nothing other than a bad dream, life has been stressful and my sleep schedule is in ruins. 

However, I check the news tonight and I see that a sudden surge of kidnappings and attacks on women are happening near my college campus. 5 in 3 nights to be exact. And this shocks me, because I walk to the parking garage all by my lonesome in the dead of night after my evening shifts, feeling somewhat secure that campus police have got things under control.

But now I’m thinking back to my dream a couple of nights ago and it’s all starting to register as a really bad omen. My gut feeling tells me something is freakishly particularly off. 

I’m wondering if you guys think I’m going insane, if this is all one coincidence after another, or if this is too damn eerie to ignore. I don’t even know what I’m trying to gain in writing this post, I’d just like some peace of mind because my boyfriend thinks my behavior is frantic and way blown out of proportion but the fact that I had a Dream preceding all of these attacks that are taking place less than half a mile away from me as I peruse around campus at night has me seriously freaked.

Their art is """"""deep"""" while mine is childish, pointless. I'm never going to be accepted into art school. I'll apply, but I know that realistically the chance of me being accepted is very slim.

But it's a goal I'm not even working towards because I'm scared, and tired and sick of art. I don't even know if I like it anymore.

The difficulty of the subjects this year are just absurd, paired up with the fact that my teachers are pretty garbage and I don’t do any work. I take shit like calculus, chemistry, physics etc. because I hate literature subjects. These subjects are ones where you need to be a genius to do well in, or study at least weeks in advance. Which brings me to my current situation.

My final exams start in 10 days time, and I’ve learnt absolutely nothing this whole year. In fact I know even less than I did last year. These exams determine which university I can get into, and which courses I can take.

I get stressed every time I think about how much work I need to do, but I absolutely don’t give a single shit, and all I’m doing is playing games.

266,"Hi,

My friend is a female in her 20s, I am a male in my 20s, we dated for a couple of years about ten years ago but have stayed in touch since then. Our relationship was fairly tempestuous, she ended up dumping me although it was basically consensual as she had moved away for university, etc. Shortly after we broke up, she started a relationship with someone else who she has been with until recently. She was engaged to them, she bought a house with them, etc.

The situation is that we started talking again three months ago. And I felt that she was behaving in a way that was unusual. I knew that she was unhappy and that she was cheating on her fiance, she wanted to have sex with me, etc. What was concerning is that she is usually somewhat reserved, she has issues with self-esteem but she was being very upfront. She denied that anything was wrong until we had a long conversation and she admitted that she was unhappy. She implied that something had occurred but wouldn't elaborate and got angry at me for bringing it up because it was obviously making her upset, etc. I got angry myself because I still care about her (not romantically, we didn't have sex) and couldn't understand why she didn't trust me...I understand this was not helpful but that is probably one of my own issues. We had a terrible argument, we stopped talking.

Forward to today: I text her, I don't know why...I am an idiot but I am still worried. She tells me that she broke up with her fiance shortly after we had a conversation. I am happy for her. She then tells me she has started a sub/dom relationship, she starts saying stuff that is very uncharacteristic for her, and I am concerned all over again. 

I don't know what to do.

I am not sure why but I feel like I have to care. I feel like she is vulnerable, I am concerned that her ex-fiance was abusive towards her, and I am concerned that she is putting herself into another bad situation. However, once again, she is basically dismissive of everything I say towards her. 

I briefly tried to talk to her, she got angry, I got angry, and I decided that I really couldn't cope with the situation anymore. To be honest, I don't know why I am reacting this way myself. I am not someone who typically has a great deal of empathy for others but I do have a small number of people who I care very deeply about...and for some reason that is unclear to me, she appears to be within that category.

Right now, my thinking is that I need to look after myself. Like everyone else, I am going through my own issues...I can't deal with her, she is very toxic towards me when we talk, and I have said that I can't talk to her anymore. I actually feel physically sick when I think of the situation so I know I need to cut her out. But I am also aware that she is vulnerable and feels unable to talk about her problems with anyone else. 

One option that occurs to me is that I write her a letter explaining my thoughts. It is non-confrontational, I don't have to talk to her directly, I feel like it may help her, and provide me with some personal closure (i.e. help me feel like I have done something to help).

 I have this friend who I have known since 7th grade and we're in our freshmen year now. Ever since 7th grade, we have been hanging out every day at my house since we live in the same neighborhood. We got closer and now she trusts me the most. But I don't think that's true on some occasions... since we have some classes together, she doesn't talk to me but instead of other people. And i feel so hurt but I never told her because that's so selfish of me. She's a social butterfly so that's how I convince myself it's okay. This is where it's tricky, I'm really tired of having someone/her coming over every day, excluding weekends. I'm really scared to tell her I don't want to hang out every day now.  Background knowledge of me is that: I prefer being alone, and I'm kinda boring but somehow eccentric and I'm sometimes quiet or loud? I don't know but a few other friends tell me I'm fun being around. I really want to stop hanging out because I feel like I have no joy anymore being at my own house. It should be fun having a friend come over, but every time it's just us, I keep thinking, I would rather be alone. I'm not happy anymore. I started realizing this maybe 3 months after school started? But if I tell her, I'm scared she'll hate me and maybe cry. I can't deal with people crying and she also has depression. I'm scared of what I say might trigger something inside her, and I don't want to be the cause of something she might do because of my selfish wishes. Maybe I'm really selfish for saying not wanting to hang out every day, but every time my thoughts dwell on the fact that I could be by myself and just be satisfied with that. Whenever she comes, I always think, how should I tell her? I'm not happy hanging out every day now. It's the same routine hanging out to her while going on my laptop every day would be the same routine, but I would prefer being on my laptop... I'm really just so tired of hanging out every single day... maybe if it was every once a week or like 1 day every 3 weeks. Now I just need advice breaking it to her...  If someone can please give me advice i would really appreciate it. (thank you to anyone who read all of this)   Please don't mind grammar mistakes...

Basically, I was not looking to find a job this semester as my course load is particularly heavy, but I found this job and it was perfect experience for what I want to do when I graduate. However, it’s just too much stress. I am working 25+ hours a week and I just can’t keep up with school. My grades are tanking and I never have the energy to do my homework when I get off work, I just want to go to sleep because I have to wake up early again the next day. I also feel very overwhelmed. I know new jobs always suck and are always stressful, but I don’t feel the training is the best and I am expected to figure out a lot of things on my own. 

I’m not sure how you quit a job only two weeks after starting. Is it worth giving a two weeks notice? I can’t imagine i’m that valuable to them yet as to where they would truly need me for two more weeks. I also feel very bad, as when they hired me they told me it would be very stressful, I know they went through many applicants, and I know I was meant to be a long term hire.

294,"Let me go into more detail. Last night was my first time at a strop club or as it was called a gentleman’s club. I spent a good few hours there before finally asking the woman that I’d been eyeing to give me a private dance. Unfortunately I definitely overpaid, but I ended up getting a 30 min topless private dance from her. Now this woman was legit a 10/10. She was beautiful. And I told her so and treated her kindly and passionately instead of treating her like she’s a piece of meat. I guess she noticed and she commented on my gentleman-like behavior quite often and told me how nice I was compared to most men that come there. And when she would dance on me I would kiss her gently on her back or neck and even cheek(snuck in one on the lips) and rub her back and legs basically not just her tits and ass. It felt very passionate and our faces stayed very close. At one point she told me she likes the way I look at her because I was looking into her eyes rather than her tits. Now I pride myself on being a gentleman and how passionate I am and I’m glad it helps me to stick out. So at the end of the night before I left she gave me her cell number and told me to text her to ask when she’s working. My question is do you think it was given strictly for professional reasons or do you think she may want me to ask her out?  It was passionate to me, but maybe it was just normal work for her and I’d hate to embarrass myself or creep her out by texting her in a way that wasn’t intended. Can you guys help me out? I am not looking to date her, but I’d love to take her out and just talk to her and maybe make love. I know I sound crazy, and so that’s why I’m asking you. Sorry for how long this is and thank you if you read this far. ",07Nov2018,1
295,"I've always been pretty introverted, but in recent years I've been able to overcome that somewhat. I can hold a decent conversation with coworkers and people I don't know, essentially turning off my introversion temporarily.

I'm at the point now though where I feel I need to be able to have more of a voice in conversations, particularly at work. Often times if I'm in a group conversation, the team I'm on is interviewing someone for example, I tend to take a back seat and just let the conversation happen around me.

I need to be able to take a more active role, maybe even as far as commanding a conversation in so cases. How can I train myself to be able to do this?",07Nov2018,1

He told me that he wouldnt tell anyone and it would be a secret but to my surprise, his best friend Bob told me that he mentioned that I liked him. I do not know why he did but it may have been because he was confused and needed help with the situation.

I quickly found another job in different sector with a company that does not allow corporate layoffs, but pays less than I made before. I now have the opportunity to return to my old company, which is under an entirely different executive structure. I would get my base salary back -and a raise...so approximately a bump of about $30K.

323,"So my little baby kitten died last Thursday.
He was born with a disease and was basically doomed to die the moment he was born. I live with my boyfriend and one couple plus one girl- so that’s a total of five ppl in an apartment-
Not to mention two cats that belong to them.
One cat has been here since March and the other kitty was brought home right before Onyx died (my deceased kitty). 
So of course all of us love our cats but onyx was MY baby- and I know this may sound bitchy but hear me out.
My roommate (we will call her Lee) took Onyx’s death very hard- almost too hard. She posts about him a lot as if he was hers, she went and got pictures of him made to put up around the house and she would almost guilt trip me for showing any emotion other than sadness for the first three days after his death. 
Now I’m a very private person when it comes to grieving- or any emotion in general.
I didnt appreciate her judging me for the way I’m coping (she doesn’t see me hysterically cry at night or behind closed doors over my loss) but what has brought me here as the cherry on top is that she has the nerve to tell me SHE isn’t ready for a new cat and that I CANT get a new one because it won’t help me or her. Understanding that people cope differently, this really irks me because in my mind I’m ready when I’m ready and she shouldn’t be telling me what I can and can’t do or should or shouldn’t do. I’m a very meek and quiet person and when she comes at me saying those things while making me feel like shit for not grieving the way she has, I don’t say much but it’s building up. How do I deal with this in a civil way?!? Am I wrong?? It’s even harder to heal for me now bc I’m dealing with a person that I live with that not only constantly judges me on stupid shit like how I make ramen , but now she’s judging me on my coping process.

324,"I currently have a BA in Biology/Neuroscience, and recently enrolled in a pre-nursing to nursing track at a community college, where there is a week-long intensive course on genetics being offered (for free!). I'm being asked to write a brief statement on how the course may aid future academic or career goals, with the inclusion of any past research experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

I avoided the genetics course at my college due to the professor, so a majority of what I learned was through Developmental Biology and Development of the Nervous System courses. It's also worth noting that I worked in a Pulmonary ""research"" lab, but most of what I did was cell-culture and running tests on airway epithelia to test viability of the cells and their electro-chemical characteristics.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd really enjoy the opportunity to take this course, but I'm uncertain how to tie this to my career trajectory (RN-travel nurse-possible Nurse Practitioner). Would it be questionable to say that my career is still somewhat open-ended, and may wish to become a research nurse?

338,"Though I've been on this website for a while, I've never actually written a post nor learned the large basics of Reddit, so I apologise if this shouldn't be posted here. However, on Halloween on my way to work, I was a passenger of a T-bone collision, hitting my side. My mum's car was totalled and was unable to be fixed due to the airbags being deployed and the overall damage to the side of the car. I was rushed to the ER as I had severe pain in my back, pelvis and overall shock of the situation.   


Though CT scans, Xrays, and blood/urine tests came back negative for severe signs of internal trauma,  I was still very shaken from the adrenaline. Days after, my pains fluctuated from vomiting and back pain to creeping stomach pain and sensitive abdominal irritations. My boss seemed at the time not convinced that I had been in that bad of an accident considering I had answered their call 14 minutes after the collision (being late to work by then). I understood that me answering the phone in the ambulance would seem that I wasn't bad off, but none the less, I was still upset how they were very, *brushing of the situation* they had been in answering with ""so you're not going to be in at all today?"" - at this point, I was still in shock. The following day, that I had off anyway, they wanted me to make up the hours I had missed which angered me.    


I go to the UC due to my continual abdominal and back pain and just, overall stress. The doctor there recommended I go back to the ER out of worry that I might have slow internal bleeding. I brush this off like an idiot out of financial fear. She gives me two days to stay home to see if anything happens.   


I go back to work on Sunday, but that point I'm tired and angry that I'm there. Though I explain more in depth to my boss what happens and *finally*, they are more lenient on the situation and I thought I had the issue resolved. but alas, my pain continues, though my back pain had resided.    


Fast forward to yesterday, when I find out that they have only given me one day off next week on a 38-hour time frame. It might not seem bad normally, but at this point, as I'm still getting over not only the physical, but emotional trauma (as now I feel severely uncomfortable and panic whenever I'm in a car and almost immediately refuse to sit in the front passenger seat). I want to quit this job, as I have another one which is more open to discussion about what happened rather than getting angry over missed hours.    


I'm currently about to go back to the ER for my stomach sensitivity as I hurt whenever my stomach is full, gassy, or having pressure on it.   


I'm scared, however, that me quitting this job will impact me with more job offers in the future. I've only worked at this new job for two months, but I'm paranoid that word gets around and I won't be hired for quitting. I really don't think my body is ready to withstand: standing and lifting, and the extra stress for 38 hours in a matter of six days when the accident happened only a week ago. I don't know how to address this problem and I'm terrified. What would you lot do in this circumstance? ",07Nov2018,1
339,"Sup everyone. So if you were in a relationship for ten year with a lady and she got mad about you not getting an engagement ring what would you do?

Back story: so my girlfriend and I have been dating for about 10 years. Its deff time to propose but there is a few things stopping me.

1. We have never fully lived together.

3. We both still live at home.

4. We live in NY where its next to impossible to buy a house unless we both make 100k a year.

Last night however we got into a fight about how our communication wasn’t very good. Needless to say the conversation ended a bit abruptly. That was at 11:04 pm, as i was going to lay down around 12 I checked Snapchat and saw that she had posted a selfie. Now before I get more into this, I usually do not care what she post. I’m not the crazy bf with trust issues. But what I noticed was that it was a selfie that she took earlier or even days before. I thought that was a little alarming, it seemed to be that she was either being petty or seeking out attention. To me there’s no reason at all to post an attractive selfie at 11:45 at night after a somewhat big fight. I even asked my sisters and she thought the same thing. 

Now let me give you some added context to this story. When we met she was still living with her ex and she reached out to me after I kept liking a lot of her stuff on social media.

He always wants to know where I go which is fine I guess but he wants to know everything I'll be doing, who I'm going with and anything else. It's gotten to the point where I get all nervous and anxious when I want to tell him I want to go out because he'll just get upset if I go out with a friend especially if its a guy even though I have never done anything with a guy before. Most of the time I dont want him knowing I'm going out with a friend because of this. Sometimes he threatens to follow me to see what I'm up to and I don't want that. I'm basically almost 18 and I don't need to be followed. He even has me on a phone gps which is always checks constantly not only for me but for my younger sisters as well.

349,"This is my first post so bear with me.

My friend and I take this class at our college and we both have the same professor. This professor always makes these cringe worthy jokes, expecting the whole class to laugh, he's late half of the time because he oversleeps, and he is also a student at another university, which he brags about A LOT. My friend and I do the same assignments and we notice that he usually always gets a higher grade than me. We decided to try something with one of our assignments to test this theory out: we put almost the same exact answer for one of the questions (my friend told me to use the exact definition from the book just like he does on all the assignments, but for his, he just shortened it and made it simpler), turned it in, and guess who got the points? My friend of course, with a 95%, meanwhile I got a 79%, with a comment that reads ""your definition is imprecise, please research more on this topic."" And I sit there wondering, ""why this professor so picky with me?"" Even on all of my essays, his comments are so critical on my grammar and use of primary sources. It may seem like a professor who ""cares deeply"" about the student, but the things he has said make no sense. I double check it with my English professor, with at least 15 years of experience, who's corrected some of these mistakes, and even then he's taken aback when I show him the paper with my grade. This made my overall grade go from an 81% to a 76%. I have tried to confront him about it, but he turns his back and begins talking to another student. One more thing he does is that when I raise my hand to participate in class, he always seems to interrupt me midway of my sentence and take control of the conversation, although he listens to other students attentively. I believe I can't do much and I have thought deeply about withdrawing my class before November 9th, the deadline for class withdrawals. I don't want to do this, but it seems I might have to if he keeps lowering my grade. What should I do in this situation?

TLDR; My professor seems to have a bias with other students compared to me, causing him to lower my grades constantly despite me putting just as much effort, if not more, into my work. What can I do if I have already tried to confront him about it&gt;",07Nov2018,1

352,"I \[26F\] have been friends with ""A"" \[28M\] for probably approaching 8 years. We went to the same high school and community college, and he was best friends with my ex, who died unexpectedly a few years ago. Since then we have remained friends and I guess leaned on each other for support while dealing with this mutual tragedy. 

While my ex was alive, he told me that ""A"" had told him and their other friends that ""A"" and I had ""made out"" before, which was a lie. At the time I was angry, but I didn't make a big deal about it because I was personally happy and I knew the truth, and my ex then knew the truth, and ""A"" was considered a little bit pathetic (sorry to be rude, but that's the simplest way to say it) so it wasn't that surprising that he would make something like that up. Part of me even felt bad for ""A"". I let it go.

Now, years later, I find out that ""A"" told a mutual friend ""C"" that I tried to kiss him, but apparently he resisted because it was ""too soon"" after my ex's death. That is a lie. In the same conversation, he confessed that while at my house, he read my diary! I live alone in town and he will come over sometimes, and when we've been drinking I let him stay in one of the guest rooms, maybe once every couple months, so it must have been during one of those times. Believe me when I say that in all these years we have never even so much as kissed even once. I realize it was dumb to leave my diary where someone might read it, but I live alone and don't have many friends in general and never have anyone over other than him and maybe 2 or 3 other people on random occasions all of whom I've known for years, so I never suspected anyone would start looking through my things (stupid of me I guess). I don't think I wrote anything totally crazy or embarrassing but obviously it's upsetting.

Now, the friend who told me all of this, ""C"", is saying I can't tell him she told me, that he begged her not to tell me but as my best friend she felt I should know all of this. I really want to confront him about it, and let him know that I know, but I don't want to betray my friend ""C"" or cause a big problem for myself or anyone else. ""A"" is always saying he is suicidal and has always had emotional and mental health issues. I don't exactly think he's dangerous, but ""C"" is worried he will do something crazy. My sister, who also knows ""A"" and has talked him out of ""suicidal thoughts"" before, says that she doesn't think that ""A"" will commit suicide and also says ""C"" is being selfish and that I should definitely confront him. ""A"" tells me often that I'm his only friend, but I'm not sure how to approach this because I'm not sure that I want to be his friend anymore, and I want to be able to at least tell him why rather than ghost him, which wouldn't work anyway because he does know where I live and we have several mutual friends. 

Side note about ""A"", he has a friend overseas, ""E"", who he has chatted with for years and went to visit a couple of times. None of us have ever met her, but ""A"" always comes back and tells us these outrageous stories about he and ""E"" hooking up, even though both times he went she was in a relationship and this last time she was even engaged! We have no way to verify these stories, but we all assume he is lying. I have wondered if it is underhanded to contact her and ask if any of these stories are true, because I now suspect he has lied to others about he and I getting physically intimate as well and if he is lying about her, I wonder if she should know. At the same time, I don't want to be a backstabber and clearly that would be a huge hit to ""A"", which is not my intention.

Long story short my parents had a rough go with a business decision and declared bankruptcy, well they are finally on their way out of it and now my father's behavior is becoming terrible. My mother likes to keep to herself and she doesn't have people over her house cause she likes to keep it clean, but my father has now been picking on her only flaw when he has so many himself. He is addicted to marijuana and smokes from 9-9 and recently got arrested for it a third time and he doesn't seem to care at all. He has been acting like everything is fine and nothing is going to happen to him. He also doesn't come home until 11 at night when we are all getting ready for bed than complains he doesn't get affection or love. He complains about his sex life every day and has tried while my sister is getting for work. It's like you can't even have a conversation with him anymore he just comes homes watches tv, doesn't pick up groceries, doesn't clean, doesn't do anything.

I commented that I think that if your friend wasn't stable financially and mentally, and decided they wanted to have kids just because they were feeling left out, would you leave them be? I stated my reasoning, which was that if you let them do it then you'd be enabling a potentially abusive situation.

355,"Basic gist of the story here...my dad had a somewhat successful business and wanted to hand it over to his kids (myself and sibling).

While my sibling was going to be doing this job full-time, I was only supposed to be doing it part-time. I have an actual full-time job already and a career I built myself.

Long story short, they didn't think I was pulling my weight. They have super lofty expectations and honestly, I can't give them 110%. Last year I recognized this and took a big pay cut (my own idea) down to what I thought was more fair. 

In addition, I really tried to step up my game and do my share. I've rebuilt their websites (6 websites), set up blogs for them, rebranded their entire company (logos, business cards, brochures, postcards, etc.), set up google analytics, set up and manage their adword campaigns, set up and manage a email marketing system, started trying to become more SEO focused and bring that into the fold...they had none of this before. 

I've also paid for a lot of this out of my own pocket: Server costs, SSL certificates, domains, freelancers, printing...

...in spite of doing all this, business is not up. I mean for almost 2 decades they did the bare minimum to change with the times and now the business has massive competition with tons of resources...so it's like fighting an uphill battle.

Last night I got in a big argument with my sibling and it basically comes out that they still pretty much hate what I'm doing and none of it is right and how they're doing all the work and I'm doing nothing.

I mean, of course they have valid points when they point to specific instances: ""You didn't do X, Y, Z when I told you to do it!"" ...but that's because I thought X, Y, Z was not a great idea and told them as such.

They're extremely scatter brained, jumping from one idea to the next just thinking if they try enough random stuff, they'll hit gold. Maybe they will. They have a lot of irons in the fire but there's basically only 4 people working on this business and not every idea can be executed.

So after the big fight with my sibling I've been mulling it over and decided I should leave the business. 

I maybe slept half-an-hour last night over this, my chest and stomach feel like their going to explode. 

I know they're going to hate me even more because the timing of this is not great: My dad wants to retire in earnest at the beginning of the year and sibling has a newborn. I know they're just going to continue to point the finger at me and blame me for years to come over this...but I'm not looking to be the villain in their story.

Am I doing the right thing? I don't want to lose my family over this stupid business...like I've tried doing a lot to make things right and contribute but nothing I seem to do is right in their eyes.

But I have to wonder if I can somehow buckle down and turn this shit around and get them more business if they'll be happy with me again...

...but I'm not sure if that's how I want to define my relationship with my family: They're only happy with me when my contributions are successful.

tl;dr I'm part-time in a family business. They don't think I'm doing enough. I took a big pay cut (self-imposed) and doubled my efforts this year...they're still pissed and blaming me for the business not doing gang busters. Basically I'm their weakest link. I think it's time to go, but I'm not sure if it's going to destroy my relationship with them even more.",07Nov2018,1

I told her she needs to get help.

“I have the help but nobody cares”

358,"Please try not to be brutal as we are already in a shitty situation due to not taking our feelings for eachother seriously.

Prior to meeting my boyfriend, I had crazy plans to just work contract jobs and travel in the gaps between my contracts. I wasn't looking to set my life up for stability and I wasn't looking to factor relationships into my plans (overreaction to giving too much to past bad guys).

My boyfriend (28) had spent a lot of his life being a hippy and had just reached the point where he wanted stability. He never went to college. My craziness seemed to inspire some craziness in him.

We dated for 7 months, my contract job ended, and he quit his job to backpack Europe with me. We had a good time. It was worth it.

He had decided that when we got back from Europe he was going to drive down to Florida and learn programming (AS400) from his mother so he can get a good paying job in the future. I have no idea if this will actually lead to a good job. I wanted him to go back to school at night.

He gave up his New York residency without thinking to do this.

I flew down to see him in Orlando. I hate it. Absolutely hate it. He isn't fond of it either.

I already have a job hopper resume, and if I went to Florida it would be for a year total. I don't think I could stomach it for much longer. He could get his programming done and we could return to New York together. Settle down and probably never move again if we can help it.

I have job hopped 4 years straight on my resume, with one 6 month contract job where I received a $5,000.00 end of contract bonus. I'm not a bad employee, I've just spent a while finding my niche and am now looking to develop a career in compliance.

We both want stability now (Europe knocked the travel bug out of my system) and want to live  together and be happy. I've completely lost my interest in living transiently and traveling. I miss our old little crap basement apartment and doing all the mundane things with him we used to do everyday, like cook dinner.

We're from Long Island and I would like to come back here after Florida but it is insanely expensive.

What are our options? If he hadn't rushed to change his residency I would have dragged him home already. Is it possible that if I land a compliance job in Florida and stay there for a year to come back to New York that I will not have made myself unemployable?

I've basically hopped industry's my whole life, from insurance to publishing to legal work, before stumbling onto compliance. 

I want to be able to buy a house with him in 5 years, and we both need to making at least 60,000 in New York in order to do that (assuming we get our tiny basement apartment back). The thought of being apart from him in New York for a year kills me (that's how long his mom says he'll need to learn the programming).

Sorry if this is a mess to read. Should I go down to Florida with him? Am I really hurting my resume if I do this? Is this as bad of a situation as it sounds? Can someone with no college even get a decent programming job with AS400? Are we better off having him come back...regain residency...and apply to civil service jobs?

We clearly made a mistake by not planning this as a couple. Originally we just assumed we would go separate ways, but we're both in agony at the moment because we don't want to lose eachother. I cannot say enough how badly I am kicking myself. ",07Nov2018,1

361,"Long time lurker, first time poster. I am on my phone currently so formatting could be weird. 

I (22F) am having issues with a co worker (mid 20s M). 

Background:
We work for the university and are both students in the same major, but I am an undergraduate student and he is a graduate student. We are a part of the front end of the office handling faculty issues. I started in the summer and he took the summer off so we didn’t meet until the beginning of the fall semester.  He works mornings, I work mornings and afternoons. 

My situation:
Since the day I met him, he has been making slightly sexist comments to me. The day I met him we went through the usual what are you studying, etc, he said “you probably haven’t heard of my major” and then was surprised when I told him I was studying the same thing. Through having conversations, he keeps being surprised when I actually know how to do things. For example, last week he learned that I knew how to code and some of his comments were. “You actually know how to code?”, “You like coding?”, etc. When he learns about my outside activities (I am outdoorsy), it blows his mind that a girl can handle dirt. If I start having trouble with resolving a problem, he has to immediately insert himself, even when I ask someone else to help me. Whenever he tries to give me advice, it always ends with “don’t worry it will work. Let me know if you need me to show you something else.”, and then goes back to his computer. He is constantly avoiding taking jobs (we have an online system for faculty to submit a request when they need help). He sits and watches Netflix his entire shift. He never checks the system. A couple weeks ago I had handled an issue, came back to four unclaimed issues and him watching Netflix. I handled 2 out of the four and he didn’t move once. On Monday he straight up lied to me about why he couldn’t take a request. He never watches the system and is always avoiding requests. If he does take requests, at the end of his shift he gives them all to me and says “oh I gave you some requests I didn’t have time for” or “oh I gave you some requests that need to get done this afternoon”. I am basically doing to workload of two people when he is here. When I am working with other student workers, they have the same issue with him not doing anything but they have no issues with him talking about life or classes. He is actually helping one of them with classes (I guess it’s not surprising boys can code in his mind?). 

What I am wanting help with:
To me, his comments feel sexist, however I could be feeling to attacked. Am I wrong to think he is being slightly sexist?
I feel as though I need to address this to our boss, how should I go about doing this? This is my first time dealing with a co worker like this and I am unsure of how to move forward.

The wire was okay although it cost me around 20€ (\~$22) and the remote control on it didn't work, probably because it wasn't an official wire but the only 'decent' one I could find on Amazon.

The cushions are in a really bad condition right now and one of them has come off. Replacing them would cost around 30€ and the wire is broken again.

Seeing how much it'd cost to get them working again I've thought of getting a new pair of headphones. Not Beats, though.

368,"So this is a really specific problem and isn't just
a general feeling of being sad everytime after I have sex but more of an acute one time thing from this recent hookup. 

So very recently I hooked up with a tindr date and to neatly sum it up it was the best hookup I've ever had which is a big deal for me right now because up until this point every male I've slept with has been generally less than and a bit underwhelming. 

But this whole predicament started when after he left I felt so goddamn cut. Like a huge feeling of sadness and loss and emptiness hit me and its been following me since for a few days. I can't pin exactly why I feel this way or what to do about it. I have had a hookup since that one but it didn't really change anything. 

I know it's irrational to feel this way over what was basically a one stand. Although he said he wouldn't mind meeting again, he said he was really busy for a few weeks. I have asked if he's free, obviously he said no. 

I find myself thinking about him throughout the day and just feeling sad all over again. Similar in the same way you think about a guy you're crushing on but I doubt this is a crush. 

Also maybe it's important to note the way he left. It was right after we had finished so basically no time for pillow talk or a good cuddle which is fine but I suppose it was a bit unexpected for me. Up until that point I or the person I was with had always stayed the night. 

Has anyone else felt like this? So torn over a hookup? Thoughts on what to do or where this feeling comes from?",07Nov2018,1

370,"Hey guys,
Just to let you know: This is going to be a long post but I would really appreciate any help because I have probably never been this hopeless my entire life.

To explain you my situation:
I am 18 years old and graduated this spring in Germany. I have just started a dual study programm at a big company which basically means you go to college and work at the same time. This is something not so many people get a chance to participate in because the company pays for a private university and you get a monthly payment.
 In this case it's special because additionally to the university and normal work I absolve a normal dual work/school programme for the first 2 years which is typical for Germany. This means I have work 3 times a week, go to university two times a week and go to a school specialised for people working in a company one time a week which adds up to 6 days a week of work. This will continue for 2 years, after that's it 1 1/2 years of just work and university so I will graduate after 3 1/2 years. But after that I have to stay at the company for another 2 years which means I am ""free"" with 23
I also life an 1 hour trip away from my workplace which means I have to drive two hours a day, 6 days a week. When you go to the gym and follow a particular diet and want to meet with friends this is a good recipe for a packed week and I haven't even written any tests so far. Because of this packed week I want to move away to safe at least these daily two hours of driving.

Now my problem:
After school I lost a lot of friends which I think is pretty typical and didn't bother me much because I expected it. I also lost contact with my two best friends because they got a girlfriend which also didn't bother me as much as I thought it would because I still kept a few good friend. Not best friends but good friends I see once or twice a week.
During my first vacation since I started in October one of the friends I get a long with the best started his first week in college which went as you would expect: A lot of partying and fun. Now he just hast to be in university for maybe 3 days a week.
As I had this contrast to my daily life I had a little mental breakdown thinking about if I picked the right thing. Nearly all my friends are in college and have this lifestyle which sound like they are having the best time of their life's.
Since this I couldn't stop thinking about quitting because in the first 4 months quitting has no consequence, after that you have to pay back all the expenses which is about 270€ for every month you participated. This will also add lots of pressure to my daily life after the 4 months knowing that if I fail a few test I have to pay back huge sums of money. 
I also tried to comfort myself by saying ""you can relief these years after you graduated by going to university again or going to another country for a few years"" but to be honest I don't know if I would really do this after having a secure workplace which would mean I would have to give up a good job.

When moving out I have fears about beeing alone. I will live with 5 other guys but they are all older than me and I don't know if I will get a connection. The city I would have to move in is also not particularly great or big so life there is pretty boring and has no offers for young people. I get along and go partying with the people doing the same programme like me but these are just friendships you meet at work/class and get a long with but probably won't form a good friendship with.

I constantly think about quitting but feel either really ungrateful because a get a chance many people hope for but don't get. The company is also great and has a lot to offer. 
I also don't want to disappoint my father who is proud of me and also works at the same company. We have a pretty good relationship but I would feel uncomfortable talking about this with my father.
Besides that I feel like I throw the best years of my life in the dirt just to save 2 years especially because I graduated so young. This was one of my main concern before agreeing to this programme.
I will also lose more contact with my friends by moving out and don't know if I can handle loosing the last friends I have from my school.
I also don't know how this will develope when I will take the first tests. Because of university and the ""company-school"" I will have to take a lot of tests.

I am about to sign the contract for my new apartment next week and the phase I can quit goes until late December. After that I will have to pay.

Please give me any sort of advise because I have never been this hopeless and desperate in my entire life so far",07Nov2018,1
371,"
I’m a 17 yo M and I’m confused about a lot of things going on in my life right now. 

I’m in a Pre-University, my grades are ok and I enjoy classes but I’m confused at my own personality, I’m angry towards my own self, I’m also confused and angry about my interaction with girls. 

Background: All my life I’ve been in an all boys middle and high school. I also live in Asia.
Just graduated high school and high school was a shit hole as I used to be bullied regularly and that broke my self esteem and I had many mental health issues. 

Mentally I’m fine but at the same time, everything feels so different. My mind feels so different. I’m not depressed but I can’t seem to concentrate and I’m always easily distracted, lost in thought and sometimes lost where I don’t even know what’s going on and this is frustrating me as I don’t know what I’m dealing with.  I don’t really have the time to go to a psychiatrist because of my tight schedule and also it’s hard to go back to a psychiatrist because my parents think I’m fine and I have conservative parents. 

I have a really big passion for music. I want to make it big out there. Don’t just wanna be a pop singer but I wanna be an overall Musician, bringing back good music like Rock and Metal. 
I used to write lyrics Everyday in high school but now, it seems like it’s hard to write lyrics and I haven’t really done any lyric writing in the past 3 months. (I can play the guitar as well) 

I’m really angry with my interaction with girls and I’m starting to hate girls in general. The reason why is because I was rejected from girls because of my skin colour and it seems like most girls won’t want to date me because I’m not of THEIR SKIN COLOUR. (I know this because they would literally talk to every other guy of their skin but me, I’m the only dude who’s of different skin in class) 

I hate that I’m introverted, shy and I’m just not extroverted, or I don’t have a vibrant personality like most of my friends. 

I’m just so confused and angry. And I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what I’m dealing with. Why girls would reject me just because of my skin colour (they didn’t even want to make eye contact, they avoid me all the time) 
I’m angry at my own personality, for being such an introvert. Whenever I try my best, to talk to a girl. They just aren’t interested in even wanting to talk. (I made a huge effort to talk to these girls and the fact that i tried so hard but they don’t even want to talk, makes me feel like shit)

I’ve been wanting to get a tattoo for 3 years and I’ve been told by my cousins recently to not get it when they have tattoos. I made the design and it has a lot of meaning. Worked a job for 4 months to save my own $. Have conservative parents that won’t approve of this, afraid to have a conversation about this. (In my country, there is no age restriction in getting a tattoo.)  I don’t know how Long more I’m going to wait. 

My whole life seems upside down. I know I’m fine but my own confusion is frustrating me. 
What do I do ? About all these I have mentioned. 

TLDR: Facing some kind of mental problem which I suspect is ADHD, having a Writers/musicians block for 3 months, girls rejecting me because of my skin colour, hate my personality (introvert, shy) Full of confusion and anger. 
Been wanting to get a tattoo for 3 years but I have conservative Asian parents.

372,"Hey guys.

&amp;#x200B;

First off, that title was a word vomit of things but I didn't know how else to say it. It sounds kind of dumb, maybe it is? I need some advice because I don't know for sure.

&amp;#x200B;

What's going on:

I want to get my portrait photography business (babies and children) to get off the ground, I was in the talks about a studio down the street that was going to let me move in for january. Fab. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got excited, I got a new camera body to practice with, we put out ads and stuff saying we are now booking dates for 2019 etc (with enough time to move in etc) and i've gathered interest, though no one has paid yet so thats not a problem, I took money from my savings to put towards the business, andddd...the guy bails on me. He says hes going to give the previous renter another 6 months since their figures are better.

Okay. Fine.

I guess I don't mind doing it at home because its just local families and babies, but our home is too small for my equipment. We have 2 bed, one bath, but the bathroom is dinky, the bedrooms are super small. It fits a bed and thats it. We pay £650 a month on rent alone, bills closer to £900. You are tripping over everything in my house. Baby's room is basically  unusable, its a storage space. We cleared out space for her crib and  shes sleeping in there, but damn its not a nursery anymore. We moved here from a place that was bigger and had a shed with a yard. This house has none of that. Just a terraced house with a small parking space. We had to move within a month of baby's birth due to my last landlord bailing on us. We were desperate.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I found a place online that looks great.  
Generally I don't know if we can afford it originally though. Its a jump to think about it. Is it a dumb idea to move? It's just down the street really.

However I got the idea because today after the news I ALSO got an email from my landlord about paying  them 6 months in advance for rent (we've done that twice, thats like  3500 and its \*\*awful\*\*, but we did it because they messed up our references, and they originally wouldnt let us have a place to stay despite having the funds) or do a work evaulation to make sure we can pay for it. Now thats not too bad.  My husband works a better job just now than he did, he makes about £1500 a month. With extras, we have about £1700 a month. (after rent, bills, maybe about 300 depending on saved stuff?) I am on maternity leave, so I don't get to count my earnings, but i also get maternity pay just now until january.

So, I found a house to rent, its in town, but its  £995-- its 3 bedrooms, 2 bath and has a yard and full window conservatory. That  is definately enough space for another child which my husband wants in a few years, AND I could business from home in that empty space. It has a room FULL of windows which would be amazing for natural light.  Instead of spending £600+ on a business rent, I could do it from home  for an extra £350 and not too many extra bills essentially, right?

I just need a small space for 2-4 people to come a week.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if we can afford it just now, but paying 650 a month for a bathroom that is moldy with bad seals, the front door panels are coming off-- to be honest im done living here, the landlords live in England and they have a company handling everything, which sucks ass because they  arent fixing anything, they wont let us do anything, no painting, no  pets, nothing. (We live up in Scotland.) I've never met the actual landlord.

&amp;#x200B;

I would rather pay the extra £350 or whatever more and get out, but...

What if my business doesnt work? You know, with bills and junk, we'd  have like £100 left maybe? Enough for food yeah, and I guess we have some bit of savings, so we would be potentially  fine until I got a job, which I guess is in the question there, its down  the street from a shopping mall. I'd hate to work there, but if I had to, that would be the best bet. I've got loads of work experience so its not out of the question. Is that a good idea to bounce off of though? I'm stuck in a rut and come January, I won't be in work without making a jump to a building thats renting for 5-600+ a month or possibly looking into the house.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think?

374,"So my girlfriend isn’t the kind of person to ask for help, and I’m really unsure what kind of advice to give. 
The situation: my Gf is a manager of a store with an employee that has some boundary issues. He has a difficult time differentiating between being friends and coworkers, and also likes to project his problems as things people have done to him. Recently he confessed his love for her, which she acknowledged and politely rejected. He said he was going to apply for a transfer, but after two weeks of being weird, decided against. It sounds like it would be difficult as there aren’t any other store openings. 

I woke up today to a distraught text saying he recently tried to commit suicide. Those are all the details I have. 

What advice can you all offer to someone in her situation? It’s really weighing on my gf. ",07Nov2018,1
375,"Lately I've been feeling pathetic over being dumped. I was dating this girl for 3 and a half weeks. She agreed she wanted to be exclusive with me. However, she wasn't too far off her last break up. I've been a couple months off a 7 month relationship from a chick that was pretty emotionally abusive. For example, she once tried to punch me in the face for sneezing while she slept. I've also had trust issues from being cheated on before. So I kept trying to make sure this wasn't going to hurt me. So I asked her how she felt about hookups and if she was sure she's fine being exclusive and if her not being able to bang other guys would ever be a problem. She told me she was like me and hooking up wasn't for her. The first night I asked her to be exclusive she said yes but the same night expressed doubts. This made decide to leave. However that same night she told me she wasn't going to let me leave that easily and that she was confident she wanted to be exclusive and that I'm one of the only people she's really clicked with. Two weeks after that she told me on the phone she wanted to end this because she wants to start hooking up with people again, such as her classmate.

Now this hurt a lot. It brought back a lot of previous feelings I haven't felt in a while. Hearing that on the phone effected me more than it should. It's distracting me from school and making me feel very insecure. The reason I asked her on more than one occasion how she felt about hookups/ being exclusive was so I could be the one to end it and not let it get to here. It was only 3 and a half weeks. I didn't fall in love with her but wow is it distracting me from my life. Am I just unstable for letting it get to me so bad? Should I stay away from dating?

Hey everyone,

I  am 30 years old and my brother and sister are 38 (twins). I see my  brother a few times per year and we aren't very close. I am very close  with my sister and her children. I try to set a boundary every year that  I want to be done shopping by Thanksgiving. Every year my sister waits  last minute then thinks of a bunch of junk she wants, but never ends up  using. I typically go overboard on the kids and their house looks like a  toy store. My brother and I usually just exchange gift cards, and my  sister usually gives me a gift card to go eat and things that end up  donated a month after.

My  husband and I have been digging ourselves out of some serious credit  card debt (started at 23K and will be under 10K next week) and are  working on changing habits. I am working on being less  impulsive/compulsive in every area in my life. My brother can't afford  to give gifts and honestly none of us put any thought into what we give  each other (""where do you want a gift card too"").  I am also limiting  what I am getting my niece and nephew this year to 1 gift each which has  been really hard because I have spoiled them in the past (hence the  debt). I also realize that they are 3 and 5 and half the stuff we have  gotten them they don't even use or remember, and I don't want them to  start associating love with gifts like I have. This year for their  birthday I got them a annual pass to the science museum as an  experience, and it went unused. This will also be the last year I get my  friends a gift, as they are starting to have kids and I only see them a  few times per year. My friend summed it up best: ""we are all grown ass  people with full-time jobs.  If we really want something, we can get it  for ourselves.""

I  know my brother will be cool with the idea but am anticipating some  backlash from my sister. I need some advice on how to approach this  situation and how to deal if there is. I am really looking forward to  the smaller moments this holiday - watching movies and baking cookies  with the kids, seeing Christmas lights, coming up with some crazy ideas  for Elfie, and just being together.",07Nov2018,1
382,"So, this problem is starting to really affect my hobbies and everyone I've talked to irl has looked at me like I'm a little crazy, so maybe someone here can relate. 

I have had a large range of hobbies over the years, and I've enjoyed the vast majority of them and wanted to continue them into the foreseeable future. However, as soon as anyone starts to insert themselves into the situation I immediately start to lose interest. For example: I took up yoga last year and went quietly for 8 months and found it really beneficial and it became something I truly enjoyed. However, my mother found out about it and started asking whether I'd been that week and how much progress I had been making. This led to my interest sliding and the passion I felt for it began to decrease, until I just dropped it because the feeling stopped being that I was doing it for me and began to get tied up in her interest in it. This has happened with other hobbies with different people, like friends asking to hear me play music too many times, people wanting to see things I've drawn or painted, people asking about progress towards fitness goals. It's completely irrational and I don't know how to stop this stupid thing I do. 

The obvious solution here is that I stop talking with anyone about what I've been doing, but this is unrealistic because then what the hell do I do to participate in any kind of small talk?

&amp;#x200B;

391,"(I'm 15) I have a girlfriend. We are freshmen in highschool. She and I have been on and off for 4 years now. I was in a bad spot emotionally. I was having trouble keeping myself... consistent. Now I have finally gotten myself in order. I figured shit out. We got back together.

 I had previously cut her off because I saw what I did to her. We ended on a really bad note. To be blunt, we ended with her sending multiple pictures and one video of her self harm. It has replayed in my mind a lot. As I was like 13 at the time, I panicked because it was like 4 am. Late at night. I panicked and I posted it on social media. I knew that people would report it to the school. It didn't even occur to me that I had just posted it for everyone to see. She saw the people who saw the video everyday. We were in a relatively small school. She hated that and she resented me for it. She had said she has an uncontrollable attachment to me. No matter how I treat her she will always love me and will never be happier.

   I have been with her for two months now. We have had a lot of bumps. She has all of these fake friends that she only uses to smoke weed and drink alcohol. Hell. At one point she took Adderall and stayed up 2 days. (Unrelated, but I'm prescribed Adderall and have never ever given or distributed.) Everytime she gets ""fucked up"" if I'm in contact with her, she always talks about how much she hates me. How she wishes she had never met me. It fucking crushes me. It rips my heart out to think about what kind of person I was; what I did to her. I have been trying to make up for the bad shit I did to her by trying to get her back on track. Remember how I said she abuses substances? I have convinced her to go sober with me. Her ""friends"" keep trying to get her to continue doing these things. I'm stuck. I even try to be her cheerleader when it comes to getting homework done.

The stuff she does to me has absolutely cripples me. It is so hard, but I really do love this girl. I can't sleep well without being on a hangouts video call with her. I can't focus in school if she is absent or something similar. I can't find it in me to get my homework done. I know that if I end things with this... this angel, I'm pretty sure I will get worse. She will be crushed. This has been the first time we actually have had a chance to be a meaningful, lasting relationship. In the past, it has always been ""things have changed"" when they hadn't. In the present it's ""we have changed"" and we have. There's still mutual care for eachother, but we are slowly killing each other. 

I don't know if I'm just a ridiculous teenager who is trying to be more mature than he is, or if I'm thinking about this correctly. I guess what I'm asking is if it's worth it for us to stay together to put the effort into working things out. I don't want to have her (somewhat literal) blood on my hands. I'm honestly stuck.

A little bit about my situation, I am 25 and currently do not have a high school diploma, with that said I had personal problems during my high school years which led me to be in this current position. I also had little to no direction with what I was interested in nor was I comfortable investing a large amount of money into something I was unsure of. I have reached a point in my life where I know now what direction I'd like to take my education in. I was going to enroll in a adult alternative school to get the credits required to complete my diploma. However, they do not offer part time courses and I am working and unable to do school full time. I have bills, rent and obviously cannot just drop everything and pursue my education full time. At the time of trying to enroll I was not sure where I was going to take my education and within the last few days I've come to a clear and coherent understanding of what I would like for myself. I am passionate about becoming a naturopathic doctor and am comfortable with the task ahead of me, however with that said, I haven't a clue where to start and am wondering if I even need to bother with a diploma at this point. I know a lot of colleges/universities don't necessarily require one upon enrollment. I am looking to basically speak with someone who can give me some solid advice on how to go about reaching my goal.

Now I am also new to posting on reddit, I hope I've posted this in the right section. I currently reside in Toronto, ON and would like to speak to someone in my area who is someway involved with the tdsb or some college/university who can give me sound advice on my next steps.

395,"TL;DR how did you know you were gay v. bi?

Alright. Back story:

I went to private school for 13 years. Then to a very conservative high school. We (and I’m so sorry please don’t hate me now) as a collective bullied and judged anyone LGBT+. When I was 19 I told my boyfriend I thought I was gay, but we discussed in depth and I identified as bi from then on. 

I am a chronic monogamist with men. My current relationship is on month 7. My last relationship was 4.5 years. My one before was 9 months. I’ve identified as bi since I was 19. I’ve never had sex with a woman, but I’ve had sexual encounters in high school (fingering, groping, grinding, making out). I’m just flat out not that into men. I am incredibly turned on by women and think that I may be gay. 

However, all of my lesbian friends say they are disgusted by men and by dicks. I’m not. I think they feel awesome and I love that it’s attached to a person who wants to fuck me. But I’m not really attracted to men like I am women, and I don’t want to date another man.

397,"Buckle up folks this this is gonna be a long one...

So a little backstory...
I work in retail as a supervisor in Asset Protection. This means I’m assigned a home store but I travel to multiple stores in my region. Recently I transferred home stores for more pay and better opportunities. I love my new home store and most of the people there. I’m not friends with anyone at my home store because of my position but I’m friendly with everyone so I don’t create a hostile work environment. The previous store I was at, I was in a different job and I was dating a coworker at the time. Which was fine because I wasn’t his supervisor at all.  We broke up right before the transfer but remained friends. 
Now I’ve been at my new home store for almost 7 months. Right when I got there this assistant manager, let’s call him E, tried to get all up in my personal life. He’s older, at least over 45 and I’m 31. In the beginning it seemed harmless but I always avoided answering his questions because I don’t trust anyone right away. Now part of my job is going to train other associates at different locations and meeting with other managers in my position outside of the store. The other AP managers and I were going to lunch to discuss the new hires in our district and about halfway through one of the other managers says his friend will be joining us. His friend is E. E shows up and immediately makes it hella awkward by asking the person next to me to move over so he can sit next to “the prettiest girl at the table”...uh I was the only girl at the table but it was still creepy and awkward as hell. After that lunch he walked me out to my truck and noticed I had fishing poles and a cooler, you know the works for a good day at the beach. 
Fast forward to a couple days later at the store he keeps asking me when we are going fishing together. I politely declined and said I don’t hang out with anyone I work with. He called me out on it and said I dated someone from my last store...let’s call him T. I told E that is true but I learned my lesson from dating T and I’m not looking to get involved with anyone I work with at the same store again. He responded with “I know all about you and T and he didn’t treat you right. You need a real man in your life and I wish you’d at least consider being friends.”  Very professional I’ll give him that. I again told him no and that it would never happen and he responded “Well we will see I usually get what I want”.  
Fast forward a couple more months and at this point he is asking me at least once a week to hang out or go fishing or get a drink or whatever. I always say no and I ask him to stop asking. He brushes it off now like it’s some sort of joke but to me it’s not. He looks at me like a total creepy asshole. He makes comments all the time about my hair and makeup to the point where if I know he’s working that day I’ll dress down. I’ve reported him to HR but there is no proof it’s only he said she said. 
Now last week he tricked me into coming to his house. I had to send out a file that day and it needed his signature. He was at home recovering from a minor surgery but he couldn’t drive to the store so unfortunately the only option was for me to go out there. I tried to get another male associate to come along but we were short handed that day. This asshole answered the door in his underwear. I could’ve gone my whole life without seeing that but it’s burned into my brain. I never went inside and just threw the paper at him with a pen and asked him to sign. Again he starts making so many inappropriate jokes that I lost count. 
Every morning I dread going into work because of this creeper. I change clothes at least 5 times getting ready to make sure nothing I’m wearing is too tight or cute.  Everyone keeps asking if I’m depressed, which I am but not over this I’ve got a lot more going on, and I’m completely done with this turd. 
Now, T and I have been trying to give it another go because we are a good couple and the reason we broke up was very childish. T and I just needed this time apart. Last night he asked me why I don’t wear nice clothes anymore or get my hair done like I was and I told him about E. I haven’t told anyone else about this except HR but people at work have come up to me and said things. Like they notice if I’m there he’ll follow me and watch me. Or he’s gone up to other coworkers and asked if I’ve mentioned having a boyfriend or if I’m dating. 
I told all this to T last night and kinda had an emotional breakdown and realized how much this is stressing me out. T straight up told me he’s going up there on Friday to “straighten this out” and T could knock E out with one punch. I told T no that I could handle it and I could see in his face that I better handle it or he will. I respect that in a way cause he cares enough to realize that this is effecting my mental health but he’s gonna take it to the next level if I don’t do something. I need advice on how to handle this. I don’t have the regular sort of girlfriends that would know what to do and every time in the past I’ve told a guy no they have moved on. I don’t want to transfer stores again but I also don’t want two grown ass men fighting over me in my parking lot. This is high school ridiculous shit. 
Now today E has texted me...oh yeah text me...so I now have some proof. He states that he found out T and I were back together (T still works for the same company and gossip spreads like wildfire) and that all he has to do is wait for T to fuck up again and he’ll try harder. Ok...gross. I can’t show this to T because he will lose his shit. I already called my boss and forwarded him the text and he said he will definitely take care of it but I don’t have much faith. What would you do? ",07Nov2018,1
398,"I met Girl A and Girl B in my senior year of high school. The two of them have been inseparable childhood friends and have a bond so beautiful and strong. They both liked me and girl B once told me outside of high school that they even had a “contest” to see who could kiss me first. so we graduated and two years later (long story short) girl A and i really connected and fell into a deep love for each other, we’re both convinced we are each other’s soul mates, it’s that serious. the only problem is when we started our relationship girl A didn’t tell girl B or anyone else for that matter. we wanted to keep it a secret because we respected the idea of privacy. so here’s where it gets tricky. turns out girl B starts falling for me just as A and I start seeing each other. B even asks A for advice on how to kiss me, which made A very uncomfortable and also very sad because she was lying to her best friend essentially. i always wanted to just tell B but A is afraid that it would destroy their trust bond and B would hate A. A is terrified of that happening and is now in spain, with B (just my luck) studying for school. i was going to see A and we were going to be a lol luvy duvy but when i told A of the date i was going to arrive, she told me that she was afraid of B’s reaction and that we couldn’t hide it if i did. it’s gotten so bad that A thinks we might have to stop seeing each other, and i’m devastated. i’ve been away from my love for so long and to hear that she’s so afraid of breaking B’s trust that she’s willing to end what we have is heartbreaking. i understand it but i just need advice on steps on how to move forward. should we tell B? should we just let each other go? what do i do? please help i’m desperate and sad and need help",07Nov2018,1

They said that Brittany placed an ad on the internet and then said bye and hung up. I was annoyed but not really worried.

405,"So, in my early twenties I was seeing this girl for a bit and I was literally smitten with her. Everything about her was just awesome. We were never in a relationship as she was an international student here doing a one year post grad course. All in all we were seeing each other for 6 months or so.

So when she left that was that. We swapped the odd message but slowly lost touch so to speak (like messaged a couple times a year). About three years later, she got married to a guy and tbh, even though I’d not seen her for so long, part of me was a bit sad about it. A year or so later she got divorced. And since then we’ve message  infrequently.

Fast forward to the present day and over the past 18 months or so we’ve been messaging a lot more and she’s told me I’m the most genuine, and basically the best, guy she’s been with. This happened about a year or so ago. 

Since she left I’ve met a lot of girls, not bragging as it’s not something I’m proud of but it’s relevant to the story. The problem is I’ve never even come close to finding someone I liked as much as I liked her and I don’t mean like physically attractive more like all round attraction. Part of me kind of feels like this was meant to happen if that makes sense.

So now she’s invited me to her country for Christmas and New Years and, although she’s not explicitly “begged” me to go as that’s not who she is, I can tell that seeing me would mean a great deal to her.

Now to the big dilemma, I’m currently in a relationship with a girl who just happens to be from the same country. We’ve been together a year and she’s 22 (I’m 28 now). I really do love her to bits and don’t think I could find a more morally upstanding and wholesome person than her. I can tell that I mean the world to her and don’t want to hurt her. I also took her virginity which is why I think I have this great sense of responsibility towards her. The only problem I have with her is that sometimes I think that maybe she’s just not the one. I know this sounds horrible but I’ve had such a crazy life and she’s like so “by the book” so to speak. 

What do you guys think I should do?

Go away for Xmas and New Years and just be friends with my old flame and stay in my current relationship?

Break up with my girl and go?

Or just not go and stay with my girl?

I’m just so confused about things.

Any help would be greatly appreciated and, if anyone wanted more info, I can provide that.

Thanks to everyone in advance for their help :)",07Nov2018,1

I’ve made plans to join the military since January but I’ve been unable to make them happen due to the distance of a recruiters office. I live in a rural region of America where I’m faced with the dilemma of no public transportation so you have to drive everywhere. My branch of choice is the Air Force but the nearest office is an hour plus drive away. My neighbors work all hours of the day and friends my age are currently facing the same problem of having no transportation of their own. Their is an Army recruiter that is only 15 minutes away but no one joining the military should meet half way and I feel like I would be cheating myself by joining a branch I didn’t choose because it was the easier accessible option at the time. My branch does matter, because the job I’m choosing is only available in the Air Force

408,"So i found out I'm pregnant a few days ago, which was a total surprise. I took the test just to ease my mind while I waited for my period and then BOOM bomb dropped. The guy who got me pregnant was really just a fuck buddy who I always had a good time with. I knew immediately that I want to get an abortion and scheduled an appointment, but I don't have the money to pay for it I'm so broke. I know him as the type of guy who spends $500+ out on a Wednesday night at the club so naturally I've been trying to contact him for not only support and generally to tell him what up, but also to help pay for it. 

He hasn't answered any of my texts or calls, I'm pretty sure I'm blocked for some reason. I track my best friends location, she's spent the last 3 nights at his place so I'm thinking maybe he blocked me so I wouldn't show up on his phone while she was there (they used to kinda be a couple and I guessed they were rekindling things, just another stressful aspect of all this.) 

Anyways I messaged him on snap and he just replied for the first time in 4 days saying: he hasn't responded because he was trying to kill himself last night, he cant talk on the phone because he's going with his parents, and I should get an abortion. Like WHHHAAAAT? I was blown away. Obviously I'm shocked by the news that he's suicidal and I feel awful that he has been thinking about taking his life. I look back and can see signs of him clearly being depressed and thank god he's getting help. 

So were both going through a crisis. I've spent the last few days super frustrated and angry at him for ignoring me on top of being really scared and vulnerable from finding out I'm pregnant.  Now I'm in a corner because obviously I can't ask him for any support in my situation which makes me mad because this is his problem too and it sucks that I have to do this on my own now. 

I've seen him do some pretty shady things in the past, and honestly I'm questioning if he's making this all up to avoid the situation, but obviously I can't question him if its true or not, I can't ask him for proof that he's suicidal. But it just seems too convenient like he said the one thing that makes my problem take a backseat and a valid excuse not to talk to me further. I'm still angry like okay you're going through a lot but have the decency to talk to me for 10 fucking minutes. Idk sorry for the long post but does anyone have experience with this type of situation? Any advice would be appreciated.",07Nov2018,1

423,"(I'm 15) I have a girlfriend. We are freshmen in highschool. She and I have been on and off for 4 years now. I was in a bad spot emotionally. I was having trouble keeping myself... consistent. Now I have finally gotten myself in order. I figured shit out. We got back together.

 I had previously cut her off because I saw what I did to her. We ended on a really bad note. To be blunt, we ended with her sending multiple pictures and one video of her self harm. It has replayed in my mind a lot. As I was like 13 at the time, I panicked because it was like 4 am. Late at night. I panicked and I posted it on social media. I knew that people would report it to the school. It didn't even occur to me that I had just posted it for everyone to see. She saw the people who saw the video everyday. We were in a relatively small school. She hated that and she resented me for it. She had said she has an uncontrollable attachment to me. No matter how I treat her she will always love me and will never be happier.

   I have been with her for two months now. We have had a lot of bumps. She has all of these fake friends that she only uses to smoke weed and drink alcohol. Hell. At one point she took Adderall and stayed up 2 days. (Unrelated, but I'm prescribed Adderall and have never ever given or distributed.) Everytime she gets ""fucked up"" if I'm in contact with her, she always talks about how much she hates me. How she wishes she had never met me. It fucking crushes me. It rips my heart out to think about what kind of person I was; what I did to her. I have been trying to make up for the bad shit I did to her by trying to get her back on track. Remember how I said she abuses substances? I have convinced her to go sober with me. Her ""friends"" keep trying to get her to continue doing these things. I'm stuck. I even try to be her cheerleader when it comes to getting homework done.

The stuff she does to me has absolutely cripples me. It is so hard, but I really do love this girl. I can't sleep well without being on a hangouts video call with her. I can't focus in school if she is absent or something similar. I can't find it in me to get my homework done. I know that if I end things with this... this angel, I'm pretty sure I will get worse. She will be crushed. This has been the first time we actually have had a chance to be a meaningful, lasting relationship. In the past, it has always been ""things have changed"" when they hadn't. In the present it's ""we have changed"" and we have. There's still mutual care for eachother, but we are slowly killing each other. 

I don't know if I'm just a ridiculous teenager who is trying to be more mature than he is, or if I'm thinking about this correctly. I guess what I'm asking is if it's worth it for us to stay together to put the effort into working things out. I don't want to have her (somewhat literal) blood on my hands. I'm honestly stuck. I posted here because no one I know could understand something as complex as this.

I was a part of this 2018 election cycle as a candidate and loved every minute of it. I had a great team, a supportive family, and a strong campaign. We were leading in our internal polls going into election night by a wide margin and were optimistic that we were going to win.

I ended up losing by an incredibly close margin. Now, many people on my team don’t have jobs and I'm not really sure what to do next. For as long as I can remember I wanted this role because I genuinely wanted to use it to help as many people as possible, and now I can’t do that.

I would be so appreciative of any perspectives. I thank you in advance for your time and consideration.",07Nov2018,1
429,"Weve been married for a few years and only in the last year or so has it gotten bad. We argue sooo much. Mostly me nagging him because he does nothing but sit on the couch on his phone when hes home from work(he works out of town). I take out the garbage, take care of our child, grocery shop, cook, laundry, work full time, pay the bills, take care of his animals, mow the grass... the list goes on. He spends money recklessly without putting his family first. He bought four, yes FOUR leather jackets in one month. I had to call my Dad and borrow money to buy groceries. In the last few months he hasnt been taking his anxiety/anti-depression meds on a normal schedule and I think its making him paranoid. I've offered to go with him to the doctor, I've offered to go to counselling, I've tried everything to make us better. For a whole YEAR. He doesnt seem to want to change and I cant put my son and I through this anymore. Our bills are piling up and I think I've emotionally checked out of our relationship. Life when hes out of town for work is so much nicer. My son and I have a great routine, the house stays tidy, and its so stress free. The minute he walks in the door its like a cloud of negativity.

430,"Hey guys. Im a 20 year old Australian male, and as cliche as it sounds i have no clue what i want to do in my future. But it isnt that im out of options, or just have no interests; more so that the options I do have or are at least slightly interested in (or so i think) don't seem as amazing as I imagined them to be. For the past, i dont know, 4 years I have wanted to be a doctor of some kind, maybe because i envisioned myself working in crazy surgeries, or seeing unbelievable things as my job. And that would have been all well and good, and I do believe that i can get into a medical course and pass- i believe that is within my abilities. Its just recently i have revised what it would actually be like as a doctor, and if i would truly like being one, and utilising great chunks of my life to learn medicine and such. I think i gave myself a HYPER pipedream and im still in the later stages of it - i dont know what to think. I dont actually care much for medicine and dont understand why i ever cared other than wanting to 'see gross stuff' and such. 

My biggest attribute is doing stuff with my hands, I love active things like that. Being on my feet and being part of something that is physical and real. Im a bartender and bottle shop guy at a really nice hotel right now and i love it, im always doing stuff interacting and moving around. Running my own bar and coffee shop when im older would be amazing. But even then, i have no idea what that would truly be like. I cant see myself being in the corporate world, politics, law, or anything office related, that isnt me i dont think. And being 20, i think i have nearly thrown trade school out the window. But even then i have no idea what sort of trade i would have even done. 

So I have dropped out of Uni for this semester and next, to get my bearings and have a little time to think about things . Its like I have a crossroads infront of me, and all leading to incredibly different things but i dont even know if i would like any of them, other than my naive perception of them.  I spent my latter adolescence dead-set on what i wanted to be when i grow up, and had no second thought about ANY other line of work. Now im a few years older and my dreams have faded, and i dont really know anymore. 

Im pretty unorganised right now and am waking up really late and going into work right after. My life right now is in a weird limbo. I just dont know what to do with myself or who to talk to about any of this. Have any of you got any advice about what I should do in a strange situation like this; im not depressed or sad or anything like that, just a bit sullen and removed about my future and what Im gonna do with my life.

433,"I’ll start with some highlights:

-	mother is an addicted to opioids and suspect in recovery for the last several years 
-	She has relapsed and caught her time in jail for under a year 
-	I’m 35 and she is 54
-	Stepdad has told me that he hasn’t seen any of previous behaviors when she was on opioids
-	She doesn’t work a program

Since she has been clean and off probation it seems there is always some medical issue happening with her that required a doctors visit. To the extent of having several surgeries. Don’t ask me what medical issues because it changes from week to week and it’s to the point my stepdad doesn’t even know. He said, *one week it’s this and the next it’s that. I just don’t listen anymore*. 

I live out of state so not certain on the medications, but I know she has a lot of medications. My brother jokes they should invest in Walgreens stock. 

My wife and I are expecting our first kid and their first grandchild. We set some stipulations on her seeing the baby when he is born. To quit smoking and to get a Flu and TDAP shot. For both of these request it’s been an ordeal about why she can’t just quit smoking cold turkey because of the meds she is on and is a very specific regiment from her doctor. She can’t get the shots because of the meds she’s on and will cause issues. I’m calling bullshit and my wife in the medical field is also calling bullshit. At the same time we don’t know the meds or really what the prognosis is. 

I speculate that she has found one addiction for another.  At this point I just want my mom to be present with me in this time because I don’t have any other family.

440,"First off, does anyone here NOT masturbate or rarely, like ever? Like did you decide to not do that when you were young and rarely have ever since, etc? 

Okay I was basically a sex addict longest time, very unhealthy relationships. I probably masturbated away my youth like a million times in my life time. I eventually got addicted to lesbian pornography, lost many important real relationships, my job and finances, I had to quit that. Long road. I made it. Sort of. 

Progress.

I am now gotten my self control willpower to be able to stay away from porn and casual ""just-want-to-use-you-for-sex-like-a-drug-and-chuck-you"" encounters but I still feel this feeling of deep regret in my soul when I masturbate, each time after. I feel so horrible after doing it. I feel so tired and my voice gets all weak and hollow and I feel that I am an adult so I think it might be a very boyish thing to do that’s passable as a kid but as you get older it just feels humiliating and isolating and weird. I can’t find any positive view about it honestly. I always feel like shit when I do it. Anxious angry afraid isolative weak and depressed. Orgasm takes a hell lot out of a man. I think God intentionally created the penis for vagina, not the hand. And that whole orgasm thing is meant to be shared with another loving caring human being partner. Right? Anyone else give this sh!t up? 

So, it's destroying my life, self esteem, confidence, romantic life, social life, I’m ready.

Do you guys think I should make “the ultimate sacrifice” and take a vow to never fap again? 

I am sick of feeling like shit after and having to like hide away from people after and just sick and tired all the time.

IS there like some great thing that adult men just unspokenly have given that behavior up a long time? OR probably every grown adult man in real relationships and great social life probably masturbates privately in like the shower and stuff? 

Also, to deal with urges I’m going single for a while because I have a lot of stuff to deal with and financially in a terrible spot and many loose ends I am not ready to bring a woman into my life right now. I really need the space.

This is why it might be tough for me to quit. But I can do it. If that's the goal.

It probably needs to be, right? I'm dying here. I look and feel horrible after I masturbate: excessive sex is like the quick road to the grave. 

What do you think guys and gals? Anyone here find a similar path or can share me their experience with this over their lifetime? Did you give it up, walk away, feel life is better without it? Any tips for giving it up? What age did you decide to be free of it? Should I just keep saying no until it gets easier, and go out there and find real love and connection, only, ever, done?

441,"Hello! One month ago my bf (30M) and I (28F) decided to live together.

We have a very healthy and good relationship overall and I feel for the first time what is to love and to be loved.

The only problem I am having is that now that we live together I miss him. We both have a pretty busy schedule. I leave for work at 7.30 and I don't arrive until 6 or 7. He comes home at 10 or so. So this month we only saw each other to have dinner and go to sleep. Of course, we have some time together, but I don't know why I'm missing him.

I've never felt like this before. I am a very independent woman and I am very happy with him. When we didn't live together we saw each other every 2-3 days and I've felt like I do now.

444,"I'm just feeling stuck and unsure of what to do or where to go anymore. I quit a toxic job about 4 months ago now, and took a bit of time to just decompress. This was after about a year and a half of my job becoming very toxic. I started driving for Uber to make some side income since quitting. I'm just going in and out of depression and addiction, and am afraid of getting a new job only for it to become as toxic if not potentially more than my old job was. I've applied to a few jobs now with no calls back. I've called a few therapists who aren't taking any new clients, so there's also that.

&amp;#x200B;

I do know I need a new job, but I don't want to go back into the field I left, due to how toxic the environment became for me, my mental health, and my life. I almost lost my relationship and it took an ultimatum of her vs my job to finally put in the 2 week notice. I deal with self esteem, trust, feelings of powerlessness, confidence, and anxiety issues that stemmed from bullying from elementary school through high school, then moved into toxic and unhealthy relationships with people throughout college, then moving into dealing with coworkers not only stabbing me in the back by never telling me about the many issues they had with me, they essentially exacted their personal vendetta against me to try to get me fired from the job I secured before graduating college. This was a traumatic enough event that lead up to me quitting that job, since the head of HR unloaded this list of about 10 weeks worth of their complaints they never mentioned to me, and if I was supposed to become a manager, and these were the people I was supposed to manage, I saw no point or logic as to why I was there, and had lost faith in all levels of management at this company at this point. 

&amp;#x200B;

It'd have been easier to circle the stuff they did talk about on this multiple paged bulleted list, since they did talk about 2 very minor things to me, that, had it been anyone else, had been done and over with then and there, which I had thought they were, since the biggest 'fireable offenses' as he put it were issues they talked to me about the first week, which was over 10 weeks ago at that point, as well as issues they obviously were just watching to document to add to this list to get me transferred / fired. They never asked me anything, he just unloaded these complaints and then transferred me to a different department. The real issue here was that I had been working with this company for over 2 years at this point and never once had any issues, suddenly this new (he was hired to the company maybe 5 months before this event) chief of HR thinks I'm this monster this department made me out to be, so he had his opinion already made up, and essentially my input didn't matter due to this, which I had been asking these coworkers on a daily basis about my performance, which they straight up lied to me and told me I'm doing great and I'm a good coworker, so I was frustrated and angry that I had been lied to so badly, and was powerless in yet another situation in my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I quit that job and went back to my old job, which used to be great before I took on a new job in a different department, but then became a nightmare after I came back. I finally quit that job back in July after numerous issues that I could have a whole thread devoted to (granted had I actually reported one issue when it happened instead of when I quit, my manager who moved away apparently likely would've been fired a few weeks before his original end date), and I've been somewhat in limbo since, since I quit said job without much more of a plan of taking time to decompress so I can work on my mental health. Now, I've just sort of been coasting, not sure what to do. I just can't seem to get over things and am still angry about mistreatment in elementary school, let alone my last job. I'm just angry in general all the time and just want to move on. Thanks.",07Nov2018,1

\-Development of multimedia products, its a course that focus more on programming.

I was completely blown away by this, because I had no idea. And I told her as much.  She said that she just didn't think it was a very ""fair"" and ""friend like"" thing for me to let her do something for me every day and not do something for her.

451,"Hi there,

Right now, I'm having that big ""what to do with my life"" thing happening as well as ""my family drains me and I don't think my emotional needs were met in childhood"" kind of thing too. I'm almost 25 and live at home. I take classes to maybe get into the health field, but I'm not completely sold on that. It has been great for my mental health though, and I've found that I actually enjoy studying and the process of learning. I made an appointment for therapy next week, which I'm kind of excited and nervous for.

I think one of my major problems is that I do not have a large support system. Maybe NO support system. I'm the family black sheep. My family calls me weird, and then treats me that way. They tell me I am not capable of things, or make me feel like I am not capable of things. I feel like they think I'm so lazy, meanwhile I'm busting my ass at work and class for something I'm not even sure I care about. It makes it hard to figure out my purpose. I do struggle with trying to figure out my life, I hate desk jobs that are 9-5 and I can't find anything I can stand enough to do the rest of my life. SO having a family that kinda treats me like I am so not capable of anything kinda leads to major suicidal thoughts and I am just tired. I feel like I don't know where the real me starts and this version of myself painted for me ends. I find it difficult to maintain jobs, but I do it anyways. I think I have some severe social anxiety even though I want to make friends really bad and love being around people, maybe thats avoidant personality. I'm trying to speak my mind more, but I always feel like I get punished if I do or people don't listen.

I don't know. I meditate everyday, which I love. I workout often. I eat mindfully. I study a lot. I work a lot. I journal the good and bad things I do everyday to see where I need to improve. I work on myself CONSTANTLY. And I try so hard. But I'm surrounded by people who speak so negatively to me AND about me, and it just feels so shitty. I don't know where to go from here.

It really seemed like he had liked me. We talked about some pretty personal thing and we’re really close to each other. But about 6 months ago, he texted me this whole paragraph about how he realized I liked him and how well, he didn’t feel the same. But that he didn’t view me any differently and would be “severely saddened” if we weren’t friends anymore. But after that day he talked to me less and less. And around July he totally dropped me. That was mostly because he was going through something at the time. But he didn’t shoot me a text explaining things. I know he talked to other people a lot during that time but just not to me. In August he apologized for ghosting me although it didn’t seem genuine. He said he ignored other people too but it hurt so much that he didn’t want to talk to me.

I am very good at my job, make enough money to live comfortably, yet I can't find love and I feel that life is taunting me with my best friend getting together with this girl. I hate it. I hate all of it.

I would just forget her and my friend, but that is currently impossible as they work where I do. I have daily interactions with them.

I want to stop being jealous and I'd love to let her go, but I fucking can't. 

I have no idea what to do and although I know life will get better, I feel hopeless right now and I'd like some kind of comfort.

460,"A good friend of mine lives in my hometown and is suffering from liver failure. To be clear, this is NOT the result of anything he’s done.

462,"Hello,
I’m nervous and upset about this but I need to ask for some guidance.

On 10/23/2018 (IL) I was at a bar with some friends when a random woman came up to me, smiled, and then immediately French kissed me. She then started talking but I realized that she didn’t speak English, but all I got out of her was that she was Ecuadorian. I was in shock and didn’t have much to say, and then in an instant, she just left the area I was at in the bar and then I never saw her again. The next morning I had a dry cough. I don’t know what I should do, or if I can do anything. This is really taking a toll on me. She could have a disease (I didn’t see that she had any signs of a disease - she looked clear of any diseases, but still I woke up with a dry cough - what if she had something worse? It would completely ruin me). I’m looking to see if there is anything I can/should do. I haven’t gotten check out by a physician. The dry cough is gone - it’s been 13 days. No sign of lips sores (worst thing on my mind right now), no cough but throat doesn’t feel 100%. I’m embarrassed about all of this and just scared, it took a lot for me to even type this. I hope everything is ok with me health-wise. I feel like all this happened so fast and there was nothing I could do to stop it. Should I go to the police station in that town and file a claim? This feels like sexual assault with possibly getting me sick. Should I go get tested? Am I overthinking this and should just move on?",07Nov2018,1

472,"I’ve dealt with a lot of memory issues throughout my life (22F) but I’m not sure if some of it is just normal/standard problems most people have, or indicative of larger mental health issues. I’m just going to list a few items and I would appreciate it if anyone would chime in answering whether or not they experience the same thing.

1. Is it normal to often experience a sort of emotional disconnect from your memories, after they’re more than a few days old? Like I can remember the facts regarding my mindset and feelings, and even my first person sensory experience of many things (what I was seeing, hearing, tasting, etc. as if I was there again) but I can’t ever connect with what I was actually feeling. It’s like I was a Sim or something. I just remember the logic behind my actions and the way things played out.

2. Is it normal to not remember pretty much anything before age 12 or so? I remember facts of experiences, but have no actuall recall of the events.

3. Is it normal to feel disconnected/unrelated to younger versions of yourself. When I look at a photo of me, even from just two or three years ago, I feel like I’m looking at a stranger. I know it’s me, but I can’t relate to the person in the photo at all or recall what it was like to look in the mirror and see that person looking back. It’s even worse with childhood photos.

4. Is it normal to feel like who you are at your core is completely different than who you were just a year or two ago, and to have this experience repeatedly every one-two years?

5. Is it normal to feel as though there are two “you”s. One that does everything in the moment, and one that analyzes it all later and understands the logic and reasoning behind the in-the-moment one’s actions. And to feel like that in-the-moment you is who everyone thinks is you, but the analyzing you is the real you?

Also, this one is optional but semi-related and mainly aimed at people who don’t have an inner monologue (I don’t either.)

1. Is it normal for you to only experience internal monologue when you’re high (weed), and otherwise experience no monologue or pictures when thinking but instead just an instantenous knowledge/sense/understanding that lacks form?

Please let me know. I’m really unsure if this is common for most people and we just don’t really discuss it much or if my experiences are indicative of profound/prolonged dissociation.",07Nov2018,1
473,"To explain you my situation:
I am 18 years old and graduated this spring in Germany. I have just started a dual study programm at a big company which basically means you go to college and work at the same time. This is something not so many people get a chance to participate in because the company pays for a private university and you get a monthly payment.
 In this case it's special because additionally to the university and normal work I absolve a normal dual work/school programme for the first 2 years which is typical for Germany. This means I have work 3 times a week, go to university two times a week and go to a school specialised for people working in a company one time a week which adds up to 6 days a week of work. This will continue for 2 years, after that it's 1 1/2 years of just work and university so I will graduate after 3 1/2 years. But after that I have to stay at the company for another 2 years which means I am ""free"" with 23 years of age.
I also life an 1 hour trip away from my workplace which means I have to drive two hours a day, 6 days a week. When you go to the gym and follow a particular diet and want to meet with friends this is a good recipe for a packed week and I haven't even written any tests so far. Because of this packed week I want to move away to safe at least these daily two hours of driving.

Now my problem:
After school I lost a lot of friends which I think is pretty typical and didn't bother me much because I expected it. I also lost contact with my two best friends because they got a girlfriend which also didn't bother me as much as I thought it would because I still kept a few good friend. Not best friends but good friends I see once or twice a week.
During my first vacation since I started in August one of the friends I get a long with the best started his first week in college which went as you would expect: A lot of partying and fun. Now he just has to be in university for maybe 3 days a week.
As I had this contrast to my daily life I had a little mental breakdown thinking about if I picked the right thing. Nearly all my friends are in college and have this lifestyle which sound like they are having the best time of their life's.
Since this I couldn't stop thinking about quitting because in the first 4 months quitting has no consequence, after that you have to pay back all the expenses which is about 270€ for every month you participated. This will also add lots of pressure to my daily life after the 4 months knowing that if I fail a few test I have to pay back huge sums of money. 
I also tried to comfort myself by saying ""you can relief these years after you graduated by going to university again or going to another country for a few years"" but to be honest I don't know if I would really do this after having a getting a guaranteed workplace which would mean I would have to give up a good job.

When moving out I have fears about beeing alone. I will live with 5 other guys but they are all older than me and I don't know if I will get a connection. The city I would have to move in is also not particularly great or big so life there is pretty boring and has no offers for young people. I get along and go partying with the people doing the same programme like me but these are just friendships you meet at work/class and get a long with but probably won't form a good friendship with.

I constantly think about quitting but feel really ungrateful because I got a chance many people want but don't get. Especially because the company offers a lot.
I also don't want to disappoint my father who is proud of me and also works at the same company. We have a pretty good relationship but I would feel uncomfortable talking about this with my father who helped my deciding to do.this programme.

But besides of that I feel like I throw the best years of my life in the dirt just to save 2 years especially because I graduated so young. This was one of my main concern before agreeing to this programme.
I will also lose more contact with my friends by moving out and don't know if I can handle loosing the last friends I have from my school. But staying at home is just to much time spent driving with my lifestyle. The distance is not to big which means I probably won't stay in my apartment the whole week but still, it's not optimal.
I also don't know how this whole situatiom will develope when I will take the first tests. Because of university and the ""company-school"" I will have to take a lot of tests. Like one test a week from next week on until the semester ends.

I am about to sign the contract for my new apartment next week and the phase I can quit goes until late December. After that I will have to pay.

Please give me any sort of advise because I have never been this hopeless and desperate in my entire life so far",07Nov2018,1

475," Hi. I’ve lurked here for a while, but I just made my Reddit account and am essentially new here, so please forgive me if I violate any unspoken Reddit etiquette (Reddiquette?). I'm aware this is a long post, so if anything isn't clear, please ask and I'll be glad to explain.

First off, some relevant background. I’m a 28-year-old woman. I was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome (autism) when I was six. It used to be more apparent when I was younger, but now it’s generally not noticeable except to other autistic people and some medical professionals, and I’m capable of being a good student, holding down a job, and living independently (I have done all those things). People have told me I don’t tend to make a positive first impression and I’m initially “off-putting” for undefinable reasons, but I have many good qualities and a talent for winning people over with time. I think all of that is probably true. My biggest issues are social anxiety, comorbid depression and ADD, rigid thinking, fear of risk, and being “high-strung” in general. But it’s impossible to tell how much of that is from the autism, and how much is from self-doubt and being hyperaware that I never quite come off as “normal”.

Based on an essay I wrote, and my good grades for the latter half of high school, I got a full undergraduate scholarship from my state’s department of vocational rehabilitation, toward the purpose of helping people with disabilities become more employable (ha!). I went to a state university, known for being a commuter school that was barely a step up from a community college. Majored in psychology because at the time, I wanted to become a therapist or a college professor and the scholarship committee approved it as a highly marketable degree (ha!). Minored in English because I loved reading and wanted to write a novel someday (still do). Although I joined a student organization related to my minor and held leadership positions in it, I didn’t do any other kind of networking, have a job, or get an internship or TA position. Graduated in 2013 with a 3.85 GPA and no practical skills to speak of.

I now know that pretty much all of that was a huge mistake, career-wise. At the time I didn’t know I needed to do these things and no one told me I needed to. I know it would pretty easy to accuse me of acting entitled or needing my hand held. All I can say is that I don’t know how I could be expected to fill those gaps in my knowledge when I didn’t know those gaps existed. And I can’t waste time regretting it.

I applied to four grad schools, and (unsurprisingly) didn’t get in any of them. As of now I’ve only had three jobs. One was an independent contract position as a secretary/editor that my dad got for me; one was a seasonal cashier position at Bullseye Inc., and the most recent and longest was a night shift janitorial position at a casino, which I got through a former friend.

Looking back, I recognize what was wrong with my job search strategy. At first, I only applied to jobs relevant to my major. After I got rejected from grad school and quit my independent contract position, I applied for all kinds of work, learning through research and trial and error. For the majority of that time, I consistently disclosed my autism, on the advice of both the vocational rehab agency that gave me my scholarship and my dad (who thought it would give me a “diversity” edge). I can’t prove that it contributed to all the rejections I got, and I know that correlation doesn’t always equal causation, but I do know that I started getting more interviews around the time I stopped disclosing. By that time, however, I’d been out of work for so long and had so little self-confidence that it was damn near impossible to “sell myself” in interviews. My former friend, who I met in college and who lived 30 miles from me, took me in temporarily after a major altercation with my parents. She helped me apply to the casino where she worked and coached me on exactly what the questions would be and exactly what to say in the interview, not thinking that I would get the job or that I would last as long as I did there.

That last job (the night shift casino janitor position) lasted 2 ½ years and oddly enough, I liked it the best. It was mundane and occasionally disgusting, but it was full-time and I made just enough to live on my own. I worked with a great team of people, made a couple friends, and my immediate supervisors were helpful and supportive. I had planned to move up in the company if I could (obviously I didn’t want to clean toilets and be exposed to secondhand smoke for the rest of my life), but it proved to be more difficult than I thought, and it became a moot point because my housing situation fell apart, I couldn’t find another place to live in the area (important b/c there no public transit in the region to speak of and I can’t drive), and my doctor told me I needed to get off the night shift ASAP. I resigned and moved back in with my parents in September.

I know what I need to do if I don’t want to get in that rut again. Work part-time, volunteer, build skills, build my network here, and move up that way. I don’t really care what I do so long as it’s not cleaning bathrooms or cashiering. I’d be very happy with warehouse work. I could also see myself going through a certificate program to ultimately get into biotech; it’s a big industry where I live. The only problem is that I’m my own worst enemy—I struggle so much with making a good impression in an interview and combating my social anxiety that trying hardly seems worth it. And my parents aren’t helping. They think that since the economy is supposedly booming, it should be easy for me to get a full-time job immediately, and they think that part-time work, taking classes, or volunteering is a distraction. They are charging me $650 a month for rent, and they have made only applying for full-time work a condition of living there. If I ever try to explain why it’s not as easy as they think, they blame it on my mental illness. And they’re partly right, as it happens: I feel like because of that lack of experience, almost anyone is a better candidate for any job than me, and that all the networking and smooth talk and tailoring my resume in the world can’t make up for the fact that my work history is so sparse. 

I could get a part-time job anyway, and move out; I have savings and can live pretty frugally. I just worry about even being able to secure a part-time job. And to move out, I need to be working; my current area is a highly desirable one to live, and no decent landlord will rent to someone without a job.

I’ve read that no one wants to pay for potential. I’m sure that’s true, and I understand it, but it hurts. I know I’m capable of so much if I could just get my foot in the door, but there is definitely a part of me that’s convinced it’s too late and it doesn’t matter. That said, I know there are people who have bounced back from worse. I recently talked to a guy who spent fifteen years in prison on a felony charge, and he’s now doing construction and turning his life around. I’m a hard worker, I have no debt, I have no criminal record, and I’m smart. I have a lot going for me. It’s hard to believe in myself, but I refuse to give up.

My question is, given my limitations, how do I persuade an employer to take a chance on me despite my puny resume and social anxiety/awkwardness? What are some practical ways that I can project a confidence in myself and my abilities that I don’t feel right now?",07Nov2018,1

I’m mildly hyperventilating, and I’m starting to feel light headed, and my fingers are starting to tingle. I can’t focus on anything and I just feel like I’m all over the place. I want to scream.

Hello everyone,

I have not been using Reddit for a long time, but have already seen what an amazing community it is, its not just that is makes you laugh but also people give really useful advice and that is why I’m making this post (which also happens to be my first post on Reddit).

For you to fully understand my situation and also for you to give a proper advice and analyse my problem I will tell you my story in full, so buckle up, because its going to be a long read.

Before I continue, I must add English is not my first language and thus everything will not be grammatically correct. Getting better at English is of course on my TO-DO list but its not on top of it. Every grammatical correction is appreciated and will be implemented in the post! Thanks in advance for your patience.

   
 

STORY

Second year in high school is started going to the gym, I do not clearly remember what the original reason was, but always when I looked in the mirror I did not like the way I looked and so I wanted to change that, I wanted to say to myself that I look good and healthy. Other important factor was also girls liked guys with a lot of muscle, maybe it was a stupid reason, but it was also one of my biggest motivation. I started going to the gym with one of my friends who is a year older then me (I was 17, he was 18) that has been going there for at least for a year, he passed his knowledge on how to work out to me. First couple of months went by in the blink of an eye, as I got stronger, I wanted to match my friends lift numbers, but that was dumb on my part, he was going to they gym for longer period of time, he had more muscle and better understanding of the technique. But NO, I was not going to be stopped by that so I trained really hard and almost matched him in all of the lifts BUT ONE, which was Deadlift. He lifted about 160kg at that time to my 80kg, I wanted to match him at this lift too. So, one day what I trained Deadlift I said to myself I could lift more, not realising the danger of putting more strain on my back, which would come back to haunt me. My EGO took over so I put 130kg on the bar and try to lift it. It was heavy, but I did lift it one time, then I decided to try to do it one more time, I could not fully lift the bar and then I heard a small pop or maybe a better way to describe it is if some clothing would tear apart, that was the sound I heard. Because of the pain I left the gym after that lift and did not go back for a couple of days. I came back when the pain was gone or so I thought, because after doing an exercise where my lower back was involved, I felt mild pain and knew something was wrong. I made an appointment with my doctor to check it out (since in my country healthcare is very slow, I got my appointment 1 month after the injury), in the meantime I still worked out despite the mild pain in my lower back, since I wanted to look good as fast as possible and not really thinking about the consequences.

My doctor appointment was here, I told her of what it happened and do not remember what exactly she said, but she said this type of injury was common and she referred me to the physiotherapy and there I had to wait about 2 months to start receiving my treatment in the meant time and also through my therapy I was still going to the gym.

Months after the treatment I thought I was getting better or at least my injury was healing, I lowered the amount of exercise where I had to use my lower back and I only felt pain maybe like every other week. Later on, I changed my exercise routine, going back to using my lower back, which I knew wasn’t fully healed but I wanted to look good remember (My desire for looking good and my mind telling me there’s something still wrong with my body were clashing). A year went by since the initial injury and I still felt the pain, now even more because I went back to including my lower back to the workout. When the pain did not stop, I decided to make an appointment with my doctor again, she now sent me to get my back x-ray-ed to see if I broke the spine or one of my disks fell out of place. Results came in later and everything looked fine and so my doctor said that she did not know what exactly it was, but it I should be getting better through time. About one more year passed and everything was the same. I still hoped that It will get better, now again I changed my workout routine. I felt my back more after that. Sometimes it hurts, sometimes it just started to swell or burn up. I frequently asked my mom to massage my lower back, we had some kind of lotion for muscle relaxation. One day she pressed on my back really hard. She must have pressed at a certain point and it started to hurt really bad, she stopped at that moment. And I just laid a couple of hours and the pain did not go away like before. I went to sleep and the pain was still there. After 3 weeks I still felt constant pain 24/7 and it only got worse. I was sleeping 16h a day just so I could not feel it in my sleep. One night it the pain was so hard I could not sleep, barely ate, it was hard for me to move and I started crying. My mom took me to the hospital, where I had to wait 2h before I got my painkiller injection. They tested my blood, my urine, had to stay there for 4h (3am at this point) and the results came back. Nothing was wrong with my blood or urine, but the ER doctor was troubled and said I need to go to my doctor ASAP and figure this out. Unlucky for me my doctor was on vacation for the next week and I did not want to go to another doctor, because she knew the most about my condition. About 24h passed when my painkiller wore off the pain came rushing back even more. I filled myself with painkiller tablets, could barely move or eat, could not sleep, I cried and went to my mom to ask her to take me to ER again because it was really bad. She barely got up, because she was really tired, when she walked to the wardrobe to get her clothes, she got up too fast and got dizzy and fainted. She fell head first to the ground and was unconscious for about 5 minutes, my dad panicked really fast and tried to tend to my mom while I was calling the hospital for the ambulance. Ambulance came and took her to the hospital, because of the adrenaline I did not feel pain, my dad went with my mom and I drove myself to the hospital. My dad stayed with my mom throught the night while I alone was waiting on the other side of the hospitals for my painkillers. I was also prescribed tablets for my stomach since I took too many painkiller tablets. Got home at about 4am that night, did sleep, did not eat, did not drink or move. Just laid in my bed. My mom was in the hospital for the next week, thanks god she was not in a critical condition, her skull broke, but no arteries were damaged, but she did lose some of her memory from the time of the accident and her smell and taste. I felt extremely bad, because I indirectly caused this. The next week was a nightmare, I felt suicidal thoughts, I lost about 10kg due to stress and not eating at all. Most of my night I took a lot of painkillers and cried myself to sleep, I still sometimes do this. After my doctor got back, I immediately went to see her, showed her my ER examinations and told her about the constant pain. She referred me to another doctor, he was a specialist in back bones. I have waited another month before for my appointment, this doctor was and older guy, told him about my constant pain, he pulled up a picture of my back, that was now made a year ago or so and told me that everything on that picture seems fine, I told him that I wanted to make another one just to be sure, but he told me since I am young that he did not want to put me through another x-ray. Since the radiation. He told me that my condition (which I still do not know or even they do not know what it is) could only be better. He said It could only be better from now on and smiled at me, I awkwardly smiled back, because I knew that would not be the case. He also said if the pain continues for the next few months, I would be getting my liver and my intestine scanned, but I also needed to make appointments for that so that about 5 months from now. That night I also cried myself to sleep. Doctors were not helping me. I became weak, very sleepy, did not eat almost anything. Lost about 14k in total. Still took my painkillers just to make the pain milder, it never goes truly away. Its always here, when I walk, when I eat, when I lay in my bed, when I stand still. When I move more, I feel more pain, so I have started to not move a lot, mostly confined to my bed and my work desk. I am losing hope, bit by bit and honestly, I do not know what to do. My family mostly thinks it will get better on its own, but I do not feel that way.

Ill tell you how I feel right now, as I am writing this: I feel I will live forever with this pain, never be able to do sports that I love so much again, never have a body I would be proud of, never be free of it. I feel like a big rock is crushing my body and I barely have any strength left to push it off. 

Lately I have started smoking, because for a split minute when my head feels dizzy, I can not feel any pain, even if its for that small amount of time and even though cigarettes cause cancer and so on, I want to be free of this pain, I want to know or remember how I felt before all this started. I know its a bad escape, but an escape that means the world to me now.

Thank you for the people that listened to my story and read all of it despite being so long! It means the world to me just to know you took some time out of your day to listen to my story.

Now for the important part. How can I proceed? I want to do something, do not want to wait 5 months just to go to another doctor that might not know anything again. I’m almost convinced that it got something to do with either my muscle or my nerves, but doctors disregarded that. Considering my symptoms that I described what’s your take on it? What do you think it is? I am willing to pay for a private doctor if you think that might be better. Does anyone have any experience on this matter, or had similar symptoms? I will read every comment, I will research every lead! I just want it to be fixed or start getting better at least. If you need any other information, I am happy to give it to you!

I've done jobs before that consisted of graveyard shifts (multiple days a week for months, I honestly got sicked of working graveyard shifts), I also told this to my boss during our interview, but apparently he 'forgot'.

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated from university last year, and on graduation, I didn't know that I'd end up in a clinical role.

&amp;#x200B;

I got into posting on gonewild, and got hooked. So the posting carried on way after I started my job. I talked to a large number of guys on kik. I sent images and videos, not showing my face, but sometimes showed my face on live cam. The one exception was one guy, to whom I sent one image and one video of me nude, showing my face. Most of the guys I talked to knew my first name, an approximation of what my job was, and approximate geographical information. I tried my best to take photos and videos in neutral parts of my house, so that my environment wasn't recognisable.

&amp;#x200B;

However, some of the relationships with the guys got emotionally difficult at times, including the one with the guy who had a face photo.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know whether I'm just being paranoid, but a couple of things that have been said at work imply that some of my colleagues might have seen some nude images and videos of me, and know it's me.

&amp;#x200B;

If stuff has been made public, I'm worried that I'll lose my job or struggle getting future jobs. I'm worried that my safety may be at risk when the sex offenders I currently work with are released from my facility. I'm worried that, even if material isn't out there now, I have no control over whether it might be in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to approach this issue at work and ask whether people know, without accidentally telling colleagues who have no idea. I don't know whether I should just give up this career path now. I've looked at my company's staff policy and nothing useful is in there.

491,"Hey Advice, 

I recently decided to check out this one ad that kept popping up on my Reddit feed for a car loan place. It's called Canada Drives and when I clicked on the ad it asked for some basic info that I provided such as phone number, email address, mailing address and name. 

The next day after a chat with my boyfriend I decided to change my mind about getting a car at all due to financial reasons. 

Ever since I gave them my information I have been receiving 3+ calls a day and 2 emails per day. I work full days every day so I can never answer and the emails are telling me that I need to answer a few more quesrions and ask when the best time to call is.

I emailed them after a few days of them persistently trying to contact me and told them I no longer wished to proceed with whatever application I had started (I didn't know I was doing an application but that's what all the emails say) and not to contact me anymore. 

Today I got another string of back to back phone calls that I chose to ignore and checked my email to see that they told me I couldn't cancel my application without answering more questions.

And no, I dont go home with strangers, but I can give you my number, and we can get to know each other because you seem cool."" He texted me the next day, and we texted here and there, but one night we had a serious discussion about family issues. After a week of chatting and having a connection through our family problems, we ended up texting consistently through the day, into the night. After two weeks, I decided that I would go hang out with him. We spent 4 hours watching low budget movies and dumb tv shows at his house and getting to know each other even more. We ended up sleeping together. I was worried he was playing the long game to have sex, but the next day we texted all day again. He invited me back over that night and we had sex again as soon as I got there, but after we cuddled and chatted like we had been friends for a while. He clearly was comfortable around me, and I was with him. Then, yesterday, he asked me out on a date to a restaurant that he goes to frequently with his coworkers, and I said yes. Afterwards, we went to a bar and played pool and had some drinks. When we got tired of playing pool, we just sat and drank and talked about some more deep things. Stayed until last call, and then left to go back to his house where my car was. We had sex again, and had another deep conversation when it was over. 

Normally, I would think this was just a great relationship blossoming, but he and his ex girlfriend broke up a month ago and they dated for 6 years. My friends and I have different opinions on how we've treated rebounds in the past, and I dont think he's treating me like I'm a rebound. My friends say differently. He's not really obsessed with his ex, and he said they had a mutual break up.

Let me back this question with a brief story....

Two friends are from a country that is currently going through a civil war, they met in Europe after 3 years since they left home after they have fled their country, for 3 years they tried to survive their stay in different countries but unfortunately that didn't work out as planned, after almost 8 years of experience and 4,5 years in Europe, life started to make some Sense.

Those two friends just found out that most of the people they know including themselves are going through tough times, and it's definitely not helping them going further in life. Suddenly and all at once it felt like nothing is possible anymore, it is challenging especially since the mental health ""game"" isn't at it's best. They think it's coming from the life path they went through ...... but they can't overcome this state of mind

Do you have other explanation or let's say a solution for this problem ?

While I have good friends and lots of family (and I come into contact with plenty of people most days, much to my introverted dismay), I’ve never been in a relationship or had anyone interested in me before, and it’s made me feel unloved and lonely.

I’m aware it’s dumb, but I can’t really help it. 

Generally I’m pretty sure that guys aren’t interested in me because 1) I’m way less pretty than all of my gorgeous friends, and most people in general
2) when someone does talk to me I’m super awkward, even if I know them. I never really know what to say and I probably come across as really nervous when I talk to people :,)

Now fast forward to 18 year old present me. I went to a clinic and the people there said it was too thin and that if they prescribed me the cream it could cause tears in my foreskin, so they sent me to a urologist. The urologist wasn't helpful at all and just told me to get circumcised and is redirecting me to go somewhere else. The thing is, I'm trying to avoid the circumcision route so that I don't lose the nerves in my skin and have that layer of protection.
So I'm not sure what to do. Is there still anything I can do to stretch out the skin or anything I should tell the urologist that I'm being redirected to?",07Nov2018,1
521,"(Sorry for the novel, scroll down for the TLDR) 

I’m looking for some advice on a few things (obviously). I’m a college student in my third year but I’ve admittedly been slacking, and have horrible study habits that have limited me to a 1.8 GPA/behind credit-wise. I’m sinking again this semester due to some unfortunate circumstances in my personal life. I’m already on academic probation and don’t want to get kicked out of school. I have the ability to do the coursework with ease, but I rarely have the motivation to show up to classes or do extra work. I know that falls on me solely.

I feel like I’ve been stuck for a few years taking general education classes that have been the same thing over and over since I was 15. I realize that I just have to suck it up and do it, but I get so bored and frustrated taking these redundant courses. I actually perform better in the harder classes because I love a challenge. I’m really wondering how to ACTUALLY break poor study/partying habits and turn the ship around.

I work about ~25-30 hours a week serving at a restaurant in addition to a 14 credit hour schedule and often have left school in the back seat. 

My main goal was to get into the nursing field with aspirations of becoming a Nurse Practicioner, but recently I’ve been wanting to get into the medical marijuana field, as I am a marijuana enthusiast and feel that I can not only help people, but work with something I’m passionate about. Should I stay the course with Nursing, or should I try to switch my major to Biology or something and strive for the medical cannabis field? I know that market will be extremely saturated in years to come.

TL;DR- Need advice/motivation on how to succeed better in college, break poor habits. Also, should I stick with Nursing or try to switch my major and get into the Medical Cannabis field?",07Nov2018,1
522,"26F I have about $18k in debt right now. Most from college loans that went into default (for reasons that involved my horrible family, but that’s not really important here) and the others are medical bills, debt from a credit card and another from a personal loan. 

I have epilepsy and it got horrible last year and the year before so I was out of work for months at a time and had medical bills piling up from all the specialists and er visits. I had to make serving my full time job so I could have more flexibility in case I needed time off for any seizure emergencies and for my tongue to heal so I could talk again. I haven’t been able to make a good amount of money since and can’t afford to go back to school until my default loans are in better shape.

I was an idiot and took out a small payday loan recently (which is just about paid off now) because I had no other option and have spent all savings on bills and catching up. 

I’m not sure what to do. I won’t qualify for any decent loans and I don’t want just a temporary fix. I know this is probably an easy fix for a lot of you but I just feel helpless. ",07Nov2018,1

525,"For the past few years I have been called gay by many kids. I do not know why they believe I am gay. It started back on sixth grade when a rumor went around by a couple of guys that I was gay. I was mad because for most of the year I did not have much friends. Except for a few people. Most of the time I let it go or ignore them, like the videos and teachers said, but that made things worse. Sometimes I would go to my sixth grade guidance counselor and say who it was. Nothing happened to those kids who called me gay and the ones that she did would know that I snitched on them. After a few times I stopped going to the guidance office and kids kept on calling me gay.

Seventh grade rolled around and I was already miserable because more people questioned if I was gay. Soon I started to question myself, but I came to the conclusion that I liked girls. So I thought of ways to overcome this. I changed my clothes, personality, sports, style, and friends(worst decision ever). After I changed myself, I tried going back but couldn’t. After that I was accepted by many people again. Kids who bullied me started to like me and I was happy, but I lost many things in the process including my friends. In seventh grade I was called gay a lot less but I was still being called gay. 

Eighth grade came and I got sat by one of my old friends in one of my classes. We became friends again, but right when we became friends more people called me gay. I did not know what to do and I panicked. I tried to make friends with guys but most of them did not like me because they thought I was gay, so I had a lot more friends that are girls than guys. I tried to be funny, nice, and friendly to everyone because I needed more friends. I did not go to anyone for help because I knew they were going to say the same bs that they usually say and I was to afraid to tell my parents because they might think that I am gay or feel like they would ask too many questions. So once again I changed my style, friends, and personality. By the end of the year I had a less amount of friends and more  kids that I just talk to in school.

Ninth grade came around I was super thankful because half of the students that went to my middle school go to a different high school. I truly thought that I had hope for a great high school year. Some of the kids that started the rumor still go to my school and most of my friends went to the other school. I did not know what to do or who to be. It was really bad that I started to question myself as to why am I here. I met some new friends and my best friend. Then halfway through the year more people are starting to call me gay. I was super mad and just ignored it. Most days I can home feeling more depressed then the last. My mom would ask me how was my day and I would just tell her “good” or “fine,” but I would never tell her that I think I am falling into a depression. It became so bad that when I think of middle school I just think of the bad stuff. Now don’t get me wrong there were a lot of good things from middle school, but most of that is overshadowed by the fear and sadness that I had. The word gay was being  used more in people’s sentences and my friends started to use them around me. Some of them even say that I am gay, but they are still my friends because everyone out of the 500 other kids think the same thing. 

Tenth grade, which is this year, is now here and what are the odds that people still think I am gay. My parents are wondering me why I don’t handle out with many of my friends and I do not say a thing because I don’t want them to know about me not having many friends because kids think I’m gay. Just this school year I have been called gay 40-50 times and we are not even halfway through the year. I am just sick and tired of people calling me gay. What made me start writing this is because just today someone called me gay for just talking to them, responding to them like a human being. I have no clue what to do. This has affected my grades, friends, personality, clothes, and many more. I’m just done with this I want to move schools be home schooled or something. I tried changing many things about me, but none seem to work. I decided to make a reddit account and write this to get advice from you guys. What should I do?

526,"Okay. When I was 18 I was really immature and completely unresponsible. I did anything as long as it meant I had fun and didn’t care about the consequences. I applied and got accepted for 2 credit cards both with a £500 limit. I blew the lot on partying and meals and just having fun. The minimum payment was £5 a month I thought yeah that’s fine. So me being the irresponsible 18 year old I was anyway I I went over on my credit limit on both cards now I cannot pay £5 minimum payment and they’re expecting a few hundred which I just don’t have. If I could go back and beat myself up oh boy I sure would. 

Now I’m 20 and I’m nothing like how I used to be and I want to get my life together and be happy. I make terrible money on the job that I’m doing now. When I say terrible I mean terrible like £3 an hour. Through the government. I’ve applied for more jobs just waiting to hear back. My tactic was to get another credit card which I have applied for and been accepted and pay off what I owe already but stick to the limit and pay back the minimum payment on the new credit card until I get myself on my feet.

528,"So a couple years ago I moved back to the village I grew up in and was reunited with old friends, including a couple, Jane and Zac, who I've known for a while. Not long after I moved back they asked me to dogsit while they went on holiday for a fortnight. As my family have always had dogs growing up I guess they felt comfortable leaving them in my care, and I said yes as I wanted to help them out.


They have two dogs - a Labrador, quite old but still very boisterous, and a Jack Russell cross, a rescue dog, fairly low maintenance but unpredictable. They asked me to move into their place, about 5 minutes away from where I'm living, and to take care of them. As mentioned I've grown up with dogs and would consider myself a dog person, but I really struggled with this situation for several reasons;


To put it bluntly, their house was disgusting. I've always known they're laid back people but never realised the extent of their lack of hygiene. As I was going to be living there, eating, cooking etc. I had to spend an afternoon clearing out their fridge of expired items (some 6-9 months out of date), unidentifiable items in tuppawares and foil, some looking like old mouldy meat, and trying to clean their kitchen. Even after doing this it seemed like it wasn't really clean, as if it hadn't been cleaned properly for months or even a year or so. They are hoarders so there's stuff everywhere which must make it difficult to clean properly. 


I'm not like a neat-freak or anything, I'll often leave clothes and books lying around if I'm in a busy period of my life but I always try and keep kitchen areas pretty clean just for pure hygiene reasons. Aside from the kitchen the floors were pretty messy, so much stuff on every surface, they had left laundry on the line and wet laundry in the machine...basically the place wasn't liveable until it had had a good once over of cleaning. In my eyes I was helping them out by moving in, looking after dogs etc - the least they could do was have a clean, welcoming house for me to come to (They did offer me to help myself to food but pretty sure anything in the fridge would have killed me lol).


Also, sleeping there was a nightmare for me - I'm a really light sleeper and struggle to sleep with light or noise around. They let the dogs have complete run of the house (especially the little Jack Russell is allowed to do whatever really) including sleeping in their bedroom with them. I completely get that lots of people do this with their dogs and totally respect that - for me though I struggle to sleep with animals in the room shuffling around so would shut them out of the bedroom at night. The dogs both have two or three different baskets and rugs elsewhere in the house but the whole night the Labrador (who is very needy) would sit outside the door sighing and whining and I would have to keep getting up and sending him back downstairs. Consequently I didn't sleep much which really got me down over this period.


Now when I say the dogs have the run of the house, it extends to them being the complete centre of my friends' attention - again, I understand that a lot of people are like this with their pets. As I said we have always had dogs but they have been working dogs so have had quite clear boundaries. Anyway my friends spend most nights in with the dogs and expected me to do the same whenever possible. This was difficult as I'm quite a busy person so did have to rush around a bit to see friends but then be back to give the dogs enough attention before going to bed etc. But also on the nights I did stay in with them, it was just not enjoyable at all. The jack Russell was fine and is quite self-sufficient and not bothered by people at all, but the Labrador is needy to the extreme. I love dogs and love playing with them and having a cuddle with them etc but this one would not be left alone even for a second. He would be on the sofa, clambering on top of you 24/7, if you tried to go on your phone or read a book he literally headbutts it out of your hand - again I get that some people find this cute and want this amount of affection from their pets but after a while I just got tired of it! When I was eating or some nights after he'd been too full on I would try and make him lie in his basket instead, but I would have to literally tell him every two minutes to go to his bed as he would keep trying to creep back. And in the background I was just feeling super guilty about it too thinking, I bet they miss Jane and Zac because they give them way more attention than I am!


They get three walks a day, morning, quick one at lunch, and longer one in the afternoon / evening. The Labrador is fine and loves going out but the Jack Russell is just generally a bit unpredictable and will sometimes just stop walking, which then means you have to carry it. It also has big problems with certain other dogs, in that it can be majorly aggressive out of nowhere to the point that it has had scraps causing multiple other dogs to get stitches. Having responsibility for that is obviously quite stressful- we've always had very laid back spaniels so I literally wouldn't know how to separate a dog fight. 


Anyway we got through all this and my friends got back and were v grateful. I left their house way cleaner than they had left it (mostly because it's the polite thing to do) and Zac did comment on that. They paid me, which I wasn't expecting but did accept with thanks, and I silently promised myself 'never again!'. 


Cut to a month ago where they corner me after a meal with other friends and ask if I can look after dogs again. I'm caught off guard and end up saying I can but I don't want to stay over, I'll just drop by and do the walks. I tell them it's because it disrupts my sleep too much (true) and messes with my general routine (which it totally does).


It's for 10 days this time and as much as it's not ideal I give myself a pep talk and just get on with it. I recruit another friend to take on the evening walks and try to limit the disruption caused to my day to day. I have some low level anxiety and depression issues which I try to keep at bay with various aspects of life e.g. workouts, eating well and prepping healthy meals, meditation etc. But find that when I'm dogsitting that takes priority and everything else kind of slides, leaving me feeling much less well.


And as much as it helps not staying over, I feel super guilty leaving them in the house every night as I know they're used to having people around them all the time.


I want to be a generous person and to do favours for people, but even when trying to make this work better for me it's still a bit too much for me to take on. I know that it would be the right thing to do to just let my friends know that I don't feel I can do it anymore, but I don't want them to be stuck for someone to help out. They are also quite judgemental people - they regularly make negative comments about people we know / mutual friends especially if people act in a way they don't like or agree with. I am worried that if I stop helping them out they will say unkind things about me to our other friends (I know I shouldn't care about this but it does bother me).


I feel like the dogs need someone who can be there on site and be with them more than what I can offer, and at the same time I know that I need to put my wellbeing first. I also know that I will feel guilty if I stop helping out, even though I think I am a generous person in other ways - I run a weekly circuits class for people for free, and am going to start teaching people in the community how to use eBay also for free. I always lend my friends money if they need it but I also know that for the sake of my mental health I need to have boundaries. I know there are probably some bigger self-esteem issues at play here in terms of how people perceive me and having to please people / do stuff for others and putting myself last all the time, which I am trying to work on! 


Tl;dr: is shedding this dogsitting obligation for my friends the right thing to do, do they have the right to be offended if I do so, and should I feel guilty about it?",07Nov2018,1

They also are expecting me to invite people whom i don't even know. They are also tying to make decisions like food etc.  While my fiancee wants us all to be a family.

Sometimes it takes so long that I end up spending all of it before I even get it (by borrowing money or using my credit card etc).  


It's frustrating because I never get to actually spend money on what I want (like investments, new equipment and just saving).   


I suppose the best thing is to keep working, even when a paycheck is coming but sometimes I just get roped into waiting weeks (sometimes months) to get a payment from someone.   


It's super discouraging and hard to maintain motivation especially when people look at me as successful and I often don't have two dimes to rub together because people can't get their shit together.   


MEANWHILE... you see those same people spend money on lots of other senseless pointless shit.   


Not to mention, I end up looking like a dishonest person. When my bills come up and I say, ""oh my paycheck is on the way tomorrow"" and then the person decides to take 2 or 3 weeks to get back to me.   


What am I supposed to do? Just let me bills pile up? Just stay home? Not eat?   


I guess the only real option is to continue working even if I'm waiting for a check, but how am I supposed to do ANYTHING without money?

Not long ago, my dad contacted me to tell me the office he works at is shutting down and disbanding his job title. It's a fairly large cell phone company, and he's worked there over twenty years, but they do lay off a fair number of people. 
The thing is, he sent me a rather emotional message about it, along with my birthdate, asking me to confirm it. Then asked me to confirm my social security number so he could go break down and cry somewhere private. He says that he needs this info to correctly complete his exit interview, as I am listed as a dependant, but there are a few red flags here, correct?

550,"TL;DR at the bottom

&amp;#x200B;

To begin,

My mother and I have always had an okay relationship. Like most families we've had ups and downs, but today she found my stash of weed. 

For some backstory, my aunts and uncles on her side of the family are all drunks and drug addicts. Both of my parents are sober for the most part, other than the occasional glass of wine with dinner, they don't do anything. 

I'm also Canadian (my country very recently legalized recreational marijuana). However I'm still a year behind the legal smoking age. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my mother, having seen her brothers and sisters fall down a staircase of addiction and  pain, always tried to drive me away from these substances and generally just make them seem like evil things.

&amp;#x200B;

Not the healthiest way to teach your child.

&amp;#x200B;

But curiosity led me to pot a few years ago and now I smoke often but not daily. I taught myself restraint and how to use it responsibly, having seen my relatives struggling all my life scared me off of becoming addicted to drugs. 

&amp;#x200B;

This morning she found the last of my stash in my room, barely a gram worth of weed and she ranted in our family group chat about how I'm going to become like my relatives.

I've done my best trying to speak with her but she refuses and now claims she's going to drink herself to death like her siblings. Saying she's failed as a mother and parent, instead of talking it out with me.

&amp;#x200B;

The only reason I need advice is because I don't know how I should feel, I spoke with my dad and he says as long as I'm responsible and smart I should be okay. I don't feel like any of this is necessary. I don't want to be the reason my own mother buries herself in liquor.

553,"A little backstory, I live with a couple that have been going through relationship problems. The chick left two months ago for a month, meaning myself and her boyfriend split her portion of rent.

She came back for a month and wavered on whether or not she was leaving again, then when she decided she was it was less that 30 days before the next rent was due.

She says she gave us notice, which probably means she told the boyfriend but didn't tell me, and neither did he. So, a couple weeks before rent was due she told me I'd be paying an extra hundred bucks for her portion of prorated rent.

I'm on the lease, but we got into an argument on Friday before rent was due and I left the apartment for the weekend because I can't handle her crazy anymore.

She had been helping me with my dog since I work and wasn't sure what my schedule was going to be at my new job. I finally got my bosses to approve a 2hr break between shifts to go take care of my dog, but before that I asked the boyfriend to help since his girlfriend was moving. To my face he said it was no big deal. That same night the girlfriend started blowing up my phone saying her boyfriend really didn't want to help me out. Which is fine, I just wish he'd have told ME that.

She sent me pages and pages of berating texts on my way home from work, wouldn't stop when I asked her to cool it until I got home, and then I just held my tongue and didn't respond. I hate arguing through text. She got personal, talking about me and my dog, suggested I rehome my dog ""since I obviously don't know how to take care of her"", said none of our mutual friends like me, the whole nine yards.

THEN after I wasn't responding she told me that maybe I should just leave, if I'm ""going to be so childish about this"". So I started looking. I've found a couple places that might be willing to let me move in on the 20th. 

However, she and the boyfriend want me to pay them 92 dollars that they're saying is my portion of what she would have been paying that I didn't have for them when this rent came through (new job, small first paycheck. And I really wasn't prepared for her to drop leaving on us so soon, but I paid my third of the rent and my portion of utilities), and the next power bill making it $112 I'd owe them on the 20th, before I move out.

Since I'm looking at not being here after the 20th or 21st of November, part of me wants to tell them to go fuck themselves since they had the audacity to tell me I should just leave. I know since I'm on the lease that's an empty threat, they'd have to evict me.

They already talked to the landlord to tell him I was leaving. I've tried to get in touch with him, I'm eagerly awaiting a response.

I don't feel I should pay that $112 since I'm not going to be here for almost 2 weeks of November. I feel it's the boyfriend's responsibility to pay her portion since she's his girlfriend, not mine. AND since they told me I should just leave.

My dog is a puppy so she's a little excitable. She's a pit mix so she's strong, I have worked with her on not pulling when we walk. She doesn't chew things up, pee or poop in the house, and is really just a friendly sweetheart. She doesn't mess with their cat too much, and certainly isn't aggressive towards it. The cat beats her up most of the time.

Am I being petty or do I have a real leg to stand on? I won't have the money until the 20th anyway, and if I have to pay it I will... But I'd really rather not, since they're being so vile about the situation. Also, I've been paying our renter's insurance on the apartment, for about 6 months. That's about $120 value, right there.

When i was about 12/13, I was visiting my biological family and I slept over my birth mother's house. Me, my half sister and my half brother (lets call him Chris) were all sleeping in the same room. I have trouble falling asleep because I have insomnia but I think I was asleep until he came up to me. He whispered in my ear ""goodnight i love you"" or something like this, which woke me up, but I still pretended to be asleep and then he tongue-kissed me. I just pretended to be asleep and rolled over.

The next day I was texting him (I forget exactly what was said) but I know that I was trying to get him to talk about the incident because it was confusing and I also wanted him to fess up, but he basically told me ""wtf your weird I don't know what your talking about"" which made me even more confused. I never told anybody.

Fast forward to now, I'm 21 and I never told anybody besides my boyfriend and my other biological sibling (MTF), lets all her Louise. Louise heard and she was FURIOUS. she said that he also did things to my half sister, but he didn't say what, and said Chris got expelled from his high school due to rape allegations.

I talked to my half sister and she said, on several occasions he tongue kissed her and tried to hump her when he thought she was sleeping. When she was older, another incident occurred with the same stuff and he also tried to take her clothes off.

I'm just so mad because Chris did this to both of us and now he has a wife and a son. 

1. Do I have a right to be upset? It could have been worse, that's what I keep telling myself.
2. How do I get over the guilt and shame of not telling anyone?

I think two years ago I went to Amsterdam with my two friends, one ever since we was little I’ll just call him Colin, and other one since secondary school I’ll call her Lily. Amsterdam was great until in McDonald, when there was tense between Lily and Colin because Colin was tired and want to stop but Lily told him that he being grumpy and ruining the holiday and that really annoyed Colin. The fight explode and Lily start ignoring Colin and pretending he didn’t exist. Colin was furious and left the building. I went outside and help him cool down. Then we was about to go back to hotel, and I stop Lily and pull her aside try to talk about the problem but she ignored me and walk off. I got furious and pull her to look at me and tell her she need to cut it out. She told me to my face that I shouldn’t get involved and it had nothing to do with me. 

I was upset on the way to hotel. Lily had goes on telling her ex boyfriend that she want to go home and talking about me (according to Colin) blah blah through the FaceTime. Later that day, thing had cool down between them two but I felt as I been smack in the face and start to realise who Lily really is. I’m not sure about Colin tho. Lily and Colin had make it up and apologise to each other but I just can’t forget it. I realised how toxic Lily really is. 

Fast forward to years, I had limited my contact with her and if I happen to be hanging around with group she is in (mostly because Colin still talk to her) I stay respectful and be polite because I knew she had shitty life in past (not as that was excuse for her behaviour but I’m not going to be bitch either) and she have the “I have not see you in long time” attitude. I have start to notice from there that Lily hardly contact me through social media (she lived far away) 

And just today I decided to delete her Facebook because I stopped giving damn about her ages ago and didn’t know why I still had her Facebook after all of the endless problems I seen on her page. I also deleted other toxic people off my Facebook too. Few hours later, my best friend Colin FaceTime me telling me that Lily ASKED him why I deleted her off facebook?! She got my Snapchat and phone number, why couldn’t she ask me directly. He explained that Lily had been looking through Facebook system of who deleted her etc.

Just to add that Lily didn’t exactly had great life in past and I completely understand what that can do to person. But at the same time I felt that her behaviour is way too childish and she criticised people and judging them but then got the hump that someone judged her. And also she always seem to be in middle of drama all the times that I think is ridiculous that she could had simply walked away from it. Maybe there something more to it that I don’t know about but that how I see it. And also I and Colin are not first people she does that to and I listened to other people she does it to too. It sound similar to our holiday gone wrong story. 

I just want to hear someone else perspective about this and advice. I really want to just cut her out of my life and move on but she find other way to get in. I hope she could be able to see how her action affect people one day and learn from it.

How beautiful it was! First time it was when I was 12. There was a girl that used the phrase ""I'll lick your balls right now"" In order to get something from boys. And once she did it. Shit, it was awesome to see it. Myself, never got my balls busted. Asked my gfs to do it - no. Ahh... 

Every time I see a boy-girl conflict, I want it to end up in busted balls. Every ponytail girl, I imagine how she busts my balls!! I don't know what would my reaction look like when I'll see a girl with ponytail kneeing a boy's balls. 

Am I normal? What would you suggest? I'm really shy, can't say I'll be able to just ""go and talk to her"".. What should I do? Go see a doctor? Get some beer to become brave and tall to a girl I like? Just cant keep it inside anymore",07Nov2018,1
572,"I am a 24 year old guy living with my parents. I work full time as a sales rep at a cellphone store. Make about $1500/month. I have social anxiety and depression. I used to be motivated and outgoing back in high school. When I graduated, I went to college for a year and dropped out. It was too overwhelming for me.

I enjoy my job, like working with the public, and like the majority of my coworkers. I feel like I’m not getting anywhere though. I make almost a dollar above minimum wage. I’m 23 and still living with my parents. I’ve been trying to get full time hours but my manager just can’t give me that many hours right now. My parents are trying to buy a new home and can hardly afford it. I feel bad that I am unable to help them.

I’m just not sure what to do and need some advice.",07Nov2018,1
575,"So a couple things to give background; I'm 21, and one of my brothers is turning 16 soon. I have 5 younger brothers, and I am the oldest and only (trans) girl. I have parents that have been married for 22 years, and come from a financially struggling background. I'm currently in my 4th year of college. Parents and I have rough relationship. 

Parents: Mom and Dad. 

Dad: He's very toxic man, who has spent the last 25 years working in the same blue collar industry. He has no college education, and was abusive to me and one other brother growing up. Awful with money. 

Mother: Has autism, she is extremely intelligent, with a degree in mechanical engineering. Has been a stay at home mom for 20 years. Is great help with academics, but terrible with emotional advice. Has an emotionally abusive mother that lives across the street. 

Brothers of importance:

N: 18 years old. First year of college, is extremely smart and is sick of family. Tries to avoid family stuff. 

M: The 15 year old in question. Is racist, homophobic, and overall extremely edgy. Spends 50+ hours a week playing video games and on discord. Mother did his homework in highschool so he could graduate early; attempted a semester of college and just dropped out. Mom put $1,100 in his bank account for a signing bonus. 


Here's the story and part I need advice on. Recently I found out that my brother, M, has been skipping all of his classes to visit an online girlfriend he met on discord, and has been using an uber to do so. He scammed Uber out of $285 by claiming to the card company that the purchases were ""fraudulent"" and not made by him. He recently had an incident where he packed up all his stuff from his dorm and left college. My brother, N, was left behind notes and immediately informed my parents. Finding M was easy, as he stayed at the gf's house. But he was not known to be there by gf's parents. So he surrendered and my mom picked him up and came home. 

I just found out about this and confronted my parents. I did go on a rant and say some hurtful things to them, but other than that I've done nothing but try and tell them they aren't helping. My dad is ignoring the fact that any of this behaviour is bad, saying that he did similar stuff when he was a kid. My mother is just all about how she's glad he's okay blah blah blah. 

My parents don't seem to understand the severity of this situation, and won't give my brother professional help or any help at all. He's obviously troubled, and claims that he's ""a fuckup"". They pretty much feed his behaviour, and don't care to help him beyond academics. How on earth can I get thru to them or even directly help my brother?",07Nov2018,1
576,"Throw away because it's sort of work related.  

I'm a private in home caregiver and my client also has a cleaning lady that is around at least one day a week.  We are friendly to each other and talk a good amount while she is here.  I've always thought she was flirting a little but it wasn't obvious enough for me to be able to tell.

Well last week she stayed late to vacuum but looking at the carpet I could tell she had already done it.  I just thought maybe it was done everywhere besides the bedroom she was vacuuming, I'm not entirely sure.  That wasn't the weird part.  The weird part is the bedroom she was cleaning has a bathroom attached and when I got up from the living room to go to the kitchen I could see her with her pants down, plain as day, sitting on the toilet.  

There are two different doors she could have closed (the bedroom door and/or the bathroom door).  It is a **very** obvious straight shot of vision, there is **no** possible way you could go unseen on that toilet.  I don't think she saw me so no harm no foul. It was odd but hey, accidents and emergencies happen, who am I to judge right?  I honestly didn't think she was flirting then and I assumed it wasn't on purpose.  

Fast forward a week later today and **she does it again** same situation almost entirely.  She stayed over just long enough to vacuum and let me catch her with her pants down.  I pretend I don't see and go sit back down.  She comes out a minute later smiling and while putting the vacuum away tells me all she wants to do is go home and take a shower.  On her way out the door she mentions she will be back tomorrow to say hi because she has another place in the building she cleans.

Last week after the first ""incident"" where I saw her she even complained about the construction workers outside on the building, saying they could see in through the windows too easily. 

Am I crazy to think she is coming on to me?  It sounds like the beginning to some weird porn now that I typed it all out.  

What do I do?  Do I even bring it up? I would really appreciate some female input here.  I don't know how to go about this no matter what the situation actually is.",07Nov2018,1
577,"I'm about to graduate from college in a couple months but I feel like I have no direction. I will have a degree in computer science, and I'm lucky enough and thankful to have a job lined up in my area of study. However, there are a lot of different fields within software, some which I am interested in, and some which I am not, and I'm almost completely certain the field this job is in falls into the latter category. Unfortunately, at this point, it's going to be difficult for me to find a different one, as I don't want to be disrespectful and renege on the company, and even if I did, there's no guarantee I could find something this late in the recruitment season.

I went through college not super passionate about CS, just hoping to barely pass my classes and get a standard job. Well, that's exactly what I got, and the thing that sucks is now I'm starting to find interest in many different fields of software- interest I never had before. It's kind of a curse that this is happening to me right as I've already got the ""next step"" planned, as I'm realizing there could be way different ""next steps"" that would be a lot more beneficial to my interests if I had given it more thought as an undergrad. 

Now I'm set to start down a career path in a sub-field of software that's not quite what I want to get myself into, but I lack credentials to easily switch to different options, like pursuing a masters or working for a ""better"" company, and on top of that I don't even know where I want my career to go long term. Mentally, I'm just a mess, and what I want to do changes every day. I just need some advice from people who may have been through similar when they graduated, whether in the software industry or not.

579,"My girlfriend of 5 years has been dealing with steadily worsening health issues ( chronic nausea and stomach issues + depression and anxiety) for about 3 years now. 2 weeks ago we had to move out of our apartment which we had lived in together for just over one year. We moved because of her declining health and because she had to quit her job so we couldn’t afford rent anymore. At this point she is living with her parents who have been an awful support system and have made her feel worse since arriving, is severely depressed, lives with anxiety pretty much 24/7 and has daily panic attacks and has no appetite and has lost an unhealthy amount of weight because she can’t get herself to eat. She smokes weed all day every day to try to cope and was prescribed Xanax which she  has nearly run out of now and she has to wait to see a new doctor until the end of the month since we moved away from her previous doctor. Doctors she has seen in the last haven’t taken things seriously enough and now that she can’t see a doctor for a while it has reached a crisis point.

I am currently 2 hours away working and won’t be back until Friday. She has spoken about suicide a few times when she is feeling at her worst and in the depths of a bad panic attack over the last few months. She says that if we take her to a hospital or a place that they hold her against her will she’ll freak out we’ll have actually made her want to kill herself. She doesn’t have an actual diagnosis from a doctor and has tried going to weekly therapy over the last few months but nothing has worked. She is also seeing a naturopath doctor who is trying to help her with natural remedies. She can no longer handle being at her parents house all day and night but has literally nowhere else to go. This trapped feeling she is having has me extremely worried about suicide. She can’t shake the feeling of anxiety and panic anymore and it’s really scary for her.

Has anyone been through a situation like this who can give me practical advice on what resources are available to use to get her the help she needs? She is currently refusing to consider hospitals and long term treatment facilities and I can’t find any outpatient care places where she doesn’t have to have been hospitalized to go. I know if she becomes actually suicidal we won’t have a choice but to send her to the hospital, but I’m trying to find an option that she feels comfortable with. 

I feel like her life is very literally in my hands and I’m trying to do all the right things to make sure she gets through this and can experience happiness again.

Hello Reddit. I'm wierd. Crazy.

The author is a man, 20, with a dark side. The fetishes.

Okay. First fetish: Ponytails. Yes, hair. When a long haired girl ties a ponytail it's fucking beautiful, I state at it. I specifically asked my gf to take photos with ponytail, asked her to go to study with ponytail. Just stair at it. From behind, front, side. To touch it, even accidentally. Watch as girl with shoulder-long ponytail moves, how her hair move with her. Even small move when she breathe! Love it. But not short hair-Ponytails, don't like them. Also not a big fan of curvy ones. Only straight.

584,"Hi so as of writing this am nearing the completion of YR11 in Australia. I begun the year picking the subjects that I liked the most and could have potential future opportunites. I've done alright and everything is fine, but midway through this year I finally realised what I want to aim towards (Piloting). I didn't take up physics at the beginning of the year but I did take up the required math and english. So next year I'll be picking up YR11 physics which will be enough to qualify me for what I need to do. Unfortunately YR11 physics is on the same line as one of my favourite classes. Meaning to do physics I have to drop this class. 

Not only will I be in a class with a grade below mine but I will miss out on the opportunities of the other class which I graduate with a CERT II in Outdoor Education. Which is handy. 

So I pose this question, is there a way I can study my physics online so I can keep my other class or is there another alternative all together, say for example study physics after completing YR12. All of this has to be down in australia, If its offline It has to be done somewhere within the ACT.

&amp;#x200B;

FYI I have never been taught physics beyond YR10 science, however I do enjoy the content based off what I've seen so I will be willing to put in the work.

587,"The feeling really came out of nowhere, developing spontaneously on some calm weekend and persisting for days (almost weeks) from there. It feels almost tingly, like someone hitting your funny bone over and over, and is accompanied by intense chest aches, near-constant shortness of breath, and a rapidly beating heart. I feel constantly nauseous, the slightest movement or smell able to send my throwing up into my mouth, and my stomach feels a constant flutter which causes me to have no appetite for food of any sort. It is sort of the feeling one gets when they are especially nervous or afraid, and yet far worse and without any targeted cause. I have not felt any particular fixation on a certain topic, nor do I have anxious thoughts -- it is instead something which simply exists in every waking hour, from the moment I awake to the moment I fall asleep. I am drained and unable to focus because of it, and struggle to put forward my best work at a time in the school year where focus and clarity of mind are paramount to face the growing mountains of November work.

595," Hi all,

I'm 25 M, full-time student (BSc in Marketing), I've been working for the last 2 years as Marketing Coordinator for a Creative Technology Agency (VR, AR, etc) avg. 30hrs a week. I've been working every summer since I was 12 and have had internships related to the Advertising industry since I was 17.

Next January I start my final year of college, in which I have to work on my thesis and several high-time demanding classes with complicated projects (complicated from what I've seen and heard from other students).

I was also contacted by a well known Ad Agency looking for someone to work as a Jr Brand Executive for 2 big accounts they have (sports drinks and a bank). They know I'm still a full-time student but are interested nonetheless. (I'm still in the interview process, having an interview-presentation next week, so not really having the job just yet.) Having previous experiences in Ad Agencies, I know its really stressful and high demanding job but advertising is the industry I've always aimed for.

In my current work we are a small agency created 2.5 years ago, we were having issues all the time but are doing really great now having just delivered 2 projects with big clients with a national impact but personally, I've been hating it due to some team members leaving, some of their workload falling on me and constant changes in the way we work. Thanks to one of these changes I have to answer directly to the CEO, whose idea of marketing is ""to get viral on social media"", and who keeps asking me for several changes in my strategy with near zero budget to work with. I've been approved to hire an intern and ease the workload I have but given we are near the end of the year and not many students are looking for internships, the candidates have been awful and I'd have to wait till January to get someone whom I would be happy with.

Personally, I've been having issues with my health due to stress (anxiety, weight gain, insomnia, bruxism while asleep, etc) due to my current load with classes and work. On income, have no debt, studies are paid and all basics are covered so money is not an issue but still a factor.

As I see it, I have 3 options:

First, quit my job, reject Ad agency if offered the job and focus on my last year of studies.

* Pros: Stress down, focus on my studies, free time to focus on other things.
* Cons: No alt income, no job experience.

Second, keep my job and keep studying.

* Pros: Flexible Job schedule, Alt income, job experience.
* Cons: Stress, low pay, big workload.

Third (depending if I'm offered the Ad agency job), take the job and keep studying.

* Pros: Job experience in the industry I like in a great agency, higher pay.
* Cons: More stress, high workload, have to be on call ready for clients.

Any advice, point of view or anything is welcomed.

Thanks in advance.",07Nov2018,1
