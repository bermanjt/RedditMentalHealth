0,"So basically I'm a black 16 year old male and has grown up and been raised by white parents in a white community (Im adopted btw.) anyway so my whole life I've been exposed to white culture but i kinda feel like something is missing, i mean I'm extremely grateful for the life I've lived and love my parents etc but a small part of me is unhappy that i was unable to live in a black community and live a black life and yes i am fully aware that the colour of your skin does not define who you are but i kinda feel like a missed out.
Idk does anyone else feel this way or understand. I just feel like its hard for me to live in a white community where I can't really relate to anyone else about my skin colour.",17May2018,2
1,"So let’s say that someone I live with drinks.  A lot.  They drink like three boxes of beer a day.  Well, I’m seventeen and usually I just have the mindset that I’ll be out of the house and then they can kill them self with alcohol if they wants to, but this is taking a toll on my mental well being as well as my diabetic father, because they are unable to help me take care of him.  I don’t know what to do at this point and I just need some advice.  Can anyone help?",17May2018,1
2,"I don't know what to do, any sort of hobby that I pick up that involves any sort of competitive aspect to it just ends up with me losing at it constantly over and over. And it's not just one thing, my entire day will be filled with losing at everything I do or try. Even simple things, like playing Overwatch, I just lost 6 games in a row. I figured, I should play something else, so then I played a mobile game called Pokemon Duel where I lost 5 games in a row. I went to go play volleyball in my weekly league, our team lost all 4 games today.

I just don't know, it's so frustrating because these are things I enjoy but I just constantly lose and lose. What's a good way to handle this?",17May2018,2
3,"I was diagnosed when I was about 10 or 11. I used to learn things from school pretty normally, like anyone else. Until junior high, when nothing made sense to me anymore. This was about the time that I had my first real music class. It all made so much sense. The music just clicked with me, in a way that algebra never could.

Sadly, this is also the time that the bullying got to the point that I was under constant watch to see if any little thing I did could be used against me. This is when I left my small town school and went to a junior high in the city, taking my broken musicality with me.

I didn't adapt very well. Everything overwhelmed me way too much, and I couldn't handle it. I begged my mom to bring me back to the small town school I used to go to, but she refused, every day. I eventually stopped asking her to enroll me back to what was familiar. Hell, but it was at least familiar.

I didn't understand math at all at this new school. Come to think of it, I never understood math. Not for one single second. And music doesn't count as math, at least not to me. Yes, there's numbers and counting involved, but it's not math.

Anyway, it wasn't until much later, about October of last year, in my junior year of high school, that someone told me that people just naturally understand things when they were kids. Like, actual go out in the world and figure stuff out. That absolutely blew my mind, because I never figured anything out, outside of school. So now my whole synthetic world is crashing down, because life, society, is built upon figuring things out on our own. And school was made to be built upon that, but what good is it when I never had that foundation in the first place?

I tried to look to google to help me with... well, anything, really. I found it pretty hard to find specific things to search, because ""how to do anything"" or ""how to learn"" aren't really good search results in google. Additionally, the only google search results pertaining to autism are about the families of those with autism. Like me just being me is enough to warrant them needing help? Like I certainly don't need help? Oh, your nephew is autistic? We'll do everything we can to help you. Oh, you're autistic and never learned anything naturally and you need help to function as a human being? get fucked.

I have nowhere to turn. I'm normal enough that everyone has a regular expectation of me, but I'm autistic enough that I can't achieve those goals, and I'm left to be the disappointment for the rest of time. The only thing that makes sense to me is music. It feels right. It feels natural. It's the only thing that I could ever have a glimpse of figuring out on my own.

I can't tell you how many nights have been spent with me sitting alone at my laptop, the page remaining white and my face streaked with tears of frustration, all because I can't figure out how to write a damn essay on Lord of the Flies without it being a simple plot synopsis.

I don't learn life lessons, either. I don't know how to learn from a thing I did. I don't know how to change what not to do for the future. Everything I do is a mistake, but I don't know how to critically think about it and find a moral, or what to learn from something. I couldn't even find a moral in the tortoise and the hare until someone flat out told me what it was.

I still don't even know the most basic of basic things about color. Why do two colors match? Nothing about any piece of clothing, besides the facts (red, long sleeves, for example) tells me if it looks good on a certain person or not. I guess my point with this, is that I never had any innate sensibilities. I've heard my fair share of ""oh, nobody does, sweetie"" in my life. And let me tell you, that's a bunch of bullshit. Even if it wasn't bullshit, everyone has at least the capability of figuring things out on their own. I've been so beyond lost that I didn't know what people just automatically knew things or figured them out by themselves until this last October.

I know I sound like an edgy teenager here, but I don't understand relationships at all. Even friendships most of the time. All of my friends are in relationships and that bums me out, so I try to meet girls (or guys idc) and say hi, ask them to coffee (someone had to tell me that's what you're supposed to do). But every single one turns around and never even says hi back. I love to be hugged and held, more than anything, and even my friends (a lot of them are girls, but that's not really important) shy away from hugging me if I say that I need a hug, or even extend my arms for one (Does extending arms mean something more than asking for a hug? someone told me it meant asking for a hug, and idk if it means more than that. Other people do it to their friends with no problems. It might just be me tbh). I don't know how they all got girlfriends or boyfriends, and one of those sounds really nice to me, but they still say that they actually suck 100% of the time and they tell me to not enter one (like it was my choice lol). This is the only thing that I'm skeptical on their word about. If relationships suck, why are they all in one? Why is everyone except me in one? If they suck so badly, then why are they even happening?

Someone, please, tell me what everything is, starting from the most basic principles about anything, especially the things that people just figure out as kids. I'm beyond desperate at this point.

***TL;DR: I'm autistic and I've never known a single damn thing about anything that wasn't explicitly taught to me in school or told to me flatly. I don't have an innate sense for anything (besides music), and I know for a fact that I missed out on a huge part of life because I can't figure things out on my own. What the hell do I do from here on out?***",17May2018,291
4,"Ok, situation is that I'm a video editor currently still living at home with my mother, I'm 20 years old and have recently lost a client that was my main money earner and also been told I need to move out by the end of the month by my mother due to an argument. I have been planning on moving out for a couple weeks now and have been looking for jobs relating to video editing in Cardiff. I have no formal education in video production and have been getting clients based on my portfolio. Had a couple responses back from companies I applied to and they declined me or the position had been filled already.

I worked in retail for a while but was seriously depressed in the role and video editing seems to be the only job I can keep doing and it makes me really happy working on projects.

My sister is super helpful and has said I can go live with her but that could only be for a few months as she is moving to London soon.

5,"I moved up from Louisiana about a year ago with 3 of my friends to Pennsylvania because I couldn't stand the south. Before I left I got a ticket I couldn't pay because I spent all my money planning to leave. I tried to dispute the false parts of the ticket but I couldn't make it to my court date because I had already scheduled my moving truck and move in date, and I couldn't afford to reschedule those. Long story short I have a warrant for my arrest in Louisiana. I tried to get them to take it off and put my on a payment plan but they refused to. I explained I couldn't get a job because of it to pay it off, and the city official didn't care. 

Eventually I found the only job I could get as a 20 year old relatively in shape guy is cam modelling. I started doing this job back in November to keep up with my part of bills. At the end of November my roommate I'll call Keith lost his job on purpose and lied about until I asked his boss what happened. He has been without a job for the past 7 months and I've been struggling to try to keep up with his part of the rent. We've been constantly late and closed to kicked out several times. He was my best friend since freshman year of high school but I just don't believe his shit about not being able to find any kind of job in 7 months. I've realized how lazy he is and despise him now. I can't stand being around him. He has no motivation or goals. 

Now I just add numbers all day trying to make rent. All I do is sleep and try to make money doing cam shows. I hardly have time for anything else and when I do, I just sit down and actually try to feel anything. It feels like I'm just always going through the motions. I can't stand things being like this. But my other roommates don't make much either. Just enough to cover things at the moment. 

I just don't know what to do. I've lost all self respect and I feel like a zombie. I feel so fake because of what I have to do to make money. I'm fake to everyone around me. I don't even really want to talk to them anymore. ",17May2018,1
8,"So my class is in an auditorium and there's tons of open seats. Normally she sits one seat away from me with no one else near us. But a few classes ago she switched seats and ever since she's been sitting right next to me. 

Now this wouldn't be a problem except that she's like a literal kpop model or something. She's literally the most attractive girl I've seen. It's been several classes and we've barely said a word to each other. I find myself getting distracted sometimes just staring at her from the corner of my eye. 

Why would she do this. What should I do. I normally never have anxiety when talking to people but she's the mental image of kpop models. I really want to ask her out or something but I feel like she might get hit on a lot and I don't want to be a creep.

For about 10 years now I have identified as lesbian. At a very young age, I was also taken advantage of by an older male. Due to this, I have a natural distrust of men.

While I have never experienced a crush before, I was always confident in my identity as a lesbian. Simply because I didn't trust guys.

...Until recently. One of my friends introduced me to his friend a few months back. We jokingly flirted, him knowing I was a lesbian, and then jokes spouting up about how my friend likes to go after women he can't get.

This was fine. I didn't mind this. I thought it was fun, I liked jokingly flirting with him.

...And then I met him face to face. Our mutual friend introduced us via a chat client. So when I met him face to face, I wasn't sure what I was expecting.

And what I got: a dreamboat of a guy, shoulders wide and stomach soft (just how i like it!!). Dreamy, deep brown eyes and..well, I..kinda felt like he was perfect.

And then a week ago us and our mutual friends all met up for a get together. Because we jokingly flirted, we were automatically very affectionate with each other. IE, hugs, hand-holding, and him grabbing my face and rubbing his beard scruff against my face.

And since then I have been faced with a dilemma: I. Have. a MAJOR crush on the dude. And I have no idea what to do!

He's also a serial flirt. He flirts with a LOT of women. So I think, in a way, I also use my confusion to do with my sexuality as a way to distance myself from him; avoiding any chance of getting hurt just in case.

But I can't help but want to get close to him. He has such a nice, soothing voice and he smells like comfort. He's so warm and good and nice and I...

am dubbed the world's worst lesbian.

I have no idea what to do anymore, I'm so confused and scared; I feel like I shouldn't chase him because...what if this is just the way he is? What if I throw away my identity only to have my heart broken?",17May2018,5

11,"I work a “cool” job in a creative field bringing in around $4750 (before taxes). It’s comfortable, secure and allows me to do what I want. The job itself used to be my dream job when I was applying for it but my perspective in the last five years has changed quite a bit. I dread going in and I can tell I don’t try as hard as I used to. I know I could do better (and make things that are more advanced) but it always leads to clients having more notes, being more nit picky and ultimately leading to more stress, complications and overtime. 


I’ve also had a side hobby making music. It’s really picked up since September and I’ve been fortunate enough to make decent money from it ($700 in October 2017 with an consistent growth every month. Last month came in at $4900(And I’ve only released 10% of my catalogue so far). At this point I have a team of 5 people working on the other aspects which includes developing the business end.


Do I leave the main job and focus on music instead? Do I ride out the main job until I am, for whatever reason, forced to pursue music? If I stay at my job what can I do to prevent myself from getting even more burnt out?",17May2018,1

I feel like a horrible person for even thinking such a thing, because I really like the crew and the thought of “betrayal” hurts whether they are responsible or betrayal I could think of such a thing when they haven't done such a thing.

Things aren’t adding up and the things that are stolen are the items that are gone are stuff that  doesn’ sit out everyday.

We pay them to come at the end of every month, so theft isn’t too noticeable in general with the fact that items missing don’t sit around.

I’ve only noticed 3 things I’m unable to find at the moment. I’m still looking for a wireless hmdi that I wanted to use today and they were like a 3 weeks or less.

The other two is money and a Mario Wii U game that 2 friends come over to play.

The two friends that come over come over rarely and the one day we wanted to continue playing we found out we had “two” Super Mario Bro Wii games. Open both the Wii U and the Wii retail box and both contained Super Mario Bro Wii disc.   [Picture of said games](https://imgur.com/a/hyJKVvu)

Said games belong in a door inside a furniture and I’ve seen said crew open both up to “clean the inside” so they would know what games there are.

It doesn't’ make sense, because we all have the sense to not let anyone borrow the game because we are not finished with it, but yet here we are. It still hasn’t been found and we are playing the Super Mario 3D world that my cousin let me borrow.

I’ve talked my roomie that hired the cleaning crew and even asked about her friends that use the cleaning service to notice anything missing. She and her work friends haven’t.

I’ve got little to no evidence on this and since put a lock on a door to put my belongings.

I’m not sure what to to and would like your guys input.

Love is meaningless for me now. They say it so much that I can’t even tell if they’re being genuine most of the time. I am not the best academically, and my parents absolutely hate that. They complain to me everyday about how i need to get my shit together if I don’t want to go to summer school, by they need to realize that grades don’t go from 70 to 100 overnight. My dad was telling me that I disappoint  my mother and I broke out in tears. He usually doesn’t get involved with this shit, but I guess he was in a pissy mood. My mother is a very gentle woman.

I've been going through a tough time financially and when time came to purchase my flight I bought a one way ticket initially and had to wait to purchase the ticket back \(using my next pay check\).

Fastforward to a few days ago, I finally purchased a ticket back however it's the day before I said I was going to which is a day before everyone else is leaving.

21,"So I've been offered my dream job completely out of the blue, while working a monotonous shitty factory job and I was so stunned by the proposal that I accepted it on the spot basically and when he asked me for the salary I had no idea what to say and I've drastically undershirt the salary for that type of jobs.

The job is basically leading a subsidiary in my home country (I work in Austria right now and they want to expand to my home country). I would be doing completely office and personnel management related work, working with potential personnel and helping them adapt to the job there. And I was so shocked by such an amazing job offer (coming from a factory job) I completely stopped thinking rationally and after he asked me how much I'd be willing to work for, I mentioned a price point I previously thought in life would be grand (when I was a student) and he offered me a hundred euros more which comes to a still  very low salary, one that is almost comparable to some entry level positions in say sales departments or product promotion. It's basically a few steps higher than minimum wage, and I was swayed by the thought that since I'll be working in my home country, I'll be glad to settle for something that people in my home country are satisfied with. 

I would also be living in an expensive city and recalculating my costs I wouldn't really be saving much each month, while here I was saving a heck of a ton more working a shitty factory job, whereas in this potential new job I'd have a ton more responsibilities, and I'd be using a lot of skills that I developed and taught myself in my lifetime  (marketing, design, translation between three different languages, working with people, getting a read on them,  motivating them, working with difficult personnel) and dumbass me was just so satisfied with finally getting paid for something I'd love doing that I basically settled for like a hundred euros more than my friend gets shilling Samsung phones. And he has like zero responsibilities. I've spoken to a family member who's a bit more knowledgeable about salaries in these areas and he said I was basically an idiot and I should ask for at least twice that, but I was so scared that I'd set a too high of a price and they would be disappointed by me asking too much (since I don't have any diploma, and I never actually worked in such a field, but I've worked with people a lot and I have the skills they need) 


This was all so sudden and we've spoken about it for the first time today, he said well meet many more times to flesh out the plan and everything and I'm going to have to mention it sooner rather than later, I'm just so ashamed about my mistake that I'm kinda stumped on how best to approach it.

22,"Lets cut to the chase: I’ve had my eye on a lady, lets call her Haley for a while now, but she has a boyfriend, eventually I meet this guy, John, which is her cousin (presumably, but he still does know a lot about her) and he’s considered one of the most powerful guys in the grade (9th). I became great friends with John and now I am becoming a bit skeptical. He’s had a history of being a excessive troublemaker who barely cares about others wellbeing. He appreciates me being around and considers me one of his greatest friends. But he’s been slipping up to the point where he’s slapping me and making jokes about Haley (telling others, bringing it up randomly), I don’t want to leave his group since they’re great guys and my only chance of staying above water in the grade. 

So I have a couple options-

Delete the messages between me and john from his phone and leave the group, so he has no proof but a whole group of guys on my back including Haleys current BF.

Tell him he isn’t the boss and risk him telling her or others in rage.

Have a convo with him and secretly delete the messages and play off a joke in the process so he has no proof but were still friends.

I currently have an administrative/customer service role with my employer. I expressed interest in an internal accounting position that would be available in June about two months ago. I have about 2 years of experience performing the same job description from a previous employer. 

After I expressed interest, our Controller promised she’d keep me updated on how the search for a candidate was progressing. Two weeks ago, I saw the posting internally and applied. Today she informed me that they were going to give the job to another employee who was only hired with our company 3 months ago. This employee has no professional experience, let alone in accounting. 

I was never interviewed, and frankly not even considered. When I asked for feedback about my application, resume, and cover letter she had nothing bad to say. This feels like a slap in the face, and almost as if it happened behind my back. Especially since HR was heavily involved in the consideration process, according to my HR Director. 

Should I have expected to be considered fairly, or is this something that happens regularly among professionals (and I should just let it go)?

Thanks for any and all advice! ",17May2018,1
34,I'm in highschool about to graduate. I feel like for a good chunk of this year ive been just coasting along. So my question is how do I make sure I get something out of a day. Like I would go to school and then come home and sleep. The same shit over and over again ever since I stopped doing sports. What is a good attitude to approach everyday life or something to keep in the back of your head when you're moving along?,17May2018,2

I've been told for years that the cost, per eye, was around $1,500 - $2,000 (so generally $4,000 total). I don't know if that included the other costs or how much those other costs would be.

I started a few months ago and i have a bachelor's degree in our very niche field. Ive made maybe one or two mistakes, ever, and contribute knowledge constantly. I know some things that the boss doesnt know (he's self taught) obviously i still have a lot to learn too but...

My boss talks about me like im starting from nothing. I just dont understand why he treats me--and pays me, like my degree is worthless compared to the other guy's years of experience (that he cant remember anyways cause hes always high)

i read somewhere that in the u.s. a 4 year degree is to be paid the same as if you had 3 years of experience. But i live in canada so idk if we have rules like that. It just really hurts when i know, and my boss knows, that i am the better employee. So why am i being paid so much less just because i have less experience?

40,"Well, the first 6 months of it went amazing, my grades were pretty good \(3.0 or so\) and I somehow managed to make a good amount of friends the first week, had a lot of fun and started dating this awesome girl. Then second semester about a month in she broke up with me and it got messy. We had met through being in the same friends group and most of our friends took her side and we stopped talking. 

In the space of like a week I went from enjoying life to hating it. The loneliness really got to me and I started smoking not to have fun but to get past the loneliness, I stopped going to class and I guess got really fucking sad, my grades suffered badly and I ended the semester with a 2.0 and now my parents are incredibly \(and rightfully I guess\) pissed.

Now I'm just looking at next year with no clue what to do, I've pissed away my shot at getting into a better school, I've got no real friends back at school, no real chance to get into the good school I wanted to, some pissed off parents, and nothing to look forward to.

42,"Backstory: My girlfriend texted me last week rolling me that she does not want children under any circumstances. We previously toyed with the idea of kids (I want them more than anything), and she came out and basically said kids would impede her career, and she wants the freedom to do what she wants when she wants.



Understandably, these are irreconcilable differences, so (despite not wanting to because she's amazing) I suggested we break up. She then called me later that day sounding like she had been crying and saying ""it would be hard, but I am willing to have children. It won't be the perfect suburban life, but we can do it. I want to start a family with you and it'll be really hard but I think it will be worth it."" 


I can't shake the feeling she's only saying these things to get back with me. I don't think this will be healthy for the kids, since it seems like she wants to compromise, not actually have the kids.

I told her that I didn't want to make no a rash decision about this over the phone and would talk to her tomorrow. I love her so much, but I want the best life for my kids.  What should I do? ",17May2018,1
43,"My husband and I are moving to a new apartment complex next month. The place is great! Brand new, super modern, still in construction progress for some of the buildings as well. Silly us, we just assumed that given the location (close proximity to a very busy part of town) and the fact that we’ve never seen a place around here that isn’t fenced in and/or gated, that it was just something that would be coming at a later point in the construction process. But we ended up asking and lo and behold, there’s presently no fencing plans. 

I know, stupid us for not asking before it was basically a done deal, and I know what happens when you assume. It just seems absurd that such a nice place in such a busy part of town wouldn’t have the intention of fencing in their complex. Our local police department has a mapping system that maps most of the crimes that occur in the city, and it seems like some of the places that are around the new place have had a number of burglaries and car break ins since November (as far back as the mapping program goes). 

Bottom line, how can we go about trying to help convince the complex to figure out a fencing plan? I know it’s a bit of a reach considering we’re just two people, but I guess I’m just hoping other residents might try to push for a fence too. Moving into a first floor has probably convinced me a bit more to try to pursue a fence as well. Lol.

44,"Hey,

I'm a rising college senior and lately I'm starting to feel like I'm in line to get fucked. I still have roughly a year to get my life together, but time is running out, so I need to make a move.

Background: Started out in business school and later transferred
Majors: Econ and philosophy, minor in business
School: Relatively prestigious top 20 school in the US 
Strengths: 
Good writing skills
Decent extracurriculars (started a club and have some leadership in business/economics groups)
Policy knowledge (took IR, worked on a campaign, led political discussions for a few years)
A few internships (economics, business research)
Creative strategist/thinker
Artistic edge (some photography skill, did fashion blogging, led a philosophy group)
Good at bullshitting (engaging conversationalist, wide array of ""culture capital"" ex. knowledge of fine art &amp; philosophy, decent style/fashion taste) 
Weaknesses:
Had a huge depressive breakdown early in college which was public and kinda screwed up my trajectory 
Relatively shitty grades because I was embarrassed about said breakdown and didn't go to class for awhile
Honor code violation bc for awhile I just didn't give a shit about anything

Dreams:
All over the place...I started out wanting to go into high finance but after the episode I gave up that dream because I didn't think I could survive in such a judgmental/impersonal environment
Thought about law school but then I got an honor code violation so yeah, fuck
Later wanted to be a philosophy professor but I just got some mediocre grades in philosophy (high Bs/low As) which messed up my straight A record in philosophy, and probably ruined my chances of getting into an ivy, which would be the only place it'd be worth it to persue philosophy as a career

Plans:
Doing unpaid internship this summer in finance (boutique firm) and also a program in journalism, but I'm really just lost tbh

So yeah, I basically don't know what I'm doing because I kinda screwed up my life because of depression. I just got a super shitty econ grade (like a D) because I never went to class and the professor wanted to fuck me. I probably deserved it but of course I'm still upset.

I see my life sort of crashing down and I wanna stop it. I have more opportunities than some people so I'm not totally screwed, but I still have major baggage. 

I'd love to do a PhD abroad in philosophy but idk if the grades are there for grad school. There's also the violation. I'm also really interested in tech but I have no background and idk if learning coding independently will get you a job. My ideal life would be fusing philosophy with tech and psychology and creating a machine learning model of the consciousness, but I sort of fucked up my academics, so why should anyone give me opportunities to do research? If I can't get further education I need to figure out what to do with my life. I feel like I'm all over the place and maybe it's because secretly I feel like I'll never amount to anything. Mental illness is a stigma that can make you a social outcast, and I still feel that stigma hanging over me. I might never have a boyfriend/husband because guys are really touchy about that sort of stuff (there's this whole ""crazy bitch"" narrative) so I want to find fulfillment in my career, if anything.

I'm doing these internships just to put something on my resume for summer, but idk if my heart is in it. I'd love to be some sort of curator (fashion stylist, music reviewer at a place like Pitchfork, interior designer, art gallery curator, etc.) in New York or LA but that's a risky career move, and it also would deny me the sort of intellectualism that fulfills me.

Sooooo I'm basically just figuring out how to undo all this bullshit and position myself to pursue opportunities. Help?

54,"Hi everyone! 
So here’s my story.
I just turned 23 and moved to another state to get my second degree in nursing. I am super close with my parents, especially my mom, and have never really experienced being “away” from them. During my undergrad, I lived 30 minutes away so I would visit every other weekend. Plus, the second half of my sophomore year, I decided to commue because I felt like it was a waste of money to live in the tiniest room with another person for a ridiculously expensive amount of money. So, I moved back home and commuted for 2.5 years. Afterwards, I decided to take a gap year after graduating and lived with my parents for another year. 
I guess since I never had that moving away from home experience most people at 18 have, this move for me has been harder than I expected. I’ve been crying like 2, sometimes 3, times a day. I can’t really talk on the phone with my parents for too long because I’ll cry and I don’t want them to be worried or sad. 
It doesn’t help that I’m engaged and worry about not being able to move back or closer to my parents if my fiancé and I get jobs here. My parents live in CT and I’m in PA. 
I keep thinking why am I so sensitive. Why am I like this. I know it’s not a big deal and it’s doomed to happen at some point, but it’s just so hard not to cry. 
I haven’t been eating well and lost about 6 pounds since I got here.. this is the first time I’ve ever lost my appetite. I NEVER LOSE MY APPETITE, unless I’m full. 

Anyways, I thought coming on here might help with all these emotions I’m feeling. Maybe some words of encouragement will help me push on through... I want to believe that this feeling is temporary, but it doesn’t feel that way. My chest gets heavy and my eyes get watery. I’ll just become wrapped into this cloud of sadness all of a sudden... anyways, thank you for reading my story.",17May2018,1

62,"I love my dog\(Aja\). My boyfriend loves my dog. She's adorable. She's friendly, unless someone provokes her or hurts her owner, which is me. I've been told that she is a full blooded Doberman, but she is smaller because her previous owner had kept her in a small cage, so she is a little smaller than the average Doberman. My mom always wants me to take her to where I live because she claim's that she barks a lot all the time. But when she comes here where I'm staying, which is very rare, she rarely barks. There is really no problem that she causes when she does come here.

My grandma's dog\(Elvis\), which is a chihuahua and jack russell mix, hides food around the house and provokes fights with her other dog\(Topper\), which is a full blooded rat terrier. When Aja first came here, she ended up finding one of Elvis' food stashes. He was not happy with that at all, so as usual, he provokes a fight. Aja easily wins that fight by grabbing Elvis by the neck and swung him around like a rag\-doll. He started it. She ended it. My grandma was not happy at all and had blamed my dog for starting the fight. Then there's Topper that she gets into fights with. Topper is tall enough to sniff her private area, and of course, Aja doesn't like that at all, so a fight is started from Topper invading her privacy. Either me or my grandma split them up, as the fight is not that bad.

Is there anyway for me to convince my grandma to let me have my dog stay here, or is there no hope? If I can convince her, how could we work it out like letting the dogs outside, or letting them roam around the house?

66,"I \[19F\] have just discovered that I'm an attention whore. I never knew this about myself and it's completely devastating to see myself as I truly am. When it comes to guys, whether they're potential love interests or guys I just hang out with, I get extremely jealous when someone else is the center of their attention/affection. I want to make it clear that I don't act upon these thoughts, and am completely supportive of all my guy friends. If they bring another girl to hang out with us, I do my best to make her feel welcomed and create inside jokes with her so she feels comfortable. I make jokes with the guys about her and the guy she's hanging out with and express my positive opinion of her, and I never ever show how I'm feeling. However deep inside, as I'm seeing him give her affection, for some reason it makes me really, really sad. 

A couple of examples: I've been messaging back and forth with a guy for about a year now, and recently he dropped a sentence about this other girl he's been talking to. I just felt my heart drop, even though I knew it was absolutely dumb because who even knows what's going on with them, it's not like he and I are even dating, and I'm \(platonically\) talking to a bunch of guys myself anyway. Another example: met this guy a year younger than me at a party six months ago, we hit it off but then I decided we didn't connect enough so I gave him the ""I only see you as a good friend"" talk when I noticed he started pushing for something more. He played it off and told me it wasn't like that at all, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt. Recently, though, he's been talking to me about this girl he's in love with that he met 6 months ago, and how she's too good for him, etc. This, among other more specific things he's been saying to me, make it clear as day it's me. A week ago we were hanging out with our friend group and we were talking about singers we thought we were attractive, and I mentioned a name. Later that night I just walk into his house to hang out and he's listening to that singer and is googling him on his laptop. Lol. ANYWAY. My point is, I made it clear I do not want to pursue anything more than friendship. However, he made a girl friend recently, and she's been hanging out with us the last week. She's super chill and I can tell they vibe really well. This friken kills me on the inside, and I feel nasty and horrible feeling this way, because if we're just friends I should have no problem with him closely connecting with other girls, and in fact I want him to because I'm not planning on ever getting with him. 

The thing is, this situation is common. I am constantly feeling jealous over people I have no business feeling jealous over. Does anyone have any tips or advice on how to overcome this? Please don't bother calling me a horrible person or a hypocrite, I'm not choosing to feel this way, in fact I really, really don't want to.

I like dogs, but soon realized she paid them attention but her house smelled horrible. She apparently couldn't smell it. I cleaned the floors every week but couldn't keep up with them. I lived with it to be there for her. As much as I hated coming home to that house every day I did. The dogs started getting aggressive with each other (fights ending with blood on the floor and walls). The english bulldog went to another home for this reason. I went to the hospital because I thought I was having a heart attack (was really set off by a panic attack because the smell got so bad and she refused to get out of the house - I mean the smell of shit) and the next day she was telling her cane corso he was a good boy. At this point I understand it's the dog over me and that's fine. I bought a house because I want my son to have a safe and clean home. Cane corso moves in. Tears up screen, eats out of sink, steals food off of counter, doesn't get washed, hardwood floors scratched up. But that's just money. My aunt walked in the backyard a few weeks ago and it lunged at her, backed away and put its tail down. That's aggression. She ignored this. I did blow up - but that dog would of killed her if she walked forward. She made excuses. I told her the dog is untrained, high anxiety, unstable. She texted three people and let it go. It's been two weeks. She insists her dog will never hurt the baby. I looked at it's swing and it had shit smelling dirt on it because the dog eats its own shit and slobbers all over it. I know that might be more of a vanity issue but it's fucking nasty. Anyways - I'm ready to make her get the dog the hell out asap. Am I being an asshole? Keep in mind I pleaded with her for the past 6 months to get it trained. She also bought me a book about a new baby and dogs - and it actually recommended getting rid of it. I read that 6 weeks before the baby was born and it recommended 8 weeks of training - and I even gave her that option.

I want to be with her and my son but I can't take this shit.

73,"Sorry if this is long. I met a mutual friend in my freshman year of college through this girl I was interested in. He and I became fast friends and are still “friends” up to this point. 

Lately I can’t take anything he has to say. He’s in high school (junior) and I’m in college (junior), not to mention I live across the state from him. I just feel like there’s already such a divide between us. He snapchats me all day, everyday telling me his high school problems and pretty much everything in his life. He seems to be oblivious to any struggles I may have. That, and he always sends annoying videos when he’s drunk, stuff like that. I never get a word in, unless he asks (maybe once a month?). I’m not sure he even knows I changed my major, knows my roommates, or anything about me, like that I started 2 new jobs to make money for college. My roommates/close friends seem to dislike him, but I’m not sure what to do since the girl and I are still very good friends (but not involved in any way).

I should add that I have mentioned to him before that he is a little overbearing, but that hasn’t stopped him. He calls me his “best guy friend” and stuff like that. I don’t want to entirely hurt his feelings because he’s had problems in the past, but I’m not sure if I can take being friends with him anymore. It stresses me out just seeing his name pop up on Snapchat. I delay responding for hours. What should I do?",17May2018,1

76,"So I used to be friends with this kid, let's call him A. and my best friend is kid B. so B's cat ran away a few years ago and I found out that A got a cat that looked the exact same around the same time B lost it. so it was kinda an inside joke between us 3 that A had B's cat. so A has been avoiding me lately and hasn't been talking much, even when I attempt to. so I asked him to sit with me at lunch like he used to just to chill, yanno? (in highschool btw) and he sits next to me but is looking away. i ask if he's okay, he looks at me while tears are streaming down his face and he goes ""yeah I am fine I am totally fine I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine"" and he starts like fidgeting and like hyperventilating and sobbing and I'm trying to calm him down and he said ""you know I think I'm freaking out because we were watching Perks of Being a Wallflower in English and that movie is depressing and you know I struggle with depression so I want to be like the people in the movies even if they get really bad so other people will like me because I need attention"" and I said ""A, if you want attention just be authentic and be yourself people gravitate towards the people that aren't fake if you just be unapologetically you other people will give you attention because they think that's pretty cool I like you for who you are and not who you pretend to be"" and he kinda chilled for a sec then he starts pulling at his hair and crying and laughing and smiling and he goes ""YOU DONT KNOW EVERYTHING, THERES A LOT I HAVENT TOLD YOU"" and i was like ""my guy I'm here just talk to me"" and he goes ""I THINK ABOUT KILLING OTHER PEOPLE. I VIVIDLY IMAGINE IT. I KILLED MY CAT AND I CONVINCED MY FAMILY HE RAN AWAY BUT HE DIDNT AND IF IT WERE UP TO ME I WOULD KEEP HIM ALIVE WITH HIS EYES GOUGED OUT AND HIS MOUTH AND EYES SEWN SHUT"" and I literally said ""nope fuck this"" and reported it to the assistant principal bc he was in my lunch room at the time. I can't stop picturing this kid murdering my best friends cat and I can't stop thinking about the pain the poor Kitty must have been in and I'm freaking out because this kid knows I told on him and he might hate me now and I don't want him to murder me and. I know I'm probably over reacting, but I'm really sensitive to this kind of stuff and I get really bad nightmares really easy. and just. oof. idk how to process everything really, yanno? I don't know really what I'm asking. I'm just. scared?


tldr: my friend murdered his cat and told me about it while acting like a psycho from a movie and I can't stop thinking of it, scared he's gonna kill me because he said he wants to kill people and he knows I told on him. been having panic attacks all day, afraid to go to school and to sleep",17May2018,1
77,"Tomorrow I’m going to be heading to Disneyland. I’ve been planning outfits and like everything I have. My only issue is that I want to wear a shirt that I really like. My mom bought it for me (parents are divorced) and she and I both love it, but I’m worried that my dad and stepmom won’t feel the same.

The shirt says ‘Why be racist, sexist, homophobic, or transphobic when you can just be quiet?’ and I personally love it. I’m pansexual and out to my mom and some friends, which only adds to my love of the shirt.

The issue comes in when I’ve noticed my dad and stepmom displaying some mild homophobia before. Very mild, but it’s slightly there, or at least that’s how I’ve perceived it. I’m worried that they’ll have an issue with what the shirt says if they really are homophobic. If worst comes to worse, they could even find out I’m pan. They’re not abusive at all and really my dad and stepmom are very nice people, they just have very different opinions than me, and are also very religious.

I don’t know, it’s dumb, but I’m worried. I don’t want them to find out I’m pansexual because I’m not ready to tell them yet, and I’m worried what they might do if they dislike the shirt. I’m likely in no physical danger, and I know they wouldn’t kick me out, they’re not those kind of people, but it just scares me nonetheless. I’ve never been that open with them and we don’t have a great emotional relationship. I don’t know how I’d explain it if they were to ask.

Anyways, what are your thoughts? Should I wear it or not? And if I do, what should I say if they ask me about it? If worst comes to worst, what should I do if they find out I’m pansexual? I’m probably overthinking but the advice would be wonderful. Thank you!",17May2018,0
79,"I’m a woman in her early twenties living in the United States with quite a few serious health problems that have left me unable to work. I tried to go to college but the stress of taking even two classes weakened my body to a point where I got an unknown infection that resisted antibiotics. That coupled with my illnesses flaring up so severely that I lost the ability walk more than ten steps or so without passing out meant that I had to pull out after three months. Since then I’ve gotten ssi and fought for years to find the correct combination of meds to bring me to a degree of normality. But these meds are ridiculously expensive (well over 50k a month) and I have to have multiple appointments per month as well. With the insurance from my disability I don’t pay for anything out of pocket. 
But even with all of these issues, I’m still a normal twenty something who wants a meaningful career and an education and a partner and the whole nine yards. I don’t just want to be seen as the “sick girl”. But I’ve been advised by my caseworker that if I attempt to go back to school (even online) I would lose my disability and therefore my insurance. If I don’t have my insurance I obviously can’t afford my meds and without those I would be dead within weeks. 
I feel so trapped. Not only by my body with all of the limitations that come along with my illnesses but by the fact that I can never get an education or have a career. My illnesses aren’t visible (other than the port in my chest) so whenever someone asks me what I do for a living or what school I go to, although well meaning, it hurts like hell because I never know what to say. When I say I’m too sick to work or go to school I get either looks of pity or skepticism. 
Even if I could find a job that would accept frequent sick days and regular hospitalizations and surgeries, I highly doubt I could find one with the insurance benefits I need to cover my medical bills. 
I want to date but I rarely have occasions where I could meet people. And when it comes to online dating, there’s always the occupation/education level questions and I never know what to put down. So I can’t see any realistic way for me to find anyone willing to deal with everything that comes along with dating me. 
I have hobbies that I spend most of my day doing like drawing and practicing my guitar but I’m not remarkable at either. 
I often fall into the thoughts of is my life even worth living? But I have a lot of people who love me so I won’t kill myself. I hold onto the hope that maybe someday I’ll find a way through all of this. 
I just wish I knew how to find that way. ",17May2018,2

81,"I've had this friend for about 7 years and recently decided to cut all ties with him. Over the years I've noticed some immature behavior and him treating me disrespectfully. Back then I had trouble standing up for myself so I always let that stuff fly past me. A few years went by and he had been improving. We had stayed friends despite there being moments of complete anger. We even stayed friends during the first 2 years of college.

Recently during our third year of college, we both transferred to the same university and still stayed in touch. He had made a group of new friends and found himself a girlfriend which was cool. Unfortunately this is where I started to notice a whole new side to him. 

Before this we all hung out with our own group. I only saw one side of this friend and wasn't really aware that he had another side to him until he made the new group of friends. I started noticing something I started not to like about him. 

He started to become more of the gossip type. He would constantly talk about things involving his new friends that revolved around their personal life. He also would constantly tell me or other people what his other friends would apparently say about me or one of his other friends. 

I noticed he always tried to instigate something. He said that when his girlfriend first saw me, she told him that she expected me to be more fit. I thought that was an odd thing to say since she's never seen me before so why would she even expect that. I asked him if she told her that I worked out and asked if he oversold me to his girlfriend because I'm not in terrific shape nor horrible shape. He immediately got defensive and tried switching the subject. 

So what I learned about him as a person from that incident is that he never talks about himself. Like barely. Sure talking about yourself too much is douchey but I noticed he never has anything to say. He was often quiet when I knew him but only recently noticed that he only talked about others or what they would say about other people rather than talk about himself like a normal person. 

Just recently, after everything I just explained, I decided to cut ties with him because he did something that made me believe that he wasn't worth my time anymore. It involved this incident added up with the newer things I learned about him. 

So I was taking a theatre class that was required. There was a project due soon that involved a video and a script found anywhere. I was one of the actors in the video. My group and I shot the video in one day under 2 hours. The video had to be up on YouTube so it could be properly graded. I was the one who uploaded it and there was that.

A week later I showed the same video to him because it was kind of funny. It was also a pretty awkward video since we shot it pretty quickly. I was comfortable enough to show him. He talked about showing everyone else but I then thought he was kidding. 

Another week later he asks me to meet him at this restaurant with two of his friends. I was having a good time eating there until the video thing was brought up. He wanted to show his friends my group's video. I went on my phone and made the video only visible by link so therefore he could not search for it. I told him no and that showing them the video wasn't his call since it wasn't his nor was it completely mine. That didn't even stop him. He told me he would do whatever it takes to find the video.

Beforehand, I showed him the Instagram of one of my group members. She was really beautiful and we were bored so I pulled out my phone and showed him her profile. 

He would then go through my following list and found her profile. Keep in mind that her profile is private and that he's never met her. He goes ahead and actually messages her a whole paragraph asking her for a link to the video. Now I knew she probably wasn't going to share it with him because she has literally no idea who he is and what not. I message her just in case, giving her a warning that my friend messaged her, because I think she had to accept his message request since she never followed him. She told me that she wouldn't share the link and that was that. 

Now that incident hit me. It made me feel like my friend is really immature. What he did is what I consider childish. So I started rethinking my friendship priorities. 

When I got home he kept messaging me that he would still find the video no matter what. I told him that not getting the link from that girl should have been a hint but he kept persisting even though I asked him not to share the video. I would then tell him that if he somehow found the video, I would never speak to him again because this incident annoyed me alongside everything else he's been doing. He messaged me with ""You aren't going to do shit"" and that he knew how to find the video. Now I assume he found it through his computer history because that's where I first showed him so I guess he found the link through there. After that I stopped speaking to him. He was not worth my time anymore and I wanted to avoid all that negativity because I'm preparing for something that's happening during the summer that's really important to me and I don't want to deal with all that drama beforehand. 

2 weeks after the incident I was supposed to see Infinity War with him and a few other friends. One of my other friends called me the night before to see if I was still going. I told him only that I wasn't talking to our mutual friend anymore and that I would see the movie another time. 

Now from information above, I assumed he would tell anyone he could about what recently happened. This was something I kept mostly to myself because I never felt the need to talk about it. My brother was throwing me a birthday party at this club and asked if I wanted to invite my friend. So I had to explain to him about the situation and he ended up agreeing with me. 

Now just a few weeks back I got together with the friend who called me. To no surprise, our mutual friend told him and our other friend about the whole situation. I asked what he told them because I had a strong feeling that his side of the story wasn't completely reliable. To no surprise, he left out the part where he went the extra mile to message that one girl in my group for the link to the video because my friend wasn't aware that happened when I brought it up. 

So I most likely won't get to tell my part of the story to everyone he told the story to anytime soon because I am leaving the country for a few months in about 2 weeks. 

Sorry for this very long and lengthy post. I've known this person for a while so I have a lot to say. Asking advice from the friend who called me didn't prove much help because there was a bias between him and my friend. I wanted to get the advice and input from people with no personal connection to this situation at all. 

Thank you for your time. ",17May2018,1
82,"Okay, to keep it short, my SO believes in pretty much every conspiracy theory out there. Mostly religious based ones. I’ve been with him for 3 years and he just started being like this about a year ago. 

I’ve tried to reason with him about some of the more ridiculous ones, but he dismisses most of what I say as being closed minded. 

So I try to just politely ignore or change the subject when it’s brought up. But he refuses to stop trying to convert me to his thinking until I believe that the Illuminati is poisoning all our food, water, and vaccines, and raping/eating babies (among other things). He says that it’s important I’m on the same page as him and I need to be aware of it all so I can avoid being manipulated by them. 

This has caused many, many fights between us. Just a few hours ago, I discovered that he thinks space and the other planets are fake, the Earth is flat, and yoga is derived from satanism. 

I love him so much, and this isn’t an issue 80% of the time, but I’m so tired of these huge fights and trying to reason with him. Can anyone please give me some advice on living with this part of him and dealing with this topic when he brings it up? ",17May2018,1
83,"So I have been having a major crisis of faith lately where, because of certain events, I don’t have the emotional belief in my church like other people do. Some people have said to fake it until I make it, or to obey first, and understanding and faith will come with that later. 10-15 years of doing that yielded no results spiritually, but I’m pretty deep into it now.

I am going right now because I think it is still a good social experience for my wife and daughter. As for me... it’s hard to sit in church for 3 hours and not be able to relate to anyone else because they all have this vigorous emotional belief in the church.

My gut says I should take a break from church for a while, cool off, still live a good life obviously, but just not surround myself with people who believe so strongly in something I don’t. My church is heavily based on volunteers to teach and what not, and I feel like I can’t volunteer for those things because it’s not emotionally honest for myself to do it, at least not how they expect it.

TLDR, is it better to be true to who I am and follow my gut instinct, or is it better to sacrifice some of my emotional well being so my wife and daughter have me there at church with them(Idk how long I can really keep that up)? Or is there another option?",17May2018,1

85,"I'm about to move towns and my current phone number wont work in the new area. I know that I could transfer my number over to a new carrier that will have decent coverage but I am still hesitant. 

Right now:
I don't pay for my plan (AT&amp;T) because I'm on my parents. Even though our family is spread out in different states of the south west we all have great service in the cities that we live. We're on a plan with five lines for $100/mo, with 5g's of Data. It's a deal, and I don't want to throw it away if I don't absolutely have to.

In the past:
I've used a pre-paid service (Straight Talk) and replaced my sim card in my phone without touching the main number (AT&amp;T). All calls and texts to my main number were lost until I swapped sim cards in a town were I could use both. It didn't cause too many issues because I let people know about the switch ahead of time. Before I canceled my Straight Talk number, I bought a second phone for $25 at a pawn shop to let people know I was phasing it out if they called me. 

Details:
I use a T-Mobile Unlocked GSM/CDMA Samsung that works for both AT&amp;T and Straight Talk, but only one at a time. The best rated towers in the new town are: T-Mobile, Verizon, and Cellular One. The cellphone providers that wont work are: Sprint and AT&amp;T.

Any advice on an easy swap that will prevent calls/texts from being lost? Should I look into call forwarding + sms forwarding? Are there other options that I haven't thought of?


TLDR; I am to stingy to pay a lot for Verizon, and don't want more than one phone. I don't want to loose my current plan/number but I'm going to have to if I want to use a phone in the future.

87,"I am a 21 year old man. My commencement is in two days. I don't have any plans to transfer to a four year university. I still live with my parents. My grades were good enough that I have guaranteed admission to state schools and some financial aid. I think. It's been a a minute since I looked over the transfer program. I already have around $13,000 in loans that I need to start paying next month. However, I don't want to build anymore debt than I already have. I know that's not exactly a fortune I need to pay off, but it's not nothing either. Another reason I'm doubting going back to school is that there isn't any career that calls to me, or that I think will enable me to find happiness. I'm working at a convenience store part time right now, around twenty hours a week. I don't mind it, it's not terribly hard. I know it's not exactly a feasible long term gig though. That said, I do have around $3,000 in my bank account after having worked there for almost a year now. If I continue on to university, I won't know what to study. I don't want to go just to piss around for a few more years and kick the can down the road, and finish with even more debt. I don't think going just because my parents want me to is good enough either. I was good at school, but that doesn't mean I'm going to be good at life. Quite the opposite, it looks like. I can't envision a life where I'm consistently happy, and look forward to each new day. Whenever I think about my future I just end up crying. 

While I was in community college, my mental health issues decided to come to a head. It was its worst my second to last semester there, but to be honest there have been shades of it since at least 6th grade. I remember the day that I got my first detention. I hadn't returned a test I failed with my parents' signatures in time, so I had to stay a half hour after school a few days from then. When I got home with the d-hall notice, my parents weren't there. I was panicking. I didn't know how to deal with it. I can't quite remember what my rationale was, but I sat at my kitchen table trembling, looking down at the slip of paper, and holding a pocket knife to my wrist. Maybe I was ashamed. Maybe I was scared of how my parents would react. Maybe I just couldn't handle the thought of disappointing them; I had been a good kid up until then, and I really thought I was. But good kids don't get detention, right? I never ended up cutting myself, not right then. Things went over a lot smoother with my folks than I expected once they did come back. From then until community college, I thought I was okay. I never did any clubs or sports or anything, because I just didn't feel that strongly about any of them. Even my passions. On my best days, I can say I have passions; writing, playing guitar, video games once I've exhausted my creative energy. Most of the time though, those are just things that suck marginally less than everything else. I'm graduating with an Associate's in Arts, and I took a few IT courses while I was in school. I thought about transferring into to the IT program, but then my shitty, shitty brain stepped in. The math courses would be too hard. I would have to interview for an internship as a program requirement. Interview! With someone who can actually function in society! I was sweating bullets just thinking about it, the day my C++ professor gave us the rundown on what the program had to offer. I never switched majors. I'm graduating from General Studies. 

My fourth semester at school, my brain really went for broke. Suicidal thoughts ran through my head every night. The only kind of plan I could come up for with my life was to get this debt taken care of so no one would else would be stuck with it once I was gone. After that, I could start letting go. I thought an intentional heroin overdose would be a nice way to die. I'd heard so much from D.A.R.E and everything like that that junkies spend the whole rest of their lives chasing that first high, because it's just that good. So I figured, hey, why bother with the rest of my life then? I find out what I've been missing, the whole feeling good thing, and I don't have to deal with the cleanup. It's been a long time since I've entertained that fantasy, and I really don't feel like killing myself right now. Problem is, I still don't think I'd be missing much even if I did. That's really the core issue behind it all. I don't think deciding on how to support myself would be so hard if I could just figure out why. I am not at all cut out for having a family. I'm not capable of being a rock. The only thing I'm capable of is what I'm doing right now, manning a register a few days a week. Even then, I'm straining under the effort. I completely lose my shit if I think about any point in the future beyond the next few weeks. Back to the mental health thing, I think it runs in the family too. The other day my dad once told me he once walked away from a scholarship when he was younger because he was scared to make a change. He said that there was a long stretch of time he had felt depressed, too. I understood completely. If there's some component of my genes that makes me more vulnerable to this kind of thing, then there's no way in hell I'm passing them on. So that's out. Why else try so hard? Money? Success? I don't really want anything material. I buy some video games on sale once in a while, and that's about it. So what's the point? Go to university, study hard, rack up debt, graduate, bust my ass finding a job, and then spend 40 hours of every week for the rest of my life doing whatever just so I can keep on keeping on? That sucks. The only answer I really have would be to focus on the whole writing and bitching about my problems through music thing. Not exactly steady income there, though, and I haven't nurtured the willpower or determination to really follow through on creating anything complete. If I was going to do that I would need a day job, like the one I have now. See? Told you I'm not right in the head. Can't see a solution if it's two inches in front of me.

I never did mention it, but I did get help after I had seen the worst of my depression. I cut myself up with a razor blade one night. Not bad, but bad enough I guess. After that, I had to admit to myself that something was wrong with me. I met with a counselor, got on medication. It helped, and I was on it for a year. Something happened after I got aged out of my pediatrician's office though, and now I don't have my prescription anymore. I've been trying to talk to my parents about getting me to a doctor again, but everybody wants to drag their heels on this thing I guess. I haven't seen my friends in a while. I keep trying to meet back up with them but it fizzles out every time. This has happened over and over again. I don't know if I did something, or if they just don't like me as much as I thought they did. This isn't how I come across in person, so I just don't know. I'm sorry for how I sound. I can't help but write like this when I feel this way. I don't want to be flippant or a downer or anything. Every time I think I break the surface, the next night or the night after that I'm choking back sobs in my bedroom again. I promise I'm not such a smartass in real life. It's just that I just turned 21, and I should feel hopeful and young but I don't. I feel scared and powerless. None of this feels right. Every day I feel like I'm running out of time faster and faster and that I've already sunk too deep. I don't want to believe that I've already ruined my own life, but every night that thought's there waiting for me when I pull the covers over me and shut my eyes. I don't think there's any way to avoid disappointing my family now. They all think I'm going to do great things.

89,"I am a 30 year old femal, Indian, and married for almost 5 years now.

I grew up with a protective middle class family with a younger sister, in a rural place.

I was never a smart kid, but I had a very supportive parents, who took care of every needs, which helped me being successful in studies and in my career. I used to work really hard, study all time (only course materials), otherwise I don't think I could get good grades at schools. I continued to work hard until l get my  bachelor's degree.

I was a girl without much exposure to real world,  never had a bf, no party or any social activities, other than meeting relatives or attending functions at their houses.

Once I started working in India, I met a guy at work, he's now my husband. We were friends, I never had a friend who was a boy, I became close to him as he wanted help for his higher studies, and he was going through a tough time due to break up. I genuinely thought,  as a good friend I can help him succeed, and never had thought of marrying him as I wanted to marry a guy my parents arrange.

Things started changing, we started hanging out, but never had a bf-gf relationship, he even went to USA for studies. But, I continued to help him in his studies and give company as he was lonely,  and at that time we decided to marry. He was the only boy friend in my life. I struggled a lot to convince my parents,  later planned to study further in USA, which made my parents to agree for marriage and I came to USA.

Just to remind, I was never a smart, but I don't compromise in studies and grades. So, again I started working really hard, which messed up my marriage life a bit, because my husband is not my parents, and he doesn't know that I need to work hard to succeed. He is smart, his expectations are very high, and he was not happy about me spending most of my time in studies.

We started to fight a lot, he used to get very angry on everything I do, also I was beaten up couple of times. Then, we moved to different places for job, stayed separately for a while,  and we are back together again, I can say it's 2.5 years, we are living together.  Now he knows that I'm not smart, and I work hard to succeed. But, we are being unhappy most of the time because of my inability to handle things in right way,  he needs perfection in everything, be it be my English, driving car, looking at the map, even while communicating we fight. I'm trying hard, and I feel I've improved and changed a lot, all my friends, sister, and family are proud of me and the changes in me. But, it's still not up to my husband's expectation. 

I'm really sorry to write such a long history and story, but I'm at my breaking point, I've lost confidence in myself, I lost my job recently, I don't see myself as successful person as I feel being constantly judged and criticized at every steps of my life.  My husband thinks good for me, he has never cheated me. But, he always calls me dumb, don't take my words seriously anymore,  I feel being controlled at every action, yells at me, not polite, and we don't even have sex that often (I'm not feeling attracted to him), he doesn't trust that I'll be a good mother. He's not ready to settle down, not ready for a baby, gets irritated if I talk about buying a house.

I don't believe in divorce or separating. But, I need advice if there is any chance for me to work out with my partner and  have a good marriage life?

Appreciate your patience in reading and helping me.

93,"I live with my boyfriend in a small tourist town that is gorgeous, but is in the middle of nowhere and has very little job opportunities. I should also mention that I am pretty seriously clinically depressed and socially anxious. We moved here because my boyfriend codes and finally found a great job that he loves after a year of searching. I had a job here in purchasing that I hated, but the company relocated months ago. Now I've exhausted all potential job searches in the area. It seems like service jobs like Starbucks aren't even hiring, and any job with customer service is super hard for me due to my depression and anxiety.

I have finally run out money, and my boyfriend told me he would support me, but the fact that I can't support myself and have to rely on him drives me crazy and makes me even more depressed. I have a degree in geography focused in environmental studies from a great school and have lots of experience with a variety of small jobs. I am also fairly creative, I have sold embroidered shoes and paintings before, and have had people enjoy my creative writing, but I don't have the drive or business skills to try and sell anything on my own. I would love to work in a not for profit or similar type job, but at this point ANY job would be worth it.

While I totally respect people getting back onto the single groove, I just hate being the stepping stone date. I’ve been single for so long that I have to be honest with myself and with others with what I am looking for. How do I get out of this date? Alternatively, should I even get out of this date? Or should I give it a chance?

I ended up distancing myself from her by not talking to her the whole summer. I couldn't get her out of mind. She was always there with me and she was the closest person to me. I wanted to talk to her so much but I had to stop myself. Before I distanced myself I asked this girl out, my longtime best friend who I wanted to be more than just that. She said no however. This made me depressed but worse than that she started talking to me about this guy she really liked. I wasn't going to be mean and ignore her but the more and more she talked about him the most and more depressed I got to the point where I couldn't take it anymore. I couldn't torture myself like that, I needed to move on. I devoted a whole summer to trying to do just that. Yet it didn't work. I still thought of her because she was the closest friend I've ever had and I really didn't want to lose her. I didn't want to lose the one person who cared about me. So I talked to her and asked if she would want to be friends again. But..... she was too busy. This killed me, guess I was too late. I did this to myself and I killed my relationship with my best friend myself. I didn't want to accept it. I made attempts to talk to her again but she always just felt she didn't want to be there and overall uncomfortable and I didn't want to make her feel like that. I gave it one last shot to see if I could become friends with her again but when I tried, my friend wasn't there anymore. The best friend I once knew was gone. She was completely different. Then after all her friends started ignoring me and eventually I was alone again. I've been trying to move on but nothing works.

I’ll try make this as short as I can 

I moved states with my boyfriend of four years. I love him with all my heart and I couldn’t imagine what life would be like without him

I work as a freelance artist and I'm not doing very well. This year has been really tough on me financially and mentally. I quit my previous job at the start of the year due to abuse in the workplace, and I've been living off of my savings for the past couple of months. I'm getting by on small projects and thanks to my partner, but generally speaking I've been falling deeper and deeper into depression as time goes by.

I got contacted recently by a past client, he wanted to commission me for some drawings for a small fee \- to the point of being underpaid. I hesitantly agreed and left. It was over coffee, so it wasn't anything formal of some sort. A month has passed since then and I haven't done anything for said client. In fact, I haven't been able to draw a single thing in the past weeks. He messaged me last week asking how I was and if I had any progress but I haven't been able to respond to that message thanks to newfound anxiety.

He isn't the only person I haven't been able to respond to. I have some family and a few acquaintances asking how I was but all I've been able to do was seenzone their messages. I feel horrible, but whenever I try typing a message back, I just break down and feel like shit.

I want to get better. Today I found the strength to reply to my friends. The only person left is said client. I don't know how to apologize and explain to him what I had gone through. I'm not very comfortable telling him I've had a breakdown or depression, or anything.

123,"It's been a year since I graduated college, and I'm always the indecisive type. Even if I weight pros and cons, I still reach a mental impasse of what to decide on -- especially when I have to make ""adult"" decisions. In school, probably the biggest decisions I've had to make was whether to change or drop classes.

To me, adult decisions are those that can affect your life years down the road and more or less set the path your life will be (having a kid, marrying someone, etc).

This may sound childish in comparison, and I know life will be full of these decisions that people will have to make, but my first ""adult"" decision was choosing between grad school and a job. Every day I keep looking back to what might have been if I had chosen to go back to school immediately. But now that I'm here, it's probably going to be a couple of years before it happens again. I set myself up: moving to a new city with no friends or family members, making new friends, renting my first place for the first time, buying my first car, and establishing my own life for once.

Now I've come at an impasse: I have a better job offer that will let me study for a Master's in the meantime. But it's at a completely different city. I'd have to say good-bye to my new friends whom I've gotten very close to in less than a year, I'd probably have to get a new car, look for a new place, and basically start my life over again. 

Objectively, the obvious choice would be to advance my career at this point in life. But now I keep wondering what if I just stay here and ride out this life I've built for myself a bit longer and stick to my new friends for a bit longer? I do love the city I'm currently in (hard to beat NYC), and if I move I might be bogged down by the thought of me staying.

These are just a few instances of me making these decisions that will alter my life for a while. Decisions like these are probably not nearly as ""adult"", difficult, or life-altering as choices I will make down the road, but I'm always second-guessing my decisions, even when I first think I have my answer and after I've made them.

I guess my question is, how do you make these big-impact decisions in life and ultimately be okay with it? How do you not look back and cope with the fact that these decisions can have big consequences?",17May2018,1

132,"I’ll put a tldr on the bottom

Okay so right now I work at a restaurant as a server. But it’s a small ish cafeteria style restaurant and my duties include food prep, cleaning, dishwashing, and other things most common servers wouldn’t be asked to do. Anyways, ive been working there for a while now and my coworkers recommended me that I should ask to become a manager especially since I’ve don’t most manager duties and I’m pretty good at my job.

But the huge deal breaker for me is the wages. I was talking to some of my coworkers and one of my managers and all of our pays are so different and really unfair. I make $12.50 while my coworker who does the same things as I do makes $11.50. My new coworker who does “official food prep” duties and still less work then we do makes $14 and my manager who worked here for two years makes $13.50 while another manager makes $15 (I live in Canada if that makes a difference). If I become a manager I definitely think I deserve a higher wage but I don’t know how to negotiate. Will I get in trouble if I say “so and so makes more than me therefore I should get the same as them” or will my bosses get upset at me and treat me poorly? How will I even bring it up? Even though I’m a introverted girl it seems totally unfair that I make less than some people even when I work just as hard or even harder. I’ve only worked here for 6 months but still even if I decide not to be manager I want to ask for a higher wage eventually.

TLDR
I’m a server and found out I make less than some of my coworkers how do I negotiate wages?",17May2018,1
133,"Hello reddit,  
  
Tl;dr: Cousin from russia visits my family and me unexpectedly. He lives now in the guest room and he seems to have no plan what to do now and neither do we.  
  
My 26 years old cousin from russia told us a few years ago, that he wants to live in germany and leave russia for good. I quote:  
  
  
""I have nothing to loose here. My mother is dead, my father married another woman and lives with her alone, my sister is together with her abusive man and her poor child and my friends are not my real friends. I loved it to work on the fields, but they are gone too. I got nothing to loose there. I want to live in germany now and start my new life here"".  
  
Three years later, he unexpectedly stands in front of our front door. We were really surprised, but also happy to see him. He came legally to germany and can stay here as a guest for 6 months. He has a driving license and he wants to work as a truck driver here in germany. Now the problem:   
  
We had already a similar situation likes this before. A friend of my father (professor in physics and mathematics) wanted to live in germany too and work at a university, but like I understood, the government of germany refused to let him stay here. He was forced to go back to russia.  
  
We want to help my cousin as good as possible, so that he can start here in germany a new life.  
  
  
What could/should we or he do?

134,"I think I am slowly falling for my best friend. Do I tell her?

A little history. 

\- Sam \(fake name\) and I have been friends for over 10 years. 

\- She used to date my best mate for a few months at the start but that didn’t last long at all. He is now engaged anyway. 

\- She is my travel buddy for almost every holiday I go on. We have been to Greece, Bali, South East Asia, road trips interstate etc. We have pretended to be on our honeymoon on a trip in Bali \(to score an upgrade haha. It worked!\)

\- She knows me more than anyone in the world. I can be 100&amp;#37; myself and vice versa. We have seen each other at our best and worst.

\- Friends come and go but we have always stuck it out.

\- We have seen each other naked and that’s no big deal. 

\- Up until recently on our way back from our last road trip I got thinking that perhaps I have been looking too much when the girl I want is right under my nose this whole time. 

\- Everyone thinks we have hooked up/slept with each other. We haven’t. 

I think she could possibly be interested. It’s hard to tell. I am a little scared to do anything about this for the normal reasons of ‘what if she doesn’t feel the same’ and ‘what if it doesn’t work. Can we go back to the way things were?’ 

I am also worried that I might be looking into this because I have been single for a while and getting the pressure from the parentals about settling down and getting married yada yada..

Should I tell her how I feel? Should we stay as friends? ",17May2018,3

So it kind of just tapers off until yesterday when she asks me to come over and hang out at like midnight, so I'm thinking she might just want to hook up or something, so I agree.

I got there and we ended up watching tv having a few drinks and hanging out. She ended up being really cool though. We never hooked up, just kind of fooled around a bit but that's it.

140,"TL:DR \- Friend has been sleeping with her married\-with\-children boss for 8 years, have ended the friendship over it before, unsure whether to end it again or inform the wife.

So, I've known Emma since we were 8 years old. We became close friends at age 11, and also at this time became friends with Dawn \(same age\). We've all drifted in and out of contact a little over the years, but for the past few years have met up semi\-regularly and are all still close.

8 years ago, when we were all 16, Emma started working for a small company in our town, which was run from home by a husband and wife \(friends of Emma's parents\). They hired her as an extra pair of hands, and over the first 6 months, she gradually grew closer to both of them but particularly to the husband, Barry. It started out as kissing, which we discouraged when she came to us for advice, and over the following months progressed to her losing her virginity to him. In his marital bed.

Since then, they've spent as much time as possible together in work situations, have been on a total of 1 date, and have had sex in every possible location at his home property. Ordinarily I would find this a clear\-cut situation in which I should tell his wife what was going on, but he and his wife have 2 children together, and the nature of their business means that it can only be run from that specific property. Emma has known his children from ages \(I think\) 4 and 6, and they are now 12 and 13. She spends time with them and his wife and acts like everything is fine. To me, this complicates things because his wife has occasionally said things to Emma which imply she knows what is going on \- Emma tells us that Barry has not slept with his wife for years, that he is ""only nice to her when he has to be,"" that he ""only takes her out when he is forced to"" and that basically he doesn't love his wife any more and would rather be with Emma if it weren't for his children.

She has also told us that Barry cheated on his wife with ALL of her friends when they were teenagers, and that she knows about some of this and has moved on, but doesn't know that he slept with her best friend during this time. Emma has tried dating other people her own age, but she idealises Barry and believes nobody else can measure up to him. She says she is in love with him, that she hopes one day they can have a real relationship, and that she would like to have children with him. We are under the impression \(she has not directly said this, but in a roundabout way says\) that she is waiting for his children to be a little older before they put all of this out in the open. Emma genuinely seems to believe that she can play step\-mother to his children, and that his wife will just disappear quietly.She hates his wife, and seems to take a smug pleasure in the fact that she is in a position to destroy her whole life \- again, their business can only be run from their property, and if the marriage ended, then essentially the wife would be forced to move out to a nearby town without her children, giving up her home and swapping jobs.

When we were all around 18, I ended my friendship with Emma because \(after many arguments\) I could not just accept the fact that she was willing to keep sleeping with Barry, in his marital home, and not caring about his wife. I also drifted out of contact with Dawn not long after for unrelated reasons, but 2\(ish\) years later when I re\-connected with Dawn, I ended up seeing Emma again as she and Dawn had stayed in some contact and Dawn wanted to try to extend some support to Emma.

Essentially, I am now torn \- Half of me believes that my friend was taken advantage of by her boss at age 16, and that much as she cares for him, he is the bad guy and I should offer my support and friendship to her in hopes that she eventually sees sense and leaves him, and half of me believes that she is an insensitive cow who does not care in the slightest that she could destroy his children's lives \(and his wife's\), forcing his wife to move and find a new job, and forcing his children to pick a side if this situation ever came out.Dawn believes Barry is fully in the wrong and that he is/was a predator who took advantage of Emma. It is perhaps worth noting that Dawn also once had a relationship with a married man, although she believed that he was single at the time and ended it as soon as she found out the truth.

Should I end my friendship with her over this \(again\)? I don't dare tell his wife because it often seems she already knows, and I would just be forcing her hand to make her move away. Or should I just be there for Emma and try to encourage her away from him?",17May2018,3

143,"Hey fellow redditors. I am a student and have classes to attend. At the start of a semester I was making friends in those classes with people that sat around me. There was this guy, let's call him Sew. I realized that Sew and I shared a lot of oit classes, since we did, he started sitting next to me. At the start he was hygenic, clean etc. All in all, the situation was bad. I talked to him after class and added him on discord and stuff, I found out slowly that this dude is not the confident type, which is ok. He also has low self-esteem and is self conscious with a lot of things.

At this point I am not really 'friends' with this guy, all we do together is attend class and chat once in a while. He still sits next to me though.

Just a few weeks ago I realised there was some sort of B.O. around me. I later found out it was Sew. I didnt really care and continued on, not paying much attention. Every day after that, the smell situation has gotten worse. If he speaks towards you from even a couple of feet I feel like vomiting. It is so bad.

I can't not attend, I can't ghost the dude. Since he is quite sad and shit, I dont think I should just tell him straight up. I dont know what to do. Any tips? Also if I don't sit next to him, it will be weird because I have been sitting next to him since the start of the semester. He is also in my group (sort of) so I can't ditch those friends either.

152,"Don’t get me wrong I’m not one to hold a grudge over something so stupid as my exes girlfriend but she really does purposely try to make me hate her. 

Backstory
Me and my ex who I’ll name John had a great start, we’d not show love in school or around people we know but we’d frequently go out on dates and generally have a good time.
Within months I saw a reoccurring pattern in him. He always asked stuff from me, would always question our relationship and he’d get jealous easily. I told my older sister this and she told my mum. My mum didn’t want me to have a romantic relationship at my age and forced me to break up with him by taking my phone, deducting allowance and she’d ask my friends if I’m still seeing him so I dumped him and didn’t give him a reason why until his second girlfriend dumped him five days before Christmas. 

He told his friend who I’ll call Tony why I broke up with him and only yesterday I learned from Tony that John told him why I broke up with him which I felt betrayed. Tony went on saying I should date him again behind my mums back and that he still loves me with John’s new annoying girlfriend in the same room within earshot. I assume she knows why I broke up with him too which explains her strange behaviours of a jealous girlfriend towards me. 

Now 

She’d constantly take petty jabs, telling me about her relationship with John. Calling me stupid as a joke and she’d always ask if I liked him or not. I said as friends as I don’t wanna be responsible for her relationship. She broke up with him before but refused to tell me so I gave up asking. I found out from Tony that he refused to make out with her and she had a tantrum and they split. Whilst they were apart she began telling me how much she missed him yet didn’t answer why they broke up. 

Another thing I’ve noticed with this girl is that she seems to always watch me a lot. In class like french or English is spot her glare from the corner of my eyes everyday. Sure you can look at whoever you want and it isn’t strange but she’s always starring. I took off my blazer and she took hers off and started starring at my arms and looking at hers then starring at mine again. I’m paranoid but I always notice these things. I have never been rude to her nor have I ever spoke about my past relationship with John to her. I’ve always tried to be polite and to listen to her but she’s too much. 

Also me and my friend have shown interest in each other and we’ve admitted we liked each other but haven’t spoke about going out. We’ve flirted here and there recently and she’s noticed this. She follows him around in class and only directs her attention to her and he’s starting to notice this and never talks to me anymore. I’d like to note that we’ve been friends since we were seven so it is really getting to me now. She has John so why is she trying to ruin my chance? I mean every time I speak she interrupts. I can’t tell her she can’t talk to him that would be beyond controlling! I think I’ll talk to him that he’s being really distant.

But all I need is a way to tell her that I don’t want anything to do with her current relationship without losing her friendship. Yeah I basically described her as an annoying jealous girlfriend with an ex complex but she’s still a genuine nice girl if this John thing wasn’t clouding her mind. I don’t wanna seem like a threat even though I still love John and he still loves me (according to Tony.) I sound so selfish but any help is appreciated! ",17May2018,2

166,"I babysit for a little boy. It has been sporadic over the last year. I don't charge an arm and leg either because I sympathize with the mom being a single mom. I know how expensive child care can be. However, she never lets me know she needs a sitter until the day of. I've asked to be contacted the night before or given a set schedule which she refuses. I love the little boy and he is super well behaved. I need some advice on how to let her know she's taking advantage of my time. 
Like today I have plans. I had told her Monday I was free, but haven't heard from her all week until this morning. I went ahead and made plans for today. She threw up at me that I said I was free today earlier this week. I don't want to cause drama, but I really would like to be notified in advance when she needs me to babysit. Help!",17May2018,2

It never generated any money until this past September. Since then it’s grown steadily until this past month where I made more than I make from my actual job. Next months projections are even bigger.

171,"I’m 15 years old and a junior. I’m unhappy with myself. I stopped going to school. I was working under the table trying to balance school and work but it just became overwhelming. I was focusing more on work than school and my grade started slipping. I wasn’t able to keep my grades up even after quitting the job and it made me depressed. I slowly started to ditch to stay in my room coping with video games and music. Then I just stopped going to school. My parents weren’t happy and forced me to go to school again. I felt like shit going to school. I couldn’t focus in class. My grades were all F’s. I didn’t want to go to school. I felt sick, like I was going to throw up. I stopped going to school again, my parents gave up. I knew they were disappointed and I wish I could make them proud but I don’t have the will. I hate myself. Eventually the school got involved and I had to talk to my councilor with my parents. They couldn’t do anything because I didn’t want to talk about it. I didn’t tell anyone about my feelings. Not even my parents. It’s just hard to explain it out loud. The school year is almost over and I never went to school. I made my mom cry because I didn’t want to talk about my problems. It hurts my heart so much to see her cry. I want to be better. I’m tired of being depressed all the time. I’m scared I won’t be able to graduate next year. I’m scared my friends won’t hear my name during graduation. I don’t want to be left behind. I want to finish school. I don’t want to be a dropout. Please help me. I want to get back on track.


Sorry if it’s hard to read, I started typing at 4 in the morning. It’s 5:37 AM right now. It was very hard to type this out without deleting everything. Even if no one cares I’m glad I was able to let out my feelings.",17May2018,1
172,"Basically last term a close friend of mine came down to visit me at uni. And it just so happens that she's a girl. I told everyone a lot of times nothing was going on and that we are just close friends. This girl I was friends with at uni decided to keep making comments and asking my friend if she was down here to shag me. This obviously made my friend feel very awkward.

After she left I confronted the girl who made the comments saying I was pissed about the weekend. She made the whole situation about herself and tried to put the blame on my friend from home. This pissed me off further. After that argument I sent a message saying sorry if I was being too harsh but I was upset. After that they just stopped speaking to me, I left it since we were all leaving for Easter break in a week.

Now that we're back she won't even look at me. She hangs out a lot with my mates here so I can't really avoid her. Like few minutes ago I was just downstairs having a smoke and her and my other mate were going town, she walked in and didn't say anything or even look at me. I tried to make convo about that dumb yanni/ Laural thing. She spoke about it to my other mate but didn't respond to anything I said.

I'm tempted to ask what tf her problem is, firstly yeah I was pissed but that was a solid month ago, secondly all I wanted was a fucking apology. Another part of me says leave it, it ain't worth it",17May2018,1
173,"So I’m a 18F.  

My mum was out and my dad was out of town so I had thought that I had the house to myself for a couple of hours, which I did. 

So an hour after my mum had gone out after a while, I decided to masturbate, like full on. Completely nude, legs spread, really going at it. 

Now keep in mind that the EXTENT TO WHICH any mum is against masturbation is UNREAL. So I was aware that she’d be really mad so was hoping she wouldn’t catch me. Like I’d be kicked out of the house if I was caught. So there I was just rubbing one off with my door open because no one was home. 

My mum came home early and I had no idea she had come home. I was masturbating with my eyes closed and was kind of moaning and didn’t really notice when she walked INTO MY ROOM WHILE I WAS DOING IT. SHE SAW EVERYTHING. 

SHE LITERALLY STOOD THERE UNTIL I WAS DONE TO GROUND ME REAL BAD. I continued on and on right in front of my mom, moaning, and squirted all over my bed having a great time. This is the good part, which is barely the point of the post, just added this here to show how quickly things changed after she caught me. 

The masturbation was fucking great. But as soon as I regained enough energy to look up. I saw my mum standing there... I was shaking with fear because my bed was covered with what happened and I was just laying their naked. 

Forget just getting caught during the act, my mum just saw me orgasm all over the bed and laying in the mess I made. She didn’t even kick me out as I expected, what happened was even worse, I ended up feeling shamed and had guilt forced upon me. she got real mad and even asked me to get straight of the bed when I was butt naked and slapped me kind of hard once or twice and she really meant it. 

She was insanely mad. She didn’t even let me put any clothes on. She just forced me to sit down and listen to a really long lecture, how I’m abusing my own body, idk why but some of the things she said made me feel very uncomfortable because the stuff she was saying was very specific to my body and not just in general and made me feel insanely guilty about it. And if she catches me again, it’s going to be a lot worse than one slap, I’d probably get kicked out for real. She just made me stand there butt naked and shout at me for a long time before looking at me with disgust. 

She later told my told my dad and used me as an example to my sister to show her what not do do and I kind of felt like I was shamed in front of my whole family for my body and what I was doing to it. She told them everything and made it sound like I continued to masturbate even when I knew she was in the house. I’ve never felt this awkward or weird. She made me stand there and was basically insulting me and my body and I just had to stand there and say nothing. 

I am never leaving my door unlocked when I do something like this again. I really felt bad about the slap and the guilt she made me feel after catching me do that. 

I really want to get over this incident. But I have no idea how to. Idk if I should try and convince her that it’s normal but even if that goes well Idk how to move past this experience, how do I? 

TL;DR my mom caught me masturbating, slapped me, ranted about it while I was still naked and made me feel like I was abusing my own body. ",17May2018,1

175,"# Looking at the points below, it's easy to see why people see me as unintelligent and undeserving of respect:

* I'm a Master of Research student at Western Sydney University, but that really means nothing if your entire family is either studying at prestigious universities or already has a PhD.
   * The shame prompted me to ask this: [My university \(Western Sydney University\) is heavily ridiculed by students of prestigious universities. What can I do to make it more respectable?](https://www.quora.com/My-university-Western-Sydney-University-is-heavily-ridiculed-by-students-of-prestigious-universities-What-can-I-do-to-make-it-more-respectable)
* My ATAR \(high school\) was 73.1 \(out of 100\)
* My GPA \(undergraduate\) was 4.833 \(out of 7\)
* I only enjoy reading factual texts \- I hate reading fiction:
   * That's why I asked this: [How can you make students enjoy reading?](https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/8dtcfy/how_can_you_make_students_enjoy_reading/?utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=u_Fart_Gas)
   * My colleagues can brag about reading all these long fiction books \- I don't have that bragging right and it will be extremely hard for me to catch up
* I have sacrificed everything to succeed at my work:
   * I am good at exactly 3 things in life and nothing more: computer gaming, academic writing and research skills
   * I am not seen as a valuable member of society \(I have been invited to 2 parties in the last 11 years\) and there is not any reason for people to do so
* I speak only 2 languages because they are the languages I was raised with:
   * I have tried and failed to learn other languages, making me useless overseas. For example, I studied Greek for 7 years and I still can't speak it \(I can read it though\).
   * In contrast, the rest of my family is able to easily and quickly learn languages, making my failure even more contemptible
* It took me 4 tries to pass the P1 licence test. On average, it takes only 2 tries. I failed those 3 times because I still wasn't able to learn to drive properly.
* My colleagues in the Master of Research degree can work 40 hour weeks, sleep 5 hours a night and work in the lab for the remaining time. And despite the extra burden, they still get better marks than me.
* Every time I travel is a disaster. If I'm lucky, I get lost or sick. If not, my family members get killed on our travels: [Man dies following Drumborg crash](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/man-dies-following-drumborg-crash). I meticulously plan our travels to avoid disaster, and yet, disaster finds new ways to hit us.
* According to the [9 intelligences test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences), I lack spiritual intelligence. Apparently, it's due to my irreligiosity.
* I have been [exposed as a hypocrite for having faith in science but not religion](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/8dsm11/how_should_i_respond_to_people_who_give_atheists/).
* My extended family chastises my parents for letting me stop going to church. 
   * According to them, [not going to church caused my impatience and bad attitude](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/8dthgb/does_being_forced_to_go_to_church_force_you_to/). 
   * They told me that not going to church because I hate going to church is just like truancy
   * They believe that I missed out the following life lessons from not going to church: 
      * You can't always have things your way
      * In life you will be forced to do things you don't want to do, and that requires a good attitude
      * Seeking instant gratification would not lead to anything good
      * We should have loyalty and not be swayed by short\-term gains
      * Being too lazy to fix your character flaws will have bad long\-term consequences
      * You have to do what's right, not what's easy
* If I didn't restrain myself and avoid intimate relationships with women, I fear that I might become like Harvey Weinstein: [I find 90&amp;#37; of the women my age attractive and I can't trust myself with them.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/8divz1/i_find_90_of_the_women_my_age_attractive_and_i/?utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=u_Fart_Gas)

In particular, I can't even get the respect of my brother because I'm not smart. On top of that, my extended family are incensed that I am irreligious. **If you can't make your own family respect you, why should anyone else?**

Because I am often wrong, I have little confidence that I might be right in life. That's why I posted this: [I have trouble maintaining conviction in any of my beliefs](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/8goacm/i_have_trouble_maintaining_conviction_in_any_of/).

I have always been taught that respect must be earned. Since I have earned nobody's respect, should I simply learn to live without respect?",17May2018,1
176,"I have been dating my girlfriend for 3 years now. We are seniors in high school and graduate in 2 days. Through out our relationship we have had to fight to be together. There was about a 6 month time spand when I had to sneak just to see her. We are very close and very much in love. My mother is very protective but also her parenting isn’t the greatest. She is never understanding. What she says goes. She always makes me go to school on days such as our Class senior skip days, clayolympics which is a game day that teachers tell us not to show up on if we aren’t on a team. she will not let me do anything unless my friends’s parents are letting them do it as well. She makes me miserable. When I wanted to be with my girlfriend she put me into a depression and I went to her doctors and they put me on anti depressants. I never told her she’s the reason why. I know i should tell her how I’m feeling and tell her how terrible she treats me and even explain to her that I’m 18 and could move out. I’m just not sure what the right thing to do would be. My girlfriend wants me to move in with her so badly but I feel like my mom would go insane and take my phone (that she pays for ) and my car (that is already paid off but she pays the insurance).
She also has been getting very strict with me seeing my girlfriend. She texts me every night that I need to come home at like 10:00. If I don’t reply she will say “Come home now” and the other day she asked me “why are you going over there to her house?” And I had to say “just something to do”. I want to say “because she’s my girlfriend??” But that would cause uproar.

181,"I am new to my career and am pretty stressed out at work, as I am still climbing the learning curve and figuring out how to manage my many responsibilities.
 
About a week ago, I caught a bad cold that left me with a runny nose and congested ears. I have never had congested ears before, which makes my hearing slightly muffled. I'm the kind of person who finds changes in my health--even seemingly minor ones--to be very distracting. Whether it's a sore foot or a itchy patch of skin or in this case, congestion, it's hard for me to focus on anything else until I get better. So I've been working really hard at clearing the congestion--getting rest, drinking lots of tea, eating foods that are known for decongestion, and taking a over-the-counter medication to help clear me up. 

Yesterday I started to feel some relief from the symptoms. Finally. Then my boyfriend calls me and we end up having an emotional conversation about how he's not happy, and how things A, B and C about me are bothering him. It all comes completely out of left field, as we just had a great weekend together recently. As it turns out, one of his friends recently broke up with his girlfriend and seemingly caused him to ""re-examine things."" Great. Under my current circumstances, it hits me pretty hard. 

It's one thing to have to deal with work, another to deal with physical illness, and then bam--I have to have one those heartbreaking conversations that I've only had with him once other year or so, but still. I end up staying up most of the night. I wake up super congested and feeling like a literal weight is on my chest. 

How do I pick things up and stay focused at work? I feel like I could deal with one thing (illness or emotional stuff), but both is just too much. I would prefer not to take a day off, as I have important meetings to attend. 

Any advice on how to stay focused at work when everything is hitting the fan outside of work?

182,"Hi, I want to know if my friend is doing meth or some other hard drug like that. I’m uncertain at the moment.
I was at my friend’s house with another friend and we were kicking back. 
We were chilling at the time and they said they were going to smoke (i’m assuming at the time that it’s weed bc we always used to smoke weed together).
So we’re sitting there talking, joking around, chilling, and then they both get up and take out a bong which is fine I know you can’t smoke meth out of a bong. 
So they’re standing behind me and i’m just chillen there. And then my friend asks me... “You smoke kush?” In a different tone of voice.
And I respond “yeah man I smoke kush.” I said this jokingly but my tone was serious. Then I laughed about it and “Said you know I don’t smoke weed.”
Even though they both know I don’t smoke weed.
Then my friend asks me “do you know what kush is?”
And I say “No?” Kinda confused I mean why would mt friend ask that 
And then my friend says, “It’s meth.” 
And I take a second to respond but I respond plainly and normally “No.” and then went quiet. Because I don’t fuck with that shit.
So they both stopped talking, I don’t really remember what they said after that but I think they stopped talking. Then they started joking? saying “Clutchbomb doesn’t like us anymore.” After a few minutes and start joking around saying I don’t like them.
So at this point I feel it in my gut that they fuck around with this shit bc the other person/friend there lives with someone who does it.
I’m confused about the whole situation though bc they talk about this person negatively as well and make fun of the roommate for smoking meth.
They also start using some type of lingo when i’m there that I don’t understand. The whole time i’m sitting there chilling unsure about the whole situation. 
I wanted to ask seriously but i’m worried because if i’m wrong they’ll treat me like an idiot or get mad for assuming. They can also deny it if it’s true.
I worry about my friend. It’s my friend’s life, my friend is an adult but I know that if my friend is doing that sort of thing I can’t be around my friend any longer and will cut my friend off immediately. 
I don’t know what to do because in my gut I feel that my friend may be doing that sort of thing. 
My friend has done it before and I only assumed once or twice but now i’m not sure.
I tend to overanalyze things as well, I don’t want to overstep any boundaries. I just want to be sure of this... I just want someone to talk to about this other than my family because it’s not my business to expose my friend like that. 
Please message me if you think you can help me because I really need it right now. I want to go more into detail but I can’t on reddit... Thanks!

I would preferably like to have this car on the road/use for a new job two weeks from now.

Is it doable? In the meantime I've got Uber lined up for the mornings. The job will pay more so I can eventually save more but Uber will take a hit too(at least $150/week).

188,"I just attended a friend's father funerals and it was tougher than I thought.

I lost my parents very early \(12yo\) and I'm confortable talking about it since I accepted it \(at least it's what I thought\). It's been more than 10 years now. I qualify myself as stable as I dealt with all this long ago.

Today though I had a hard time in front of the church, seeing other people grieving a lost one. I was very sad for them for sure but I believe too much to be just about the one they lost. I barely knew his father and almost never talked to him. Sometimes during the funeral I had the impression that I cried harder than everyone else, tears couldn't stop flowing. It's like attending this funeral caused all my memories from my parents to come back.

Some context:

* I learnt about the death of my friend's father 2 hours before the funeral, we're not very close and I happen to bump into him in the street
* It was the first time since I attended a funeral since my parent's.
* I'm not a religious person at all

Do you think it makes sense or could this mean I have some unresolved issues about my parent's?

189,"I just feel so rundown. 

Background:
I dropped out of high school at 16 due to family issues, lived with my Dad for 2 years in a rural area. Moved back to my old stomping grounds after getting together with my gf, worked full time from 18-20, unemployed for a full year, worked full time for a year then switched to part time for a year after an injury at work. (All of this being a stoner high school drop out, quit now, thank fuck for that)

At the end of last year I applied for Uni, started in March this year while also starting a new job in January. 

I’m a full time Uni student (2 whole days a week + homework) while working part time/casual (3 whole days a week) 

I started off okay, I was doing my assignments in ample time, managed to work with people in groups. 
But lately I’m feeling burnt out. 

I’m having lots of trouble balancing everything. 
Because of Work I’m staying up til at least 1am doing homework and being wrecked for work the next day. Because I’m staying up late and being wrecked for work I’m not coming home and doing homework like I should be. I just fall asleep on the couch. 

Weekends are great for studying. Except the last few weeks have been so busy I’m slipping. There’s not a lot of time left before the end of semester and I feel like I’m going to fail my assignments, one of which is a group assignment and I’ve not been pitching in like I should. 

I would give anything, ANYTHING, to not go away this weekend with my gfs family and just study and do homework. Except I’m losing. 50+ hours of potential catch up time to go to a beach area in freezing cold weather. Yay. All because it’s the ‘social norm’ with them. 
I barely see my own family as much as I see them. 

I really don’t want to have to drop out (AGAIN) or fail. I’m already late to my studies due to being a teenage drop kick. It’s fucking miraculous I’m even in Uni. I don’t wanna ruin my chances at higher education. 

So r/Advice?... any advice? I could really use a helping hand and a sympathetic ear rn.

At the end of the month I called to switch providers for a cheaper rate and asked them at the end of my july cycle to cancel me, to which they agreed. A few months later I get a letter in the mail from the PT place stating that Anthem withdrew coverage on the two dates in july , and I now owed them money. I called anthem ,around october 2017 to try and resolve it, and they said they needed permission from the Connecticut Health Marketplace to reinstate coverage , so we linked them to our call. The marketplace said they would need sometime, but they will give anthem permission to reinstate the coverage by sending me a bill to re pay for july , since they refunded it after accidentally canceling my july coverage , when they were supposed to just end coverage after july, and that they will call me back \(they never do\) , so since then I have been calling them and having the same conversation with both companies on the line. Anthem needs Marketplaces permission, market place needs ""time"". Its now May 2018 , with so many calls in the books, and they still haven't sent me a check , and now collections is after me.

\- I have not so great credit but repairing it and should be debt free in 2\-3 months and started a new job 2 months ago after being unemployed for a while.  By the time we move it will be close to a year of employment.  

\- I had an apartment with an ex for about a year from 06/2014 \- 10/2015 and he lied about paying rent and hid eviction notices/letters from me.  Also didn't pay like he said he would when we broke lease early due to relationship ending \(long story, feared for my life and had to leave.  He paid rent and I paid utilities due to income differences\)

\- Will/how will this affect me finding a new apartment?  Do I need to disclose this if we weren't actually evicted?  I was on the lease but not main lessee.  

We are looking to rent something small, in the suburbs of Philadelphia PA \(about $900 a month\) for 6 months to a year while we save/invest the money his parents are giving us for a down payment on a house.

199,"Tldr: Listening to others problems give me anxiety / depression episodes and then it seems like I am making their problems about me. How do I not do this / How do I deal with this better?

Pretense: I have my own mental health issues of depression and anxiety.

Whenever someone tells me something really negative thats happened to them, or has happened in their life, or problems they are having etc, it really freaks me out to the point where I really can't listen because it sends me into a panic attacks or depressive episodes. 

Even stuff like seeing someone post about something sad on social media does it. And I stopped paying attention to the news because it was making me too depressed to get out of bed and function like a normal human.

Im on meds for my depression and its mostly under control for my day to day life but I still find it difficult to listen to other people talk about bad stuff thats going on with them.
It sends me into a depressive episode and usually takes me at least a day to recover from.

E.g. today I saw a tweet from someone I know saying they feel depressed and now I feel too anxious and worried about them that I can't work. Its not even someone I know well. Its an acquaintance but its still affecting me like this.

I WANT to be a good friend. I WANT to listen to them and for them to feel like they can talk to me about things but whenever they do I either have to hide how I am feeling or I'm honest about it making me feel anxious/depressed, they wish they'd never spoke to me about it. 

I dont want it to seem like I'm always making other peoples problems about me because of how I react. But also I cant stop my body from reacting this way.

207,"I had a really shitty childhood, my step dad sexually abused me and my mother used food as a method of control. When I was 'good' I got fed (mostly high fat food like fried egg on chips, sausage and chips, or pizzas). When I was 'bad' I went without or I got fed shredded raw cabbage which my mum fed me a lot because I was 'fat' (I was not fat at all, quite skinny and under nourished). There was obviously also violence and lots of name-calling and shaming.

As an adult I've dealt with much of my childhood trauma through intensive therapy and years of medication. After years of hard work I'm finally feeling much better. I've stopped taking all the pharmaceuticals (with doctors supervision) and I work out with a personal trainer once or twice a week. I'm definitely trying to build more of a positive relationship to my body. 

The more recovered I am over the 'big stuff' the more I'm noticing all the little things that have been swept under the carpet all these years. My relationship with food is fucked, I've definitely continued the punishment and reward cycle my mother started for me. My boyfriend pointed out I don't even buy my favourite foods, or I'll buy them for him and he'll have to kinda coax me to eat some,but I don't allow myself to enjoy. On the flip side I'll tend to pig out on cheaper 'less special' foods. I feel a lot of guilt when I eat so I tend let myself get really hungry, then I'll eat lots (but again, usually low value items while the expensive things in my fridge will sit there until they go bad). I also tend to hoard food until it goes bad and then just chuck it out and replace it, like I've got to have full cupboards even though I don't eat any of that stuff.

I know that I need to hit the reset button,I can see now I'm trapped in a cycle of guilt, bingeing and starving myself for no reason other than that's just the way I've always done it. 

What are some resources I can access to help me start deconstructing this stuff? There's an over-eaters anonymous meeting not far from me, would that be a good place to start? Are there any good books about this subject?

What I really don't want is the whole diet/weight loss/healthy eating lecture because I understand the logic and the reasoning etc... What I need help with is changing my emotional responses, not learning how to count calories.

211,"Hi, so I obviously need some advice or at least some kind of reassurance that things take time. Anyway, here is my situation. I graduated from high school and went to college. While I was attending I always had a lingering panic that I won't be able to finish at the University because my brother had to leave due to lack of funding and financial assistance. 
So, eventually the same thing happened to me my second year into college. I tried to work full-time and go to school full-time and it really took a toll on my grades. My job wasn't helping me work around my school schedule even after I told them, anyway. Had to stop going to school because I just couldn't afford it. Since then, I've been trying to get myself together financially in order to get back to school.
 I was accepted into a community college but I still had to fill out FAFSA. My mother (who I have to use on my FAFSA) and I have had a rocky relationship and I would say, along with my therapist, that she shouldn't be involved in my life because it's such an unhealthy relationship. I've told the school about it to tell them that I need to file independently but the head of financial aid said that ""just because your mother and you argue doesn't mean you can claim yourself as independent.(I'm 22 and they have all of these special circumstances in order to be independent. I think the age to be independent is 26?)"" Which really undermined my experience growing up with her but that is a different topic. Anyway, now I am trying to get money together because my mother is refusing to let me use her tax information for FAFSA and the school is refusing to work with me. I want to go to school and get my RN even if I have to work up the scale to get it.
 I work in a hospital now, working 12 hours shifts, 3 days a week where overtime is not acceptable and shift differentials are poor. At my last job at a nursing home even when I was part time I was able to make ends meet by working past my 8 hour shift by 4 or another 8 hours. Anyway, I want to get another job but I know I'll over work myself into a depression again. I had two jobs at one point and was working 70+ hours a week and it brought me into a really unhealthy place mainly because I wasn't sleeping or eating. So I know if I work another job it has to be something where I actually have time to take care of myself. I'm a hard worker. Whenever I go to work I'm so focused on my job and making sure things get done I almost always miss my lunch break and I'm trying SO hard to go back to school so I don't have to keep struggling to make things meet. 
I think it may be hitting me a lot harder now because a lot of my friends just graduated and my boyfriend graduated a year ago and he has a stable job and a good income and I am just starting to feel really bad about myself not being able to afford education yet. I've met a lot of nurses who weren't able to get their RN until they were in their late 20s but it's really just frustrating. 
So, here are my options that I can think of right now:
•Save up for a couple years, get myself together financially, build my credit, pay off the remaining student loans and then go back when I can file independently.
•Keep pursing more evidence to prove that my relationship with my mother is unhealthy which would make the relationship even worse, and cause me to lose basically my only family (she's all I have and even though she hurts me a lot I don't want to lose her) .
•Try to join a branch of the military to help pay for college and get my RN. 
Maybe I'm over thinking, but if there are any other options please help me. I feel lost. Or at least just someone to tell me that it's okay that it's taking me longer with my circumstances.",17May2018,3

222,"Hello and thank you for reading... let me start with a little background. 
I’m a (very recently turned) 18 year old girl, and my HS graduation ceremony is in 2 weeks. But, I graduated in December (2017) due to a lot of hard work and a huge class load. I’ve always been hardworking and very mature for my age. In fact, I’ve been in (community) college since June 2017, so during my senior year I was taking college classes with my senior high school classes. It was super stressful and I was happy to be (the only) mid year graduate at my school. 

And I decided I wasn’t going to my graduation ceremony. 

Let me explain why. 

Right around the end of my senior year (and when I decided to graduate early) my uncle who is an extremely close family member of mine, seriously he’s my second dad, got diagnosed with terminal cancer. So I was splitting my time between high school, my office job, college, and yeah, hospitals. It sucked. There were several nights I would sleep at the hospital with him and get up early for work or school the next day. Fast forward a few months, he’s home from the hospital but he’s not doing well. He can’t leave the house except for doctors appointments that never give us good news, and he’s been back in and out of the hospital several times. Not to mention the medical debt stuff to deal with. He missed my graduation party a couple months ago and that was really hard for him. We Skyped him into part of it, but still. 
Actually the day we found out about his cancer was MY LAST DAY of high school. I left during lunch and missed the goodbye party my English class was throwing for me. When a week or so went by and my family realized I was technically graduated, he told me he’d be better in time to see my ceremony. I knew he wouldn’t be. And here we are and he isn’t. So I told him I thought it was overrated and meaningless and I wasn’t going anyways. 
I know it would be so hard on him if he missed my ceremony.... and the only other person in my family I get along with is my dad. I don’t live with my mom and we don’t really get along at all.. I had this vision of my mom and I getting into an argument at my ceremony and ruining it, which made me apprehensive about the whole thing.

And yes, I have really great friends, but they’re all 5-7 years older than me. My age hasn’t ever been weird (sans the occasional 90s kids reference I don’t understand) because like I said, I am mature. And I’m in college, I only have one year left, and I’ll have my career and everything. But, it seemed weird and babyish for me to invite them to watch me graduate. I don’t think they would feel that way, but I would. I don’t like being reminded of my age since I see myself as a lot older with a lot of adult responsibilities. I don’t even live at home. 

So I thought, why bother going to graduation, I don’t even know who to invite.
Then we had senior breakfast yesterday and I went because I won an academic honors award and I wanted to accept it in person. 

It felt so weird seeing everyone try on their caps and gowns and taking senior portraits, once again I found myself quietly leaving the auditorium after accepting my award. 

Am I making a mistake? Will I regret not going to graduation or is it not that big of a deal? I mean, everyone does it. 
But I don’t want to look back in 20 years and think I missed out on something great for a stupid reason. 
At this point I don’t even know if I should try getting a cap and gown and trying to go. Caps and gowns are like, $40,  I don’t even think I have my tickets, I’m pretty sure they were given away...  
Any words of advice on this at all??

TL;DR...
I’m skipping my high school graduation for various reasons, but am afraid I will regret it in the future, although at this point it’s PROBABLY wayyy too late to go.

229,"We've been together for about a year, and been friends for a year before that. We're both college students and while we're in a mostly problem-free relationship, I don't want to move in with her.

The problem is I already told her I would lease with her in June of 2019. We love each other and she said that she wanted to move in together. I loved the idea of it, but after a few months of it, the reality of it is now setting in, and I'm getting cold feet (for right now). I do eventually want to live with her, but right now my rent just got reduced at the place I rent with three other people, the house is clean and problem free. The landlady is wonderful and it's a few minutes drive from work. My roommates are pretty okay as far as roommates go, and I've got a great space here. So naturally I want to stay here.

It's nothing against her. She's great. But at 21, and this being my first long-term/healthy relationship, I think I want to just stay where I'm at. I don't feel in any rush to make such a significant change in my life. She really wants to move in because during college semesters we have less time to see each other, which is true. But part of me thinks that time apart isn't necessarily bad. I've never moved in with a girlfriend before, so this is a big change in itself.

 June is quite a while away, so I don't feel like I'm racing against the clock to tell her. But I feel like I should tell her as soon as possible. I love her, and have nothing against her. I just don't think I'm ready to make that step like I thought I was a couple months ago.

233,"Ok, this is a long story but I've cut it short. I've known this guy since 2016, cut him off 2017, became friends again 2018 and we're super close within months. The problem is that, I cut him off in 2017 because of my depression... \(I was basically in love with this guy\) and eventually found out that a ton of people knew he had a long term girlfriend but was still a huge flirt. It motivated me to really stay out of his life the entire year. But my intuition told me to go back after I recovered from depression in 2018. I did go back. He's totally different this time. Maybe it's because his career is in jeopardy for his flitartious behavior \(it's a place where it's just socially unacceptable to flirt around\), he has mentioned he needed good therapy the first day I talked to him again.. and he's been mentioning on and on that he's all alone, doesn't have anyone with him, etc. It's as if he's hinting he had a breakup and is single \(he actually never told me he was taken before but it might be because we were never super close before 2018. We became friends off a situation where it's kind of not ok to ask each other if they're single... it's like off\-limits until we're really close.\). So I can't be sure. I have to say that I would trust him with my life... because he's really the only person in my life that I've ever trusted and told so much to.. and to think that he's potentially lying to me about things is just a thought that my intuition keeps telling me to not even consider. 

I looked him up yesterday... and I found one of those truthfinder/mylife profiles saying he has ""1 relationship"" related to ""this name"" so I looked up the name. It ended up being that long term girlfriend people were talking about in 2017. I don't know. My brain shut down when I found out last night and told me to abort the friendship... but I woke up with the intuition that I should see him....

It's intuition and not me just craving to see him b/c our friendship has been on a limbo since the end of April. I told him I didn't want this friendship to keep going, he tried to work it out with me, I told him I liked him, and I just can't get myself to see how he replied.... my brain tells me everyday to give it up and my intuition gnaws at me everyday telling me to go see him. I know intuition is always right... so should I really see him? Or is my intuition telling me to go see him just to find out he really is taken, I was stupid for not digging up his life history earlier, and I've officially made a fool out of myself? \*sigh\*",17May2018,1

239,"tl;dr I am independent, my girlfriend is not so much. She has frequent depressive episodes, and asks for my attention which is starting to feel more unhealthy and unsustainable

As the title says I have been having some issues with my relationship for a while. Some background. We have been dating for almost a year and a half and we currently live together. We recently decided to move and so because of that I have to pick up more hours at work to cover the costs. I will say that this move is mostly her idea. We have been living upstairs in a master suite at her parents house.

She (let's call her Jane) is starting a new job next week but has been alone on and off for a few days for a couple weeks. Historically she has had some pretty bad depressive episodes when she's left alone.

I get home yesterday, and decide that I want to sit down and play video games for a few hours. I haven't had much time to myself with all the time I've been spending at work, and I needed some time to unwind and to take care of myself. I am a very independent person while Jane is not so much. So I really try and make an effort to give her ""attention"" more than I naturally would. I feel like I have done a pretty good job of this. I make an effort to check in with her throughout the day and talk to her when I get home, asking about her day and generally trying to not be a shitty boyfriend.

Anyway, I can tell she's not feeling the best, so I ask her what's going on and she says ""I'm fine nothings wrong"" etc. I take it at face value.

This morning I wake up early, and I'm spending some time on the computer eating breakfast and I see that shes really upset. I had headphones in so I couldn't hear her, but she had been trying to talk to me and was very upset, feeling like I was intentionally ignoring her (I was not). She said she feels like, ""I haven't been around even when I am home and that she was feeling down and really just needed some attention,""

I tried to be as sympathetic and listen as well as I could. I let her know that, ""I am sorry you're feeling that way. I wasn't intentionally ignoring you,"" etc. and gave her a little love. I have a hard time knowing what to say in these situations, because I want to listen and be supportive but I also don't want to let her beat down and me and blame me for everything, or to enable some of her actions which I feel are less than productive. I have been working on the whole, 'Women want a listening ear, men want solutions,"" idea. I tried my best to take this approach, and just understand her perspective when these things come up. I can certainly be defensive, so when she does blame me, I try to take a breath and shut my ego up before saying anything.

Anyway, if this situation had been a unique one, I would be more than sympathetic and understanding. We all have bad days and just need a little support. But these things seem to come up every month, often more (is that exceptionally frequently? I feel like it is). Before I started working while she had time off, I knew she was going to struggle again. She gets very depressed and has a hard time on her own. And this happens all the time. I am at the point where I don't know what to do. Jane suffers from depression / anxiety so I understand that she can't always help it, but every day she has been home she has just sat inside and done nothing. When I get home, I do my best to give her the attention and support she needs, but some days I have to take care of myself and be selfish. If I don't do this, things will just get worse.

So there are a few components that I need advice on. First of all, I feel like she doesn't really do a lot to help herself. I want to be supportive and caring, but when I hear her say things like, ""I just sat on the computer all day,"" and, ""I couldn't go out because there's nothing to do,"" I really start to feel like shes amplifying her own misery, like she isn't making an effort to help herself. As I said, I am a very independent person and really like to have alone time. I have no problem finding things to do on my own, so I don't know where to draw the line between normal desires for love and attention and unhealthy / overly dependent behavior. The second issue is that it seems like she really doesn't know how to be her own person. Leaving her alone is something I actively worry about, which I feel like I shouldn't have to. I already worry whether or not I am giving her enough attention, and when things get like this, it really starts to make me think that she is dependent on me in some ways that border on being unhealthy. She will say things like, ""I just need some attention,"" I can appreciate that when she feels down, she wants some love and care. We all do. But when these episodes happen as frequently as they do, I really start to feel like she is using me as a band aid for her own problems more than working to figure out things for herself.

We have talked about this before. I have a hard time communicating though, and feel like I can't make my point without sounding like a jerk, partially because I am so unsure of what is fair reasonable for both her and I. Is it selfish for me to feel this way? Are there ways I can better help her to have a bit more of a consistent state and to be a little more self reliant, while still being a good and supportive boyfriend?",17May2018,5

241,"In a deeply regrettable attempt to enjoy the beautiful spring weather, I opened the living room windows in our apartment. I noticed a wasp buzzing outside but didn't worry too much about it because the screen was down. 

Well, unfortunately, it managed to squeeze in through an overlooked gap between the screen and the window because the next thing I know I'm working at my desk and this GIANT F***ER of a wasp FLIES ONTO MY HEAD and starts zipping around the room. 

I grab my laptop and run out (I had to abandon my coffee - there was no time) slamming the door shut behind me. I could hear it in there... it sounded angry... 

Now, the window in that room was closed, and the door is tight fitting (it actually takes some effort to close) so I know it hasn't gone anywhere. My husband came home in the evening, and weaponized a thick magazine by rolling it up into makeshift bat. I armored him up in a winter coat, hood, and gloves, and sent him. My hero. 

But there was no wasp. We looked everywhere, shaking the shelf, rattling the closet, banging the brick walls and tapping the wooden beams of our ceiling. It's a small room... where could it have gone? We thought perhaps it has squiggled out of a window somehow... We gave up our search, but left the door shut to be safe. 

The next morning, hoping I can return to my desk in wasp-less peace, I timidly open the door and... there it is. That sly f***** is buzzing around the window trying to escape. I see now that it is HUGE, like damn near an inch long, and I don't want it to sting or eat me or anything but I know if I don't do something now I might lose it again. So I shut the door and suit up - coat, hood, gloves, the works - and I go in. 

I had hoped to make a beeline for the window, open it, and set the wasp free. It may be a demon spawn of an insect, but I decide to be the better, more compassionate species, and let it go escape largely umolested.

Yet despite its impending freedom, it disappeared again. It's as if it has simply vanished. I looked everywhere. Beat around the furniture. I couldn't see it. I couldn't hear it. Why? WHY?!

In a last-ditch attempt to reclaim my home office, I got a bottle of homemade insect repellent (a potent mix of essential oils that I've found to be very effective at keeping ants and high-rise spiders - yes that's a real thing and they're horrifying - at bay) and start spraying into every nook and cranny I can, hoping to flush the bastard out. 

No such luck. 

It's day 3 now, and I still haven't found it. We've searched everywhere, sprayed every corner. Sometimes I hear it buzzing... but when I go in the room I don't see it. Is it building a nest in the ceiling? Is it laying eggs?  Am I going to open the door and find an army of wasps buzzing around?

250,"So I've got some pretty overbearing parents. To be fair they arent as bad as some I've seen (my mom has never sat in on my jon interviews) but they're still overbearing and I've realized now that I need to start gaining my independence. Some examples of their helicoptering/manipulating:

1. Mom told me to draw a 2 hour radius around our house that was in state. Those were the only schools I was allowed to apply to. I decided to rebel and apply to one 2 hours and 15 away. Mom was okay with that because it was a prestigious school and ""youll never get in anyway"". Jokes on her I'm graduating in 2 months. 
2. Parents forced me to live in on campus housing (they are convinced anything that isnt on campus is the hood and I'll get raped, murdered, kidnapped, and/or drugged etc)(more context: theyve only ever lived in our suburban hometown which has a 9% minority population-trying to get them to understand that you cant say the n word or ""chink"" has not gone well) and then my last year our school switched to a housing lottery system and i lost out on the chance to live on campus another year (probably for the best anyway). So my parents went and found me an apartment. Didnt really consult me until after we were sitting in the leasing office of this overpriced apartment that i didnt even like and basically forced me to sign and become dependent on them for rent.
3. I have to have an app installed on my phone so they can check my location or else I'm grounded. I'm going to be 24. 
4. Tried to ground me last year because I bought tickets to a concert they didnt like. Only let me go after ""the other ladies in my league said i was being irrational"". Yea screaming at me on the phone while i was at work might be considered irrational. 
5. I wasnt allowed to have a computer with internet until i was 13 and even then my parents would sit over my shoulder and monitor what i did. They started blocking websites they didnt like (YouTube was the big one and any site that i watched anime on)
6. If my friends and i go to a concert I'm not allowed to drive. My mom will make sure to ask me 10000000 times and get me to tell her whos driving and everything about how were getting there, when were getting there, etc.
7. Gave me crap for quitting a club in college they were personally invested in. I quit for reasons i couldnt tell them. 
8. My mom forced me to do band in high school because she was never allowed and didnt want to deny me the opportunity. Wouldnt allow me to join an dance studio though, even though it was what i actually wanted to do. Still to this day insists that she made the right choice and that my life is so much better for it. 
9. My mom gave me a speech after i told her i wasnt moving back to our hometown after college about how shell ""follow me and move wherever [i] move but just understand that [hometown] will always be my home and I'll never be happy anywhere else""

This got really long, sorry. Didnt intend for that, i just got really angry.

In our break room at work, there's a fridge to store our food in and we have to label our food with our names. Earlier this week, I put my labeled food in the fridge and today I looked in the fridge and saw my crush' s snack, but she didn't put it next to mine. I put my food on the top shelf where there was plenty of free space, but she put hers on the bottom shelf away from mine.

Is this a sign that she doesn't like me anymore? Like, she's over me and now she doesn't want our food to be next to each other since she's distancing herself from me. Am I overreacting?

I am a cancer survivor I had radiation to the neck and chemotherapy be because I had a tumor around my cervical spine. Now I have a chronic pain. I am on multiple opioids including Norco and methadone. I am on antidepressants because you know chronic pain and depression that’s a thing. I have hypothyroidism because radiation just ruined it, it is virtually dead. I want to explain what happens when I sleep when I’m about to wake up I will feel like I’m being held down, like I am completely conscious but at the same time I am in a dream. Sometimes I go in and out of consciousness and consciousness looks like unconsciousness I try to speak but, I don’t really know if I am speaking or if I’m just drooling and slurring words. I’m terrified it’s like I don’t know what’s real and what’s not. And when I finally wake up I’m dizzy and my eyes or pupils are constricted but, I don’t know what to do because my mother believes if I tell my doctors they will remove me from my chronic pain treatment. If my chronic pain is not treated I have no will to live but, if I am afraid sleep and I can’t stand up without almost fainting at 21 there’s just no reason to try.

The one I remember most is when I woke up and I couldn’t move and my boyfriend was right next to me and I saw that the door was open. I tried to get up to close the door but I couldn’t and I tried to yell for my boyfriend but only slurs came out. And I was going in and out of a terrible dream that I wasn’t sure was real or not. Then five minutes later I’m fine and can close the door.


I usually cant move like im held down and i try to scream but, i only drool and moan or i am screaming but, no one in my house can hear it, I am so scared i don't know whats real! It's like im going in and out of a super vivid dream but, if the dream is real bc when i am conscious im not looking at the same place (sometimes i am) making me think i might be moving but, im never tired after just dizzy my pupils are big and my head is fuzzy. Im afraid to tell doctors bc my chronic pain and if they take away my meds im on i would be in unimaginable pain.

We both had a lot of computer knowledge but he showed me a side of the web I never knew about. So I started learning Web Design &amp; Developing while living with him and his future wife. I studied and a few months living there, I started making websites for him. Almost 2 years living with him, my rent was being paid by doing the work, plus he provided food, everything I needed to live comfortably / having the dream we were starting a company. I eventually met my wife during that time and the business was going well enough, I saw an opportunity to move in with her, believing the business was going somewhere, or least enough to pay the bills. They did write me a big $1800 check for deposits / first months rent, etc.. Months went by with me working on getting this company going with my friend and one other with not much money coming in. A $100-$300 check randomly when they could had it(they said). At the end of 2017 I had to make it clear I couldn't continue working like this that I need a set amount each month in order for to pay the bills as it was stressful on my wife(gf at the time) So we wrote out a little thing on messenger of him saying that he would pay me $600 a month for doing the work. That only went on for 2 months and I was back to getting nothing for the work. It is now 3 months later. I just recently landed another job doing factory work while also still doing the work for the company &amp; I do not have a clue how to handle this at this point.

How do I get over this feeling? I love to learn and I'd love to be at their intellectual level.

Since then, the 2nd mom in our group has been included into this group and needless to say, they have been doing more and more with them.

I wasn’t very comfortable with many people especially with people loud and rowdy like his friends and part of it was also my social anxiety. I started to speak up about it to him and he said he understands, he asks me the reasons and I said it’s because of social anxiety and I then told him more about me, my past and my social anxiety. 

I know he told his friend and I wasn’t very nice about it. I got into an argument with him and at the same time I got into an argument with my boyfriend so I said “look I can’t deal with this, I’m also having an argument with my boyfriend” then he stopped replying.
Later on he asked if I meant him when I talked about a boyfriend and I told him no. He sent me a long paragraph of how he understands, how we could still be friends, how he got his hopes up and it’s better now than letting it develop. I was fine with this.

Until he started calling my social anxiety a fake because I played with a calm 5-man in siege but I told him it doesn’t mean that I didn’t feel uncomfortable or anxious. His friend and him started to call my age a fake because I showed them a photo of me (I’m an asian girl and asian girls typically look younger). I told both of them several times that I was revising for two exams today but they still kept calling me and calling me. It got severely irritating so I told my boyfriend who told me to ignore them because I really don’t need any toxic people in my life so I did that.

I want to do something to change this but the lack of motivation means that I hardly want to get out of bed nevermind try and exercise. My life revolves around routine and has done for as long as I can remember making it very difficult to make changes to way I do things. 

I've always excelled in school and have performed well in the exams I've already sat but I have no aspirations that I am aiming for. When I try to think of what I want to do with my future, nothing comes to mind.

I've decided to make this post because I don't know who else to try and talk to. Talking to my parents or teachers hasn't provided any meaningful help. I've built up a facade among my friends of being a happy\-go\-lucky guy who hasn't got any worries \- somewhat of a comedian \- so when I try to have an actual conversation with people about the fact that I have been and still am depressed they usually dismiss this as a joke or something that isn't as serious as I'm making it out to be.

I realise what I'm actually asking for is quite vague but this post is simply me putting exactly how I feel into writing and sending it out onto Reddit to see what advice I can get. I'm looking for ways of changing my routine so that I become more healthy and ways of finding something that gives me motivation and alleviates the depression that I'm feeling \- an attainable goal that is something meaningful to work towards in life.",17May2018,1

295,"The other day I ordered a product off amazon and went to pick it up from one of their locker locations. 

While doing so, I noticed another package in my locked too and thought it’s part of the order. 

Upon looking at the label, it looked like an u familiar name on top, but didn’t really look it was someone else’s order. So I decided to open it and it turned out to be something that would be very useful for my work (price range £20-30).

Now I am in a dilemma wether I should return it.

The only reason why I am thinking not to is because of the hassle of contacting amazon, then waiting on their post so I can then send it for free. I have to buy get post marks, go to the post office and ship it or do I just keep it.

I asked a friend and he said: “as much as I know how loyal you are, just avoid the hassle and keep it since it was the delivery guy’s mistake and not yours. “

In my experience, amazon refunds you the money if the person hasn’t received the product but don’t chase it up if it’s not in very high value. I had this happen to me with a £10 product and they just refunded me. Now, someone enjoys my LED light.

296,"So I had my interview this morning. The first part was an assessment. To check my knowledge. To be honest I didn’t know a good portion of the questions (they were IT related questions). It was taken on a computer in a room with no one in it. I answered the questions I could honestly and fairly.

After the assessment the group who would be interviewing me walked into the room. They asked me about the assessment and I told them that I didn’t know the answer to all the questions. They asked “well did you use the internet at all? You were allowed to use the internet” I said no because 1. I didn’t know that and 2. I again wanted to answer the questions open and honestly. I did think about using the internet but I felt that was cheating so I didn’t.

The rest of the interview went actually really well. It felt like general conversation rather than an interview. They asked a question I had an answer. 

So what exactly were they looking for during the assessment? Again they didn’t tell me I could use the internet. But they didn’t say I couldn’t either. Did I do the right thing?",17May2018,1

I guess before I bought the car, there was previous repairs done to it and they were not well done. The body shop said that they needed to go through those repairs before they could repair anything else, and I declined. Now they don't want to give me the fill amount of the checks given to them by AAA because they put labor into it, but yet I am getting my car back the way it was before, no repairs nothing new.

So I started hanging out w my friend and realized she was hooked on pills and cocaine. Her husband left her shortly after I met her and I felt bad bc she said she had mental illness and had no job.   The more I got to know her I started feel guilty for not doing something about what I saw


She would take pills and do cocaine in front of her 8 year old daily. She started escorting and had the men there after her daughter was asleep. All the money she made went straight to drugs and shopping. Or she would sleep all day. She did not pick up her daughter from school on her daughter's birthday and I only knew bc she never texted me she was up, so I left work and found her daughter at the school, took her home where her mom was asleep.  Then one night she called me to come over bc she thought she was over dosing.  That was the last straw i told her mom everything. Her mom and I called cps separately. They intervened.  She failed her initial drug test but has passed the last two since she has only been doing high amounts of rx drugs that she has rx for like Xanax. So now they are about to close her case. She's still seeing men, she told me she never wants a real job and she is going to go back to pills and coke again as soon as she can.

Wtf.... sometimes I'm like why did I even call if it's this easy for them to close a case on a woman that brings her child around drugs and johns. All she has to do is see a counselor. The case has gone on about 2 months total..

She has no idea I called cps on her so she tell a me all the fucked up shit she does. Any ideas on how I can keep this child safe? She has no filter talks about sex acts in front of her daughter, wears stripper heels and outfits around her and has her daughter even take selfies of her. Also she tool a video of her daughter asking a man for money at his request. And no surprise the man started talking sexual about the child but it was just online and cps did nothing.

I was supposed to give them my first one the other day, but of course they stand in there with you and stare at you. I was unable to produce urine the first time, and asked to come back today. I tried multiple times today (I believe 4) drank LOADS of water and soda, and I knew with certainty I had to go, even did a mini test trial in the private restroom nearby (didn’t let much go, but just enough to see if I could) and that worked just fine, but when I had to go in front of them again, it simply wouldn’t work. 

Now, they put down failure to produce (which my P.O said isn’t a huge deal the first time) and of course, as I figured, right after they let me go, I pee’d just fine in the private bathroom adjacent to the room.

305,"Hello,

My son is 20 years old and just finished his third year of college. He hasn't been doing that well in school. He has many C's on his transcript, a few D's and even a few F's. He did very well in high school. He graduated with a 3.9 GPA. In college, his GPA is a 2.5. He tells me that high school was easier than college, which is why he's having a hard time. He did pretty well his first few semesters, but ever since he lost his scholarship for being unable to maintain the GPA requirement, he's been doing very poorly. From looking at his transcript he did pretty decent his first few semesters, and now he's been doing poorly.

He's a Biology major. He told me that the classes he's taking are not difficult, he just said that it's hard for him to focus. He tells me, he procrastinates, he has a hard time starting assignments that's going to take a while to finish, he has trouble reading long passages, starting essays, etc. But a lot of people that don't have ADHD have the same problems he has, so I don't think it's ADHD that's causing him to do this. I just think he's not trying his hardest and is distracted because he spends a lot of time on his laptop just surfing the net instead of studying.

He says reading long passages is difficult for him, but a lot of people don't like to read. He paces back and forth in our house, he fidgets when sitting for a while, he says he daydreams a lot, but I just think he needs to learn how to control that. He doesn't have a driver's license because he says he doesn't pay attention that well, and he doesn't feel safe to drive. I just think he haven't practiced driving enough to come to that conclusion. He tells me whenever he leaves a movie at a movie theatre, he falls asleep and fidgets in his seat. He tells me he never remembers what happened in the film. Many people fall asleep at the movies. I don't think that's ADHD.

My son went to his GP to talk about this, and his GP told him ""you probably do have ADHD from what you've described."" He told him he has to visit a Psychiatrist for further testing and to get prescribed medication. I don't think he needs to go to a Psychiatrist. If he gets diagnosed, that's through the whole state, and I don't want him to be labeled. My son mentioned to me going on medication.

I really don't want him to be medicated. I don't want him to have to deal with the side effects. I have family members that were on medication and it screwed them up. I take care of special needs people who are on medication, and it turns them into zombies. I don't want my son to go through any of that or end up being permanently disabled from going on medication.

I want my son to cope with his problems the best he can. I think he hasn't been trying his hardest in school. He's distracted by his laptop. I feel like he hasn't been trying hard enough to learn how to drive. He doesn't need medication to do these things, he just has to try harder and cope with what he has. I think medication should be a last resort. If he has truly tried his hardest, and still struggles then maybe he could try medication.

I noticed this, so I just brushed it off since I don't want a relationship right now. It was all fine UNTIL he gave me a note recently. In this note, he confessed his love to me. All the mushy, gushy stuff, and at the end, he asked if we wanted to date. Although I'm flattered by his note, I feel awkward and I don't want a relationship right now. What should I do now?

311,"Ok, so obviously we have a long history that gets pretty complicated both personally and together. Relationship wise, we're coming up on our 6 year anniversary. We were each others first have been together since highschool and we've never been with anyone else. We do have a lot in common and I liked him for his dorkiness mutal love of music genre and generally loved being with him and very much saw a future of marriage etc. 

However also my past when I was a teenager and with him made it complicated. I was in a very bad place for a long time. I came from an abusive family, and bf was literally the first person I've ever truly loved, period, family or otherwise. I even went to go live with him and his parents for 2 years to escape living with my verbally and emotionally abusive mom, before I was finally able to move out and get my own place with a roommate. So some unhealthy psychological habits developed in our relationship. I was relying on him too much. I have issues with driving (not getting into that) so anytime I needed to get somewhere, including my job, I needed his help. 

Anyway, once I moved out and was with a roommate, it was good that we finally had some space and I wasn't having rely on him anymore. I thought of breaking it off then or at least just ""taking a break"". Sad feelings arised because yes he helped me when I was in a bad place, but it was not really out of love, but more so obligation and he complained about helping me a lot. I started to realize that at his core, he's a selfish person. I knew that if he needed help the way I did, I would do everything I could to help him without a second thought, as I have with his problems as well time and time again, and that was not how he responded all. At times when we would argue, he would attempt to gaslight me a lot, but then also he has depression so in the end he would always say it's his fault and he's a piece of shit and why haven't I broken up with him yet. I talked with friends who told me they believe he's a bit of a narcissist. Also we didn't have much to talk about anymore, all he would talk about was Magic: the Gathering because that's the only thing that made him happy besides me, he said.

I did have a talk with him, but I couldn't break up with him at the time because if our long history together and I knew how much he loves me. I also didn't know how much of his actions was really him, and what was a result from his depression. He began to struggle really hard with depression and felt he had nothing in life anymore with no motivation except for me and Magic. My biological father I never met had committed suicide and I have struggled with it myself, so I vowed that I would always do everything I can to help someone in that situation so that will never happen to anyone else I love, especially him. So I had been helping him over a long string of time with his depression in all stages of denial, admitting, accepting, and just recently, finally getting help. 

My roommate situation didn't work out and I needed a place to live. So I got a new job and found a great place $850 all bills paid. I had tried convincing bf for a long time to come move out with me, but he didn't want to because he was going to college and living rent free with his parents. But he had expressed that he really wanted to now, so I made him a deal to help him out. I said I would pay $650 and he would just do $200 and groceries, essentially exchanging the gas money he was paying to drive from hometown to the city every damn day for school and work, for rent instead. I would be paying for this by myself anyway, so anything would make it cheaper and then I would finally get to live with him. (To note, I was happy to help and have never given him shit about going to school and working an easy part time job at a game store while I bust my ass working full time with doubles and shit to make ends meet. (I've had people tell me he should ""be a man"" and have a full time job also but I thought that was bull and would be too much on him)) I was hesitant because we never took a break and he was still struggling, but I told myself I'm very close to getting him to get help and get medicine for it, and I think I at least owe it to him to try to make this work and give it another shot at living together as adults on our own when I am way more independent and taking care of myself, and he is getting better as well. 

So here we are, and everything is pretty good. I finally got him to take medicine and he is feeling way better and treating me a lot better too. He graduated college and is finding a job already and actually has motivation and is putting effort towards his life and our relationship. But I'm not sure how I feel about it. Everything is better with us now, but the past and how he has treated me badly still haunts me. I'm not sure if I feel relieved that everything is fixed and we can move on as a better couple, or relieved that I finally feel comfortable asking him for a break now that he actually feels better and is making a life for himself. We do still have a bit of issues with being different people as far as no having much to talk about, having different interests and aspirations and him talking about Magic way too much. I know the next step in our relationship is that he will eventually propose, maybe even soon on our six year anniversary. And I don't feel like I can say yes. 

I also have other feelings of wanting to explore and see if there is someone else better out there for me, and also have different sexual experiences tbh. I've actually had crushes on other guys before that make me wonder. Even one recently. I'd feel like I'd be missing that part of my life as I've only ever been with him, and I don't know if I'm ok with that. But I also don't know if I can or want to break a heart and a long term relationship just to explore and be a slut for a bit lol or if I should just let go of the past and my curiosities so I don't ruin a good thing and break his heart.

But we've been living together for 5 months now. Our anniversary is coming up, and our lease is about to end in June. I feel like it's about time to make a decision. I feel a lot of pressure right now because we live together which makes it harder to take a break and I want to tell him I dont want him to propose, but I know he will ask why.

TL;DR: Long history with bf of 6 years whose the only one I've ever been with. He treated me badly at times but I didn't break up with him because of his depression and I wanted to give things a chance to get better as there were a lot of good things and I loved him. Now things are better and idk if I'm ok with moving on with our relationship, or I want to take a break and explore other relationships. This is hard because of our history, we live together, and I suspect he might propose soon. I feel a lot of pressure to make a decision soon, but idk if it's worth ruining a good thing or how I should proceed.",17May2018,0

313,"Here’s an example, a few years ago I got a £100 check from my grandma for doing well in my exams. At the time I didn’t have a bank account but was going to open one. Without my permission my mam put the money in her bank and spent it. She later claimed I had chosen to spend it on my school uniform. I had never given her the permission to do so. My grandma never found out. I had to lie and say I’d spent it on my uniform. She also borrows money from my grandma (e.g. £300 for a laptop for me. She never bought me a laptop and instead spent the money. I have to lie to my grandma and pretend I’m still saving money for a laptop). 
If I refuse to not give her money she shouts and says “you’re pathetic... you can take a bus to school”, amongst other things. Thing is if I wasn’t “strict” then she’d take all my money just like my brother. She owes him around £3000 because she spent it all on a car. She keeps saving money to give him it back but instead buys clothes for herself. I feel extremely sorry for him but at the same time he didn’t refuse to give her the money. He’s also been threatened to be kicked out and pay rent even though she’s so in debt to him.

314,"So I'm a 22 year old guy and I've never had a girlfriend still a virgin. I matched with this really cool (or so I though) girl on Tinder. My friends in college always pressured me to have casual sex (hookups, FWBs), but I was never comfortable with that. I wanted something meaningful. I wanted to lose my v-card to someone special and someone who I truly cared about. I was told I can use Tinder to find a relationship if I just put in my bio that I'm not looking for hookups. So I matched with this girl who was 24 and we hit it off pretty well. Common interests, good conversation, you name it. We texted for like a week before we set up a first date (coffee shop and a walk around a park). During the first date, she asked why I'm not looking for hookups and I told her that I don't feel comfortable enough having sex with someone who I'm not emotionally close with. I need trust and familiarity to be that intimate with someone. If I want to be that close with someone physically, I want to be close to them emotionally too. She seemed a little curious by it, but I didn't think much of it. She said she respects that and we moved on. We went on a series of dates for about 4 weeks until the night we had sex for the first time. It was a bit awkward but overall not as bad as I expected. I kept asking her if there's anything I can do for her to make it more pleasurable, but she said it's fine. After she left my apartment, I sent her a text saying I had a great time. I haven't heard from her since almost 2 weeks. I feel absolutely terrible that I lost my virginity to a girl who gave zero fucks about me.

317,"I am in need of some advice, and I know this is going to be a bit long so please bare with me..

I work as a licensor overseeing a daycare, and I recently bumped into a girl that happens to be a site supervisor at one of these sites. It's no surprise to anyone that we have a liking for eachother, so we exchanged instagrams and were talking for a few days before we got eachother numbers. We hung out last week for the first time and it's getting fairly serious in the sense that we want to continue seeing eachother. I will also note that Im also in school and I WILL be quitting at the end of this year for school reasons. 

This poses a problem for myself, because as the licensor overseeing this day care center, people my think I am giving her special treatment (which is a respectable assumption but she really just does good work). So there is a conflict of interest to any bystandard looking at the situation.

I have two options here.. Either we keep our private life private and we just leave it alone for now. I would have to commit a lot of trust into this girl I'm seeing, which I do. But it is terrifying to think that it could blow up in my face if something goes wrong. Additionally, if we do keep it under wraps, I will have to avoid being seen in public with her as many of her friends are from the same work. I also feel like this can prevent me from fully being comfortable...

The second option is telling my boss that I've bumped into this girl and that I was thinking of hanging outside of work with her, and eventually date her. Then I'd ask if there was a way that I could have this particular day care swapped with another one from another licensor that way I have no control or power of her program and it eliminates the power differential. I'm slightly leaning towards this as I tend to be anxious and if I make it known now it will be much easier to figure out what I need to do as oppose to it potentially blowing up out of nowhere.

Our entire family became super distant from each other after me and my cousins started college a few years ago. Now because of ramadan, we have our usual family parties and i really dont want to attend any of them. My older cousins have been skipping them for years and got a ton of disappoimment and disrespect from the rest of the family for doing so. I know if i do the same then the same thing will happen to me. But frankly i honestly dont care, i dont care about what any of those people think anymore. There all fake, down to the bone. 

The thing is, my mom is very family oriented and she is annoyed with the fact that i dont want to go because shed be the mom of the child who doesnt want to show. Ive been wanting to skip out on these things for a while but i always end up going because i dont want her to be mad/sad. Were having a get together next week and i really dont want to go. I just told my mom and we got into a small fight about it.

319,"I’n 15 and a Freshman in highschool, Today my mom had originally taken all my stuff away for staying up too late for working on a school project. The past 2 days she has been going through all of my texts, Reddit posts, iFunny posts, etc. 

Yesterday she had wrote me a note with 6 things that she thinks is wrong with me and my personality. They included what my friends and I talk about, The things i find funny and other things that don’t concern her. Today she wanted to talk to me and told me that the things i find funny and how i act (when no one else knows or cares except herself) makes her look like an embarrassment. 

After finally making some friends this year she wants me to find new ones because she doesn’t   like the language they use (not around her only when texting and such) and she wants me to try and make new friends with the idiotic church we go to. Note that we’ve gone there for a few years and I genuinely don’t like the people there.

I think its ridiculous that she takes away everything I have, i understand the phone because i don’t pay for it. But she has taken away my PC that i paid for almost all of it. (My parents bought me my Processor which was $200/$1400) 

I don’t know what to do or say, she does this when my dad is about to go or has left for a business trip so I don’t have anyone to back me up.

320,"Sorry, 3 different issues, one megathread. 

**Divorce**: My wife of 4 years and best friend of 7 divorced me after she told me there was never any spark or romance. She essentially said she committed and she thought she could do it, but she can't. To be honest I think it was 50/50. I don't believe that what she's saying is true. I became depressed, addicted, and just a general misanthropic miser. 

A few years before the divorce I decided to make a change and start working on me. I was really a mess, but I could always hold a job, I just didn't...show my affection very well to my best friend. Over time, familiarity bred contempt and we just kind of...tolerated each other. I was still fine because I had a best friend, but she didn't have a lover...I didn't see it like that until recently. I kind of hate her for not pointing it out earlier. The papers are in, it's over, but it still hurts and if anyone has **ANY FUCKING ADVICE** on how my brain can force my heart to hurry this the hell up that'd be great. It's approaching the month since the divorce started.

**Job Boredom**: So I've been a teach for quite a while. I tried it, I tried ALL of it. Middle school, high school, college, GED. I'm over it, but it's all I know. I'm having trouble finding something that can keep me at my current quality of life. I don't like sales, and I really don't want to go into anyone's home \(I've done that shit, gross.\) My degrees are in ""Administration of Justice"" \(whoops\) and a Master of Ed. Social Studies \(god damn it\). I've worked with juvenile delinquents and sex offenders. I'm just over high emotional stress jobs like this. On the same side the thought of reading a phone script sounds pretty lame. I just am looking for some suggestions.

**New Romance**: So I met this woman on okcupid. She's got her own baggage, but everything has been real good.  Which brings me back to what my wife said to me...there was never a spark, well she didn't feel it, but I did...Now I feel it again \(in a MUCH different way\) with this woman. I'm so scared to date her though. I don't know the rules at this point how much is too soon? What are key benchmarks I should wait for if I'm going to do it right. In my head ignored one woman to death, so how do I avoid it with this one? At this point the best strategy I have is just to be straightforward and honest no matter what, and I have been with this woman...and it feels exhilarating. I know I'm smitten though, and I need to be careful because I'm still vulnerable. Any advice on the speed?",17May2018,3

323,"Hi, r/advice!

I recently started a new job at a media agency in February 2018. I am an account manager, managing client relationships. Now that I have been onboarded and trained, I have found that my workload is not enough. I like to be busy and have a lot on my plate. Recently, I found out that my agency gained a new client and was going to be hiring a project manager to, well, manage the client's projects. \(Who would've thought!\) I asked my supervisor if I could have a shot at this role, in addition to my current account manager role, because I would like to take on more work. My supervisor is allowing me the opportunity to explore this position on top of my current position. My new role of project manager will begin in a few weeks.

My question is: do I ask for more money? I will now be in a dual role of account manager/project manager. By requesting to take on the PM role, my supervisor doesn't have to hire and train a new employee, and the agency saves money because they do not have to fund a new employee's salary. Personally, I think that, yes, I should request more money. But I'm worrisome that this will come across as ""greedy,"" as I've only been with the agency for three months. I have a good relationship with my supervisor, but they are a tough negotiator.

I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts. If you're Team Ask For More Money, how do you suggest I go about doing so? Is there a specific dollar amount or percentage of my salary I should request? I've never been in this position before and I want to ensure I'm approaching it in a successful, professional manner.

**TL;DR: I've been at my current job for three months and offered to take on a second role. Since my agency doesn't have to hire/train a new person for this second role, should I ask for more money? If so, how do I respectfully \(and successfully!\) navigate this situation? Is there a specific dollar amount/percentage of my salary I should be requesting?**

Thanks in advance!",17May2018,2

325,"Hello guys, I am creation this via a new account to prevent anybody coming back to me.

I really have no idea where to start or how but here goes.

Since I was medically discharged from the Army 6 years ago I have literally smoked pot every day apart from the odd family gathering etc and recently I have decided it is time to knock it on the head once and for all. My SO has smoked it for about 3-4 years on a daily basis also, we both hold down full time jobs with respectable companies that are nationwide, looking to buy our first home at the end of the year all being well. My SO can easily stop any day she chooses and has done on various occasions but every time I attempt I fail on the same day or the following day without fail. 

I am planning for this post to have some reference to myself for when it gets hard to come back here and realise the bigger picture.

I honestly don't feel the cannabis has effected me, I have progressed well over the past 6 years gradually getting better paid jobs on progressing in life so I didn't think the cannabis needed to be stopped. For a few years I produced my own music and had quite a successful time in doing so which led to gigs around my country, so I kinda used the cannabis for my creative side of things, or that was my way of thinking and before you know it I'm smoking it every day. 

Me and my SO do not drink at all...literally never, so we always told ourselves hat we can spend about £60 a week and still be better off that going into town and drinking on a weekend so I think we kinda convinced ourselves to carry on with it.


There is times when we are away for the day and it really does not bother me at all, but the second I know we're going to be home I mentally rub my hands together knowing I'm going to be having a J soon. I will look forward to having one after I've finished work. Literally walk through the door, put my shorts on, stick the kettle on, skin up and be a living zombie till it's bed time.

The last few times I have attempted to quit I really struggle to sleep at nights, get really sweaty and done feel like doing anything apart from moan at my SO.

so...does any body have any tips or methods on how to do it the best way. I know it's going to be really hard but I want this.

334,"I spent two years at a local college studying Interactive Media and Game Design. The program had an emphasis on programming in C++ and designing games on the Unity engine. After a year and a half, I couldn't stand to be at this college. I had a TERRIBLE roommate that made my college experience miserable. During my second semester, my programming professor was fired for doing a poor job (half the class dropped the major, and the rest were behind in the more advanced classes). I was among the latter, and I struggled immensely in my last semester's Data Structures class. I fell so far behind that I began to give up, and I wound up leaving that school as a result. 

In hopes of getting a fresh start, I applied to two well-known schools for a major in media/film production (I always loved to edit videos in high school and wanted to incorporate that into my work). While I was accepted into both, I didn't receive enough financial aid for my family to be able to afford it. I've already taken one semester off, and now my options for schools are limited to state schools. 

So here's where I need advice: I don't know what to major in anymore. I'm hoping to find something that will actually land me a decent-paying job right after graduation. I've heard computer science might be a good option, but I don't know what sorts of jobs I could get with it and if my difficulties with programming would be an issue. Generally speaking, I would consider myself to be a creative person that traditionally has struggled in math over the years. I also love to help people and make their days brighter when possible.

336,"Hey all,

So I am in a dance band and we want to host a huge ""Dance Night""event later in the year and we are looking for ways to both increase the number of people attending as well as fund\-raise for the event.

I don't know if this is a feasible plan or if it is kind of scummy but here it is. 

We are offering ticket sales as a fundraiser to the event for other organizations. So ""Organization A""gets to sell tickets for us for the event at $20 dollars each and they can keep $5 of each ticket sold. I'm thinking of doing this across multiple organizations \(at least 30\) across many different cities with different targeted demographics so that there isn't an interference of selling areas. Of course the tickets can be bought through the band directly for $20 as well, but ""Org. A"" might sell to someone I would have never reached or known. For doing this, I'm thinking to offer the organizations a table where they can set up promotional materials and sell some of their merch, a set amount of free tickets provided to them for their members, as well as their logos on everything as sponsors/advertisers. 

Should I include something else for the organizations doing this for us or is incentive of a fundraiser enough?

Also, is there a name for this kind of selling/fundraising strategy of having others sell for you while taking a percentage?

To add to all this, an ex from years ago in my past, randomly emails me. I ignore it, because I don't want to talk, they didn't treat me very well and it would most likely bring me nothing but trouble. 

Cue to yesterday when I accidentally run into them while shopping (small town unfortunately) I was so caught off guard and anxiety was through the roof. I kept my cool as much as I could and made awkward small talk (I felt cornered to be honest, I wasn't expecting it), he said he emailed me and I had played dumb, he wanted my number as well, but I said I would rather just stick with email for now. That went on for several minutes until I said I had to get going and proceeded to have a full on panic attack in the frozen food aisle. 

He then sends me a long email detailing what happened to him. It consisted of the following:

Shortly after he broke up with me, he became addicted to oxycodone. 
Got with a bad crowd to keep from getting dope sick.
Proceeded to hang out with a girl he used to sell to. 
Said girl was pulled over and basically coughed up all the info she had on him, when the cops found drugs.
Turns out the girl was a minor.
He gets arrested and sent off to prison for almost 4 years for selling to a minor and I guess he was sexting her, so trouble for that as well. 
Now has to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life. 
Proceeds to tell me that he is sorry for what he did to me and that he thought of me a lot in prison and that he had a good thing and he fucked it up, yada yada yada…
Is basically trying rekindle romance again, but knows he would have to prove himself and that it might not even happen at all (Fun fact: IT WON'T) 
Wants to know my thoughts on the matter.

I know it seems really simple to solve, but my brain cannot compute all this shit right now. My anxiety is so high and I am so stressed out, I can't think straight. I need help phrasing what I want to say, because as I said, it is a really small town and I am probably going to run into him again. I don't want to date him at all. I don't even really want to talk to him, at best I can offer is friendship and I use that term loosely, like if I saw him in some public space, I would say hi just so shit isn't awkward. I had forgotten about him completely until this email fiasco happened. Now I am just flooded with bad feelings. I am trying to get myself to a happier place in life and this issue is a dark cloud for me. Please help me. Any advice would be appreciated, thank you.

So, i am only 15 yrs old (03) and i got a crush on this girl, right? normal. but i haven't felt any love for someone in probably four years because a shit long-distance relationship that wasn''t real love. 

we never talked to eachother that much and our mothers were best friends since they were kids so that probably has a reason to do with us being together. after a whole year. not long after our anniversary we broke up. we never kissed, and i was a very shy person back then and i guess i am a little bit shy now too. 


But that fucked me six ways to Sunday, but i was still not that sad about it weirdly.. like after one hour i was done with it and moved on. (Is that weird? for a 12 yr old?). So i started developing trust issues (i guess?). And after that i haven't felt something towards another person as special as a few weeks ago.


So she has been in my class 2 years now. Soon to be 3 years, in this high-school (Norwegians start middle/high-school at 13 (i think) so those who started this year is '04.. whatever.. this has nothing to do with this story, sorry). And she was in love with me in 8th grade. But she didn't have feelings for me (as i can recall, i am talking to her best friend and she could obviously hide stuff from me). Like, a few weeks ago. 

And a few days ago, i got invited to a party (i guess you could call it a party). around a lavvo (google it), And we played spin the bottle with my crush and 3 other people and her best friend is there and she want's to try to get us together. my crush already knows i like her. (and this is where my confusion kicks in). We had a great time, me and my crush. and she wanted to always take her behind the lavvo to talk to her multiple times. And i think that is weird. is it??. Anyways, we were going to play spin the bottle all five of us. and the bottle pointed to her, or me. and (INSERT_NAME_HERE) wanted her to kiss me on the cheek (as she does). Some turns afterwards the bottle turns to me and they want us to kiss... keep in mind that this was my very first kiss and my head just went like: WOW, WE ARE REALLY GOING TO DO THIS, MY BOY? ARE YOU EVEN READY???. And i went up to her and we kissed (with my teeth touching her lips... is that bad?, and i did the same the third time. More on that later). Her best friend says it's sweet that i can't kiss :P. Some turns afterwards, the bottle turned to a friend and the she could choose what other friend she wanted to kiss. And the one didn't want to so of course my crush's best friend suggested that me and my crush would kiss again. she accepted and i of course did too. i kissed a bit more normal but i didn't like peck my lips again. was too nervous i guess, couldn't focus. and 30 minutes passed and i was about to go and my crush's best friend wanted her to hug me as a goodbye hug, ya know. and the best friend whispered to me that i should after the hug kiss her on the cheek and say let's talk on snapchat. when the hug came and after that i just froze up and i just stared at her for a second.. and the she said ""let's do it"" or something like that. it was pretty inaudible. and then reached for a kiss. and i wasn't prepared and.. oooh shit.. there goes the teeth again.. well damn.. i couldn't say anything to her now i just said goodbye.

Now, i feel like this was very faked. probably because i thought this would never happen. It felt too good for me. and the last kiss i am not sure of if it were real or not. and if i were bamboozled for my first kiss... i meant that's fucked. Her best friend said my crush wanted to kiss me but now...lik..idk. Now i need help. is this real? Does this sound real? I have thought about it 2 days now. like... idfk.. please help me and my love life!

Holy **** that's when things got really, really uncomfortable. Tom became obsessed about the movie and started sending me clips, reviews, trailers, and knew everything about everyone in it. When we met up it was all he could talk about. He also started:

- Mirroring my every action. If I took a bite of food he would do the same thing. He ordered everything the same as me with the exact same words to the waitress.

- He revealed that he would talk to plants and they would sing to him, because he had no friends

- I commented that I liked the shirt he was wearing and he said he had burned the same shirt a few times before.

- He said really lewd inappropriate things out of nowhere and then dropped it.

- He told me his hobby was carving donuts into trees

- He showed me a handful of pills and said ""this keeps the bad people away"" and that he was diagnosed with some mental issues

- He told me that he ""would golf with the penguins if the summer didn't sit""

None of the above was joking.

Needless to say I was concerned and I tried to make sure Tom had a good time. I know that he's clearly got some serious issues. I don't want to be around him. Does that make me a bad person? Do I have a responsibility to be his friend?",17May2018,1
346,"My neighbor, and I, used to put our scrap metal in this open area that was part of the land I owned. I’m currently in the process of removing the junk from my property to pursue other ventures, namely raising livestock (approved by the bank 6 months ago!) . I have to tear out the dead/dying trees to install the pasture system. 

The neighbor in question was upset that I was tearing the mentioned trees, actually he was livid about it. It started as him being mad that he’s not getting a share of the $1500 I made from hauling the scrap metal, then he got pissed because he thought the trees were his. He called me every swear word in the book, and there were combinations of swear words I never knew existed in the lexicon of swearing. Yep, lots of F bombs too. 

I brought the surveyors out, and they found I was doing everything on my side of the property. He was pissed that things didn’t go his way, and he just left the area without saying a word. He later came by the house when I was getting ready to install the fencing. He gave me the basic, half assed “hey I’m sorry” apology. 

I was so upset with being the constant barrage of profanity coming my way from him, that I told him I don’t accept his apology. He was, as you might expect befuddled about not having the apology accepted, that he tried to continue making amends with me, and I really wasn’t in the mood to hear it. 

I told him that I’m not accepting the apology, for the time being, and I proceeded to tell him “get the hell off my property”, as for me there was nothing more to say between both parties. Now, he doesn’t even look at me whenever we cross paths, and so I kind of feel like the villain. Should **I** apologize now?? ",17May2018,2
347,"(wanna quickly clarify this is NOT asking for anything else other than advice) Hey, so my roommate urged us to use one of her accounts for bills and stuff that way we aren't all paying 30 different things with our own money, we agreed and it's a great idea but we need to pay our rent in cash (only recently found this out) and our roommate had forgotten her pin number for the account and had to transfer the money to my SO's account.  Our rents due today but nothing's in yet and I'm starting to worry, what should we do if the money's not in yet? ",17May2018,1
348,"So... I’ve wanted to talk about this with someone for a long time but i never found someone trustworthy, so I’m just asking for advice here.
Anyway, in middle school I was in this big friend group, where we would go out regularly have lots of fun and bond. We were so close that I personally thought that we would be friends forever. I remember having a conversation with my best friend out of the group (before high school starts) where he said something like :”high school starts and we will probably be in different classes. Do you believe that we will rift apart?” to which I responded:” it is a fact that we will make new friends, but don’t worry our friendship is too strong” or something like that.
Needless to say, the majority of our friend group was in the same class, but i was put in a different one. I still knew 2 kids that would hangout from time to time with us , but we weren’t the best character fits. I was in a class with lots of popular kids, but i tried to avoid them because they seem to have a strange “superior- inferior “ kind of relationship with their friends. During class I would mostly talk to girls, with most of whom I became friends, (as to some others that would crush on me).
However, i became really really good friends with the class clown and some other kid that lived close to my house, who very shortly after just hanging out once or something he joined every single club activities i was in. He joined the basketball team, the music band and he especially requested to be in the same after school extra class as me, which freak me out. Our friendship felt forced and I don’t like that he’s fake. Like, he suck up to the popular kids ,that treat him like shit and then explode to me and say really offensive things like I did something to him. I try to talk to him and sort things out, but he prefers to just shut up for a while and then start talking again to me like nothing happened.
On the other hand the “class clown” and  l really bonded on our shared taste of humor and the fact that we are free spirits (lol). (our friendship developed freely and normally)
I would still go over to the other guys with a super big smile and wanting to talk to them but they wouldn’t seem as excited and they would go as far as to ignore me. They shortly after stopped inviting me when they went out. As i saw that i decided not to disrupt them anymore as i was clearly being a nuisance.
As of now , i’m on my senior year and have a three musketeers friend group kind of thing with the class clown and the other dude. I’m still friendly with everyone on my class, as opposed to the 2 other dudes that I mentioned in the beginning that have completely cut themselves from the class. 
I surely don’t regret making new friends, but as the school year comes to an end and after graduating our roads will separate, I can’t stop thinking about what it would be like to still be part of that first group. 
thank you",17May2018,1
