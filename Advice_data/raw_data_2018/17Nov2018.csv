I'm not sure if this is the best subreddit to ask questions like this, but I thought I'd try.  Maybe I could even find someone here who's willing to gush over books or Poldark/The 100/The Walking Dead? :D

1,"I’m about to be 33 in a couple of months. And everything happening right now is weighing me down. 

After 4 years, I recently left a steady and somewhat good job, which had benefits, 401k, and paid $2 more than state minimum wage. The last year or so, I wasn’t very happy there due to increasing and demanding work load. The long hours, sometimes 10-11 hours, M-F. The lack of willing to change for the better on the employer’s part. And just the lack of advancement opportunities in my department or even more paid for all the work we were expected off. It was so bad, that the majority of the time we wouldn’t be able to take our one hour lunch. 

There was one day a month ago that the day to day grind just got to me that I had a nervous break down. I couldn’t do anything and I didn’t have the mental capacity to just keep working.

I needed out. But I didn’t want to quit without having a backup plan. So I re-applied at an old retail job I had 8 years ago. I was re-hired. Gave my two weeks. And started this old-new job a week ago.....

However, having come back to this job and seeing how shitty everything has gotten (it was shitty when I was there, just not so shitty) it made regret leaving my previous job. 

I just don’t know what to do to fix all this. I’m applying anywhere that looks better. But so far no calls. I’m getting depressed. 

I can’t talk to anyone - friends or family, about this because I’ll feel like even more of a loser...

What can I do? I feel so overwhelmed by how nothing is really working out or that I’m I’m turning 33 soon and I don’t have a steady job or even a career.

2,"So I live with my SO and one other roommate in my SO’s house. Our roommate is said slob. He’s messy, he doesn’t clean himself, or his room or his office. He smells like hot shit. His weed doesn’t help the smell. He keeps it inside but luckily smokes it outside. He doesn’t keep his bathroom clean. And we’ve talked to him a few times very informally about it and that’s helped but within a month he’s back at it again. We could technically afford to kick him out, but having the extra rent Money is super helpful. Plus he’s a good friend and I think if we evicted him he’d take it personally and stop talking to us. 

How do we approach him and kindly say “fix your shit or get out!” Without it sounding like an attack or he’s being ganged up on? ",17Nov2018,1
3,"Hello reddit. 

Yea, I know it's probably stupid. 

So i'll try to keep it as short as possible. Me and my girlfriend had a closure. We both tried to had sex while being unprotected and she was on the end of her period, but we decided to stop after first penetration. It was just one time i got in and then she wanted to use my fingers instead what I did. Everything was allright but the next day she had terrible car accident. She was in a coma for 3 days, and for 2 weeks in a hospital. She got a lot of medicine, and almost 2.5 liters of blood tranfused. Right now she tells me that her period is not in time by 1 week spready. 

Is it possible that she's pregnant after everything that happened? ",17Nov2018,1

When I look at the picture I look like a stranger like I am not a part of the family even though I am there and have my moms hand on my shoulder. It looks like I should be a part of the family but I'm not. It made me think I don't want to be in any more pictures with them.

My step brother has lived with my mom and step dad like half the time ever since he can remember and the other half with his mom. My half brother is their kid.

7,"Here goes, it's a long one.

My best friend was my college roommate. My dad passed away last year, and my best friend had been very supportive. Over the years, she has basically been a part of my family and we had invited her to spend many holidays with us, including last Thanksgiving. She declined because she was spending it with her boyfriend’s family, which was totally fine and not an issue between us. I have been living with my mom since my dad’s passing, and last year before Thanksgiving, I invited my friend over while my mom was also having friends over; she was thanking them for being there for her during my dad’s illness and passing. As my friend was leaving, my mom asked about her thanksgiving plans, and also asked my friend if she felt she was going to marry her boyfriend. My friend said maybe. My mother then went into a bit of a rant about how “maybe isn’t good enough” when you are thinking about marrying someone. My friend seemed to be fine throughout the conversation, and left shortly after. 

I texted her later and made sure she was okay. My mom also apologized to my friend the next morning for saying what she said, and that she thought of my friend like a daughter and that she was just feeling emotional about my dad. My friend distanced herself after that, and I honestly had no idea why for a few weeks. She kept cancelling our plans last minute, until finally I called her and confronted her. She said that she thought that I had been gossiping about her relationship to my mom, and that she had felt judged by what my mom had said. She said that I should have stopped my mom from saying what she said. I was taken aback, and started crying, which I regret. I felt horrible that my mom and I had made her feel that way, as I knew that what my mom had said what only really about my parent’s relationship (they were very happy and in love through everything). I apologized profusely and tried to express that of course I wouldn’t gossip about her relationship, especially to my mother. My friend had confided in me in the past that she was having doubts about her relationship. 

We eventually saw each other after that and we seemed to put it behind us. She said that we didn't need to talk about it anymore and it was all good. Hoever, now it’s been a year since this has happened, and we barely speak or see each other. I thought things would return to normal after we made up, but she stopped reaching out basically immediately after this happened. I didn't press the issue further because I feared rejection from her, someone who I considered one of my closest friends, while also dealing with the one year anniversary of my dad’s passing and the holidays (my dad died 2 weeks before Christmas in 2016). Now I wish I would have confronted her about the new way she was treating me sooner, as she has basically rejected me anyway, but I was in such a fragile state it was hard to get out of my own head. 

After all of this, I would reach out as normal, and she would be nice and respond, but she never reached out to me in the same way. Since this has happened, I have been extremely sad and depressed. Not only have I lost my father, but now one of my closest friends is gone as well. What did I do wrong? How do I move forward? I would love some advice. Please let me know if you have any follow up questions or anything! ",17Nov2018,1

11,"Hey, so if I'm 100% honest I never really cleaned up my room. My parent's have always hated it but were never really strict about it. Anyways, I've only ever really been grounded for like 2 weeks at a time and it's always for not cleaning up my room by the day my mom tells me to. 

This last time I had a day off from school at the beginning of this month and my mom told me that if I didn't have the upstairs clean by the end of the day than I would be grounded for the rest of the month. Long story short, I had swim practice that day, fell asleep when I got home (oops), and did homework the rest of the night before going to asleep again. So she grounded me. 

Now I'm grounded for all of December too because we have family coming over today and I was told the upstairs had to be clean by Thursday. Last night I had a swim meet (got home from school around 8) and did homework until 10 or so. I fell asleep, woke up at 3, and cleaned until like 6. Then I did homework again (I had a test today) until I had to leave for school. But my mom said I did a ""half assed"" job of cleaning the upstairs and grounded me for another month. 

If you can't tell by now I'm a really messy person. I hate to admit it, but it's true. And my room is way worse than it should be a lot of the time. But I really don't think 2 months of no friends and nothing but school and home is fair. I'm going to be grounded on Christmas and I'm grounded for my thanksgiving break. My friends are smoking weed, drinking, having sex, and I've never done any of those things but I get in more trouble than they do when their parents catch them for worse things. 

I respect my parents and I usually do really good in school (i'm taking AP's and Honors) so I'm really upset that my mom is making this such a big deal. This year school has been really hard because I moved to a new school and it's so much more challenging (so I don't have all A's anymore). So I'm stressed at school, crying in the bathroom all the time because I failed some physics test I studied my ass off for, or got a D on a paper I tried really hard on. And now I'm upset at home because I'm stuck here with my mom yelling at me every minute for some mess I didn't clean up or a room I didn't tidy good enough. I can't escape from school and I can't escape from my house; two things that cause me the most stress, so I'm feeling really upset. Idk if I should try to get over it or what. It feels like overtime I get over being upset with my mom, we get into an argument a few days later and it starts all over again. I'd rather just talk to her as little as possible these next few months and avoid it altogether. ",17Nov2018,1
12,"I ended my relationship of 2 years today. He is 26 and I am 21. I felt I was being emotionally abused. Now I'm not so sure if it really was emotional abuse, or if I was overreacting. I'm afraid I made the wrong choice, and ruined everything. So, basically things were okay when he would leave for work during the week and come home on weekends, when he'd be laid off is when things were rough. We would argue constantly, if I didn't feel something he said was nice or right, he wouldn't want to talk about it. I started standing up for myself the past few months, not allowing things to slide. So that's why we were arguing more, normally I'd just go with it if he made rude or dumb comments to me. If I told him he was emotionally abusive after making accusations or getting mad over stupid reasons he'd go off and say things like, ""why are you still here then?"". I'd tell him no one is going to want to put up with that crap forever, and he would say something similar like ""leave then"". He didn't know how to communicate in a healthy way, and it often left me frustrated, angry, and worried for our future. He also accused me of cheating over stupid reasons, he was very jealous and insecure. He got to the point where he would apologize for his behaviour which is step in a good direction, but I found the behaviour kept on and I was constantly hearing I'm sorry. We also had really great times together though, I could be myself completely around him. He knew everything about me. I didn't need makeup, which is huge because I have very low self esteem and am hideous without makeup. I didn't have to shave my legs or armpits, he wouldn't get grossed out. He would tell me I was beautiful, make me feel beautiful, compliment me and tell me I'm smart, etc. Encouraging about me starting college and whatnot. I feel like I messed up by breaking up with him, I have a hard time making decisions and expressing my feelings during situations like this and I didn't even give him much reason or anything to why I dumped him and I feel terrible. The words just wouldn't come out. He also just lost his mother a month ago, and I feel horrible about doing this now given the circumstance. I feel like maybe he was finally being who I needed him to be, and that I messed up by leaving him... He used to drink and get black out drunk, and verbally abuse me and push me around, but he stopped doing that 6 months ago. He would still drink at least once a month behind my back, he would lie when I'd ask him about it but claims it was okay because he was just at home not out partying. It still hurts me because of how he used to treat me when drunk, I felt it wasn't fair. But I also feel bad for holding grudges, I feel he should be allowed to have drinks with his friends.

19,"I’m starting to wonder if I’m a good fit for my current job.  Sorry for the vagueness but I’m trying to keep anonymity here.  I have a very open personality and talk about health issues, admit when I’m having a tough day, etc.  My current supervisors have pointed out a few key times when I’ve over shared personal information with my staff, and even the families of people I work with.  They view it as problematic that I’m talking with staff about anything personal. 

I have been a therapist for years, and I’ve not had problems with talking about myself too often.  It’s a 45 minute session once a week, and it’s easy to hold back when you have focused time limits...but the context is different now, as I’m with the same people all day. You build a level of familiarity with the staff you supervise since there’s only one or two other people working with you for most of the day.  I used to feel comfortable with my staff, but now I’m having reservations about being a supervisor. 

Apparently one or more of my staff (I specifically know of one because the information that was spread was only shared with one person) have been telling my supervisors when I’m mildly complaining about work or talking about my personal life.  The problem is that I feel like I’m not doing anything that other people don’t do, I’ve heard my supervisors talking about themselves plenty...but it seems like I’m the only one getting flack for it.  It also feels quite petty that one of my staff in particular is talking to their old supervisor directly, who’s now my supervisor.   Another staff has told me specifically that she prefers me to my supervisor (her old supervisor) because she feels like I respect her more as a person.  We’ve had a conversations about this issue during supervision meetings in the past and I feel like I’ve done better at specifically keeping any complaints about work to myself. 

The most recent issue was involving an incoming person who comes weekly to work with one of my clients.  This worker told my supervisor that I follow her around while she’s working to talk (decidedly not true), and I’ve interrupted her sessions to talk about myself (not entirely true).  She asks about how I’m doing and say hi, has come into my office to check in with me, and other personal things at times.  I’ve said hello and poked my head in briefly when the door is open when they’re working, I’ve defiantly responded to the ‘how are you?’ questions, but NEVER followed them around or knocked on a closed door to talk.  There was a comment I made yesterday, which was a suggestion for a potentially motivational ‘competition’, which I would participate in with the clients in my care.  Just a suggestion from me thinking it could be fun, but she did not say anything negative or positive.  Instead, it set her off to talk to my supervisor about ALL of this, and implying that I have boundary issues.  However, she was in the bridal party of the client’s wedding and frequently hugs both of my supervisors, gives them gifts, etc. 

All this has led to another awkward supervision meeting with both supervisors about oversharing in general.  They surprised me first thing in the morning, without advance notice, by showing up in my office and waiting for me to get in.   It’s not the first time I’ve been ambushed like that.  They also both emphasize how I need to inform them of every little thing that happens but they don’t always keep me in the loop about things that are pertinent to me.   They failed to teach me how to properly do my job, but gave me flack for not being prepared with paperwork during an audit without assistance from them...that they were freely offering.  They ask me at these surprise supervisions about how they can help me or what I need supervision on, but I’m always caught off guard and am stumped in the moment for an answer.  

I’m frustrated with their supervisory style, and how they expect me to conform to their level of keeping conversations with everyone at work impersonal.  I’m upset that other folks I work directly or indirectly with, seem to feel like my behavior is a problem, and they feel better about tattling on me instead of addressing it directly like adults.  I’m angry that my supervisors are listening and believing second hand info, that is probably being exaggerated or taken out of context.   I’m upset that my supervisors don’t seem to be addressing the ‘tattling’ dynamic with the staff person that continues to report everything I do.  

Am I totally out of line and should I just stop talking to everyone?  Do you think problems are because I’m the newer person in a preexisting dynamic between supervisors and staff?  Is this a case of ‘everyone wants to talk about themselves but no one wants to listen’ mentality? I’m honestly not sure if I can handle working with these people much longer if this continues in spite of now making my best efforts to fix things and still stay true to myself.  It is exponentially adding to my stress levels lately.  

Thanks in advance for the advice!

TLDR; am I really over sharing and have poor boundaries...or am I surrounded by poor supervisory styles and gossipy staff members?",17Nov2018,1

Some good from the homies (of course the homies will approve) and some bad from family.  My folks were so against me having a car with blemishes and that makes noise from the exhaust.  I mean, i didn't want to make payments so I bought a car from someone so I could only worry about insurance and gas.  I went behind my family's back (they told me not to buy it, it is ugly, i can do better, etc) and bought the car off of whim.  I actually enjoy having the car and hid it from my father for about the first week.  I had come home and parked around the corner, usually he takes me to work.  I had to decline his rides because i began to drive myself.  The feeling was BLISS.  Eventuallyi came clean because i was driving dirty having not registered the car yet and it was going to be insured in their name anyway so i told them about it.  Their expression ""alright"".  More so I am happy you have a car, but when it breaks down don't say i told you so.  MY family buys their cars from dealerships which i do not see the reason.  I mean its like paying for a rental. I tried persuading them for their benefit not mine, but they never listen so they got stuck in debt between car notes, ins. and gas.  So i do the same ""hey don't say i didnt tell you so.""

27,"I fucked up big.

Yesterday, a friend (f) of mine is part of a group who collects those cases to help the victims on my university. Not legally, but they help the victims through all the process. A very few people know, but she trusted me and told me, because the person accused (m) is very close to me (I'm his ""mentor"", every year I give him my class notes, exercises, and we often talk about very sensitive things. At the start of the career everyone chooses his mentor -another 2nd year student- and this relationship is maintained until the mentor graduates). In the other hand, she's my best friend and she trusted me.

The thing is, it really fucked me up. I'm a very sensitive person and I needed to talk to someone about this. I'm sad and shocked. I could not keep it to myself and I felt that I really needed to share this, and I did it with the other person who I am mentoring, who is equally close to me.

The thing is, all this stuff is still confidential, but the person I told and the accused one are very close too and he wants to tell him. I'm afraid the person accused is going to talk to the victim, which could cause more harm. He (the one I told) promised me he will wait at least a week but he does not know if he'll be able to keep it to himself more time.

I know this is all my fault, it's giving me anxiety and I sincerely want to kill myself right now. I don't know what to do. I fucked up big. I'm afraid of what could happen.

30," I am not sure what to think about this but i am tired of making friends.  I am tired of people in general. I use to be naive and trusting people  but i do get taken advantage of. I was one of those people who'd die for  others or give my last amount of food even though i was starving. I  think as a teen this gave me a reason to live. I hated my life and i  wanted to die but seeing smiles on peoples faces changed that. Later in  life i got into a Admin role online and man online felt cruel i thought i  was a good leader, someone compassionate but i realized i had to put my  foot down a lit which made people lash out i gave many chances but  sometimes they just had to be kicked out. I did have people help me  called Mods but as much as they were their to help it felt like they  were just work friends or co-workers. So i left them after a while and  stopped being a leader or even wanting to be in that role ever again.  Being in charge of people made me hate people because no matter what i  did someone got upset. I always heard ""You either die a hero or live  long enough to see yourself be a villain"" and i felt that happened. I  hated people and people who i felt i could trust seemed to back stab me.  I dunno if its because i put all my eggs into one basket but i did. I  thought id be friends for years but when they turn around and say they  dont need you anymore then i dunno. I had a girlfriend but it never  worked out she was in a bad place in her life and i felt no matter what i  did to make her smile things got worse. Eventually i started to only  care about sex but im not willing to go out and get it. Being around new  people is starting to make me hate them even if they did nothing. I  dont trust a soul not even my own family. I have no reason to act this  way but the only friends i have are my grandmother and i take care of a  kid. I cant process stress properly i mean ive gotten better i do  believe their are good people out in the world but i question if im a  good person now. I am trying to live a peaceful life and all but i see  myself doing it alone. Someone i recently argued with told me that with  all my ""im lonely, i have no confidence, i have no friends"" that i  actually dont want friends and just use people and that i am attention  seeking parasite. But doesnt everyone want attention? I am thinking  about going through life being a lone wolf and learning to just be alone  and happy being alone. I hear you can deal with life and stress better  on your on without people bugging you i hear that friends are overrated  and some get in your way that being alone helps you grow and love  yourself. I know im not a saint i tried to be in the past but lastly  anytime i have a friendship if i get insulted or attacked i just leave. I  may try to talk about it and clear things but ive gotten sooooo use to  if their is a problem i leave as quickly as possible and never speak to  them again. Its how ive lived recently it never mattered how close we  were because i feel if im getting hurt they will do it again. 

 
I try to be as open minded  as possible. Whatever someone does as long as it hurts nobody I see as  OK. I suppose I talk about myself a lot when meeting people I mean I  don't know what else to say half the time I just like to be asked  questions and then I figure something will come up that we have in  common. I'm unsure if I should talk about the other person more or not I  have read a couple of books on friendships but part of me deep down  sort of feels like this is all a waste of time. Like I should rather  focus on my career, improving my health and making myself smile. Last  weekend I went out alone, just me and nobody else I heard doing that  builds confidence like you won't NEED people always there around you.  Also I'm afraid of meds I always liked talking things out instead. I  just wish I had a solution I do think of making tons of friends but man  is it work and I feel like all that effort is just going to go down the  drain in the future from a big argument.",17Nov2018,1
31,"So this past year I went to the doctor a quite a few times, my mom usually handles my Bill's and always had, she never sat me down or taught me how to do anything. Now, I was expecting to pay some doctor bills but I never knew how much, shes never added it up her self and never told me how much I owe besides a rough estimate of 2-3 grand, than 5 grand 6 grand and 7 grand in total, , she never gives me exact numbers, and always keeps my rent, doctors Bill's and two things I broke separate( hence 2 grand here 3 grand here 1 grand here). I've been suffering from depression. Just had a suicide attempt 3 months ago. And self harm issues for about 10 years. I'm 21, finished school for welding but becuase of my mental health I can't hold down a welding job. So I'm working at a fast food restaurant. Now, it's been a year since I went to the doctor alot. A year.

So, yesterday when I confronted her on how much I owe, she said she would do it this weekend. (I've asked her before and she never did) this time i made a scene about it. She grabbed the booklet with all the Bill's in it. She started going over them in the nose bitchy tone, treating me like a kid. She sets down the stack in front of me, when I go to pick it up she takes it back and I grab on to it and hold on to it, she says ""wait there's more"" I said just let me look at these while you get the other ones, she continues to pull the papers away after she already set them down in front of me. I slam my hands down and tell her to just fucking give me them so I can look it over myself(she never let's me do many things myself so I've distanced myself from her the past 10 years becuase she keeps treating me like a kid) things escalate and I chuck a metal piece on the ground and start yelling at her more as she starts yelling at me and takes the Bill's away. My dad steps in trying to defuse the situation and my mom keeps yelling g at this point I'm pretty calmed down but shes still freaking out. After my dad leaves the house shes talking to herself swearing. And I leave the house shortly after and come back when she goes to bed.

Now, today she comes down to me and has a sheet with everything added up, it's at $8,000 and she over estimated the two things I broke by double. Which changed from what was originally written down on the cabinet with my rent. But never my doctors Bill's. She also says I have to pay for my phycitrist which I've never had to pay for nor has she ever written those down before and even says there's even more. And she stopped adding rent from July and since it didn't keep going up I've been saving money the past month so I could start paying off some of my dues and than she adds up the rent she stopped accounting for a while ago which was a main reason why I even tried to start paying it off was becuase it was ""frozen"" which just added another grand.

So now I'm out $8,000. from what I thought was only 2-3 grand in total. And I still have to live with my parents.

What the actual fuck am I suppose to do, is there any legal action? Is there anything I can do? I'm at a loss if I should just pack up my shit and tell her to fuck off and pay for it and move out. Just went out for a drive and came back and I had a serve urge to just crank the wheel and see what happens and hope I die. I'm on medications, from a doctor who gave me 8 pills a day, which my therapist with a master's degree said that my brain is ""fucked up"" and I'm trying to get a new doctor who is better and can actually help me, that will take 4 months which my mom said she will give a call to which she has sent done, since I've asked her 2 months ago. My therapist last month quit her job after surgery. So I have to re explain to why I tried to kill myself 3 months ago and everything that's happened since. I can't go into partial patient treatment becuase, well becuase the absolute last thing I'm going to do is add another 2-4 grand in doctors bills. Alot of my mood swings, extreme anger outbursts and borderline delusional thinking is from a change in my medications 3 months ago.

 I'm also working 38 hours a week, live in the US, Wisconsin to be more specific. And I have no idea what to do",17Nov2018,1
33,"Hi, 
Very new to reddit but someone suggested that this is a good place to get advice. 

Long story short, my mother in law started hearing spirits/ghosts in her house in the middle of the night about a year ago. She is engaged and started staying at her fiancés house after hearing loud banging and noises in the middle of the night. She is convinced it is spirits. My father in law did die in the house from cancer 5 years ago. I am not sure if I have ever believed her about the spirits but she is still really shook up about them. 

Now to where I need advice. My wife is now convinced that we have the same spirits in our house and calls me almost daily at work (she is a stay at home mom) saying that she heard this or that. I always ask her what she wants me to do and the conversation goes nowhere. Tonight it has gotten even worse because she is convinced that our daughter (18 months) hasn’t been sleeping good because of the spirits and now has our daughters crib in our room. Also on the way home from dinner my wife was hinting around about how she doesn’t want to live anymore because of everything going on with the “spirits”. I try to talk to her and it always ends up in an argument. What do I do to be supportive? 

I do not believe in the “spirits” but want to have a happy healthy home. We are upper middle class, no drinking or drug abuse, if that’s what people are thinking.

38,"I am a 17 year old girl. I don't think I have real friends. I don't actually fall in love with people. Something seems to be wrong with me, like in a 'I'm thinking about things wrong' or 'I'm not fully myself' kind of a way. I'm fairly introverted, and I've always considered myself to be someone who seeks close, meaningful friendships...but sometimes I feel like that's just an idea, because I don't really have any. 

I've isolated myself very well, there have been times when people have reached out to me and tried to get to know me but there's something about this that I'm so very disinterested in, and so I just distance myself. Like it feels so artificial and I hate saying it but I just don't care about trying to get to know people, I guess it feels so fake, I don't know how to be vulnerable or myself or feel actually connected to anyone...I can't remember what it feels like to be really happy and connected with people. I often feel very selfish because I'd rather retreat into my little cocoon and be with myself and my world...it's just that trying to be friends with people hasn't seemed to bring me any more peace or happiness anyways. I don't really fall in love, like it seems that every crush I have (dear god I hope someone relates to this) is a choice, like I just choose to kinda go along with it and be flirty with them and try to get their attention, almost like I'm completely acting, because I want something, anything to happen to me, if that makes sense. And then with these crushes/relationships, I always feel an impulse to try and get these people to admire me or feel concern for me in some way...it's awful, I know. 

I guess I just want to know what I'm doing wrong, what is wrong with me at this stage in my life? Why don't I connect with anyone? Does anyone relate? Any thoughts?

41,"I turn 18 years old in 18 days. Up to this point, my life has been fairly terrible. 

I was born with an ultra rare skull birth defect that left me with moderate facial disfigurement as a result of the surgery to save my life. 

This has led to my life just being a constant cycle of bullying and harassment.

This may be strange but I didn't really understand the true value of friendship until I was around 12ish solely because friendship was nonexistent in my life up to that point.

My parents separated at age 7. My mom threw me away into a ""therapeutic"" boarding school (otherwise known as residential treatment centers) when I was 12 and I've been in for years and won't be free 

until June when I graduate high school (7 years). She constantly lies about ""how much she cares"". My resentment for her has no bounds. I can not describe how fierce my hatred is for her.

I have moderate social anxiety and pretty much have no friends no matter how hard I try (probably because of my appearance as I stated earlier).

I don't like my diagnosis' to define me but to show you how much I have on my plate internally, I'm bipolar (cyclothymia to be exact) with some borderline characteristics (apparently), I'm fairly paranoid when it comes to other people's intentions, suffer from extreme depression, etc.  

The only family member I cared about and who cared about me (my grandmother on my mom's side) passed away in February and I've been suffering from PTSD on top of the other things.

I feel like I'm losing my mind because everything like my paranoia, depression, etc. has been getting signicantly worse at a pretty fast rate and I can't get help because my mom won't let me leave the school aside from the weekends when I come home so that I can get a new mental health evaluation and start therapy. 

Looking back at my life up to this point, it's just been a miserable mental hellscape where everyone, including my own family, hates me. 

Hell, I had a random peer peg a snowball at me and call me a name for literally no reason this morning. I just ignored it because I'm so used to stuff like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

This comes at a time where I'm actually doing the best I've ever done at... well.. life. I've been in a vocational class / college course for 2 years doing IT and cybersecurity (I have my A+ and I get my Security+ in June).

I have a part time job at Target. I was elected as a Parliamentarian for my local SkillsUSA chapter. I'm doing student council at my home school. I did all this to keep myself busy but I feel like I'm

losing a grip on myself to keep these good things going.

&amp;#x200B;

So those are the internal struggles..

&amp;#x200B;

Now here are the external struggles.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to have zero family support when I graduate high school (I'd rather die than rely on any of them again if I even had the choice tbh), I live in New York so a job at Target won't pay bills, I don't even have my learner's permit

because my mom refused to bring me because she doesn't want to do anything for me aside from take me on the weekends, I won't be able to afford a car, and I'm very unlikely to find an entry level IT job to advance my career.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm leaving high school with:

&amp;#x200B;

No friends

&amp;#x200B;

No family

&amp;#x200B;

No money

&amp;#x200B;

No home

&amp;#x200B;

Very little hope of moving forward with my career

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As negative as all of this sounds, I do want to try and improve my situation. I believe there is some hope. Very little but at least some. I want to be successful and I want to be happy. Likewise, I would love nothing more than to see the despair in my family's faces when they realize they failed to tear me down. It's the most pleasurable form of vengeance in my situation. As of right now, my plan has literally just been based on the dim hope I could find even just a simple entry level IT job with the certifications I'll have (which is very unlikely). If I'm being honest, the truth is that I have no clue what the fuck to do to get myself out of this mess.

&amp;#x200B;

What's some advice you can provide me with? Do you have any personal experiences you'd like to share? What are some resources I can look into for some of the problems I'm facing?

&amp;#x200B;

I hate for this thread to seem so negative but I really do want things to get better. I just want to be successful. I don't want my hard work and resilience to be for nothing.

Thanks in advance.

in December of last year, I met a guy and we really hit it off. he was super busy most of the time but about mid-February, we finally ended up going in an official date. I'm not new to the dating scene. I was 21F at the time and I would consider myself somewhat charismatic but most of the time I end up not liking the guy back. I was so surprised to find how quickly I fell for this new guy. Let's call him John. We went on dates and got along really well our sense of humor was the same and I for the first time in my life could see myself dating someone long term. He was interesting and I felt I could trust him. I ended up losing my virginity to him in March and I only slept with him once. We went on one more date after and he ended it, ""We can still be friends,"" he said.

I'm not upset he ended it. I'm not even upset that I had sex with him. In the end, he always made me feel like I was a chore. In fact, my ""rebound"" ended up being the love of my life who I've been with for the last 8 months and they've been the best months of my life.

My problem is. I feel like I have some sort of PTSD from John. I was so scared to lose my virginity (even though I was ready) When we were about to have sex I remember I completely lost feeling in my entire body and we had to stop. Sometimes I'll be sitting in school and I can't help but think about John and those moments between us and also the fear I remember from having sex for the first time. I feel so guilty. I love my boyfriend so much but I feel like I have an imprint on my mind from John.

I feel like I was tricked by him. Like I wasn't important and I can't stand that I let myself fall for someone like that. I had been so careful with who I trusted and given myself to.

Im the kind of person that likes to be alone and do my own thing most of the time and he might understand that. But i dont want to be a complete asshole.,17Nov2018,1
58,"My friend reconnected with me recently. Someone close to them has recently passed and they were trying to find money to help with the funeral. I offered as it was only a small amount but they kept coming back for more and I stupidly helped them to the point where they now have a large chunk of my savings.
I hadn’t heard from them for a few days and of course I was worried and then I received a text saying that they tried to kill them self. I’m really conflicted because I’m worried about my friend dying but also I’m worried that I won’t get my money back. I feel really bad and selfish about it.

My question is should I try and get a job first and explain I'm moving and hope they can be flexible with starting dates and then find a apartment or do I use the money I have and find a place to live first and cross my fingers I find a job before my savings runs out? I only have myself no friends or family in the area to fall back on. I can find pros and cons to both approaches but I don't want to risk my future and fresh start by starting out wrong.

60,"I'd like keep this short, I live in New Jersey, i've always had a huge infatuation with him, we'll call him James (23M) and it only grew more so over the years. He's black, handsome, 6'1, into basketball, into hiphop/rap/trap music, everything that i'm into. I'm a Mexican (22M), i'm a man fan, but I'm usually attracted to Black men, hood boys, really tough masculine guys. I choose to identify as straight for more safer reasons, and I'm not really disgusted by pussy I don't mind it, more so gay in the ladder. James has always had his girlfriend, but he always cheated on her and she always took him back. I've always been in love with his personality, looks, and his charisma. He can pull so many girls w/o trying it's not even funny. There are some other openly gay guys that even go crazy and go to the extent of buying him anything he needs (I'm guilty of that as well.) He's just popular. I always go out of my way dating girls, but it's really just for him and for his entertainment. I could or could not care about those girls, but it the end it was really for him. So we can stand together with the prettiest girls (Don't judge me please, I'm just telling the story, no girls that I dealt with got hurt) My crush for him only grows deeper as we get closer and it's always been in my mind for him to fuck the living shit out of me. We weren't always close, but recently we've been closer and closer. He's made fun of me before cause i'm more sensitive than most of his friends, and called me a faggot before in the past, because he thinks that I act and think like a girl. He also acts ""gay"" when out other friends but rarely/never towards me, and we used get into really big fights, so our relationship was always on/off. but I couldn't stand the fact of not seeing him but we still hung out every single day. After a big fight, of me yelling at the top my lungs at him, I would text him what are you doing, then he would reply. which is kinda weird but we always hung out everyday so whether I had to buy him something he liked, like basketball gear or get food and eat out we did. I needed him because I felt like he protected me, although he would be mean to me, i felt safe around him. (we live in NJ) Then, he moved to Canada for a year and I was devastated. But I followed him there and bought a plane ticket, I visited him twice. I've helped him a lot through out the years, and he has grown a lot as a human ever since he moved. After my 2nd visit, we didn't talk for 6 months, that's the longest we've never talked. I ignored him because I was just tired of it all. He visited home (NJ) 3 times and he never hit me up, instead he visited his other friends and family, so I believed he didn't care, and I was furious but I let it go. Two months ago he moved back for good, and then he messaged me after he found out I was hanging out with a mutual friend. Once we hung out, we started really talking about anything and everything. We don't really argue as much anymore, it's more laughs now a days, but I really know everything about him, his family, his friends, his complications with his girlfriend, so I've always been there for him. I'm just so confused whether he really likes me or not. People say he uses me and I used to think that too, but it's me who has always offered whatever so I don't necessarily believe he uses me, because it's really simple to say no. I believe that there is a bond but it's never gonna be spoken about unless the right time. It's as if he has a soft spot for me. But I know I'm different from all of his guy friends I'm more sensible. So we always have deep deep deep convos. I just get him. What should I do? I don't want to be always hoping and wishing he'll love me all my life. We're getting really old, and maybe I should let go and just keep him as a friend? He always calls me all the time and talks to me so it's really hard, and we've just been getting closer, but this has been going on for far too long.

64,"I’m writing this on a throwaway because my husband sometimes browses reddit and I wouldn’t want him to see this. This a bit long as I’m trying to think of the best way to really explain it. 

I don’t know where to start but I don’t feel comfortable talking to any of my friends or family about this partly because I’m not sure how to feel about it. Which brings me to seeking some objective opinions. 

My husband is a wonderful man. He encouraged me to return to school to pursue a career in which I would be much happier than I was in my old one. I am going full time which means that I am not working, I’m a year in so no turning back now! I am also pregnant. Due in March, and I am starting to look pregnant (this will be relevant later). 

I have to ask to be able to buy anything or go anywhere. I have a debit card which is linked to my husband’s account so I am not allowed to do any frivolous spending, I can go to the grocery store but I can’t go shopping or get my nails done or anything like that without asking. Understandable as he is the one making money. Now, he works for himself and does not have a steady paycheck or salary so I’m not sure how much we have but we are definitely not struggling. 

I don’t know if I’m being materialistic or selfish or rude by thinking it’s a bit unfair to always be told no. I can’t do or buy anything for myself. If I do it must be cheap or every once in a while. Now I know my husband works hard and is entitled to anything he wants. He buys himself a new truck every year, I am still driving a 2004 Toyota. It runs well, I will say that but it’s almost 15 years old and my husband has a brand new SUV every year. He attends a very expensive gym, about 150 a month. I mentioned wanting to go with him and I am told to work out at home. Which I can, so I didn’t make a big deal about it. He gets weekly golf lessons in addition to golfing with his friends every weekend, he also plans very expensive hunting trips (he goes with his dad and brothers and I want him to go, they have a great time together). 

My friends recently wanted to take a weekend girls vacation to the beach, a few hours drive from where we live and I was told that I can’t go because we can’t afford it. I get it, it’s a frivolous trip but it hurts that I can’t do anything fun meanwhile he buys and does all these things for himself. I made something up as to why I couldn’t go because I didn’t want to say that my husband won’t let me. As he’s friends with their husbands and I didn’t want to cause any drama. 

I also asked recently if I could buy myself some new clothes and bras as I’m getting bigger. If you’ve ever been pregnant, you’ll understand. He asked me if I could just make what I have work or ask some friends if they have any clothes I can borrow. I know I could but why can’t I get some new clothes for myself? And I don’t feel comfortable asking friends to borrow their bras. It’s little things like that that don’t really seem to matter (like I have to get my hair cut at Supercuts, I gave up coloring it when I quit my job) but over time I’m beginning to feel like it does? I don’t know how to explain it but I know he works and it’s his money to do with what he pleases but I’m his wife. He encouraged me to quit working to go back to school. He does support me, bills, mortgage, my phone bill and insurance so I feel guilty asking for more. I would understand if we were struggling but he does all these things for himself, I brought up getting a part time job but he wants me to focus on school and doesn’t want me gone at night. 

Now, I brought up Christmas the other day because I’m in charge of buying gifts for our family. I asked what he wanted and he told me a few things but also added that he’s not getting me anything because he’s paying for my textbooks next semester. Textbooks aren’t covered by financial aid. Also, I said once that after I graduate and am working and after my loans are all paid off I would like a new car for myself. This was after he brought home his newest car, sometimes I get to drive it though. He said that after the loans are paid I should save my money and buy him a cabin as a gift to him for supporting me. 

Am I wrong to feel hurt? To feel like I have to live on bare bones and not do anything for myself for the next 3 years while he does anything and everything he wants? 

I feel ashamed to think this because I’m not trying to be materialistic, it’s just starting to seem unfair. I’m not trying to compare myself to others but he has colleagues and friends who’s wives also don’t work and are able to do much more than I am. I’m not trying to go shopping everyday or drain the bank account but doing something for myself or getting some new clothes every once in a while without having to ask permission would be nice. I’m not working now to eventually make more money in the future. So we can have a nicer life and I can contribute and work a career that I’m happy in.

I don’t even know how to talk to him about it. I don’t know what to say because it sounds so selfish, like I’m being unappreciative. 

Any thoughts? ",17Nov2018,1
65,"No personal information because I'm far too nervous that people from work will see this.
I work in a small-ish doggy daycare. I adore the job. I love the dogs, my coworkers, the work, it's amazing.

My old boss was never around. He came in to pay us sometimes or he would come around the holidays when he knew we needed help. Though he wasn't around ever, he knew all the dogs and the people, was an amazing dog trainer/handler and was mostly decent.


He sold the business and didn't tell us until the paperwork was signed and the new guy was coming in. He went so far as to give him a tour when none of us were around, and when our groomer saw them he told her that he was a ""friend"" who wanted to see the place.
This new guy has absolutely no experience. Never owned a business, knows nothing about animal care, knows nothing about dog behavior and training. His only dog experience is that he has one.  He is a very secretive guy.


Him and my recently-quit manager had a secret chat that he insisted on getting, she wasn't allowed to use it when any of us were around because he didn't want us ""snooping"".  He forced her to put a password on her phone so that ""we wouldn't find out what they were talking about"". Whenever he came by to talk, he made her step outside to have a conversation so that we couldn't hear. 


He expects things of us without telling us what he wants and then talks shit about us to that then-manager. He claimed that he had been asking for a price list for months, when he never actually asked for it or said anything about it. He asked the groomer how much she was making a week, she told him, he told her that it's perfect and then he went to the then-manager and told her she had to fire the bather if they kept ""making so little money"". But he was expecting an entirely unrealistic amount of money because HE HAS NO EXPERIENCE.


He acts like us needing anything is a fucking killing him. He HATES spending money when we need cleaning supplies or dog food/bowls, basic stuff like that. On top of that, we used to be able to have as much overtime as we wanted because we've all been here for years. They gave us a raise, and then without telling us, haven't been giving us our overtime. I only found out because I eavesdropped.


My old manager quit a few months ago and they hired a new guy. They're paying for his apartment, his food, his car, and paying him salary just so he'll work for them. HE IS A FUCKING AWFUL PERSON. He claims to be a dog trainer, has no credentials to prove as such.

He REFUSES to clean anything or interact with the dogs. He sits on his phone all day and does nothing for 6-8 hours. We do EVERYTHING. And on top of that, we are very understaffed but he makes no attempt to hire anyone. 

And now I find out that my boss is watching us via security cameras all day because he sits at home and does nothing instead of coming in and helping us . The new shitty manager blabbed to my coworker, who then told me because we don't keep secrets from each other (she and I are really good friends and always keep each other in the loop)

I don't know what to do. I'm getting married next year and don't know if I can hold out long enough. 
I fucking hate that stupid new manager. I can't stand him. Advice?

This is my very first Reddit post. I've heard it's good place to get advice so here I am.

So, let's start off by saying I've always had anxiety and get depressed easily. But lately I've been overthinking way too much about death; like how will I die? Or what if I go to the store and get hit by a car? I'm always thinking things like ""what if something happens to my son in school"" or ""what if my husband never returns home from work?"" I live in constant fear and it's making my life so miserable and I don't know how to stop. 

This just started not too long ago and I don't understand why. I try to be positive, I do yoga and meditate frequently.

A coworker that caused some psychological turmoil is leaving and I can’t be more excited to see her go. This certain coworker is/was friends with my boyfriend and he wants to go to her going-away party. I told him that he could go if he wants, but I won’t be happy about it. He said it’s been a several months already since she stopped bad mouthing me about my life choices to E V E R Y O N E in our department and I should be over it already. Her actions caused me to retreat from my work life and seek out a therapist because her bad mouthing caused other people to start unnecessary drama. 

I feel that my boyfriend believes that I’m overreacting in this situation and he thinks he should go because he’ll never see her again (they were friends before we started dating). 

I can view it on his terms where she is his friend and he believes that it’s only right for him to wish her farewell, but I feel that he is dismissing my feelings toward it. 

We got into an argument about it and I told him if he goes I won’t be happy about it (i.e. May be very short with him, not answer his phone call after the hang out, and won’t hang out with him after because I’m upset). I did want him to know what could possibly happen and didn’t want to say “ok just go it’s your friend” and then be a passive aggressive bitch after. I would rather be upfront with what could be a possibility. 

He argues back that she is his friend.

Then I say okay, if we flip the situation and I ask to hang out with someone that he has a huge distaste for would he be upset? We all know the obvious answer for that.

92,"Everybody says that money doesn't buy happiness, but it kind of does when almost all of your problems are about money and you wonder if your parents and you will have something to eat .
It can also limit your experiences so you can't do many things without it.

93,"Hi guys. I’m the youngest (F/23) out of five people including my parents. I have two sisters; the oldest (29 let’s call her Jane) and I always butt heads. The other sister (25) is closer to the oldest and always takes her side and babies her. 

We recently got into an argument-turned-cold-war about how she made our mom cry out of frustration because she was being disrespectful. I told her to apologize but she kept insisting she did nothing wrong. Now, we are Asian and the respect runs deep for our parents. I got so angry and annoyed at her with an argument that went in circles that I called her a “dumb b*tch” because she flipped a switch in me by saying I don’t help my parents out by giving money while I’m still in school but she is already working, barely giving enough. I try my best in helping out in other ways by buying necessities and whatnot for the house/family so I got really offended by that. Because of that, we have been ignoring each other for a good month. 
I know I’m supposed to apologize for the sake of peace but this has happened more than once and I’m tired of always being the one to apologize while she never apologizes to anyone. I would love to avoid her as even her presence now boils my blood but I’m still living with my parents and she comes over almost every day for dinner.

Extra Background: two years ago I was preparing to move into my uncle’s place with my best friend from a different state as my uncle isn’t home often. My sister proceeded to move in literally a few months before I could. She took precedence because she was older. I’ve always had ill feelings for her after that because it caused hardship on me and my best friend. Because she’s living there now, she has become unmotivated and entitled. She thinks she can argue back towards my parents and do whatever she wants now because she no longer “lives under our parents’ roof.”
She’s also been stuck career wise for seven years since graduating. I was the only one who would bother to ask about what she is going to do, how she should deal with her debt, suggesting different career paths, etc. But she would always find a way around everything or give me answers that weren’t serious.",17Nov2018,1
94,"A little bit of back story, I’m currently in high school. Around a month ago I was going out with a girl and everything was great but she broke up with me because she said she wasn’t ready for a serious relationship. I understood this because she had briefly mentioned how horrible her previous relationship was. So for the past month we have been talking and hanging out a lot. One day when we were both pretty drunk (I know, underage drinking) she mentioned feeling really sad sometimes. I didn’t really think much of it due to the fact that we were both drunk. Recently she opened up to me about why she broke up with me and why she has been depressed. She said she has been feeling suicidal. I’ve tried to convince her to get professional help but she has said she doesn’t want to get any help and that she is fine on her own. I want to help her but I’m not sure what I can do.",17Nov2018,1
97,"I need to find a job but I have a weird phobia of doing anything that involves handling money in front of people/cashiering. Math has never been my strong suit and I'm especially rusty because I haven't been required to do much of it in like four years. I was out of school for awhile and just started college again at 20. And no job I've had has involved transactions of more than a dollar or two. I'm not great at counting in my head, and I get really bad anxiety in situations like these. A year ago I was a checker at a grocery store for maybe a week and honestly quit because the pressure was just too much for me even though most of it was done on the register. Maybe that's pathetic but that's my situation.

Basically I need advice on how to get over or around this fear, because I can't avoid it forever especially now that I'm back in school and there aren't many options other than food service and retail. I'm very self-conscious about it and it makes me feel pretty stupid. I just get so flustered.

This might end up being a long post. Im not to sure if this is the appropriate subreddit but im honestly just lost and need advice on how to handle this. 

Today at about 8pm I received a call from my uncle wholives in El Salvador. He told me that my family there has been getting strange calls and texts from random numbers demanding money from them. They ignored the calls and texts believing it to be internet scams until 2 men believed to be from the gang MS came by and personally handed my uncle a letter with their demands. 

They are demanding 4 thousand dollars be given to them by Monday afternoon or they would kill my grandmother and her care taker. 

Currently all my uncles and their families are all staying with my grandmother at her house. They all live relatively close from one another. Its El Salvador so naturally we had some form of weapons to protect against 1-2 intruders but nothing to defend against a gang attack.  

I don't know what to do, should we pay the money and hope they leave us alone, do we report to the police and hope that they help us? Is there some sort of hotline to call that deals with these kind of things in El Salvador? 

I know there isn't much I can do but if there even a slight chance someone would know some way of helping my family back in El Salvador I need to take it.

103,"Hello. I'm 19(F) and just got a new retail job. It already sucks, but the number one problem I have (one that would have prevented me from accepting the job had I known) is that we don't get breaks, besides a ""30 minute lunch shift for 8 hour shifts"", which no one gets scheduled (the managers opt for 7.5 to avoid the lunch breaks). Everyone looked at me like I was crazy when I asked about breaks on my first day, and said no one takes them and it'll obviously be super frowned upon if I do. Enough that I could be ostracized, treated poorly, and maybe even fired given the hostile work environment. 

The thing is, I have foot problems (plantar fasciitis) and back problems (from a repetitive stress injury) and I need to sit down after a couple hours. I'm in shape and used to standing jobs, but the human body isn't meant for standing that long with no reprieve. The job is entirely on your feet with no assistance (read: no leaning on anything, no sitting on anything, you get yelled at if you're caught doing either thing). I've only worked 5 hour shifts so far, and they were super hard to physically get through, and I'm scheduled 7 hours a day in the coming few days. 

I live in Colorado, so if I understand correctly, I should be legally allowed a 10 minute break for every four hours, and a 30 minute lunch for more than five hours worked? How do I go about asking this in a place where everyone is going to get angry with me for taking my breaks? I want to quit this job asap, but I still need to work it until I get a new job, and I don't feel capable if I have to stand at a register nonstop for 7 hours. I'm already crying just thinking about tomorrow. Help. :(

104,"Lately, my relationship with my dad has gone downhill. For the past few months, he's been angrier, colder, ruder, more intrusive and more disrespectful than I'm used to and is considered normal. Every little thing I do annoys him and causes him to raise his voice at me, I could literally just be eating a nut (mouth closed) and the sound of it crunching inside my mouth would anger him. He's a single parent, which I do recognise as hard work don't get me wrong, but it's been this way for almost a decade now and I don't understand why suddenly his attitude towards me has changed. I also have a younger sister, but he treats her well, so she doesn't understand where I'm coming from with these feelings. This has been affecting my schoolwork quite a bit as well because I'm constantly nervous at what he's going to scream at me about next. Everything that I do, he has to know every detail about. I will ask him if I can go out with my friends to the movies during the day on a weekend and he'll ask me at least 5 times to repeat to him where exactly I'm going, who's coming and when I'll be back, even if the movies are ten minutes from my house. Things like that he never used to do and now it's making me feel smothered and uncomfortable. He's also cold and rude to me, in the morning he'll say a bright good morning to my sister and just ignore me like I'm not there. My dad and I have never had the closest relationship and my sister has always been the clear favourite but this is just making me feel uncomfortable in my own home. I feel as if I'm always respectful towards him, I never scream or talk rudely towards him, I never ask for much and I always help around the house so I don't get why he treats me with such disrespect. He calls me selfish and bursts out in anger and then ten minutes later pretends it never happened and if I mention it he thinks I'm overreacting when it genuinely scared me/made me nervous. He's also always at home when I am because he has the same work hours as I do school, so I barely get time away from him, where I can just relax without his constant pressure, which I think is also part of the problem. I'm gonna stop there because I could go on forever but I just need advice. What should I do? is there anything I can say to him without him freaking out at me? ",17Nov2018,1

At times I would try to talk to him but he would just give me one worded answers and it really seemed like he did want to be bothered by me so I just left him alone and never talked to him again. During our last year in middle school and high school I would always catch him staring at me in the hallways or in class but I just shrugged it off and never really thought anything about it, that is until this senior year because now it's getting kind of annoying.

108,"So for a little over a year I've been shaving down there. I do it for personal reasons. I don't have sex or anything but I just dislike the feeling of hair and it gets in the way sometimes.

I use a pair of grooming scissors to cut all the hairs to at least half of their current length, usually a third or quarter though, and then shave them with a razor like I would my face (As to not clog the razor with really long hairs). I have a few questions though.

* Is it normal for the shaving cream to ""sting"" a little bit on that region when you put it on? I have a sensitive skin brand of shaving cream.

* This might just be from lack of experience, but I have several red bleeding spots in my region after I just did it. Is it normal to have these? Are they ingrown hairs or just nicks? The little red blood spots are perfect circles but I can't post pictures because it counts as CP.

* Is it better to shave with an erection? Out of the half dozen or so times I've shaved in total it's been soft every time. Should I wait until I get hard or bring porn into the bathroom or something beforehand? I find the shaft of my penis an absolute nightmare, my balls are the only one that's worse.

* How do I make growing it back slower, or preventing it all together? I might not want to be making this decision yet, but I think I want to be hairless the rest of my life. Is there anything that I can try or would I have to see a specialist? The first few days after are the worst because it's like a beard but around my dick and it's super spiky and feels terrible. I want to deal with that as little as possible.

110,"I dated my ex for 4 years (21F) (21M)

So we started dating at 17.

I suffer from depression and anxiety. I used to have episodes of panic and anger towards him, I would be yelling and screaming for hours about our fights, I would just freak out in manic for almost the whole day.

He was there holding me down, screaming back at me to snap me out of it, pinning me to the floor so I would calm down and even when he told me to leave, he wouldn’t let me or told me to back in the matter of minutes with I Love you.

So I changed, I changed because I didn’t want to do that anymore, I stopped doing all of that, I started meditating mindfulness, yoga, seeing a therapist. My depression was still there but my freak outs were no more.

But it came a day when I wanted him to change for the better too.

During our disagreements he would call me all nasty names, totally get off subject saying disrespectful things. I get people say shit they don’t mean when their mad but he would say things he couldn’t take back. Like my mom doesn’t love me, I’m a nasty whore, I sleep with my boss (he doesn’t even talk to me or I hardly see him), I’m a dumb bitch so on, he even put his hands on me a couple times.

They usually were about him getting a job, he sold weed and paid for everything but still I wanted him to grow up and get a steady job.

He started micro-dosing acid every other day because it made him feel free.

And the disrespect that he showed towards me when I tried to talk about it with him.. I wasn’t even being harsh.. was ridiculous.

I gave him chance after chance when he did these things. He even used to call other girls when he crossed my boundaries (that anyone would have; basic respect) and I had to remove myself so he called them to come over or whatever instead of working on these things.

Am I wrong for not sticking around? I just feel like he was there for me through my shit and even made me a better person but it kills me to know that he won’t make those changes for me.

112,"Prior to reading this I’m apologizing in advance for the buttload of grammatical errors I made. Typing paragraphs isn’t my forte.


To be specific on “special” the kid I’m working with has a learning disability. I work as a PPT and I work with one child that needs help with almost everything in school. My goal is to get him to be independent, meaning being able to do work and follow directions by himself just like any other normal student. 

As for where I’m at right now I feel like it’s stagnant. The child himself, he’s close but yet far away from being independent. 

This takes place in a real classroom environment with 2 teachers and an EA. One of the teacher and the EA takes turns switching classrooms. All 3 of them are women. They also work with him.

The child himself is really sweet, like an angel. It’s as if you can’t get mad at him. (Not an overstatement). He can speak well enough to communicate but sometimes it’s hard to comprehend what he says even when he spoke it clearly.

Now here’s the problem 

When working with him I’m gradually losing control over the child, as in he’s not wanting to follow directions ask him to do. This sometimes happen but eventually he does follow directions.  Now me, I approach him like any other children; a friendly, outgoing adult. But as seeing as he takes advantage of my “friendliness” he thinks “Oh Mr. Friendly person is nice, he wouldn’t be mean to me.”  And this makes him feel like he can do whatever he wants to do. I keep having this moment where I change my voice into a more serious tone to make where I’m in control. 

However, I don’t want to cuz then the teachers will think how I’m treating the child and that the child himself will tell his parents about the treatment he was given. But the thing is; both teachers are on the opposite side of the spectrum, a fairly strict one and the other a really easy and outgoing one. Both of which the child listens well to with hardly refusing directions that’s given. It’s as if he’s improving a lot more when they work with him. I feel like I’m not doing my job well enough to reach my goal.

113,"I started a university course this year and on the 1st day, ran into someone I was friends with as a child. It turned out we were studying the same subject, so naturally we started hanging out and talking regularly. I wouldn't say we were very close but we definitely became friends and it stayed that way for at least 6 months.

About a month ago, there was a big university social event and my friend ended up going with a group of people (she knew one member of the group). This group is generally considered to be the 'popular crowd'. Ever since then she's been hanging out with them every day, posting all over social media about how they're ""BFFLs"", etc. And slowly but surely cutting me off.

When I see her in real life she pretends not to see me, when I message her the conversation is short, and she never initiates anything anymore.

Problem is, when we wanted to meet up at 8pm, I was fast asleep from sleep deprivation (I have sleeping disorders, so does she). I was planning on watching some series till I meet up with her and must've just fallen asleep...

117,"So little back story, I work at a huge home renovation/improvement store as a loader, in which I help bring in carts, help people load items into their cars, and if other employees need help with other things inside, I help them out. I’ve been working here since April of this year and I absolutely love my job.

Now I know usually people in these kinds of threads always try to paint themselves as golden people, but I’m not gonna do that in this post.

I feel like I’m going to be fired from my job soon, but I’m not sure if it’s just me being anxious. I have several suspicions.

First, long story short, around a month ago, myself and another coworker accidentally did a safety violation, and keep in mind that at our work, we take safety super seriously. I admit I did a mistake; a bunch of exams were coming up, and my life, during that time, was go to school and work, and if it wasn’t either of those, it was studying, so I was very exhausted at mostly everything I did, which is why I let the safety violation happen. An assistant manager saw, and he didn’t really yell at us, so to say, but I guess he sternly told us, in short, what to do next time to avoid the safety violation and that if this were to happen again, we would both be written up. Ok, fair enough, I know what I did was wrong. As said before, we take safety very seriously at our store; someone actually recently got fired for a safety violation.

Next, I usually close once a week, sometimes twice, and the store closes at 10 PM, but I’m scheduled to leave at 10:30. The problem? I’m not really needed in the store after 10 PM because my duties are done. There are 3 assistant managers who work there, and there are 2 that usually work on the days I close (not both at once though, only one of them would be closing.) One of the managers wants the closer in my department to stay until 10:30, while the other doesn’t really care. I usually try to stay until 10:30 because I don’t know if I’ll get in trouble or not if I leave. So I stick around just in case I might be needed for something, but to be honest, what usually happens is that I stick around the front end, talking to one of my coworker/friend, who closes as a cashier, and then leave with her when she’s done. Sometimes the managers might see me not doing something, which then they’ll tell me to do something, to which I finish the given task and then they nudgingly tell me I can clock out, (to which I mean they’ll ask me something like “So are you about to clock out?”) I don’t know if I’m annoying them or not, but I feel like if I leave early I might get them upset, but it also feels like if I stay I annoy them. Another person who works in my department always leaves at 10 when they are the closer, and the manager who wants us to stay till 10:30 knows and he doesn’t like when the person in my department does that, but this person has been here for 2 years and he hasn’t ever gotten in trouble for it.

Finally, another person got hired to work in our department, which I’m not sure might be a replacement for me or not. On one hand, this person has been hired in to work as mid shift during the week, which is something we’ve DESPERATELY need, cuz  out of the 5 people that work in our department, 3 of us go to school.(for example on the weekday where I close, it would be an opener working 8 hours until they leave, to which there is an 1 and a half hour gap of no one in my department is there until I arrive, which results in a lot of work  to be done when I arrive. ) I don’t know how exactly it is on other days, but I’m pretty sure it’s oddly similar.) but on the other hand, maybe they’re possibly my replacement. But then again, we’ve had many new hires throughout the store over the past couple weeks. 

I guess what worries me the most is something specific that has happened. So basically, every Sunday, I opened, worked 8-4:30, and then my friend/coworker comes in at 12 and closes at 8:30. In our most recent schedule, a Sunday I work in around 4 weeks has me working 10-4, and I have overall less hours during that week than I usually have (since school started, I’ve worked 20-25 hours per week. On the specific week I’m talking about, I’m working 16.) does this mean they’re cutting my hours in preparation of firing me? But then again, I’ve been told that, overall, everyone’s hours get cut during the winter season because we aren’t as busy as we were before.

Overall, I feel like Im on everyone’s good side in the store, including the manager and assistant manager, but I feel like due to recent screw-ups and inconveniences, they might be looking into firing me and replacing me. I’m not sure if this is just me being anxious or if this might be the case.",17Nov2018,1
118,"Currently I’m a college senior about to graduate in December. The original plan was to relocate to Philly start working full time for the company I’m currently with. They had already offered me a full time job in February, I had to inform them I wasn’t graduating until December, but said I could work full time at the office over the summer. They liked the idea and that’s what I did. They made it clear that after I graduate there would be no more remote workers for the company. Two weeks ago they asked what hours I could work in December and January. I told them I would need time to move to Philly and they acted all surprised about it. I suspect they are going to offer me to work full time hours for my current part time pay, which they keep trying to do, instead of a full time job. 


I have applied to jobs in the public sector, but I have not heard back from anyone. The other issue is I’m not really a city person, and all the jobs in my field of study would be in the Dc area or in a major city. A couple of years ago I did a conservation program that partnered me with the forest service in Alaska and loved it. I tried applying for that job but my degree is in the wrong field and I don’t have enough work experience to qualify. I tried the National Park service but they are very completive  jobs as well. 

While looking for outdoor jobs, I found this https://www.bushwise.co.za. Basically it’s a 6month to year training programs to be come licensed safari guides in Africa. There are a couple programs I could do to become a guide. The only downside I found is that it’s can be difficult to find work as a guide if your a foreigner, because their are laws that give natives first go at a job. 

I’m not sure what to do but I don’t want to graduate and then have to move back home and wait till I hear back for a job. I also don’t want to move to philly if I’m only going to be paid for part time work, while doing a full time job.

119,"So for a long while now, I thought of distributing anonymous physical media on a family road trip across the United States. What I mean by ""anonymous physical media"" (APM) are data discs (data DVDs or CDs) that contain my writing/poetry, which would be in the public domain.

I absolutely hate getting in trouble and I’ll do anything to get out of it. If I think of an excuse I’ll go with it and lie. However, I start to believe it. The one time that I lied to lie was when I used to work at a home improvement store. TO MY DEFENSE: I was outside in the Texas heat 100 degrees and up, cashiering. I had been fed up with being outside for so long (the limit is 2 hours at a time, I was out there for 4+ hours a day). I had called my managers to switch and they never would. So I basically called them and said I had to throw up. Spoiler: I didn’t. And for 20 minutes I sat in the break room pretending to have an upset stomach and telling my coworkers that I was taking a heavy pain killer from my wisdom teeth. After keeping that up I got to go home. But the thing is that I was so fucking good at acting sick. Because I had it in my head that I WAS sick. That was the problem.

123,"So, a little preface, I’m very young compared to my friends. Two of them are 22 and the other two are 28. They are split into couples with the two older dating the two younger. I myself am 19. 

I believe I may also may be aromantic (not sure on this yet but I’m pretty sure I am) I will never be anyone’s first choice, as I do not wish to have a romantic partner, but I know others will. 

My friends all have decent jobs, in fact one of my friends is a high ranked manager at the factory I work at and makes good money. 

I guess what I need advice on is, I know that there will come a day when they want kids, want a family, want to focus on careers, etc. and they will eventually be to busy for me. Two of my friends have already started to try and have a child, and it freaks me out. I’m not good with being lonely at all, despite virtually being alone my whole life (always lived with family but we don’t really chat with each other so I keep to myself.) 

I am absolutely terrified of the day I know everyone, through obviously no fault of their own, will be to busy for me. I know they love me. I know they support me and care for me. But that doesn’t change the fact that one day, they will be to busy out in the world living their lives while I sit in my small apartment watching YouTube videos, studying for my online classes, alone. Desperately alone. I’m terrified I will be consumed by loneliness. Any advice on this?

They both seem unattainable. The worst part is I have to talk to my mom about it and that conversation does not bode well for me. I can't find the words to explain to her why I struggle to pass my classes, why a mental health day becomes a mental health week, why I'm scared of my professors and peers, and why my education is just going to take more time. She always see the worst in me and makes it my identity. I've been raised to believe that I am ungrateful, incompetent, mentally stunted, lazy, and unloveable.

126,"So the past few months I’ve been questioning whether my 2 closest friends are good friends. The closer one was telling me that he hates how little social interaction he gets these days and said “we need to get some friends.“ I knew that meant he needs to get some friends but I didn’t get angry or anything and just gave him the space he needed. The thing is, he still hits me up occasionally and usually tells me how much he misses me or something like that. Then he’ll say something along the lines of “wyd let’s chill” and when I say yes he does one of two things. He either waits at least 4 hours to read my message or tells me to meet him somewhere where he is nowhere to be found. Last week he did that 7 times in 3 consecutive days. It just seems like he’s trying to waste my time and piss me off on purpose when I don’t think I did anything to deserve this considering everything I’ve done for him over the years and especially within the 8 months where I picked him up from work almost every day since he didn’t have a car, drove him around wherever he wanted, even if it was a totally ridiculous request like the several times I took him to chick-fil-a which is over 20 miles away and I’ve never once asked for gas money. I’ve driven him tens of thousands of miles and I don’t think he’s ever even considered giving me any gas money, but that’s always been okay with me because I enjoyed his company most of the time.  When he finally got a car he was so excited to show me and said “now it’s my turn to drive you around everywhere!” It’s been over 2 months  I’ve been in his car 4 times and he probably drove me less than 30 miles total. Whenever we hang out and want to go somewhere he makes up some bullshit and says “I think it would be easier if we just take your car instead.” Not to mention the time I picked him up from the bar at 2:00am and he almost immediately passed out in my car so I had no other option but to just bring him back to my place. The next day he wakes up in my car and eats breakfast, lunch and dinner at my house, then I drove him across town so he could purchase a motorcycle. He brought it back to my house and started working on it with my tools even though it would’ve been way closer and easier to just go home. 

My second closest friend is his brother. He just moved here about 5 months ago and things just aren’t working out too well for him out here. He’s been discussing the possibility of moving back to his hometown and I told him that it would probably be his best option, even though I’ll miss him. Last time I saw him he said he was just gonna stay for a while and just think it over. This morning he sends me a text message saying that he is leaving tomorrow and “we gotta chill tonight.“ He then went on to ask me about how I’ve been the last couple weeks and we discussed how much better we are both doing since we are both going through stuff. I had a feeling that he wasn’t going to hmu and that’s fine because I’m sure he’s got things to do if he’s leaving tomorrow. But what I’m having a hard time understanding is why didn’t he tell me sooner? I saw his brother just the other night and he mentioned him very briefly but then stopped talking about him as if he suddenly realized he wasn’t supposed to mention him. He said nothing about him moving back. They’ve both been acting weird lately and I’m not sure why. 

I’ve spoken to some of my other friends about it and they’ve all just made me feel like I am the one that is acting strange and that it will all be fine since we are so close but I strongly disagree. Do I just have a bunch of shitty friends or am I tripping?",17Nov2018,1

128,"I received a job offer about a month ago contingent upon passing a background check, drug test, and physical. I passed both the background check and drug test with no problems, but I ended up having to reschedule my physical twice through no fault of my own. The first time, I was told that my blood pressure was “too high” to continue with one of the tests. The second time, I threw up in the middle of it (due to a preexisting arrhythmia) but was told I had to come back on another date even after reassuring them that I felt completely fine once I sat down. They claimed it was protocol in case it was a stomach bug going around.

I emailed the person responsible for scheduling physicals, but did not receive a response on that date. I waited through the weekend, then emailed her again on Tuesday because I still hadn’t gotten one. She said she would send me the information when the appointment was rescheduled. I finally received an email yesterday evening, 11/15, and to my horror it said the appointment was scheduled for, well, 11/15 at 9 AM. It also said the physical needed to be completed by that date and time otherwise it “may effect being able to move forward in this process.” I immediately emailed the HR rep I was working with, explaining the situation. I thought surely this could not be blamed on me, but lo and behold, I received an email this morning informing me that they were withdrawing their offer of employment. 

I don’t really know how to handle this. Should I follow up with a screenshot of the email and the day and time it was received to prove that I didn’t get it until several hours after the appointment was supposed to take place? Or should I just let it go and keep applying for other jobs? I’m sort of mad because I believe it stands to reason that this predicament wasn’t my fault.

130,"Hello, I'm in a bit of a weird situation right now.

This information is coming from my Mom, so there is a chance it isn't true/ she's lying to me to get me to stay in College.

My parents signed up for a RESP plan with *Knowledge First Financial*, and everything I read online about this company is that they should be avoided (too late for that). My mom tells me that if I don't finish school, she wont get her initial investment back (tens of thousands of dollars). We live in **Ontario**, in the **GTA.** 

I guess the first dilemma is whether this is true. Is it legal for a these companies to hold my parents money like that? Is that even how these plans work, or does it depend on the company?

If the answer is: you will lose the tens of thousands that your parents invested if you do not go to school, would I be in the wrong for wasting my parents money if I decided that post secondary wasn't right for me.

I'm still thinking a lot about my future, and if school is right for me (going into music), and this whole RESP headache is really causing me a lot of stress. I find it strange that I'm stressed about *losing* money for not doing college.

Any advice on this matter is greatly appreciated.

“You’re done seeing the doctor. I’m not paying for your OCD and depression treatment anymore.”

152,"About 18 months ago I [33M] broke up with my long term girlfriend [32F] (we had dated about 15+ years) and she moved back home to the other side of the country.  The breakup was amicable (she was upset but we kept talking regularly) and I still care immensely about her as a friend and someone who was a very important part of pretty much my entire adult life.

The first 9 months or so went by (we kept in contact and spoke every few days) and everything seemed ok considering but then she started to exhibit some pretty serious changes in personality and ability to understand what was going on, memory, etc. (a lot of my information about this is second hand from her family because at this point she is no longer using cell phones or anything like that and they are totally taking care of her). Her family became very concerned and after months of testing to try to figure out what was wrong, she was diagnosed (and got a second opinion) with Frontotemporal Dementia. It is degenerative and the things I've read online and from speaking to a friend who is an  MD do not paint a rosy picture of her prognosis (typically fatal in 3-10 years from diagnosis and getting worse the whole time).

In hindsight, I can see that some of the main issues that I broke up with her about were probably early symptoms of her illness (for example, the final straw was the fact that she actually chose to move out and across the country without discussing it with me and then didn't agree that this was the type of decision that we should have discussed together). I know it isn't my fault but I feel incredibly guilty now because I feel like she is sick and instead of being there for her (and her family who I thought of as my second family before the breakup) I am thousands of miles away doing nothing to help.  I don't regret that we broke up because I think it was the right thing either way (although who knows how much this illness was affecting her personality in subtle ways) and I don't have any romantic feelings for her still, but I still feel like I should be responsible to at least help care for her and be there as emotional support.  It would be very difficult to move closer at this point for a number of reasons and even if I could, I don't know that her family would even want me involved given the breakup.

With that said, I am acutely aware of the fact that the clock may be ticking and it is hard to come to grips with the idea that this person, who was my best friend for my entire adult life, is slipping away and I'm not even around to spend the time with her that she has now.

I'm really struggling with the whole situation and, in particular, being so far away and not able to help, see her or her family, etc. The last time I saw her was last Christmas but it is clear from her family and my parents (who have visited her) that a lot of the person she was is already gone.

155,"Hi,

Straight out of high school I went to university to study Biomedical Science, a degree that I completed mid-year last year. My girlfriend and I both studied entry exams to get into post-grad medical degrees to become medical doctors. 

Around this time I started to ask myself were I saw myself in the future, and was still unsure if medicine was the career I wanted to follow. All through high-school I had wanted to be an Architect, however was encouraged to follow the sciences by my high school councillors. 

I have now gotten myself into a mental trap. I have applied for a Bachelor of Architecture, an extended Master of Architecture and the science loving me, a Master of Forensic Anthropology.

I am genuinely interested in both fields, so I am torn about what to choose. As of now I have received an offer for the Master of Forensics and the Bachelor, and had an interview for the Master of Architecture. 

The Bachelor, following into a Masters will mean I will be finished studying after 5 years. I will then have to do 2 years professional work to qualify as a registered Architect in Australia. The university campus is over an hour and a half drive in another city, and I will have to commute both directions twice daily.

The Master of Architecture I have not heard an offer from yet, however, it is 3 years study before having to complete the same 2 year prerequisite to become registered. This university is a 40 minute drive away, but still easy to get to from either my girlfriends place or mine. 

The Master of Forensic Anthropology is across the country in Perth. This course is 2 years long, will lead onto a PhD and most likely research jobs in the future. My sister lives in Perth, but will only be there for one more year. 

I live and work in Melbourne, and my girlfriend will be staying in Melbourne as she will be studying medicine here. 

What should I do?  Are there any redditors here from either field who can offer some guidance? All advice welcome, I want to take whatever you guys have on board.

Thanks in advance!",17Nov2018,1

But my brain keeps thinking and worrying about this. I’m just confused. How do i stop thinking this way? Or am I really somehow trans?",17Nov2018,1
157,My friend group just fell apart cause of this one fucking asshole causing drama while everyone is almost zero tolerance drama causing 2 people to leave with one who was ostracized and I believe developed a fear of becoming emotionally invested in people. Even previous to this I everyone had their one person they liked more than me. I always knew I was part of the group but not particularly close to anyone. Now with no friend group I feel empty and depressed and anxious and cannot bring it up with the 2 people left as they have bigger problems than me and it makes me feel invalidated cause they are dealing with the dissolving and more. All i wanted was for my friends to be happy and I cant even do that. I feel meaningless and everything i do hurts and the only reason im here right now is the fear of pain and the unknown caused by the bullshit raging horomones of high school. What can I do.,17Nov2018,1

161,"Alright, this might be a bit long, so if you're really here to help, thanks for reading. 

At my school, we are allowed out at lunch to roam the city for like 45 minutes to go to the store and grab a snack or hang at a friend's house, on school property, or whatever. I know this guy, we'll call him Gavin. I've smoked pot with him before and I trust(ed) him. He has good tastes and is funny, seems like a person I'd wanna be friends with, I've only had one real friend since 5th grade, anyways. At lunch, he took out his homemade bong and a little pill bottle with a teensy bit of weet at the bottom. I obviously wanted to get high, so I of course took a few tokes. 2 or 3 I think. Fast forward like 5 minutes, and we're sitting behind the school. There's 20 minutes of lunch left and I'm definitely high. I'm finding everything funny and such, like a normal high. Another 5 minutes pass and we go inside and sit in the lobby. I'm standing above a group of classmates at a bench when it hits me. I'm losing touch with reality. I go to sit down and he follows me. I tell him ""I'm losing depth perception."" as the normal sized benches in front of me looked like dollhouse benches that were just really close to me. I was phasing in and out of this, each time I phase in it lasts longer. When I phase in, everything is muffled and I can't concentrate on more than one thing. He just tells me ""It's like that when you're really high."" which I bought, but may not be true. Fast forward 5 minutes and we go to class. Walking down the hall it feels like everything is zoomed out and I can only concentrate on my walking, if I try to hear what someone's saying I'll fuck up and trip or something. I sit down and control myself. We're ten minutes into math when I totally get thrown out of wack and lose touch with reality. It's like the chair I'm sitting in is the only thing that's real the rest of the classroom is kinda like someone turned down the render distance. Not that it's blurry, I can see just fine, it's just.. weird. My motor skills are fucked up now, moving my hands from the sides of my desk to crossing my arms is so difficult. I can barely hear anything, and my ears are ringing. My nose is super cold, it feels like it's wet, but the rest of my face is really hot. My crotch feels warm, like I'm pissing myself, but I look down and feel the area and I'm not. It just feels really warm. Everytime I lift my head to look around it feels like the classroom moves with me and the chair I'm sitting in is the only thing I can concentrate on to keep me ""grounded"". All of a sudden, I feel nauseous and very light headed. In a drowsy, confused voice, I tell the teacher I'm gonna throw up and he tells me to go to the bathroom, me obviously in my current state, I tell him that I can't and I feel really sick. I zone out for a bit and he's next to me with a trash can. I take it and throw up every last bit of liquid within my stomach. A person from the office arrives to escort me down to the office where I can be taken home. I sit in a meeting room in the administration area waiting for my ride to pick me up. I only stare into the trash can I'm grasping onto for life because when I look up the meeting room is in a strange state, but it's worn off now. It's been about 25 minutes since I went to class and it all started. I'm getting better, but it's still not good. I've only passed the peak. My ride arrives and I leave quickly. It's been about an hour since the whole thing started when I get home. I've still got crazy anxiety and shallow, rapid breathing. I look in the mirror and my pupils are very very large, I didn't turn the lights on but the bathroom was bright from sunlight. I hug one of my cats and stare into my phone for the next half hour, trying my hardest not to pay attention to the effects that were still there, but faded, and still fading. I'm left really exhausted and traumatized, but I can't help but sleep. I sleep for a while and wake up with a little bit of anxiety that lasts for the rest of the day. Terrible experience.

Any ideas of what that could have been? Was it laced? If so, what with? Or was I just tripping out hard from some (too) good kush?",17Nov2018,1
162,"So I don’t think life is actually ruined but she fucked up my life pretty badly.

For starters I am 24 year old male and I had a best friend(also male) since college. We eventually moved out to Colorado 2 years ago and we were happily living life. 10 months ago I started dating this girl and at the time she became madly in love with me after a few months, and my best friend had a year long relationship with another girl at the time. Fast forward to the end of last summer, and my best friend’s girlfriend dumped him, and after some time my ex and him discovered they had mutual feelings for each other. In one fell swoop of 3 days, she ended up dumping me for my best friend, and now he lives at her place instead of our apartment that my friend and I had together.  It’s been 3 months since this all happened and I’m still in pain everyday over it. The feeling of hatred and love for my best friend are at odds everyday in my mind. I haven’t talked about it with either of them since it all went down, but she texted me earlier asking if she and I could discuss what was going through her mind. I flat out told her no. I don’t think I’m ready for that yet but does anybody think that bringing everything to light can help? I honestly don’t think it’s possible but she thinks we can awkwardly coexist with each other. Does anybody have experience with something like this and have some advice?",17Nov2018,1
163,"Long story short, after a bout of unemployment my roommate (who is the only one on the lease) decided to kick me out with a very short notice (gave me until Monday) right as I got a new job. I understand why she kicked me out, though this comes after we had a discussion and decided that the agreement was I could stay as long as I had a job before the end of the month. 

Regardless of the details, after Monday I'll be homeless for the first time in my life. A friend is able to thankfully hold most of my belongings for me, so it'll just be be me, a bookbag for my computer and charger, and a small suitcase w/ my clothes.

I already contacted the city's Human Services and unfortunately all they could do for me at the moment was give me a list of shelters that I can go to at night. That being said, I have a friend or two that can let me crash at their place but only on certain nights &amp; if it doesn't conflict with my work (can't be miles out of the city and then need to wake up to bus to work for an 8am shift). Right now I'm looking into a couple different apartments, but those won't be available until December 1st and I won't have my first paycheck until around that time either.

So with that in mind, what are some things to consider or other possible programs I should potentially look into to make things a little bit easier? Or things I should keep with me? Right now in my suitcase I'm gonna (try to) keep a few pairs of pants, a couple of my nicer shirts, socks &amp; underwear, and a change of shoes.

After I got over the initial anxiety, I realized that I had no clue how to start a conversation with her, apart from introducing myself and asking her name.

167,"There is this girl that I met through uni and we became really close friends. A year or two later I developed feelings for her and once I was sure I really liked her, I asked her out. Unfortunately she rejected me. I didn't bother to ask her why and I just told her that it's OK. In reality, I was absolutely crushed. I thought to myself that I just wasn't good enough and felt really down (for a really long time). I decided to work on myself and use that rejection for something good.

We never talked about that rejection again and I never tried to bring it up or to make her uncomfortable, but I still liked her. We remained friends but increasingly I noticed that she cared much less about the friendship than me. I felt once again rejected but this time as a friend.

Now it's almost two years since that rejection and while being abroad for a while I sort of cut ties between us. As I was trying to just move on completely she suddenly tried to put more effort into the friendship (she replied to texts faster and showed more interest in my life). This just made me feel as I was being manipulated, as if she was trying to make sure I would continue give her my attention.

I am now very busy with certain things in my life and have been ignoring some of her texts. I do still care about her but I don't want to go back to being that person that I used to be. Am I being unfair here?",17Nov2018,1

We managed to move on but never really spoke about what happened (massive mistake again). Another 6 months later she decided to leave me, because it wasn't in her morals to date someone who did what I did, as well as the small disagreements we would have.

I feel terrible, I hurt someone that means the world to me. This is still 2 months after the break up, I'm not scared of being alone or single. I do miss her but more importantly I feel awful for doing what I did. Will she forgive me? I want to apologise and show that I recognise my errors.

171,"I'm 17 years old guy and I've been thinking a lot about life lately and it just seems crazy to me. For the longest time I can remember, I always looked up to adults whether they're famous or not, regardless of their gender, and no matter how old they are.

I listen to a lot of music artists and I've also chatted with normal people and I am really fascinated by how they live life and the magnetic personality they seem to have/had in they're 20s and 30s. I've heard so many different stories about several people and where they were at in their life when they were 27 or 31 or 25 or 26 or 33, basically 20s and 30s as a whole. When I see old pictures of Beyoncé how she lived her life at 27 or a PhD student I chatted with couple months ago seeing what his pictures embodied, when he moved here to Germany when he was 28. I feel this huge excitement because I strive to be like that too. 

It gets me soo excited because I in fact dream about what it's like being 27. I always wanted to know what it's like being 31. I see people who just graduated with a Master's and they are 28 and they have this University-ish appearance. Plaid shirt, cute little glasses, being very intelligent and looking cute but also looking very mentally strong at the same time. They are able to go to bars and have a great time and all this cool stuff. There's a district in front of the central railway station and in the summer when the sky turns peach its really nostalgic to see all these people sitting in restaurants and having their time of their lives. It's like I'm in a movie. 

I live in a small town 50km away from this big city which is called ""the financial capital of Europe"", if that says something to you :) 

I often go there for shopping or just because I love this big city so much, I always feel so drawn to the depth those tall buildings create inside of me and they make me feel so small but also like I can achieve anything because I am in a big city with lots of opportunities. Just examining the spirit of the people who are walking around, I love looking at people who seem authentic, even if it's just Bankers or normal big city dwellers, they all really fascinate me. Especially adults. 

They have a beautiful river with lots of bridges and restaurants and museums with a magical view of the skyline. In the summer there's a bunch of people sitting on the gras or sitting in a Café or playing with each other on the grass. I absolutely love walking on the river side and observing everything. All together it just looks like a nostalgic film. I see all these adults with their friends and their partners having a great time and I strive to be that too. 

I unfortunately always have to go and walk there alone by myself cause I don't have any friends. It seems like there's a wall and that I'm just a ghost walking around. 

That's why I always wanted to be any of those ages because my life is very isolated and lonely and not very exciting and the options I have to spent my free time with are almost none. I'm in 10th grade and I also live in a small town and people here are a little dull and it's difficult to connect with people. 
I just want to break free and be those people I see every time I go to this big city and be my own person. I always wanted to sit with someone really cool laughing and having a great time in a restaurant or Café knowing there's a huge city out there waiting to be explored. I really like being on my own not having my mom around because I feel really grown and feel strong and like I can be myself when I'm on the go. I unfortunately can't start Uni, not before 2022. Because I need to go to academic school (4 years from now) to be granted access to University. From all the things I've mentioned, none of them are are realizable I'm just way too young to do all these things and it makes me feel down knowing I have to wait for such a long time cause I'm just a teenager. 

I'm very interested in studying economic science and I hope that'll work out :) I'd even love to start my own business some time in the future. 
I always had a passion for English and I'd love to study abroad and make new friends and unforgettable memories and expand my horizon.

I went to a free trial lecture at a private university and there were many attractive professors and I really enjoyed listening to them and what they had to say. There was one lecture in particular and he said if we have questions we can ask them in private when the lecture is over but my mind couldn't comprehend speaking with someone who has a Prof. Dr. on his name attached so I was really terrified. He went through it all. He wrote a dissertation. He went through a Master's, Bachelors, and doctorate degree, and has put billions of hours of work into his crafts and that really intimated me especially because I'm just a 17 year old 10th grader. 
He was a super sweet guy though, he always smiled when he was talking and he seemed really calmed and relaxed, it really warmed my heart. I really enjoyed listening to his voice. I would have loved to tell him that his body language as well as his facial expression really made me feel welcomed and that I really appreciated it.

I feel like I'm a baby and there are so many ages I have in front of me. Sometimes I count till 35 out loud and it takes really long and I notice that this is going to be a long time I'll be on this planet. Having so many years ahead of me, I want to make the most of them knowing I can fill my 20s and 30s with whatever I feel like, I don't know how and what to fill those with. 

There is so many, soo many things I want to do and I just don't know what is right and what is wrong. I try to read books like trying to learn about the stock market, financial independence, freelancing, self employment, economical science, Small talk, novels, books about understanding programming, tourist guides for the big city I've mentioned earlier, conversation skills, University brochures, languages, time management skills, positive habits, basically self help books. It's too much out there and I struggle with balancing that with school and trying to learn housekeeping, cooking and doing laundry and washing dishes. It's a lot of knowledge I'd like to be able to hold but it's really difficult. I'm really eager to learn about these things but I fear that I might be missing out on something. When I try to imagine my future it seems like it's fully filled with every day full of studying and just doing those adulthood things that nobody wants to do but has to and therefore I fear that I won't even have time to figure things out. 

I'm just not quite sure what's the right way to live life to the fullest and what direction I want to go so therefore I'm asking the ones who have the wisdom to give. The person I've strive to be is a person with lots and lots of wisdom and maturity. 
I seem to be very attracted to mature people. I think it's the wisdom and the opportunity to get to know about a guys or girls life and what they went through and what memories they made and what they experienced is really tickling me.

One thing, I always wonder where I'll be when I be in those ages and sometimes I'm concerned because when I'm already wanting to be 27 I fear that life might not let me get to that age and just erases my existence out of nowhere and that's really getting to my head lately. I just fear that I might never make it to 30 or even 23 :/

172,"FYI: I'm pretty minimalistic person, I don't like to keep stuff just for the sake of having them and store them like some relicts.

So my birthday is coming up. Usually my dad asks me to provide a list for possible gifts to choose from but this year there was no such request. I came today and he very proudly gave me a gift. Which was very old (still working!) ZSRR coffee grinder. My dad plugged it in and it did work (although it did smell a bit like burning)

 The issue is...I don't really drink coffee. My bf does and loves it, that's the reason he has professional coffee grinder that we use since regular coffee grinders tend to burn the beans and leave bad aftertaste. Now of course I appreciated the gift since my dad put work into finding it but I have no idea what to do with it. I don't want to clutter my space again or put it in the basement and I don't want to hurt my father's feelings. Were not gonna use it due to reasons above.

I just got into school for film and I'm loving it. I wasnt sure this is what I wanted but I have no regrets. 

The other day I was doing some work and the subject of school came up. My dad really wants him to go to school and he will pay for it all as long as my brother makes something of himself. As a matter of fact I want that for him too but my brother has been with his girlfriend for 9 years. She is on disability for some chronic pain and she wont go to school she just sits at home and my brother supports both of them. 

I like his girlfriend but I dont want my brother to be held back on doing what he loves just because she doesnt want him to.She doesnt have to be on disability. She goes skiing and snowboarding so I assume she can hold a job but she wont get a job or go to school. Its sad to see someone my age give up on life so soon and just tell themselves they cant do it. 

I dont want my brother to ever be like that. I know he wants to break free. He told me he wants so bad to go to school and he wants to leave our home country but he cant because of his girlfriend. She just wants to stay where she is. I sent him online courses and he said he might look into it because he doesnt know if thats what he wants so I had to tell him he'll never know if he doesnt try.

I feel he tells me things he wouldnt tell our parents or his girlfriend. I want to help him but so far the only thing I feel I can do is cheer him on from the side lines. My dad has lost faith in him and says that even if my brother says he wants this that he will never try. 

Is there anything I can do without putting too much pressure on him or upsetting him?

176,"So, I moved into my roommates apartment for grad school in September. At first I thought she was really nice an friendly but as time has went on I've started to notice things. Disclaimer - she owns the apartment (her mom bought it for her). 
At first she was really talkative, a bit too much but hey - who doesn't like friendly people? As time has went on I've started to realise that she's the kind of person who does not listen, instead she's just waiting for her time to talk. I'll often be telling her a story about my day and shell interrupt me and just start speaking louder than me till I shut up. It's the same stories every time as well, and it's always about how awesome she is. It has got to the point where I'm actually unhappy in the apartment and avoid talking to her. If I'm lucky and she let's me finish, she just one ups me everytime about absolutely nothing to do with what I'm talking about. I know this sounds small but it is really getting on my nerves. 
Furthermore, another thing she did really upset me. If I ever have friends round she comes through and dominates the conversation (my friends don't want to come round anymore). It's annoying, but hey she clearly just likes to talk. Then I started to notice that when she would come through, she would undermine everything I say and just make jokes about me to my friends - again I get it, I'm what she has in common with them. However, the one time she really upset me was one evening when I brought a couple of my friends round. I told her something pretty personal, and she told one of them what I'd told her when I wasn't there. When he asked about it I was physically uncomfortable but I looked over at my roommate and she was smiling, super proud of herself. Later in the night she brings it up again in front of everyone, again she's smiling like she's super proud of herself for hurting and embarrassing me. 

Am I overreacting at this whole situation? Is this what roommates do? Or am I correct in thinking this girl is a complete and utter narcissist? How would you suggest handling the situation as I'm rather unhappy with the situation at the moment.

She had told me before that she only wears her underwear as pajamas but I was expecting her to put a little more on while I was there.

I work in a small office and a couple days ago I overheard my boss talking on the phone with Bell asking for a better rate.  Then yesterday while they were out of the office and I receive a call from Bell stating they were going to apply 30% to our phone bill and just needed to confirm some info. The person had a thick Indian accent which is fairly normal for outsourced call centres so I wasn't too surprised. But there was weird ""pauses"" throughout the phone conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

So I gave them info that was already available. Business phone # and address. Then they asked for my name and date of birth to confirm I was over 18 as well as my position at the company. Being an idiot I gave it to them. As for the email I gave them my boss' email and not my own. I never gave them any other personal information. 

&amp;#x200B;

They then had me verify the info and very strictly told me for call purposes they need me to answer ""yes"" to all questions. Throughout the conversation they kept repeating that they were part of a company called Reliant and were affiliated with Bell and no other company.  (I just looked up Reliant and it looks like a fake communication company ""based our of"" Vancouver)

&amp;#x200B;

They then told me that they were going to confirm the information with some upper management and patched me through to a lady with no accent and had me verify all the info with her with answering just yes. She then had to call me back at our number to do final verification.

They did state that they would fax over some paperwork to fill out and send back. I later found out our fax is broken though so I'll never know if that will come through and if it's something they need to complete the scam or not.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm worried they may have used the information to mess around with the company phone number and going to use it for toll fraud like this:  [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/phone-fraudsters-leave-businesses-on-hook/article1347717/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/phone-fraudsters-leave-businesses-on-hook/article1347717/)

I'm planning on calling my employer soon. (It's 6am right now on a Saturday and I can't sleep) I'm hoping they can just call Bell directly and get this fixed.

182," Hello, I need some advice from you guys. So recently my grades have been going down the shithole, I turn from a slightly above average student to a barely passing student. My nightmare is that i will not make it far in life. I am afraid that one day i wake up and find myself having financial problems and i will be stuck in a never ending cycle of bad debts. I am currently studying psychology in management here in Malaysia. I dont have many close friends and i am not the type of person who shares my problems with my friends, I put on a fake mask infront of people and they see me as an okay person, I am not however, deep down i am a coward and a loser. My parents are not helping the situation either, they expect me to handle my own shit and frankly i am tired as fuck, i dont wanna give up but sometimes its just so hard to keep pushing on, i watch motivational videos occasionally and i dont find it helpful at all, it is also not easy living with schizophrenia as sometimes things around me trigger me on a daily basis, I am learning how to cope with it as i am now currently on tolanz ODT. I feel that i am suffering from severe stress, stress i elicit on myself and stress i get from seeing my classmates doing better than me. I feel useless and incompetent. ",17Nov2018,1

185,"Okay this is gonna be such a rant but I‘m feeling horrible. Yesterday, I fucked up at work. Pretty, pretty badly. Some general information I should be giving away beforehand: I‘m volunteeringly working in a psychiatry at the moment (this is some sort of program in Germany, right after graduating this summer I started working there, hence lacking any work experience, specifically in that field) for about 6 weeks by now. I‘m trying really hard to do my best, and as far as I could tell, most patients really do like me. Back to what I originally was talking about; in a psychiatry (especially the closed mental hospital I‘m working at), it‘s quite common to find yourself in a bizarre situation. Said situation was that one patient who had just arrived there that day asked me if I could let him out because he forgot his cigarettes upstairs. My colleague asked me to join him, so I did. When we went upstairs, he confessed he didn‘t forget anything and is going home now, his wife would be downstairs talking to the doctor. I tried to convince him to come back with me downstairs so we could figure this out but he panicked that I would try to lock him back in. After trying several times to convince him I started panicking, too, called the woman working at the entrance and grabbed his arm because I was scared he might run away. The woman at the entrance kept an eye on him while I run back downstairs and told my colleagues what happened and to immediately call the doctor. What I didn‘t know was that the patient was actually right about being able to leave, and his wife was waiting outside, overhearing everything I told my colleagues (I didn‘t say anything bad, just what happened) 
Obviously, that was a major mistake because of the patients privacy, for which I immediately apologized to both the patient and his wife, as well as apologizing for trying to hold him back when he was in the right. I then started crying in front of the hospital entrance because my colleague (rightfully, so) told me what I did was pretty bad and I felt pretty awful as well, so I unwantingly caused even more attention. Aside from this being very, VERY inappropriate and unprofessional behaviour which might lead to me getting fired, I‘m still feeling awful for how I represented the hospital and especially for how I treated the patient and his privacy.
Now, after having ranted this much, I‘d like to ask for any tips from people working in this field/or anyone with more life experience than I have, how to calm down yourself in such situations and stay as professional as it is needed because I want to avoid such occurances at any cost.",17Nov2018,1

He's acting super scared and weird, hiding away and snorting super loudly as if he has a stuffed nose. He doesn't want his favorite food or anything and he's drooling a bit.

188,"I'm at a point of my life where I don't know where else to go... I tried accounting and automotive but they weren't for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 23 years old. I'm trying to get my life together but I feel like I'm in a maze.  I set myself back, due to video game addiction..  thus, I scarcely graduated high school. Lucky I controlled my video game addiction.  I take full responsibility of where I am in life.  I just want to move forward and grow my wings so my mom can see me fly on my own. 

&amp;#x200B;

I use to work at Walmart and now construction (for 5 months now).  I wanted to see if construction was for me but it's not \\ I plan to quit either at the end of this month or next. And perhaps, go back into retail. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate always looking forward to Friday's.  

&amp;#x200B;

 I don't have many skills except working at retail but I can't be a stocker boy for long. Every time I shop at Walmart, managers say they have openings for me, that I just have to submit my application. They liked how hard I worked, and how fast I would stock, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm good with computers. When my mom first bought a PC for the house, I was so intrigued by it, that I would click everything to see how it worked. I ended up helping my neighbors with their computer problems, etc. I enjoyed helping them.  But it's different when you actually work it vs study it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have done some practices with codecademy and watch a few streamers on twitch/youtubers, coding. I like how you can work at home. Solve problems, and create things. At the same time, I'm not sure if I'm creative or smart enough to do this as a career.   

&amp;#x200B;

I tend to overthink everything and speak negatively to myself. I have gotten better at controlling this, but it's still there. Which I think is the reason why I'm in the place I am in life.  All I can do is pick myself up and move forward though. Lucky, I found people such as Jocko Willink and David Goggins to be helpful for creating a better mindset. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since I'm 23 years old. I feel old, I don't necessarily like the idea of going to school for 4 years and still working a job I hate. One of my fears is never finding my passion. I just want to find a job that I look forward clocking into on Monday's.   

&amp;#x200B;

Which is why I'm considering the Air Force with a computer-related job such as IT, programming or cybersecurity.. I know I can't simply quit once I sign that contract but it can be a good foundation to set up for my 30's.

190,"A person from my family is really passionate about their new profession/studies (related to singing).

Since we’re not really close with them but try to reconnect, I started taking to their spouse a while back randomly to ask her how she’s doing etc. Since then, they invited me and my partner to a birthday party (never did that before) and seem relatively enthusiastic about sharing their profession (concerts etc.) with us. My boyfriend called their way of talking about it horribly arrogant (being a musician himself), I tried to keep neutral. 

Look, I’m anxious when going to concerts. I used to go to concerts all the time years back, but for some reason, I can’t bear them anymore due to the loud music and the room being packed. I can somewhat bear it when my partner is with me, but going alone, I really can’t. 

When they invited me, I clearly said that I don’t want to lead them on and that this is the reason for me not coming. I assumed that they could somewhat relate to that since they also both struggled with mental stuff. 

Nope. 

They both started to somewhat spam me and tried to invite me and my partner to come on different occasions over and over, linked me to stuff on social media etc. My partner absolutely hates that kind of music and while it’s my cup of deal in some cases, by this point I’m just really .. well.. anxious to reply in any way. It‘s not appealing anymore to even go watch it.

Now they send me some low quality recordings and I found it not that great to be completely honest, but I also know that it’s important to them and I should react in one way or another. I feel burdened by it, because while they are family, but I can’t be enthusiastic about something that I don’t really care about. 

Sorry for the messy post, I’m on mobile, not a native speaker and I don’t know if I even make sense.

192,"I was going to post this in r/AITA, but need a broader base of opinions than just 2k or so people.

Just over 3 years ago, my younger brother was diagnosed with stage 4 non-smokers lung cancer.  It had spread all over his body (we found out because he was having pain in his right shoulder and hip, which turned out to be growths pressing on his nerves).

Originally, the diagnosis was 3 to 4 months left to live, but due to gene therapy, he has lasted until now.

He has slowly been losing the battle, but he is one hell of a fighter, and we have been holding out for some therapies to make it to human trials.

A week ago, things took a sudden downturn.  He collapsed, and went into a coma.  I obviously took time off from work, and spent 2 days at his bedside... and he woke up.

He wanted Taco Bell, and I went and got his request: two crunchy tacos, a bean and cheese burrito, and a medium Sprite.

I stayed with him until the next day (taking another day off from work (I am a server lead at a semi-high end restaurant)), and he seemed almost back to his old self, or at least as much as he could in his fight.

36 or so hours ago, he respirated (breathed in) some of his oral medication, and relapsed into the semi-coma.

He is now incoherent, and is doped up on morphine.  Again, all but in a death coma.

He is not aware of anything, and when he *does* even open an eye when Mother shouts to try and get a response from him, he -at best- responds nonsensically.  He has repeated something about wishing someone a happy birthday and that he loved them three times when I was there and she did that.  Our sister's birthday is on the 23rd.

It is the end, and we all know it.

My question, my request for advice is this:

This is *not* how I want to remember my little brother.  Dying, incoherent, breath rattling in his throat, and so sunken and shriveled that my forearm is larger than his thigh.

I want to remember the man that left our parents at 17 to live with his big brother because we couldn't accept our ""Pardon me, but do you happen to have any Grey Poupon"" type parents.

I want to remember the man who would selflessly give anything of himself to any other in need.

I don't want to watch that person I knew as he dies.  If he was even the *slightest* bit awake, if he could for even the briefest second know I was there...

But that person is gone.  The cancer is in the brain, in his spine, in his lungs, and attacking his heart.  I was there until he no longer was.  I don't actually want to watch his physical body die as well.

But that same family that he left now insists that I must sit deathwatch at his bedside, and watch him breath his last breath.  The 6 hours I spent alone (they all cleared out when I came in, insisting that we should be alone) with him was ***brutal***.

It has always been Brother and I against the world.  

But I can't do this.  I can't do this alone, watching the *one* person who has always had my back die before my eyes while I hold his hand... while he is already brain-dead.

I can't watch him choking on the mucus in his lungs that he has no strength or will to expel.

And please, no religious stuff.  I know you would mean well, but neither Brother nor I subscribed to that, despite Mother's strong Catholic beliefs.

So all that said, I need your advice:

193,"Long story short, back in May, I cut off a very toxic ex who was emotionally abusive, manipulated me, gaslighted me, and over-all was an absolute wreck to my emotional health. I ended it by telling him that we needed to stop talking to each other and blocking him on literally everything.

All of the other friends I made their have left. And I have been alone without friends here. The only person I know that lives here too his my ex.

194,"Is it OCD? I dont know, I just want to get rid of it. And I have to say that I had to pour my brain into this post, otherwise I would pretty much ignore the comments because, well, it wasnt perfectly written. 

I want to rid myself off perfectionism which I'm sure I have. 

I feel like this whole perfectionist problem I have has deepened so much that I feel like 

me searching for solutions to my perfectionism 

is

being influenced by perfectionism. Now I have to find the perfect way to battle perfectionism. Irony at its WORST I guess.

Oh, wait! And if you think about it, now Im trying to find the perfect way to stop searching for perfect ways of dealing with perfectionism! 

It all feels like a never ending loop and I believe I can never fall out of it. Makes me go crazy when I have to think about it, and it is worse when I actively want to stop thinking backwards and finding more flaws in myself. 

On top of that, I am constantly trying to find the perfect way to solve any problem and I always want the holy grail for doing anything and everything. Want to wash clothes? There is probably this one person that knows of this one method that is perfectly curated for this special detergent and cloth type and it will give me clothes that are as good as new! Now I'm putting the actual washing process on hold just to find that godsent washing method which I will probably never find. 

I cant study, I cant socialize, I cant do anything really. (And, you know what my mind is telling me right now? The fact that I said ""I cant do anything"" is just forcing me to find perfect ways to do them.)

This pretty much happens with everything I do. If you check my browsing history, the amount of ""best way to do X"" searches you can find is mind boggling. And it's not about one thing really, I always have to find the best pdf reader, the best ebook reader, the best site for this and that, the best subreddit for X and the best method for Y. 

Even if I get advice regarding this matter, I'm probably only going to label them as perfect methods and I'll do them and if I dont get anything from them I'll probably resort to another perfection-loop of trying to find other perfect methods. (I hope not though, I just wanted to get my mind out cuz I would be really bothered if I didnt. I will use your advice to break out of perfectionism.)

I actually want to resort to mild drugs to aid me with this because Ive read that drugs will make you feel like you can conquer the world. Like nicotine, nothing more. Maybe that can help me stop giving a damn about perfection. Telling myself ""love yourself"" has helped a little because I tend to do things that I want to do when I say that to myself, but apart from that it's all a perfectionism-induced nightmare.

Any advice is REALLY appreciated.

I'm 18 and I don't know what to do anymore, My big family is breaking apart and everyone is very stressed. Multiple family members have died over the past couple of years. I recently got my diploma and trade from Job Corps and have been home for 3 months. I can't get a job because most jobs in my trade require me to have 2+ years of experience or a degree. I ended up getting a bullshit factory job which was going well until I got put ""on call"" from them the second week, which was their way of firing me without saying it. My mom is expecting me to be able to just up and go find find a job when she hasn't had one for about a year. She keeps asking me why I haven't been able to find a job and has been saying she can help but when I ask she never can really answer. I'm fed up with applying to places day in day out and not even getting emails back. I'm tired of my mom pushing her depression from past relationships and experience from her life on me. I'm tired of her thinking when things aren't going my way I 'give up'. I just don't understand why she keeps putting all her shit on me. I just try to keep to myself, stay out of trouble. She sees this as me staying in room and not hanging out with friends. We had a one-sided argument about this today. She says that me sticking to myself and doing music in my room isn't how life is to be lived. I'm making money from music btw, she is forcing me to get a ""real job"". I try and do things to shut her up and it bites me in the ass and she gets on my ass 10x more. I'm tired of trying to please my mom, I feel like I nowhere to go. My mom has no job, my father isn't sure if he wants to be in my life or not. Everyone else in my family is going through their own personal issues with depression and poverty and I'm getting thrown into this fuck of a mess. I've never contemplated suicide this much, the last time I remember being this hopeless and hurt was when we were homeless and going from shelter to shelter when I was 8 or 9. Lots of people are trying to give me 'answers' and nothing is working for me. I've been trying to fight the urge to just end it for a very long time but it hasn't peeked like it has now. I guess me trying just isn't enough. My mom wants me to go out and do superficial things with my friends like movies, shows and going to the mall, but that's never really been something I wanted or can do because we are so fucking poor. Now that I'm thinking about it I can't even think about a thing that she has actually gotten me it's always something someone has gave to us or she's gotten with someone elses money. I don't hate my mom but she's really starting to get to the point were I'm starting to hate her. I never really had a childhood because of me having to take care of my younger siblings since I've been 7 or 8. I feel stuck and that I can't do anything. Music has been the only thing that been keeping me sane and the only thing I can really do to keep my emotions at bay. My 3 months away from home I felt normal for once, like I could breathe. A few weeks after getting back I feel myself back in this depression cycle looking for some way to get through this.I don't have 'self-love' issues or anything like that. I love myself, and the person I am but this part of my life is making it hard to any light at the end of my tunnel at all. I feel like I'm crawling through life blindly and just expected to find my fucking way without any productive help.

I've been trying to get another job and get the fuck out of her house but I cannot find another job, I have no work history besides this little stint at that temp job I had, never been arrested. I live in  a North Eastern ""suburb"" with no car. I applied to many 'meh' jobs.

I met up with an acquaintance whom I met the last time I was here to have dinner and drinks. We both got very drunk, I consumed way more than I should have (2 bottles of sake, 3 beers, 4 glasses of plum wine, and red wine) and blacked out. The last thing I remember is drinking red wine at the bar with my acquaintance, and then waking up in my hotel room next to him as he got up to get dressed to leave around 6am. I was so confused, I had no intention of hooking up with him whatsoever, I was definitely still drunk when I woke up but I asked him if we had sex and if he used a condom and he said we did but it was unprotected. He left, I fell back asleep and woke up a few hours later to go to the bathroom and immediately realized I was in pain, both vaginally and anally. It was the last day of my period and I know I had a tampon in when I met up with him but I realized it was no longer in and I didn’t remember taking it out. I later found the tampon on the floor next to the bed. I remember brief snippets of our interaction in bed, I remember him on top of me and me biting his shoulder, I’m not sure if that was out of pleasure or out of resistance, I also remember a moment of being penetrated from behind anally, as he spanked me so hard that I have bruising. I later messaged him expressing how upset and hurt I was because I didn’t really remember consenting or our interaction in bed, he said he thought it was consensual because we went to buy condoms together (I don’t remember this at all), I feel so alone and confused as to what happened, I feel like I have no where to turn and no one to talk to, I feel so fucking violated. Was this rape? Either way, this has felt extremely traumatizing and I know I’m going to need help to move past this. I’m also feeling extremely vulnerable as I struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts. Is there a free crisis hotline I can call internationally? I’m leaving tomorrow and flying back home to NYC where I’ll be getting tested immediately. I also realize I should probably speak to a psychologist about this as I’m feeling pretty debilitated right now. However, I don’t have health insurance so I’m not really sure of my options. Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",17Nov2018,1

210,"I've been a decent computer guy as long as i can remember. A few years ago i left the military as an IT, i got a job in IT and got quickly bored of it. I decided i wanted to do something other people could enjoy. I left IT and got a job as a cook, then as a baker (which i currently am). I thought long and hard about what i wanted to do and decided that film animation, helping to make 3D movies like Wreck it Ralph and Inside Out would be an amazing thing if all the stars aligned. The more i thought about it, the more it made sense that thats what i wanted to do. And it still is.

But the issue is, all the schools I've talked to, while they will teach me the computer side of 3D film animation, in order to gain access to thier colleges i need a traditional art portfolio. So, 2D sketches, figures, observational art pieces and stuff like that. But i haven't had an art class since middle school. My skills on paper are essentially 0. 

As a 24 year old vet living with his parents and eager to move on in life, my first thought was that it would take years for me get decent enough at what they needed from me to even be considered. I've seen some of the portfolios they showcased on thier websites and i dont feel like I'm anywhere near that level of skill. I dont know where to begin at learning to be artistic. I thought about taking classes, and its still something i want to do, but I'm afraid to sit at home and sketch waiting to be good enough to be accepted.

I dont know now if i made a bad choice for wanting to do something art-like without a background in art or if there is an easy way to get started that i havent seen.",17Nov2018,1
211,"I don't really know what to say here, but to give you a run down of my current life.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 16-21, I was diagnosed with depression, but honestly, who isn't depressed now. Everyone is at one point or another. I'm not really here to talk about this, but when I was depressed, I did have suicidal thoughts. This isn't what I'm here to talk about but it will be important later. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some other key factors: I have a short temper in general, I had a very traumatic childhood (The best way I can describe it without going into detail is a lot of, really fucked up shit happened) which resulted in some heavy, heavy abandonment issues. (All of my relationships I've had before I met my wife were ended because I was so scared that the other person would leave me that I pushed them to leaving, which only perpetuated my fear.)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, onto the topic at hand. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have been working 3rd Shift (11PM to 8AM) for a little over a year now. Before this, I worked a normal 8-5, for the same company. I moved to this position because it was more responsibility and more pay. Before I started my career, before I met my wife, and before my daughter was born, I was a mess. I was taking just about any drug I could get my hand on, I was very angry with the world around me. I blamed just about everything on something or someone else. I met my wife, and started my career around the same time. After that, I changed, completely. I still smoke weed regularly, and that's because it helps cope with the depression. Otherwise, I take a medication that does help, but it nulls my other senses as well. I won't be depressed, but I also won't be happy, or sad. It makes me indifferent about things. But besides that, when I started this career, I was driving 15 minutes one way to work, working 8-5, and getting to come home to my lovely wife and eventually, daughter every day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a year or two, I get ""promoted"". I use quotes because yes, while it was a promotion, I really don't feel that way. I went from driving 15 minutes to work, working 8-5, driving 15 minutes home, and spending time with my family, to now driving a little over 1 Hour to get to work, working 11PM to 8AM, driving a little over an hour home, and getting to see my wife for maybe 15 minutes if I'm lucky before she goes to work, and spending 3-4 hours with my daughter before having to take her to my grandparents so I can get some sleep. And that's if I get 6 hours of sleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

To put the icing on the cake, a few months after I get here, it is revealed that some people on my team have been breaking major rules, some that could cause very large issues, only for it to come down on everyone. We were able to pin point the exact person that caused these issues, but everyone was reprimanded for the issue. This is where I started to notice my behavior. I went from always being the first person in the office, to being the last person in the office. And as issues like this kept arising, they continued to handle the same way. With a team punishment attitude. Now, in my line of work, if you don't have anxiety, then something is wrong with you. It's high-stress, high-function. But that anxiety, coupled with what I guess is just, maybe a lack of sleep or pure depression, caused me to just, give up. I gave up for about a week. I didn't really know what to do with myself for a while because I felt like I was directly responsible for what was going on. Even though I was a key factor in bringing these issues to light, I got punished for them. This began a long string of calling out of work, taking half-days, procrastinating on vital jobs, and just a general careless attitude about my work. One of my supervisors did confront me about this, and noticed that I had been very lethargic as of recent, but I just told them it was nothing. I really should have said something but, hindsight is 20/20. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, the short temper, the anger, the depression, and the feeling of being abandoned have come back, almost ten-fold. Like someone dropped an Acme weight on my head. I find myself lashing out at the smallest things. For example, my wife and I are looking at purchasing our first home. When I asked my wife where exactly she wants the home to be, she stated she didn't really care where it was. What happened in my brain is as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

Location of home = Don't care

Don't care about location = Don't care about home

Don't care about home = Doesn't want a home with me (even though we already live together)

Doesn't want a home with me = Doesn't want me (Even though we're married)

&amp;#x200B;

And that happens, in the blink of an eye in my head. And immediately I went on the defensive. Only for my wife to explain she doesn't care, she just cares that it's with myself and our daughter. And my wife has never, ever done anything to make me feel less loved, or that she would ever hurt me. This happens with almost everything. The smallest conversation can turn into an argument with the snap of a finger because my mind just, spins it so fast. So fast that I don't even get a chance to comprehend what I'm doing. Before I know it, I'm so angry, over nothing. Over literally nothing. Over a far-fetched scenario that I played out in my head. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I have been considering leaving the working world for a while, to focus on both my mental health, and my family. I feel like I'm missing crucial moments in my daughters life. I guess I'm here to ask if anyone else would recommend this sort of action? Or if not, what is some possible alternatives that I can maybe try to help quell these feelings that I have? Any advice would be helpful. 

&amp;#x200B;

She has a boyfriend , her parents found out  about him recently and were really upset about it. She decided to not contact/call him for  some days and.

However , there is something going on in her life which keeps bugging me and I am really tensed about how to help her. There is this evil asshole cousin 28M living in her house from some days. When I say evil , believe me I mean it. No matter what my friend does or says he has got to comment on it , be it her getting dressed for her tutions , be it her being on phone. He makes a irritating and useless comment. 

Now comes the part,  she just called me and was crying bitterly , he somehow sneaked into her  Facebook account and took some screenshots of the chats she had with her boyfriend. I adviced him to change the password , but she couldn't because the cousin is blackmailing her to shut up or he will show the chats to her parents.

221,"A little background on me: I suffer from a slew of mental issues, but most of all, sometimes crippling anxiety. I currently cannot afford therapy or anything and am managing it on my own, but I do think it clouds my judgment at times. I am also 29 and AFAB non-binary, and incredibly introverted.

Anyway, I live on the East Coast, and as I'm sure everyone knows, we just had our first snowstorm. I went out to shovel out the car today, and one of the people helping out had a conversation with me, and immediately pressed me for social media information. I lied and said I did not have facebook (I don't like to add people I don't know) but when pressed further, I ended up giving out my instagram, which I do not have connected to FB or anything else.

This person told me that they just moved to the US and do not have many friends. We do not live in the same town, he only works at my apartment complex. He gave out a name which I'm not even sure is his name as it didn't match the one on instagram, and he's being really adamant about being friends, telling me I seem cool, and insisting it's not about dating. He did ask once in person if I was single or dating, and I said I was not looking or interested. 

I've since messaged back a grand total of *two* times on Insta, short and sweet and said I am not interested in hanging out as my schedule is too busy and I do not hang out with strangers unless I am with my friends, and they are too busy as their schedule always conflicts with mine so we rarely see one another as it is. I'm trying to avoid lying about things that can easily be found out, so I've been honest but guarded about it.

After that I suggested going to a church or interest group to make local friends, as that is what I would do if I were new to an area and wanted to meet like-minded people, and I am avoiding checking back as I don't want to seem like I'm interested or available in any way. 

Unfortunately, I feel like if I slight this guy that he's going to retaliate against my car or my residence, since he knows (generally) where I live and also what my car looks like, and I cannot afford to have anything happen to my car, I work to survive and it has sentimental value to me because of how much I've worked to maintain it.

That said, what I would like to know is:

• Am I just being paranoid? Do people generally do this sort of thing when they meet people and trade a social media account name? I usually only add people like coworkers / former classmates and even then, they're not hitting me up to hang out five minutes later, so I have no idea if this is normal or acceptable behavior.

• Am I going about this the right way? I want to let the conversation die out in a way that doesn't make me seem like a complete asshole. I do not know this person's intentions nor do I know how they'll react if I *do* act like a jerk about it. I have serious trust issues with people in general and do not know how to navigate situations like this in where the person might be able to contact me offline.

All I can find is advice for people who are trying to date, so I would like some personal input that actually matches the situation as I have no intentions or desires to date anyone, ever.

Thank you.",17Nov2018,1

223,"Reposting cuz I posted during dead hours last night 

So little back story, I work at a huge home renovation/improvement store as a loader, in which I help bring in carts, help people load items into their cars, and if other employees need help with other things inside, I help them out. I’ve been working here since April of this year and I absolutely love my job.

Now I know usually people in these kinds of threads always try to paint themselves as golden people, but I’m not gonna do that in this post.

I feel like I’m going to be fired from my job soon, but I’m not sure if it’s just me being anxious. I have several suspicions.

First, long story short, around a month ago, myself and another coworker accidentally did a safety violation, and keep in mind that at our work, we take safety super seriously. I admit I did a mistake; a bunch of exams were coming up, and my life, during that time, was go to school and work, and if it wasn’t either of those, it was studying, so I was very exhausted at mostly everything I did, which is why I let the safety violation happen. An assistant manager saw, and he didn’t really yell at us, so to say, but I guess he sternly told us, in short, what to do next time to avoid the safety violation and that if this were to happen again, we would both be written up. Ok, fair enough, I know what I did was wrong. As said before, we take safety very seriously at our store; someone actually recently got fired for a safety violation.

Next, I usually close once a week, sometimes twice, and the store closes at 10 PM, but I’m scheduled to leave at 10:30. The problem? I’m not really needed in the store after 10 PM because my duties are done. There are 3 assistant managers who work there, and there are 2 that usually work on the days I close (not both at once though, only one of them would be closing.) One of the managers wants the closer in my department to stay until 10:30, while the other doesn’t really care. I usually try to stay until 10:30 because I don’t know if I’ll get in trouble or not if I leave. So I stick around just in case I might be needed for something, but to be honest, what usually happens is that I stick around the front end, talking to one of my coworker/friend, who closes as a cashier, and then leave with her when she’s done. Sometimes the managers might see me not doing something, which then they’ll tell me to do something, to which I finish the given task and then they nudgingly tell me I can clock out, (to which I mean they’ll ask me something like “So are you about to clock out?”) I don’t know if I’m annoying them or not, but I feel like if I leave early I might get them upset, but it also feels like if I stay I annoy them. Another person who works in my department always leaves at 10 when they are the closer, and the manager who wants us to stay till 10:30 knows and he doesn’t like when the person in my department does that, but this person has been here for 2 years and he hasn’t ever gotten in trouble for it.

Finally, another person got hired to work in our department, which I’m not sure might be a replacement for me or not. On one hand, this person has been hired in to work as mid shift during the week, which is something we’ve DESPERATELY need, cuz  out of the 5 people that work in our department, 3 of us go to school.(for example on the weekday where I close, it would be an opener working 8 hours until they leave, to which there is an 1 and a half hour gap of no one in my department is there until I arrive, which results in a lot of work  to be done when I arrive. ) I don’t know how exactly it is on other days, but I’m pretty sure it’s oddly similar.) but on the other hand, maybe they’re possibly my replacement. But then again, we’ve had many new hires throughout the store over the past couple weeks. 

I guess what worries me the most is something specific that has happened. So basically, every Sunday, I opened, worked 8-4:30, and then my friend/coworker comes in at 12 and closes at 8:30. In our most recent schedule, a Sunday I work in around 4 weeks has me working 10-4, and I have overall less hours during that week than I usually have (since school started, I’ve worked 20-25 hours per week. On the specific week I’m talking about, I’m working 16.) does this mean they’re cutting my hours in preparation of firing me? But then again, I’ve been told that, overall, everyone’s hours get cut during the winter season because we aren’t as busy as we were before.

Overall, I feel like Im on everyone’s good side in the store, including the manager and assistant manager, but I feel like due to recent screw-ups and inconveniences, they might be looking into firing me and replacing me. I’m not sure if this is just me being anxious or if this might be the case.",17Nov2018,1

Some important information you need to know before we get into the crux of what’s happening: 

1. I’m from England and moved to Australia for a year 
2. My mum has a big family, majority of who live in this area of Australia 
3. I originally lived with one set of Auntie/Uncle and moved to live with an Auntie who lived closer to the job I got 
4. I had paid rent in the first living arrangement, which they chose the price for and I was more than happy to pay 
5. Whenever I visited I offered to pay/help out the family of who I was staying with 
6. My brother also moved to Australia later on, however he had decided it was more permanent, where as I was going to move home to get back into University 
7. My mother unfortunately fell out with her family whilst I was there which caused disagreements but nothing extreme (or so I though...) 

So here we are four-five months later. I’ve moved back to England, got my life back together here and thrown myself head first into University. 

I first knew there was something off when I sent an email to the Auntie I had been living with and didn’t hear anything back. Then another one whose birthday it had been, however I just decided that maybe they were busy. 

Then, my brother lets me know that he received a message from an Uncle (not directly related) who has basically over heard I didn’t pay rent and feels I have taken advantage of my Auntie who is now struggling. 

I’m confused, because three-four times I had bought this up with her only for her to say “I’ll think about it” or “we’ll talk about it later” like I thought it was fine and of course if she had wanted me to pay I would have. I also would offer to pay for groceries and if we went out, aware that she was kindly letting me live rent free. 

Now, all this time later I am hearing that she has been telling the family that’s she felt she couldn’t talk to me about it, that she feels we had fallen out and towards the end I stopped talking to her. Now a narrative which I’m not even being included in is being spread through my family and I’m hearing it, not even second hand. 

To make matters worse, I spent a year with these people and they are blindly believing it, knowing that this is not me. For example, the email I mentioned earlier, sent to my Auntie to catch up. They are now misconstruing this as me trying to keep her sweet so if I want to come back I’ll have a bed. Plus adding in things they feel I have done wrong, or ways I have made them feel that they have never voiced.

232,"Hello, I’m a 20 Year old Male, I live in the Midwest, and I work in automotive sales. I’ve honestly come to the conclusion that over the course of the last few weeks, I’m completely bitter. I’ve felt as if the little things have made me extra frustrated, and that I’m taking it out on others.. even the smallest things, I’ll get heated about. It’s affecting my relationship and work. I don’t know what to do to get rid of my bitter/frustrated feeling. I’m fucking drained from my job, and we’re getting into the slow part of the year where it snows, and my job is very important to me so if it’s going bad I somewhat let it control how I feel about everything. This causes me to argue with my girlfriend, and not spend time with friends. It’s terrible. I’ve been working the same job since I got out of high school, and I’m nervous to get out of something I’m so used to doing, I’m good at it, but I’m just stressed. 

TLDR: I’ve been bitter and frustrated with work to the point where I feel like it’s ruining my life",17Nov2018,1

234,"I broke up with my first girlfriend a few weeks ago. All I wanted to do was help her become a better person, since she’s had a really rough past and I wanted her to be a role model for herself, ya know? During the relationship, she kept bringing up this ex, and made it seem like jealousy was the worst thing on the planet. Being my first, I started getting jealous... and I got scared she’d call me crazy. I’ve tried opening up a few times, but she made the excuse that she felt useless whenever I did, then berated me for not opening up. And now she claimed that all I did by doing that was hurt her because I kept teeter-tottering during the relationship. She compared me to the worst people she’s ever known. I’m not saying she’s wrong... there’s probably truth to that that I just don’t see. I dunno. I feel like it’s my fault for all of this, that if I didn’t try to open up everything would be fine. I just feel like maybe, by helping people, all I do is hurt them. And all I wanted to do was help people... to help her. I’ve pretty much lost all self confidence from this, and I don’t know what to do now. It hurts too much to move on. I don’t even know where to start.

236,"Some context:

I (M.19) live in a student house with 4 girls (one of which is my girlfriend, we are both on the tenancy). Another of our housemates has a boyfriend who rents a place in the town, further away from our university. Since the school year started, he has slept in his own house maybe 3-4 times and spent the rest staying over at ours.  In addition to using all of our resources (electricity, internet, water etc.) he also doesn't clean up after himself, is incredibly loud in the early hours of the morning whilst I'm trying to sleep and refuses to do any housework. Despite this, he always wants his say when we discuss things about the house (laundry, cleaning rotas, things of that nature). I find this shit incredibly disrespectful to both myself and the landlord who was reluctant to let me and my partner stay together but has been lovely to us since we moved in and incredibly generous. We spoke to them around 2 weeks ago to say that it's unfair that we all pay rent to be here and he stays over constantly, they agreed that they would work out a plan to stay over at his more often. This, as you might be able to tell, hasn't happened. What can I do to help this? They are still my friends and I don't want to cause arguments, but I'm so stressed and tired of it that I don't know where to go. All help appreciated.",17Nov2018,1
237,"Parents have been renovating a house in Scotland for a while, whilst we have been living in South East of England. House is nearly ready, so we move to a rental property nearby so they can finish it off quicker. I desperately need to move out but the rental property is in prime location for nothing apart from walking for hours and seeing nobody.

I am a 22 year old male who lives with parents, and up until this year had not done much in life. Health had played it's part in myself never thinking I'd be able to move out of my parents house and at the beginning of this year I managed to get my health and the issue under control. I had a sleep disorder which caused me to need a lot of it, otherwise I couldn't physically keep my eyes open and get out of bed. I'd basically get up when I could and go to sleep when I needed, this meant I'd sometimes be awake during the night and sleep during the day or vise versa and often sleep for whole 24 hour periods. This stopped me from being able to make plans and I ended up becoming a bit of a recluse in the 5 or so years that this affected me since barely scraping through education. At the start of 2018 I had a week long stay in the country's leading neurological hospital. During the 7 day stay, I was put on a medication that had promising results in the past, and with the dedication and persistence of the NHS staff, I managed to regulate my sleep and largely decrease the amount that I needed. 3 months later and I start volunteering at a boarding kennel, 2 months after that I get a temporary job at the kennels over the busy summer period (my first ever job - other than Saturday jobs when I was in school). Finished that in mid-September, the time there was honestly the happiest I've ever been. Started working as a warehouse picker a couple of weeks after leaving the kennels, and I really enjoyed this as well (I just really enjoy working and meeting people and doing new things at the moment). It was during the time of working at the warehouse that a time frame was set for moving to a rental up in Scotland, which i'd known would happen when taking the job at the warehouse (deadline for moving was before Christmas). It was 3 days before this time frame/deadline was made that I had an accident in the wet whilst en route to work on my 125cc scooter/moped which I had bought as my first vehicle in August, going for the moped over a car as this was the easiest and quickest way that I would be able to get a vehicle and use it on the road (had driving lessons in a car before, so had some experience on road before taking the Compulsory Basic Training needed to ride moped). Moped needed repairing and I was hobbling about with a bruised leg and stiff back, so I made the decision to leave the warehouse job and start getting ready for Scotland. I had plans to (and still very much do) move out into my own place, not totally disconnected from my parents but not down the road from them either (this would be hard anyway as the place they have bought and renovating is remote as well, nothing but a couple villages within 25 minute drive and nearest city/town type place is about 50 minutes drive). After the stressful period of packing and unexpected changes, we are now in a rental property, where the closest small towns and villages are a good 20 minutes drive away. This would not be a problem if I had a car, but I have a little moped that is pulling to the left pretty bad, as the repair job that I paid for back in England has I think missed something, a moped that does 0-60 in a good 45 seconds downhill, a moped that I am still not 100% confident on since falling off and almost 0% confident on going down little country roads with leaves, sheep shit, mud, potholes, blind corners and a decreased ability to take those corners if they happen to turn right. So what would take a car 20 minutes, takes me 45. And it'll probably end up taking my life as well if I risk it too often. There is a bus stop about 15 minute walk from the rental property, a bus goes through there 6 or so times a day while doing its rounds through the smaller villages, with the latest being around 5:30pm-6:00pm. I am renting a storage container in the closest city, that has basically all my belongings inside, apart from clothes, toiletries and bare essentials. I was lead to assume that this would be easily accessible from where we would be staying. This is not the case. 45 minute drive, 2 hour unsafe ride on moped with no way of transporting belongings apart from a backpack, and almost 2 hours public transport each way with a with a curfew of 6pm when the bus doesn't run near the rental property anymore and a whole bunch of money spent on travel (money that I don't really have much of in the grand scheme of things If I want to be renting my own 1 bed flat). 


So my predicament is that I need a job, my own place and means to get to things including said job  without too much hassle, while I am in the process of getting a better suited vehicle i.e. a car. 


I really would like to continue kennel work, but getting another job in this line is going to be a lot harder than finding work at a warehouse and would most likely mean travelling a bit as they are often located away from built up areas, travelling which is not the easiest for me right now. A built up area such as the one with my storage container, that would take a couple of hours for me to get to from the rental property I'm at now, has a lot of jobs that would be easier for me to secure as there are a few large industrial areas and warehouses that I have seen jobs advertised for in the past.


I honestly don't know how to tackle this, as I am very restricted when it comes to getting places to even start looking at my options. I have not got a great amount of funds to dig into. My sleep has started to deteriorate and go haywire again, I am actually losing my faculties from being constantly stressed and don't know where or how to start the process without coming to a point very quickly where I would need to go somewhere but not be able to get there.


If there is an obvious point or possibility that I may have missed or not thought of, or if you could think of anything that may help, happy to answer questions. All is appreciated.

238,"Yesterday, I had quite a fortunate situation. I was at a meetup, a cute and also generally cool woman was sitting next to me (and continued to sit next to me even after the group had to spread out a bit to make space for others), I think I was the first one to say something to her, but between talking with the general group and ourselves she initiated maybe multiple conversations, and also would look at my face for my reaction to different things that would happen in the group.

ANYWAY. This seems like a perfect scenario, right? For some reason, here is the way I actually felt at the time:

1. Annoyed that she was talking to me
2. Simultaneously ""unattracted"" to her and yet aroused (like a brief mild boner at some point, just to be honest)

???????

What the f\*\*k?

I didn't even really feel nervous. I felt ANNOYED that she was talking to me.

After thinking about it a bit later, I think I felt annoyed because I felt like there is a certain way I had to be when I was talking with her? Later on, I feel like what I really wanted to do was just get up a leave the group with her, not necessarily for the entire duration of this particular social event (which was 1.5 hours), but at least for like 10-15 minutes to just walk around (I hate these sitting + talking in a group things in general - I know that sounds weird, but I'd rather be doing some activity while talking), and then we could re-join the group.

Instead, I guess I felt like I was ""forced"" to keep my conversation and actions pretty limited because it would be weird to do otherwise? And for some reason this type of thing appears to affect me way, way more than other people?

241,"Hi, Reddit. I hope you understand how hard it is for me to write this post. 

I've known I was gay for as long as I can remember. Only recently did I own up to it. A couple of my friends know, too. I live in the Middle East, in a very conservative community with my very conservative parents. I'm a senior in high school.

I've sent some nudes and stuff (to guys) and received some (from guys). Accessed some (gay) porn sites. Nothing I'm proud of, but nothing a teenager wouldn't do. My sister saw these on **my** iPad (DAMN YOU, iCloud!!!!). She blackmailed me with them for a few months (stop or I'll tell everyone about it!!!) and I know she has always been envious/jealous of me. It's almost like she hates me. I'm a top student and I am currently applying to universities in the US for obvious reasons. She blames me for everything bad in her life. And I've always felt bad because she feels like she's living in my shadow. 

Well, today, she had a tantrum. I shit you not, a *literal* one. She started screaming at everyone, and she wouldn't eat lunch. She started saying how I stole her friends. And how I'm going to the US even though she said she wanted to go before me. And then she said I'm g... She wouldn't say the whole word, only the sound (g). She said she had proof, and that I've sent pics to guys, and that she knows they won't believe her but it's true. Then my mother started asking questions.

She asked whether I have feelings towards guys. She asked whether I like any girls, and why I've never had a girlfriend. My answers were passive to almost everything. I told her it was just a phase I'm going through. I told her I'm not in a place where I can be with someone. 

But then she said if I were gay, it's abnormal and then she'd kill herself but not before killing me. And I think she means it. You would, too, if you knew the kind of environment I was from. 

This all happened around an hour ago. My life is going downhill at a speed of 10000km/hr. That's how I feel. I feel almost numb, like I know this will all be over soon, and in a few months I'll be in a big city in the U.S. studying in some major research university. But these are just dreams for now. Unattainable dreams. Oh and did I mention that my sister said that was the reason I wanted to leave to the US? So I could be free to be with guys? 

I know that for a teenager in the U.S., this would be it. No more lies. No more pretense. He/she would just come out. But I'm not in the U.S. I've lost count of how many times I've been told that LGBT is bad, and how many priests would preach it at school while I sat there, boiling on the inside, trying to act normal. As if that were a thing. 

A few years ago, I promised myself that if anyone *ever* knew I was gay, I'd immediately kill myself. End it all. And that's how it feels right now. If my mother/father does some digging, and figures out everything was true, wouldn't it be easier to just jump off my 4th floor apartment and end it all? 

I just.. need some advice. That's what I need. 

P.S. I've posted this to another community. Just in case you see it twice.

242,"so i recently got engaged. when my then boyfriend and i were talking about getting engaged, his mother was so excited and even said she would split the costs with my family. she showed no signs of not liking me, in fact she said she loves me and constantly talked about me to family, would tell me in i’m drop dead gorgeous like 5 times a day, took me out to breakfast occasionally, and once i complimented her purse and the next day she went out and bought me one. i have also been super super nice in return so i don’t see any reason for her to not like me (other than the fact that my fiancé used to spend a lot of time with her and now all his time goes to me.) a couple weeks ago our families went to our first bridal show together. it was so much fun for all of us. i ended up getting my wedding dress and all this fun stuff. at the end of the day, my mom goes to my future mother-in-law to talk about what each family’s part in the wedding costs we’re going to be. she tells my mom that it is “customary” that the girls family pays for it all (keep in mind i’m an indian marrying a white dude which is pretty un-fucking-customary) and that the grooms family just pays for the rehearsal dinner, she also said their side paid for her daughters entire wedding. here’s why, her and her husband were in the middle of her divorce, to fuck him over, she gave her daughter the grandest wedding and used all his money. she would have never paid for the whole thing if they were both together. and then she just leaves. she walks away without even saying bye to me on my day. she claims that her and my fiancé talked about it and he said they didn’t have to pay anything for the ceremony and reception. now i found that so disrespectful to my family. our side is going to have more people so my parents didn’t want an even split, just a fair share for OUR wedding. it is not fair to put the entire cost of the wedding on my family who is pretty middle class. i’m just graduating college and i have two other sisters going in after me. it’s not that my parents couldn’t afford to pay for the whole wedding, but i just find it terribly unfair to put the whole thing on them when it’s both our weddings, not mine. when i brought these concerns up to my fiancé, he said he sees both mine and his mothers side. he said the cost list was something he found online so it must be the truth. he also said he sees his mothers side because she is retired and what she has is what she has to live off for the rest of her life. oh and one more thing, his mother has a million dollar house and a sports car and is constantly redecorating and eating out, and traveling, so clearly she is not struggling. so then i tried to come up with somewhat of a compromise which is that his mom would pay for the photographer, videographer, and DJ and my family would pay for the rest of the ceremony and reception. she won’t even do that. she refuses and i think her and my fiancé now have a declining relationship because of wedding costs. i’m starting to hate her and i just get irritated anytime my fiancé brings her up and i am sure she talks mad shit about me. my fiancé offered to pay for it himself but i don’t want our marriage to start off with a huge chunk missing from his savings, especially because i am just graduating college and might not find a full time job for a few months and my parents don’t feel comfortable that it’s coming from his pocket too. we just don’t understand how his mother did a whole 360 on us and now won’t pay for a thing. i don’t even want anyone from my side of the family to go to the rehearsal dinner. i am starting to really resent her and i don’t want to lock down a date or a venue until SHE agrees to pay for it. not my fiancé. it’s HER son’s wedding too.

243,"My 21 year old son just came out as gay to his mother and I. His mother supported him, but I was unresponsive. I’m not going to lie, it was a crushing blow to my heart.

I just can’t wrap my head around having a son that’s gay. I wanted my son to be a manly man. As a father I never imagined this scenario. I don't agree with homosexuality. I don't think it's right. Homosexuality is incompatible with real masculinity and therefore full male adulthood. Me having a gay son is an attack on my own masculinity.

People are going to look at me as less of a man for having a gay son. I did not want my son to be a sissy. I can’t wrap my head around him having intercourse and being in a relationship with a man and not a woman. Knowing what two men do to each other is disgusting.

\---

Rant:

I want to be with people but I fear their baggage. I crave being someone’s friend so much but I’m also too afraid that I don’t have the capacity for “a family” of friends. I wish I could have that but I’m unable to.

When I do surround myself with people, I don’t feel like I belong. I want to belong. I know many people probably feel the same way but that’s the problem, they’re alone too. I’m alone and they’re alone but we’re not alone together. We are separate.

When I listen to people bond over music, I can’t say I can do the same thing. I don’t listen to any contemporary music. I only listen to instrumentals or spiritual poems, I can’t relate to anybody in real life over that. I really despise most contemporary music (be it indie, pop, rap, underground, etc) and it seems like the people around me can’t get enough of it. Normally I hate imposing my own preferences over others or being a picky person but I just can’t bear listening to people talk in my head saying senseless things, and even if the song is soul-filled and speaks about an important matter, I feel disturbed by the additional emotions I have to carry when listening to it. Generally, I feel that I have a lot of emotions and lyrical music amplifies them unnecessarily. I can only feel at peace with meditative sounds or purely instrumental, soft music.

When people bond over shows, I rarely find myself interested in the shows other people watch. I do watch a few popular shows but I’m not exactly obsessed with so many like the people around me are. I don’t know who’s strange around here, them or me? I feel like I’m wasting my life away when I watch too much TV.

The reason I mention things like TV and music is because this is what the people around me generally bond over, it's the basic stuff, and I can't seem to find anybody who wants to go deeper than that. I feel left out. I struggle to fit in and in the past I usually did but now it's not as easy. I'm at a period of my life where I'm developing a very strong set of morals and I'm struggling to reconcile it with my harmony-craving, deep-connection-seeking self.

The only thing that doesn’t feel like a waste of time is when I reflect. I feel ashamed of the irony; being someone who reflects so much but holds no answers when it comes to the ailments of their own heart.

When I speak to people, they start to speak about other people and I fear backbiting. The feeling I get after I get sucked into the conversation and forget about my own morals then snap back to them again is awful, it makes me want to never return. I don’t want to be insensitive to people. I really don’t. I wish I could share their feelings without having to talk negatively about anybody or having to stop us from backbiting (because they start to feel like I’m defending the person who caused them pain). I hope this makes sense.

I also feel that I don’t have a life. My insecurity soars when I’m around people. It’s like I shield myself from sadness when I retreat. I get so envious and intimidated sometimes that I never want to speak to anybody ever again. I don’t want to feel spiteful towards them, I hate holding that bitterness and negativity inside of me but I can’t seem to resolve it. I feel so small around people that I want to avoid them to avoid this feeling, for both of our sake. I can’t build friendships with people knowing that deep down I feel jealous of them.

I know it’s not right, but whenever I sense insecurity, I start to harm myself. I harm the way I think of myself and I harm my body (not by seriously/directly hurting it, but by eating too much or too little, picking at my skin, staring at my flaws in the mirror, etc).

It feels like I hold so much inside of me, I’m scared that it’ll be too much to fix. But there must be something that I can do; there must be something, one thing that’s at the core of all of this, that’s holding me back from living.

I wish I could befriend the neighbours for example but I also don’t feel ready. It feels like I’ll get insecure again or lost for words and I hate it (as I should) when I feel so ridiculous and worthless. I feel like I can’t communicate even though I was much praised as a child for doing it so well. I don’t understand what happened to me.

I feel like I lost my ability to write and speak. Right now, I’m being repetitive with my words and I can’t seem to string them together in a way that reaches out to people correctly, in the cohesive and organised yet emotional manner that I wish they would.

Currently I go to a hard school and I'm very tied-up with getting the perfect grades. I'm experiencing a lot of stress and I rarely socialise.

I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. It feels lonely. I want to fix it but at the same time I don’t. Please help me.",17Nov2018,1
246,"Okay so this has a little bit of backstory.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a guy I know from school, been mates with him for several years but never best friends, just somebody I'd talk to in class. For a few years now I believe he's made up a whole bunch of shit, either to win sympathy or just to keep people interested in him, since he's very shy and introverted and doesn't really have many friends and isn't close to anyone in our friend group. A few of these lies include:

&amp;#x200B;

* Claiming he was attacked and mugged outside a shop at night in a town centre, where apparently there was no CCTV, and he never went to the police. He's never mentioned it since first telling it to us
* Breaking a rib, then going to a party a few days later and showing zero signs of injury. He's done the same with numerous surgeries and also broken wrists and ankles, never seen any evidence of him ever having these
* Having a girlfriend for two years who lived in the next town from me, yet who none of us have ever met or seen any evidence of. He claimed that she cheated on him, then begged for him back, and used to stalk him, but like I said, we've never seen a Facebook profile or gotten a full name from him or anything. He once organised a double date with a friend of ours, and then his gf allegedly stood him up. I think he bullshitted from the start and then said she stood him up to win pity

Basically, he's been doing this for a long time now. I struggle to talk to him because he's very shy, very introverted and just doesn't have any interests or hobbies, I don't even know what he does apart from play FIFA. He's never done me wrong, but I've got very little interest in being his best friend, especially after all of this, since I think he just bullshits constantly.

He messaged me earlier today. I've not seen the full message because I haven't opened it, but it says something about a diagnosis and how the doctors have told him something, so I assume that it's meant to be cancer and it's severe. Obviously, this is a fucking horrendous thing to happen, but after all of the times he's lied before, and since we've not spoken in two months, I find it very strange that he'd message me about this, and plus I just doubt it. I genuinely think this is another example of him trying to win some attention from people again. 

I'm not really sure where to go from here. I can't exactly accuse him of bullshitting, especially since cancer is such a severe issue, plus I don't really have any evidence to prove he's lying, only a pretty certain assumption after everything he's previously said. At the same time, I do genuinely believe he's bullshitting and I don't want to encourage his behaviour. I'd rather just ignore the message completely but I don't think that's an option knowing how severe this is.",17Nov2018,1

He came out a few minutes later and looked so angry. I didn't have the courage to bring it up bit I really want to talk about it.

How do I start the conversation and what should I say?

249,"About 2 months ago I started working a job on campus at my university. I am a full time student and ROTC cadet, meaning much of my time is already occupied. The benefit of my 15 hour a week job is a flexible schedule, but in recent days I’ve been pondering quitting this job. My boss is a weird kind of perfectionist/nitpicker who assigns us busy work just to see us work. She is worried about her boss firing her and takes out some of her stress on her employees because of it. Yesterday was really almost my tipping point because she cussed me out when I arrived to work because someone else had told her that I agreed to go into work earlier which is not true. She then demanded we have a mandatory meeting and whoever doesn’t show up will lose their job. With almost every bit of my free time dedicated to school work I feel that I do not need the added stress and time commitment of this job. What are your thoughts?",17Nov2018,1
250,"I've been a user of Reddit for a while. In that time, I've gone on subreddits for sexual conversations. Although I don't like sex itself, I like nudity and things like that, so these would be the topics of my conversations. I'm a guy, but sometimes I would RP as a girl. These conversations never lasted longer than a couple of days, then one or other of us involved would get bored and ghost. I got pretty used to it. Independently of this, I met a girl on a different sub, and we became friends through shared interests. We ended up meeting each other irl, and she ended up in a lot of group calls with my irl friend group, and talking a lot to one of my best friends, who was set apart from the irl group as he lived elsewhere (we knew each other through family). 

Me and this girl (let's call her Jana) had some flirty interactions, on-and-off, but were never in a relationship. At one point I made some comment about her boobs, started asking her questions, and she said she felt uncomfortable with the topic. I remember distinctly (and have messages to prove) that I immediately apologised and stopped with that line of inquiry. I realised pretty quickly that I'd behaved creepily, and didn't go there again. All flirtiness stopped after that. She ended up having a close friendship with my best friend ('Pablo'), and that was all cool. I got into a relationship with a girl from my irl group, and me and her were together for a year, but at the end of that year, she basically did a load of weed and drunk a load of alcohol, and seemed pretty paralytic, so I texted Jana to ask for advice (as I knew she hung out with weedheads). My girlfriend became pretty sober in the next half hour with water and juice, I got us a ride home, and we talked for a bit about how shit the night had ended up. We ended up having a bit of a break-up talk, for reasons unrelated, but she asked if she could stay over in the spare room for the night and I said sure. She went to bed. 

Jana saw the message I'd sent, and started berating me about 'oh she's going to die' and 'you have to call an ambulence,' and I told her she was fine now and all was okay. Despite this, Jana completely freaked out, repeatedly telling me I HAD to call an ambulence or I was going to lose her, and I was being selfish and stupid. I was pretty bummed out about the break-up, so I was sitting there drinking myself into a bit of a stupor. After an hour of her flat-out not listening to me, I just ignored her, and then she got Pablo to text me as well. From what he wrote, it was clear he didn't understand the situation at all, but was just doing it for a pat on the head from her. I explained things to him, and then she started texting me again. It all got too much for me, and I was feeling really, really low about it, so I went to the cupboard and got out this pack of codeine pills from when my mother was ill (she died before she took any, I guess we forgot to throw them away). I was planning on ODing on them as I just couldn't take the pressure from all angles, so I snapped, sent an angry message to Jana saying 'all that happened tonight was her fault,' took a couple of the pills, realised it was a bad idea and called Samaritans, who were able to talk me out of it. 

She didn't talk to me for ages, and then one day I apologised for snapping, and said given all that had happened, maybe it was best we didn't talk in future. 

She stayed in a couple of group chats just because I didn't think to remove her. The other day, someone jokily pointed out that she was still there, and she responded, saying she didn't know either, because I'd upset her quite a lot (this all happened while I wasn't online). She explained, from her limited POV, what had happened with the ex-girlfriend, claiming I'd 'refused to call an ambulence for a girl who was ODing, and got irrationally angry at her over it,' and then claimed I'd 'asked her questions about her body, and became angry when she'd refused to answer.' I can absolutely guarantee this is false. 

She went on to detail my reddit exploits, and I realised I'd stupidly done some of them on the same account as I'd used to message her. This wouldn't be a huge problem beyond embarrassing me in front of my friends, as I've said/done nothing illegal - but she claimed a couple of my personas were 'obviously' based on her. Incidentally, I don't think they were, they just happened to share characteristics. She then proceeded to quote things that I'd said in a private chat to someone. Clearly, either her or some other mutual friend (presumably Pablo) had picked up on one of my posts and RP'd with me, hoping to scrape up some shit to throw back in my face. She then said she'd 'got screenshots.' 

I was on my way to becoming fairly well-known in my field, but I can't do that anymore, because I know this coming out would destroy me, despite none of it actually being illegal; I'd have people doxxing me, I'd have a volume of hatemail my mental state can't cope with, I'd be driven right into my grave within a couple of days. Luckily, my friends in the chat called her out and suggested she was being 'a bit of a cunt' bringing this up randomly and trying to turn them against me. I appreciate that. 

But it doesn't change the fact that she has some case against me in the public eye. She's destroyed my lifelong friendship with Pablo, I don't know what else she could do, and clearly she's vindictive enough to do it.

252,"Just made this account for some advice.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm Sam, and I'm 16 and a sophomore in high school. My parents are divorced and I mostly live with my mom since my dad has a drug problem. But, since my mom is always working I stay over at my friend's , lets call her Jaclyn, house all the time. We get along extremely well and when we're together we usually play video games or go out for a drive together. Her older brother, who we can call Ron, is a 28 year old college drop out who looks like he's in his late thirties. He's quite bulky, slightly overweight, and isn't the strongest person alive, but can definitely overpower me since I'm a twig. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway. when I sleep over at Jaclyn's place or even just sitting alone while Jaclyn is out, Ron would come over and try to talk to me in this weird tone, usually having a slurred voice. Probably drunk. He tries to flirt with me and say I'm pretty, but I try to tell him I'm underage and straighter than a pencil, but this usually would make him mad. He usually gets so mad that I try to leave that he grabs my arms so tight it leaves marks. The first time this happened he sodomized me, which was the scariest time of my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

This happened around twice month. After around 5 or 6 times, I gave up trying to get away. He thought I was enjoying it, so in his words, he tried to ""please me"" or some shit. It never worked. I usually just ended up crying. To shut me up, he would stick his dick in my mouth. That was awful.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to tell my mother about it, and she doesn't believe me. I've tried showing her proof, but she just couldn't handle it. I'm way too scared to tell Jaclyn, because I know she'll flip out and claim I'm lying because she thinks her brother wouldn't hurt a fly, and she's one of those people who think men can't get raped.

260,"***Event/Reason***

I had a really close friend of mine. We were class mates and we were hanging out, having some good time.

But there was a problem, he ignored the lessons. He was always getting low marks at each exam and his parents were so strict about this issue.

So, after the school ended and we were still talking until July. He disappeared from our lives, he stopped talking to anyone from our school including me. He made his profile pic and instagram pic black which worried us.

Another close friend of mine which was also close with my disappeared one, told some information about it. His mother told him that when \[the disappeared friend\]'s parents were going to the school for  student registration, our school counselor talked to them and told them that \[the disappeared friend\] should not waste money on this school because he was not working on his lessons and that money would be wasted. I dont know the rest, but its obvious that he got scolded badly.

Later on, one of my friends talked to his cousin and found that \[the disapeared friends\] psychology was fucked up and he tried to hang himself. 

I guess thats why he stopped talking to people from our school, including me. A talk of the school counselor led up to being scolded severly and leading to a trauma?   His attempt of suicide makes sense since he is a very sensitive guy.

Plus he is not in our school this year.

***Attempts*** 

Of course, calling and texting. He doesnt even see our messages. We often see him getting online on WhatsApp, we spam him but he just doesnt even see it. His phone rings but doesnt answer. We are occasionally calling him but no answer. Did he block us? I dont know, maybe... since its hard to ignore all of these texts and calls.

\-

Contacting to his Parents through social media. This one is pretty embrassing and hard to do, but we see this as our only option since this is last thing we will do xD. It didnt work. I guess they dont have social media. But we talked to his aunt, he has been going to school normally these days.

***End***

I know, most of the people will say to leave him alone for his sake, but its just hard to do. We were having a great time and its really sad to see him ghosting from my life. I would love to hear any innovative advices and i will keep this post up to date when we got more information. ",17Nov2018,1

My best friend came out to me yesterday and told me that I am the only person he has ever told, and that he’s not ready to tell anyone else yet.

263,"(See below for the link to the original post). I confronted my wife on her behavior during couples therapy and my confusion over it. She had suggested the therapy for us, but she had been sabotaging/undermining the attempts to reconnect. She would ignore the therapist's advice, become oppositional, finish things late, react negatively to physical touch or suggestions for activities to help us bond, etc. Whenever the subject of her depression comes up, she gets evasive and noncommittal about the cause. She states she wants to believe it's multi-factorial and not due to a specific cause, because in her opinion depression is rarely due to a single incident.

 

Well, she admits she's been engaging in the sabotaging behavior. She can't give a reason as to why, and I told her I was confused about this because she was the one who suggested marital therapy in the first place. I told her that I felt like ever since she had her work problems during the summer, that she's acted resentful. I told her I felt like she has been blaming me and the marriage for her inability to keep up with the demands her coworkers and bosses placed on her. A mindset sort of like, ""If it wasn't because of you and this marriage, I would have had the time to finish everything. If I didn't have to come home to you every night, I could have met everyone's expectations. I wouldn't have had to admit I was unable to do everything.""

 

We are still waiting until after the holidays and our vacation in January to decide whether to divorce. This is largely due to her personal therapist's suggestion, and the suggestion of the marital counselor. They suggested we wait because the holidays are a stressful time, and the vacation might allow for another perspective. Overall though, I'm not feeling very optimistic. I can honestly say I've done everything I could, both for her and for the marriage. I have been concerned about her mental health overall, and I'm not entirely convinced it will improve if we divorce if she is on her own and isolated, but that's not my call anymore. I've done what I could.

 

This is an Update for the following post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/MedSpouse/comments/9wpm2c/im_married_to_a_physician_and_shes_destroying_our/

 

TL;DR : Despite my wife suggesting marital therapy, she has admitted that her behavior has undermined/sabotaged the therapist's advice. I've told her that I feel like she resents me and this marriage for her inability to keep up with her work, like our marriage prevented her from living up to her bosses'/coworkers' expectations. We are waiting after the vacation in January to decide what to do, but I'm not optimistic at all.",17Nov2018,1
265,"Hey, Reddit!  This is probably the strangest and most first-world question on this website, but I’m torn between a long hospital trip and possible death or disappointing and losing my best friend.  Let me explain.

So I’ve always had allergies.  I’m mainly allergic to three things: nickel, hydrocortisone, and cats.  They burn my skin severely and it feels like I’m rotting in a hell fire.  She has a beautiful and huge cat named Princess Peach (who we all call P), but P has a ton of hair.  Also, she’s gravitated towards me.  I love animals and I think I have that aura that some people have where they just all stick and snuggle.

Last time I went to her house, P curled up in my lap, and I tried to pretend like nothing was wrong.  My airway completely closed up and my skin was broken out so bad that I scratched my skin to bleeding.

My best friend, on the other hand, isn’t very understanding.  Her one flaw is that she’s rather immature when she doesn’t get her way.  Keep in mind that I’m a senior and she’s a junior in high school, and we come from a very small, sheltered town.

Anyways, so I never go to her house anymore, but she wants me to spend the night tonight and tomorrow night for her birthday weekend, which is Monday.  Allergy pills don’t work at all around P, and I can’t use creams because I’m allergic to the hydrocortisone in it.

My dog is 14. She's been blind for as long as I can remember. My parents got her when I was really little and she's been in the family for almost my entire life. She went blind at about 5 and we couldn't afford the cataract surgeries, but she wasn't in pain so my parents said they did not want to euthanize her and the vet agreed with them. There wasn't any point in putting her down if she wasn't suffering. She still had a great quality of life. She got used to the layout of our house and honestly it seemed like she could still see. She memorized every little turn and she could still go downstairs to the basement to bark at the furnace if it was too loud. We got another dog so she wouldn't be as lonely during the day while my parents were at work and I was at school. They're still best friends.

Now, almost ten years later. We've all noticed something isn't right with her. She runs into a lot of stuff, even though we haven't moved any furniture or anything at all. She wanders around when she can't find either me or my parents and she paces from the front door to the back door. She barks at nothing and she sleeps a lot. She stares at walls, but that might have to do with her cataracts. Sometimes she pees her bed in her sleep. *That's* what worries me. She is such a good dog. The only time she ever has accidents is when she's sick, and even then, she gets out of bed and goes on the floor so it's easier to clean up. She doesn't go to bark at the furnace anymore. Sometimes she doesn't even recognize us calling her name.

I think she has dementia. I know this sounds dumb but I googled it. What else can I do at this point? My parents think it's just her ""getting old."" They don't want to take her to the vet. I don't want to just sit here and watch her fall apart. I know she's suffering. Everything is dark for her and she's confused.

i was showing my mom the dress and she was trying to adjust the shoulders and she saw the hickey. this has never happened before. up until now, the most she knows is that we’ve kissed (we’ve done much more than just kissed) 
i told her that i ran into a door and she didn’t believe me. i asked her what i needed to do so that she would believe me and so i told her that the most we’ve done is that he squeezed my boob and that i told him i didn’t want to do that so he said okay and that was the end of it. she made me swear on the bible that that was all we’d done. 
i thought i was off the hook but she told me that later today she wants to talk more about it because she doesn’t believe me. i don’t know whether i should tell her that it was a hickey or if i should keep up the lie. i know that i’m not telling her we’ve done other things, there’s no way i could do that. i just don’t know whether to keep up the lie or crack and get in trouble.

College was a very transformative time for me and I recognized the error of my ways in trusting my elder blindly when I was already close enough to graduating that I thought it financially worse to dropout.

281,"For the past year I've felt like my life has just been going downhill continuously.

Superficially speaking, I'm getting the best grades I ever have, have a great social life, in all the teams and extracurriculars and stuff couldn't seem to be better, from an outsider's perspective.

The reality is that I feel like my life is fucked:

* I was addicted to snorting pills and was smoking weed around a year ago now, but recently relapsed into doing pills after an old friend (who I used to do the stuff with) came back into my life
* I have so much work to do, all the time. Remember how I said I'm in everything? Whenever I start thinking about anything I have to do, I always end up having a minor panic attack. I've never told my parents about it because I've already caused them enough pain when they figured out about my addiction last year
* I like a girl, who likes me back and am in a casual relationship of sorts, but never feel like she actually likes me back. Whenever I talk to her, whether in person or on text, I feel like she doesn't want to be there talking to me, no matter how much she tells me that she wants to be with me. I do it so much that I'm scared of making her insecure or ruining her life by dumping all my insecure bullshit on her. 

In summation: 1. I have relapsed into drug use, 2. am always stressed or having panic attacks, 3. Am wildly insecure about anything in my life and 4. can't trust anyone, not even the closest people to me.

282,"O, so I was invited to a party like 2 weeks ago. I really don't want to go because it is far away, and I don't have a ride back till next day. Nor do I like the type of party it will be nor the music. The only reason to go there is to meet my old friends who like that shit. Being a muh privacy type of nerd, I can only be gotten in touch with via sms or phone call, while others just type in a facebook group. 



It is getting late, and the party could technically start anytime in the next 2 hours. No one has called me yet to tell me who will be picking me up, nor has my pickup called me. I am hoping it got cancelled or they forgot about me, but I still wanna show that I made the minimum effort to find out what's up, and that I theoretically intended to go. What should I do? They are all crazy, and there is always a chance that if they get my sms anytime in the early night, that they will go to get me and drag me out there, But I really don't wanna go.

287,"I am in studying in 10th standard right now in a same school since my childhood and I am a really shy boy. A girl entered this school in 2nd standard, she was really cute and beautiful, she immediately caught my attention.

By the 3rd standard I got to know that she was really soft spoken, polite, had a really beautiful smile and very quiet person just like me (I don't have all of those qualities mentioned lol, I am just a quiet person) , I was really interested in her and wanted to know more about her. I got to know that she was really into drawings and art stuff, I always tried to get a seat close to her and try to talk to her but because of my shyness, I had little success. Any day I talked to her would be just like the best day of my life, whenever she went past me it sent my heart racing, I didn't even knew back then what this feeling was. I had very few friends so trying to know about her and talk to her, impress her pretty much became my purpose of going to school, I was good in studies and was very regular to school. By the time 5th standard came, I got a chance to sit with her many times and we talked very less (both were shy) but every moment with her was priceless to me. Then in 6th standard, all children of sections A,B,C and D were reshuffled randomly in different classes, on the first day I went and was very nervous and anxious whether she would end up in my class and she wasn't in my class, I got nearly teary eyed but when teacher took attendance I heard her name and got to know that she was in my class but was absent that day. I was relieved and very happy, I used to sit close to her often now and tried to talk to her by excuse of studies and she always poiltely helped me and I talked to her more often then before, I would often joke around with her and she laughed at them, I went to school trip to wonderland and she was there too (my 2nd trip but her first) it was the best trip of my life just for the two moments, we were on some stepping woods and she slipped and I helped her from falling and then I was stuck in a net with a really heavy bag and she offered help to hold that bag for me. Life was going so well for me, I used to spend half of my day thinking about her.

Then in 7th standard the classes reshuffled again, I went to school on first day and yeah she wasn't there and this time she actually wasn't in my class, I was in A section and she was so far actually on a different floor in section D. It was really heartbreaking and I was helpless, i went home and cried really loud somewhere alone, I was borderline obsessed with her and because of this divide, I rarely saw her for literally a year. For first like 2 months, I used to be very sad but I made 5 great friends in this class and for a brief time, I actually forgot her and became a very notorious big, my studies really hit rock bottom. 
                      
Then in the 8th standard, I was mildly excited to know whether she was in my class or not and  she wasn't as classes didn't reshuffle but I didn't mind this time, I got a liking for a sport Cricket and wanted to be a professional cricketer and that was literally my only aim in life and I was like really passionate for it. But Once in Recess my friend pushed me into her and I really crashed hard, I quickly said sorry and my mouth couldn't even process the words easily. She said ""no worries"" and smiled at me and my heart started racing fast and I got a very similar feeling I used to have for her, as the fate of events we were in the  same activity class that was Art (45 minutes in school everyday), I used to see her regularly now and fell for her again. Got a thousand things in my mind to say to her but again I was shy AF so never got success. 

Then in 9th standard classes reshuffled again and students were asked to choose between computer or physical education as a subject and I selected physical education just like 80% of students and now I was in D section but for first 3 days I was really sad as she didn't come to school ( I was afraid whether she changed the school) but she came on 4th day and I mistook that she was in C section (which was a section reserved for computer students) , so I rushed to principal with my mum to change my section ( I told my mom that there were no friends in D section and all were in C so I was alone). My section got changed, I went to C section and then I realized she was actually in B section and God I was heartbroken. Thankfully her class was next to mine and her best friend was in my class so she regularly visited our class so atleast I got to see her regularly, we would often get into eye contacts but never said a thing to her ever because of my shyness.

The way she walked, the way she talked, the way she dressed, the way she spoke, her nature, her cuteness. Loved everything about her since forever. now i am in 10th standard, I never told any of my friends ever about her but I was playing a game called truth and dare with my friends and 2 girls, one of them who was best friend of my crush (not friends anymore for some reason) and I had to answer the truth about the girl I liked and don't know what happened to me  but I gave it away, her former friend was like shocked to know that. Her friend told me so many things about my crush, what she likes to eat, her hobby and her birthday date which I was confused whether it was 19th or 20th November(It's 19th). So she asked me what I will be gifting to my crush and I said I can't because that would look weird, she isn't in my class and if I even wished her then it would be awkward like how do I knew it's her birthday today and why am I gifting this? 

Her friend advised me to put the gift in her bag in Recess when no one will be in her class and I think it is great idea. I have been saving pocket money for last 20 days to buy a Art kit for her because she loves drawing, I bought it today and plan to write a note with it like ""I am a boy who had a crush on you since always and could never really tell you because of my shyness and still can't so I am just writing this letter to you and unfortunately I am not even in your class. I know that you love drawing so I brought a Art kit set for you, hopefully you like the gift and pursue your hobby and enjoy what you love the most, wishing you all the happiness and a really happy birthday, love you always :) "". Now I am not giving away my name in this but should I give her some means of communication like asking her if she wishes to talk to me or leave a message , she can message and chat with me at my fake I Instagram ID ""Abcdwhatever"" and that I am going to express my feelings to her very soon. 

Should I add that above bit in letter? because I am gathering courage to express my feelings to her very soon anyways because 10th is the last standard in my school and I may never see her again so I will have to act soon before it's too late.

Is gifting her like this overall a good idea and if i do, should I add that last bit into the letter? Please advise, her birthday is on 19th November.

291,"Hey Guys, 

&amp;#x200B;

So I have a 2006 Honda Civic. The car has approx. 150K miles, but aside from this it is in a pretty good condition and maintenance is up to date.  Nevertheless like every old car and like every car with over 150K miles it is going to have a major issue eventually. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because I do not usually use my car (I walk to work) my roommate has offered to 'rent' it. Because we live under the same roof I can put him under my insurance and we can split the cost of the insurance and I think its fair to split the cost of oil changes as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, what do you think is an acceptable price for him to rent the car? (that is fair to both).  On one hand the car is old and probably worth around \~$3,500 dollars. On the other hand, he will be putting around 300 miles per month in the car and will be saving a ton of money. My company has a policy of 75 cents per mile but that includes the cost of gas, which i suspect is the major expense here. I am thinking of renting him the car for 25 cents per mile so around 75 dollars a month. I would be responsible for major repairs (which can be expensive). 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think 25 cents is too little? I like him as a person and a friend but I want to make sure I am getting a fair deal, especially because I would be responsible for major expenses and eventually selling the car at an even lower price. Any advice on what a good price that incorporates all risks and rewards would be nice.

&amp;#x200B;

For info purposes, I am in Texas. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm part of a neighborhood watch group on Facebook. For some background, our small town had a hospital a few years back. It completely closed down and has not reopened since. The way that the building is set up, it's \*really\* tucked into a residential area. That's important for later. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lately, there have been vandals or thieves going into the building or the surrounding area. Their vehicle is loud, so the citizens living nearby know when they're coming and going. The residents say they've called the police when they hear the trespassers vandalizing the property, but the police never get there in time to catch the people who are doing it. 

One of the citizens got fed up and said that he'd go [sit outside with his ""AR"" and would ""hold them there"" until the police could get there](https://imgur.com/a/AbGwRLx) (that's an imgur link). Obviously, in a super residential area, this isn't wise. I've called the city, but they're not answering their phones (probably due to [this scandal](https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/catfishing-and-conspiracy-in-groves/)). The city marshal is not answering his phone either (I've been calling the city and people who could help since Wednesday) and he's not responding on social media.

293,"Sorry for the wall of text, I’m on mobile. Tl;dr at the bottom.

Some context: I have suffered with depression and anxiety for over 10 years, and was just newly diagnosed with bipolar I. It’s hard to function as a human being, but I am putting in the work to better manage everything.

I met my friend (let’s call her Courtney) at the end of 2017 in the same technical college class. Courtney puts on a hard exterior and does not let people in very easily. We became friends after I left college for mental health reasons. She saw I was struggling and alone, and reached out to help me get out of the house and meet some of her friends. She was always complaining about how her friends leave her, or how they’ve done her so wrong in the past.

We were great friends for most of 2018, always hanging out, going out to eat, talking about nothing and everything at the same time. I was feeling great, I had a new friend, felt a little more confident, probably the best I’ve felt in years.

The past few months, she has been working hard to achieve her dream job since she graduated from trade school. I tried to be supportive whenever possible, encouraging her, reassuring her that she’ll be great at whatever she does. She really puts her whole heart into whatever she is passionate about.

Recently, Courtney got her dream job. I was so happy for her, told her endlessly about how I knew she could do it. And to try not to forget me when she was famous! Unfortunately, I believe this has gone to her head. Her progression in her career has been quite rapid. As she moves on and up, I noticed she has less and less time to spend with others. I understood, she is quite busy and enjoying what she does.

However, last week really shocked me. 

I sent her a message to check in, asking if she’s doing ok since we haven’t really had time to talk. Courtney replied cold, and distant. She said she has no time to try hard for others, as she felt nobody was trying as hard for her. I was really hurt by this. I tried my hardest to be supportive and understanding through it all. She has been so nasty to me the past week. Sending one worded, uninterested messages back to anything I ask or bring up. 

We were supposed to get together next week, to catch up and relax. Courtney sent me a message yesterday, very rudely asking if she was still expected to hang out next week. I was very upset when I got that message. I had to collect myself and I responded this morning. I asked if she could help me clarify what has been going on, if there was anything I could do to help. All she responded with was “that’s ridiculous coming from you lol”. I am still very confused what I could have done to warrant a response like that. 

As she becomes more successful, her head seems to get bigger and bigger. We have discussed my mental health issues a lot, she wanted to try to understand better. I was able to get a really cool job, and I felt useful for the first time in a very long time. My life is fairly open-ended right now. I have an idea of what I’d like to do, and how to achieve it. But my mental health always has to come first so my world doesn’t come crumbling down around me. 

I believe Courtney is becoming passive aggressive towards me because I am not at the same stage of life as her, I am progressing much slower because that’s all I can handle right now. Maybe she thinks I’m lazy, or not trying hard enough as her. My version of giving  100% is much different than her 100%. 

I would like to know what I can possibly do to fix this, or just end on good terms. She has helped me get through this year in one piece. I’m grateful she reached out. But I’m feeling so hurt and incapable. How do I not let her words bother me? How do I let go without feeling as though it’s my fault? And most importantly, how do I ask for closure if she is hostile towards every message I send her? I’m still really happy for her, she’s got her dream job and everything. I wish I could tell her.

I was getting uncomfortable, they intentionally started saying them more. My family is not abusive in any way, but they are very conservative and my parents are borderline, if not completely, alt-right. My parents, especially, make offensive comments about other people and don't stop when I ask them to. Sometimes they make unsolicited comments about my body when they know I tend to be insecure.

304,"Howdy,

I am a 17 year old enjoying my last year of high school. I feel like I have missed out on so much in my life. Looking back, I wish there was some way I could have just slapped myself in the face and told myself to go out and have some goddamn fun. I am excessively scared of competing because I have a fear of rejection. For instance, I did not try out for the speech team in my freshman year because I was scared of not making the team. I feel that I have spent my life up to this point waiting on a harbor and now I am watching the sunset from the same pier as I once waited from; but, now, the horizon is peppered with ships I was too reluctant to board. I never really had a permanent group of friends. That being said, I still have a couple of great friends, most of which are my girlfriend's friends. I never joined the band, the choir, or theater despite the fact that I probably would have loved them. I lived my life in high school with this notion that ""oh, I'm definitely going to make the most out of my college life."" Basically I pawned all of my highschool experience onto this college experience which I am now finding out will not be what I have it cracked up to be. I have always been a good student, but in the recent years my academics have become more of an obsession that weighs on me more than anything else. I decided that I wouldn't take so many AP and honors courses this year so that I could focus on having some fun and maybe squeezing a drop of enjoyment out of my high school career while I have the opportunity. Instead, I just ended up hyperfocusing on the classes I did take and I never got around to making time for the ""fun parts."" My life has careened to studying on the weekdays and working on the weekends. 

When I say it like that, it does sound a tad over exaggerated. I have had plenty of good moments in my life, and there are plenty of things I am grateful for: I have an awesome girlfriend and a job which can be pretty fun at times. I have done pretty good in school: I have received good grades, especially in the last two years. 

 I don't know what to say. I entirely blame myself. I will try to say things like ""well, it was always hard for me to get involved because I wouldn't have rides,"" as I live really far from the school I attend; or ""I like studying, this is what I want to do and how I want to spend my time."" That is completely true, I genuinely enjoy studying: I am devoted to studying math and science. I love it and I feel that I could do it for hours on end. The regret comes in when it comes to looking back in my life, I realized how little I have truly done: I have only seen a handful of movies. Odds are, If you named a title, I have not seen it. Regardless of how popular the movie is/was. My family dynamic is very different. I am not going to really get into it, but I feel that I have missed out on a lot in that department as well. It is strange. I have this reputation of being this happy-go-lucky kid with never ending happiness, but below that surface, my emotions are caked in regret.",17Nov2018,1

I tried only eating stuff I like, eating healthy, fast food, supplements, eating stuff with neutral taste. But none of that really helps enough, because I cant eat enough. Ive tried forcing it until I throw up, in order to get used to eating more food, Ive tried slower approaches and Im eating more than I used to. But it is a freaking every day battle nonetheless. Even after a year of eating ""more"" Im still not used to it. Its the same struggle as on day one. I have no idea how to fix this. Its not like I have anorexia or something, I know that I need to gain weight and I want to as well. But after two bites or whatever it feels like my throat just closes. Sometimes I'm still hungry, stomach-wise, but the throat thing still forces me to stop eating.

311,"So a year ago I started worked at this apartment complex. I met this girl, Em, and we became good friends. At the time she had a boyfriend and I’m very against cheating so I never thought about hooking up or anything like (despite the fact she has an AMAZING body). As time went on we became closer and closer. When summer came (I started last December) we would go to the pool the complex has everyday and drink for 2 or 3 weeks straight (she still had a bf). Sometimes he would come, me and him were cool. Eventually they broke up (they had been together for like 4 years or something) and she would start hanging out with me and my friend a lot more because she was still living with her ex, and apparently he was treating her bad. One night small things started to happen and one thing led to another, we hooked up. She started staying the night every night for like 3 months. We had decided probably 2 or 3 times that we need to stop, but we always ended up no stoping. I originally never had feelings, but loved when she would give me attention. We went on dates and stuff to. I treated her like she was my girlfriend but I wasn’t ever “in love” with her. Side note I have been in love before and it was different. Anyways finally Em told me she was starting to fall in love with me and I told her I didn’t feel the same way, but we were still hooking up and being best friends. Eventually she messages this guy she always talked about because of his looks and he responds. Pretty much immediately after they initially started texting she tells me she’s for real calling every thing off. I agreed that that was for the best and told her I was happy for her. Now when we hang out she’s always on her phone and I feel like she doesn’t even care about me anymore. I honestly just miss having her stay the night with me (just for cuddling because the sex was only amazing once in a while). She was my best friend now I feel like she has completely moved on and could drop me and be fine with it. I’m starting to get depressed with the situation and not sure what I should do. I’ve already talked to her about the way I feel now. In a perfect world things would go back to normal, we would focus on each other, hook up, cuddle etc. However, I know that’s not possible.

On the website, we have a “contact us” 1-888 phone number, with a prompt to get transferred to a specific geographical location.  If someone were to dial it, and press 2, they set up ALL of those calls to be forwarded directly to my personal cell phone.  Not to the company phone number; my personal one.

I brought it up that I did not give them permission to do this, and they do not have my permission to use my number in that way...or at all to forward their business. They do not pay for any portion of it.   Their response was to threaten my job.

320,"Hey Reddit,

I’m currently in a predicament. I’ve been staying at a family members house for the past 2 months due to some complications with the house I usually live at, my mums house. 

I’ve grown to like it at this family members house just due to the amount of freedom im given. Obviously I still have a curfew and I can’t just bring strangers around or whatever but I really enjoy the stress free environment I get that I don’t have at home (due to a younger sibling who makes it their soul purpose to frustrate me and the constant nagging from my mum).

I’ve also taken a new job around here. I told my mum that I was planning to apply and she literally screamed at me and told me that I can’t and that i’m not allowed to make any decisions by myself. I know i’m not 18 (i’m 17) but why should I have to wait a few months so that I can get a job?

She’s also demanding that I move back home and I really don’t want to. I have to pick up my sibling from school every day which is really time consuming as I have exams coming up that I need to be revising for.

Also, I’m meant to be going to uni this year but i’d like to take a gap year as 1) I don’t have the predicted grades that I need and 2) I don’t actually have any idea what i’d like to do. So I thought that maybe if I took a year out it would give me time to think. She’s also against that. She said we could discuss it, fair enough, but her discussions are her shouting when I don’t do what she wants.. She said that it’s not my decision wether I go or not and that I have to apply and I will go this year wether I like it or not. I’m worried that if i’m forced to go, I won’t want to be there at all and i’ll probably drop out in the first year and lose interest in education completely.

She insists she just wants the best for me but i feel like i’m being trapped in a box and I really don’t like it. 

Any advice?

321,"tl;dr at bottom, but please read the whole thing before giving advice.

Obligatory ""I'm on mobile, formatting"" pretext.

This is a long one that requires a ton of context, so pay attention.

I am 14 years old, and a freshman at a school I'll refer to as Arts High. I've been studying piano for 8 years and want to pursue it as a professional career. Obviously I need a piano in pretty good condition to be able to succeed at Arts High. Here's where the trouble begins:

We used to have an upright piano that worked well enough. It wasn't perfect, but it was fine. Around half a year ago, my parents had an idea to replace it with a parlor baby grand as a surprise. Now, I could go on and on listing all the reasons this piano is unusable, but the bottom line is I can't use it. My parents have acknowledged that this was a mistake of their part.

Flash forward to today. No progress has been made on the piano. My parents insist that they can fix the piano using YouTube tutorials, etc., but I think it would be a better use of time and resources to either get another piano or buy a digital piano. I do not think that, with the problems the piano has, it is possible to fix the piano using YouTube tutorials- in fact, I think it would require a professional to fix- but my parents are adamant they can do it.

If I wasn't going to Arts High, or considering piano as a profession, this would not be the same problem that it is. However, I need a functioning piano to properly do schoolwork and to succeed as a musician. That's why I just want to get another piano or a keyboard, rather than spend the time to try to fix this lost cause of a piano.

And, something I feel like I should note: a lot of people think that, if I want to get another piano, then I should pay for it myself. Easier said than done; In my area there are no jobs that employ 14 year olds year round OR pay above minimum wage (believe me, I checked). And, I did have a job, but it was seasonal, so I couldn't have gotten all the money I needed from it anyways. I'm offering to pay a portion of the cost of getting a keyboard (I have a little over $300 left in savings), but my parents still want to try to fix the piano themselves.

So, should I help my parents try to fix the piano using online resources, or should I continue to consider getting another piano/digital piano?

323,"To start things off. I’m 18 (M), a high school graduate.

Right now I’m preparing to write entrance exams for med school.

My aim in life up to this point was to become a surgeon, specifically, a neurosurgeon.

But the thing is, I’m not really sure if this is what I want.

You see, I keep telling myself that I want to be a neurosurgeon because of my fascination with the human brain. (And trust me, I really am)

But besides that, I have many doubts. 

Sometimes I feel as if the only reason my mind really wants me to be a neurosurgeon is because neurosurgeons make quite a lot of money, and that if I ever become one, the only reason it would make me happy is if I get to say “I’m a neurosurgeon” and imagine the bewildered look on people’s faces.

But paradoxically enough, I find that nothing else, and I genuinely mean NOTHING else interests me as a job prospect.

You might think that this is enough reason to say that I should just stick to this path.

But there’s more.

The thing is, I have ADHD. I’ve looked for treatment three times in the past and all of these attempts ended up badly.

Now I’ve grown to consider my ADHD as a blessing in disguise.

You see, if I’m interested by something and have no doubts in pursuing it, my mind forgets about anything else and keeps hacking at the thing I want till I get it or till someone forces me to stop.

A good example would be this, I’ve been teaching myself how to play the electric guitar for the past two-ish years and I’m quite good at it. (check my post history for proof)

I’m hyper-focused at things my mind feels like doing and extremely bored by things I have the slightest doubt about.

I feel that my immediate environment has caused me to become suspicious of my ability to study. 

I couldn’t focus very well in class and the fact that my teachers loved to publicly humiliate and berate me for the slightest mistakes didn’t really help it. School was hell for me (and I’m sure most people share my beliefs), I had friends but wasn’t really that welcome in their social group, I was socially anxious and I stammered when I talked (which again, my teachers loved to poke fun at). And I know you were probably expecting this but I was bullied a lot.

But after school, we had about three months to prepare for the year 12 final examination, which I did from home and I managed to score outstanding marks. After this however, I was left severely burnt out and depressed, I didn’t even attend my school graduation party or prom or any such thing.

Right now, as I sit typing this, I’m at home with my parents and my brother (who’s in year 12) who are basically the only people I talk to.

I struggle to study everyday, as I’m constantly reminded about my doubts every time I open my textbooks, and overcome with laziness, all I do is open my phone and browse Reddit.

My mum thinks I’m just lazy, and tries to push me into being my old self (the gifted 5th grader who could finish a book in a matter of hours), but this seems to just leave me more disinterested.

I’ve been in this limbo for about 5 months now and I’m kinda stuck in a rut.

Sorry for making you read so much.

Thank you.

324,"So..this might be kinda long and complicated and there’s a lot of factors that play into my health and anxiety. Sorry if this is at all confusing and honestly my mind is kinda in a fog because of it all. Let me know if I need to clarify myself on anything!

First let me start with the fact that I have anorexia. I’ve had it for 6 years and have been to treatment twice. I just recently turned 21. I’m 5’3 and 84 lbs. I know that’s so low and it honestly freaks me out too. Last year I was in treatment for about 6 months and the beginning of this year I was doing great. I’m in college, and school gives me an immense amount of stress and anxiety, and I think it’s part of the reason why I relapsed this semester. 

My mental health has felt really out of control this semester in general. I started smoking weed daily this year and I definitely think I have developed a dependence which has led to more anxiety. It helped my anxiety at first, and now I feel as if it’s made it worse. I’ve developed intrusive thoughts and have been struggling with some depersonalization/derealization. I haven’t been diagnosed with the disorder, but I have definitely been experiencing symptoms. It’s gotten a little better lately though as I’ve started to process it more.

Let me also mention that I use a Juul as well, and I’m addicted to nicotine. This is new to me too, I didn’t pick it up until about August. I can’t go long without it. I hit it maybe once an hour. 

About a week ago I went to the ER after smoking and having a “panic attack.” My boyfriend took me after my heart randomly started beating out of its chest. I honestly wasn’t anxious before it happened, it was completely random and it made me freak out more. It was literally out of nowhere. When I got there I was really lightheaded and dizzy but kept second guessing myself because I knew I was high and thought maybe I was just paranoid. But I was still freaking out. My entire body was shaking and wouldn’t stop. They gave me an Ativan shot and it brought my heart rate back to normal. They told me I was dehydrated and let me leave a few hours later. They didn’t really do any testing except for an EKG which looked normal.

Looking back now I seriously have no idea what happened. I’ve had a panic attack while high before and it’s never ever been like this. I’ve never had heart palpitations precede other symptoms of a panic attack...it was bizarre. Also it lasted almost 4 hours. I haven’t smoked since and won’t again probably for awhile. I don’t want it to trigger anything like that again.

The day after the attack I woke up with chest pain. It’s been very light (maybe about a 4 out of 10) but it’s still there. I’ve never had chest pain before and every time I feel it I think I panic more. It’s very brief, random, and sometimes I feel it in my lower back too. It feels almost like a pinching in my heart area, sometimes a burning sensation.

I went to the hospital again last night after my blood pressure and heart rate shot up again. It lasted for about 2 hours and this time I obviously wasn’t high because I haven’t smoked since that night. They did all the testing they could (blood labs, urine test for a possible UTI, chest x ray, heart ultrasound, &amp; EKG) and I left after they told me everything looked normal. At this point my heart rate had gone back to normal without any meds this time.

Here’s the thing. I know all the health risks related to my condition. I know. It scares me too. If this was my wake up call to finally recover from my eating disorder for good, then so be it. I am determined to get better and take out all stressors out of my life if it’s what I need to do. But right now I am also focused on finishing out this semester, I only have a couple weeks left, and want to try to hold on for just that long. 

But I’m worried that something is gonna happen to me. I’ve had medical people tell me that I’m fine, that it’s just anxiety related, and I want to believe them but I still woke up this morning with that same chest pain and heart racing. Am I just paranoid? Is it just panic attacks? Ugh. I’ve just never experienced anything like this before.

I have no idea what’s going on with me right now. Not expecting doctorly advice or anything like that but if anyone has any insight on my life or experience with any of these things please help me out, it would mean a lot :)",17Nov2018,1

Last year in October, I had to leave my parents because of their abuse and they left me without a place to stay. Luckily, I had a friend who let me stay with her family. I am an art major, and I paint a lot of people, and naturally, they asked me to do a couple of paintings. I started doing that, and they started shitting on them, I mean, this doesn't look right, this is wrong, the colors are off, I've never been picked apart like that about my art honestly. My friend, now ex-friend, (another story) doesn't even want me to show  a painting of her because of the way I painted her nose, I don't think it looks that bad, this has really hurt me. When I wanted to do another person, I found this photo of the mom when she was in med school, and when I did it, she didn't like it. I did the dogs, they didn't like it. This is really discouraging. They asked me to do another for a person, and honestly, I haven't even gone that far with it because of how much I'm dreading how they are going to talk about my art. I feel like I'm doing the wrong thing, and I should just give up. They have helped me so much, and they deserve more than a few paintings, but their criticisms suck all my will to paint anything. I've done a few things lately, but I don't show my art anymore to people around me, I've posted like one thing on Reddit, but that's how far I'll go. I have this current painting like 40% done, and when I go home for Thanksgiving they'll ask me about it, but honestly, I don't have the willpower. For those past paintings, I've stayed up until like 12 am trying to perfect these paintings to just have them shit on me later on. I know they feel like its just constructive criticism, and they've told me that they are just trying to help me, but I feel like I'm being shitted on. These people have given me everything, how do I tell them that I just don't want to make anything for them, like, ever again?

329,"Hey Reddit, I'm coming to you because my friends and my parents are both very biased in this scenario and I need an outside, impartial perspective.

In my freshman year of college, I lived in a dorm, the dorms are rather cheap for freshmen so it wasn't a problem for my parents to pay my living costs. However, upper-year dorms are prohibitively expensive so my parents gave me two options; get an apartment and have most of my rent covered so long as I can come up with some of the money, or move home and be given my mom's car. I chose to get an apartment and the arrangement has been great. Now, I'm halfway through senior year and a problem has arisen; I need to take an extra year to make up for some missing credits. My parents made it very clear that the arrangement of them paying most of my rent would be a four-year deal, anything beyond that I would have to take up the entirety of the rent. This is an issue because my parents chose an apartment in what they felt was the safest part of town, meaning that the rent is quite high. I'm very grateful for that, of course, it's been good living in this part of town, but I simply cannot afford to pay the full rent here.

I would have happily moved home and taken the car for next year, but as I elected not to originally, my brother got the car instead - which is totally fair. My school is not close to home, but it is close enough that commuting with the car wouldn't have been too much of an issue. If I were to move home and not have a car, I'd have to take a bus to the train station, a train to a bus station, a bus to my school's shuttle pickup, and the shuttle to the school. This would be quite expensive and also would take 2-3 hours, depending on what time I had class. If I had the car it would have been a 40-90 minute commute, again depending on time of day. Finding an apartment would be problematic as the city my school is in is rather expensive rent-wise, and all my friends have apartments and roommates already as far as I'm aware, so finding a new roommate would be a challenge.

Living at home seems the more sensible option financially, but I'm concerned about the effect that commuting for as much as 6 hours a day would have on my studies, so I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with that. 

If anyone thinks that there's a way I could talk to my parents and arrange some sort of deal, advice on that would be appreciated. I was thinking I could take on a greater percentage of the rent, but I also don't know if I'd be able to afford that.

Thanks in advance!",17Nov2018,1

331," Well before I was born my father was in a real struggle when he was a young man (so in his early 20's). He had been suffering from depression (and was estranged from his parents), was in financial troubles (he had been a hard worker and good saver so that really bothered him) and was contemplating suicide. He had a pet cat which he loved but feared that he might have to give it up for adoption.

Then while at the vet (making sure the cat is well cared for even if he has to give it up) my dad is waiting, an older man comes in (with a pet bird that was obviously very well cared for), and chats to my father while they are waiting. He is emotionally in tune and asks my dad what is wrong. My dad although a proud man tells him. The old man tells him something will work out.

My father comes out of the vet and finds his bill has already been paid (i'm not sure vets would allow this these days but this was a long time ago and maybe he gave something to the receptionist). The old man has dissapeared and when my father checks his bag later he finds around $500 that wasn't there before.

My father is overjoyed as it is enough to get him back on his feet and ensure provision for his cat. He has no way of locating the man, just a name (on the receipt) and no details. So he records this in his diary and forgets about it.

Years later we are going through stuff and find the diary. I am curious about the man but wouldn't know when to start. Then out of interest, I am reading something about the Holocaust in Eastern Europe (the atrocities and such) and find reference to a war-criminal who fled the country (and was never caught), one of the assumed names he adopted is the same name he gave my father. He lived it seems a quiet life moving around a lot and then died. The description is similar, even though he was older when he met my father.

The unit he was part of were ultra paramilitary who aided the Nazis and did terrible murders, tortures and all sorts of evil acts. They beat people to-death with shovels and such. They killed men in front of their wives and then killed the wives.

Yet, this person who did all this, cared enough about a young man and his cat, to give him enough to keep him going and also in a way that preserved his pride.

I have thought about contacting the family of the man (if they exist) but at the same time I realise they might want to forget about the whole trauma. I don't want to humanise war-criminals but I think it is important for heritage to maybe donate the diary?

I become frustrated, angry at nothing, and I don't know why. This started 2 years ago and I believe it is linked to Seasonal Affection Disorder (SAD) but I cannot confirm.

334,"I am a part time employee in the hospitality industry, I work as a receptionist. I like my job for the most part. 

2 months ago a new receptionist was hired to pick up some of the slack between our two locations. She worked with us for about a month, then was fired, no one knows why. They did not find anyone to replace her shifts before firing her. 

Now every week I get asked to cover a shift for our owner, who has been picking up the slack since firing the other receptionist. I only have two days off and I work for minimum wage, so suffice to say I am NOT happy coming in on my days off. 

However I feel really guilty because I had to use FMLA a few months ago due to a mental health emergency, and now I feel like I owe it to them for being gone for two weeks. One of the most frustrating parts is that we have been getting applications for new receptionists a lot, yet they haven’t been responded to and are still asking me and others to cover. 

In my opinion, this isn’t my problem. It’s not my problem the receptionist was fired and now we are short staffed. It’s not my problem our owner is overworked because of firing said receptionist w/o coverage. I am very fragile mental health wise and working is one of my major stressors, so I really don’t want to work more than I already do. 

How can I say no without feeling guilty? I already told them I would not increase my hours. I like my managers, I really do... but asking everyone to cover all the time isn’t cool. ",17Nov2018,1
335,"Long story short, some stuff happened and my dad, the person I value the most in my whole life is in jail because of false allegations. We sold our house and gave (almost) all our money to a lawyer who will hopefully get him out. Because of this situation all my family (including my dad) is struggling mentally and have developed some psychological problems (being constantly anxious, not being able to go outside alone, constant fear of betrayal etc. &amp; mom can't communicate with strangers anymore). I'm the only functioning person left, ironic because I had mental issues all my life. Also I'm the closest out of my siblings to a diploma, thus hopefully a stable job. So I have to stay strong, I have to graduate and get a nice paying job. Now I'm looking for some part time jobs near school ('cause I barely have enough money to eat and it's gonna get worse from here) but it's hard because it's the middle of the semester. 

The thing is, I know I shouldn't even be thinking this because it's so very selfish but this is not what I wanted from my life at all. I wanted an academic career. I wanted to go overseas. I wanted really cool internships to fill my CV. Now I don't even have the power in me to search for one, hearing my peers going abroad this summer just hurts. A lot. I know I don't get to choose my future but I can't help but think it's just.. not fair. I don't know if I have the power to fight alone for something I don't even want. I just know that I have to.

He seems more distant than before and tomorrow I am supposed to be travelling with him and spending two days together but in the light of recent events I don't think being with him in the same place together for two days is how I want to spend my time if that's gow he's going to be.

Writing this as so many tears come down my face braking down for the last hour to write just thinking of him I know I have/should call him but I just cant keep myself together I want to talk to him but my brain always says we will talk to him when I have something he can be proud of. This is the main reason I think this emotion comes out I think. its not his fault I think like this I know he would be supportive of anything I do. I think the reason I feel this way is when ever he see a young guy with a good job or owning a bossiness he says look at this guy how well he is doing trying to encourage me I assume. yet I don't even have the balls to call him and talk to him to wish him a happy birthday to let him know how great of a father he was even though he could not be there for some of it because of a messy divorce he did a lot for me still and would always make time for me if I ever asked he would also get me to go outside and enjoy life instead every time he text me to congratulate me or ask how i'm doing I cant respond all I can do is cry uncontrollably and be upset I don't even know how I would be able tell him a simple happy birthday.

Up until April this this, I was in contact with a group based in the USA (two guys, to be specific) who would accept donations to make commissioned niche video content. What happened earlier in the year, was my debit AND credit card details were used fraudulently and, while I did my best to ensure that the payment I made to them via Paypal reached, them, ultimately my bank still classified their payment as fraudulent activity, and Paypal suspended their account as well as my pending payment.

Understandably, they got pissed and threatened me with a lawsuit (I'm based in the UK, for reference). I was able to settle everything without it progressing further, and in the end they got the money that was meant for them. However, since this incident, they have been banned from using Paypal for their business. They've since moved on to accepting other online transaction methods, and I have since moved on from them.

However, last week I started receiving emails from them. They seem to be tracking my online activity by posting direct quotes and links to things I've been commenting on. I've asked them if they're still holding a grudge and whether they are able to somehow move on, and they say that they've forgiven me as the events weren't directly my fault nor were they intentional. However, they are still sending me these emails and I'm getting worried that they may move on to blackmailing me. They seem to know who I am, where I live and work, what social media and forums I use, who my friends and family are...but because they're on the other side of the world and I know nothing about them, what are my options? I feel that they simply won't agree to leave me alone.",17Nov2018,1

Ive had a girlfriend for the last 4yrs we were doing great as a couple, not perfect in any sense but we would have the normal relationship arguements and always worked it through regardless. I do very well for someone my age head on straight, good job, achievement driven and competitive in my hobbies, i get wrapped up into them sometimes. There was about a month where i was fixing up one of my race cars i would work 8am-5-6pm come home and shed be here but we barely communicated because I was moving from task to task in those weeks this was crucial to my hobby that finish out strong this season. She started a new job and then met a nice kid at orientation and since i was busy i was completely not noticing the signs she got his number and 3days later he convinced her to come over, needless to say she did come over to his place ""they talk cuddle watch Netflix"" then stays the night meanwhile im focused on achieving things i completely over look the fact she was texting this kid the last 3days and she says she wasnt coming over because shes stayin at her own house since ive been busy and she had family things to deal with. Fast forward 2weeks im all caught up with my goal i was chasing so now i have time and we were getting better and then she starts to stop visiting this guy (at this point i have no clue she slept at his place for about 5days and had sex twice she claims) she continued to communicate but doesnt engage in visiting him anymore because i was back to being about her and giving her the affection she wanted all along. About 2 weeks goes by i wake up were going out for a morning date mall run etc, shes freshing up and i see her phone on the bed but this time its lit up and i see a goodmorning text from a boy ""TravHeartEmoji"" i then become annoyed but shes an attractive female guys try to text her all the time ie social media etc,

this one got to me though because it was a actual text message which means they have each others number this is a red flag. Later on shes away from her phone in another room i touch her phone click and swipe briefly to see the extent and to my disappointment i see a flood of previous messages i only noticed the amount i didnt read deeper, she seen me touch her phone from the other room and comes in and from this time on she no longer leaves her phone unattended she becomes guilty and we both felt the vibe i was upset but not ready to except it to be something awful later on im thinking this through so much i have to confront her, we talk i notice the defense is up against me and she's not being honest and her story is shakey claims they never hung out, only friend from work. This point i express to her im no fool and the argument gets heated on both ends me feeling decieved and her becoming angry at her self and i tell her to call him and tell him this communication between these two is over. as shes telling this information to this guy he's seeming much more confused then someone who was only friends thats when i know this is bad i take the phone and she screams in insecurity knowing what my question were going to be ""How long"" ""What really happened"" ""what is this between you guys"" as shes making it impossible for him to talk i hang up in a rage and ask for the truth and at this point my pain in my heart and anger are at about 90% she knows shes caught she tells me *crying in tears and fear of losing everything* they had sex it was twice she met him at her job as management at homedepot.... as im getting details shes being as honest as possible because she wants what we still have and believes the truth is the only thing that will set her free, things that stuck out

""i stayed the night about 5 times within about a 15day period of knowing him"" 

""We had sex twice thats it"" (Same thing the kid told me on the phone)

""I didnt do oral is was just vaginal intercourse""(no condom,classy right.)

""I felt like he cared because we talked thats all i orginally wanted was to talk""

"" i did it because i felt like you outshine me in so many aspects of life, like i didnt deserve you because I cant keep up"" (i tell her she could be a damn retail store employee all her life as long as we loved each other id take care of us)

After the talk i send her out my home and sit and think for hours alone and vent to a friend ofc they say move on but im hurt but still feel love but confused emotions.
its late but i call her i need more answers, we take a car out and talk near the water and the whole time we are hurt deeply shes feeling disappointed in her disgusting actions
me feeling disappointed in her ,betrayed and ridden of loyalty i felt towards her.

About 2weeks Since I found out all shes done is do anything to make us work, submissive, willing and dealing with anything i throw at her emotionally. Shes trying to fix her wrongs because she knows what she did is terrible and believes no one is worth throwing away what we had and knows how she was dumb, immature, irresponsible expresses how it will never happen again, she says she did it because i was busy not acknowledging her and she was upset i wouldnt marry her and start a family any time soon (were 21yrs old wtf) . 

My question what should i do? What would you do ? i feel like a fool for letting her back in but at the same time i love her and she loves me. we are torn this had happened and swears this is a one time life time mistake type thing.

344,"Hello reddit, 

&amp;#x200B;

So currently I have a very busy life. I work 3 jobs ""job A"" a manager at an autoparts store, ""job B"" an CNA, and ""job C"" military duties. Im also in school full time which ties in with the future of ""job B"".

&amp;#x200B;

So about 6 weeks ago I got a raise at job A, it was .50 cents. Now im making 10.75 there, I felt like a .50 cent raise for the work I do was insulting so ever since then it has been the lowest on my list of priorities. Job B just started and starting out im making 14 or 16/h on the weekends. Its doing more to pay the bills plus lines up with what I want to do in the future. Ive called off work or switched shifts at job A to make sure im at job B because its more important to me.  Job C is the military, on my free time I am an honor guard and preform graveside services. 

&amp;#x200B;

So tonight I have a service at job C. I have to be there at 730. Job A however wants me to work 4-9. I told them I can only work 4 to 7. They told me if I cannot find coverage I will be fired. On one hand I dont care, I dont care about the job in the slightest, but I also dont want to get fire. I told my manager I wanted to put in my two weeks, they told me I could also put in a leave of absence in case I want to keep working there once school is over. I said I would do that and to put me in the system for the leave. Theyre still putting me on the schedule for next week and tonight should be my last night. Id rather resign but I dont think they will give me that option. I also feel like they cannot fire me for this since its a federal duty but im sure they could come up with something.

348,"Hey.

So I'm a pretty athletic dude, with tons of fake confidence. I am outgoing and can talk to any girl, I am brave and can kiss and can do anything with anyone. I'm attractive and have got a few girls after me... However, when it's about to move on to the next step - I start getting severely nervous. Extremely nervous. It's uncanny. I start to overthink, and then I say to myself ""okay you've read about this, just focus on the girl"", which makes it worse. Last time I was fingering a girl for over 15 minutes before she said ""fuck me already"" and I had half an erection so I did, for like 20 seconds before getting nervous, ejaculating and losing it completely. It wrecked my confidence and the girl was super nice about it, but Jesus nightmares about it. And plus, how can I wear a condom in these situations? This girl, thankfully I've known her for a long time and I know she's clean - but what if it was a stranger? A one night stand? I'm at risk of course, if I can't get or hold an erection for long enough to even put a condom on...

With my ex girlfriend it was fine, we had been dating for months so it was pretty routine, we did tons of imaginable positions and I had a pretty healthy and active sex life. I was able to hold an erection and have sex for long periods of time, sometimes 20 or 30 minutes, it was really fine.

I need advice on what to do in order to not get nervous. I don't like getting drunk, so that isn't an option, and I seriously can't  control my brain. I wish I could. My mind is crazy, it goes on overdrive and ruins my nights...

It's absolutely unbelievable how this happens. And, I have an erection for a good time whilst we are kissing and making out, I mean I'm 18, you brush your arm on me and I'll be up and going, but just as we are about to move on to the next bit I really start overthinking. I do a lot of mental preparation such as ""okay man you're going to do it really good this time it's going to be amazing nothing can stop you"", you know, motivation that keeps me off the negative mindset, just focusing on the beauty of the girl and all, but it really doesn't work.

It's terrible. Angustiating to say the least. I just want a normal sex life at 18. For these reasons I've only been with 2 girls in my life. I've thought about taking viagra just until I'm ready and confident enough with doing it with a new/random hookup. I want to be able to have nice, comfortable and safe sex with girls that I meet - especially at uni, girls from clubs, whatever... For that I need to get and hold an erection though, for a bit longer than 30 seconds.

A bit background - I've never been confident, I suffered tons of bullying for being fat. I hit the gym for 2 years and now I'm strong, have a lean and muscular physique... So yeah I'm more confident, or play confident but deep down have still pretty fucked problems and mind due to the bullying I suffered. Might be a reason... right now I just need help.

Been writing lyrics when I was 14, just learnt guitar a year ago and I’ve progressed a lot as I play both electric and acoustic, play all kinds of music from metal to pop folk, to rock. 


I do have a fear, that I will be cyberbullied again for doing music because it’s ME and not anything else. I’m a little upset most of the people I know doubt me and aren’t very supportive. 

I know next year, I have a lot of stuff to do.

352,"This is probably the stupidest thing I've ever written, but I've been thinking about it for a while. I'm not technically sure this is the right place either but uh. Oh well. Ok anyway! 

So most of my encouragement comes from friends and various other people, which is where I mostly get my motivation.

Since I was about 9, I would always watch Saturday Night Live, and stand up comedians and stuff like that. Then Vines, and more stupid things. My mom was one of the first people to bring the idea into my head, she always says I'm so funny and I would do great on SNL, since I impersonate people and stuff like that. I kinda just chalked that up to her just being my mom and of course she thinks I'm her funny daughter cracking jokes. 

But recently, I'm 18 now, I've been getting comments from friends, my teachers, other adults I talk to say things like ""you need to do stand up, you're hilarious"". One time my friend and I were sitting outside a coffee shop just saying the stupid things we usually do to each other, and the guy at the table next to us told me I should try comedy sketches. Then he compared me to Amy Schumer, which then made me never want to speak again, but whatever.

So where would I even start with doing stand up comedy? Most of my jokes are just making fun of what people say, and I don't think the type of things I say are good for stand up? I don't know. I don't have any sort of experience of acting besides like a 5th grade school play. 

Or where would I even start with comedy in general? How do people make it to Saturday Night Live? What would one do? 

I'm genuinely curious.

They were really upset and he was saying something about a guy that came out of my house and stole his car. Which could not be true I was asleep with my door open and my dog on my bed. I would've knock if someone had been in my house. 

Anyways they finally leave and the dude tells me to get dressed because the cops were going to come over or something. Cops never showed up.

They have been sitting at my neighbors house, which is across the street, coming out periodically to smoke cigarettes. 

Its Thanksgiving break for students right now, and I am a student. I think they were checking to see if anyone was home before trying to rob me. I of course realized this after and am now considering calling the police. 

I'm worried about calling the police now, it's been like 4 hours since they knocked on my door. And I dont want to piss them off, especially if they weren't planning on trying anything.

354,"Hi all, 

Among my childhood friends there is one guy, Lars, that has a history of treating girls in a bad way. Being a bit too close, hard to take no for an answer. I have talked to him about this. Not very socially competent. However, in a group he is a fun guy and contributes to the atmosphere.

As christmas is closing in, I invited all of the childhood friends to a get-together, and also my girlfriend. However, she was very upset why I invited Lars, as I now apparently have decided between him and her.

I'm normally considered the guy that brings everyone together (planning wise, and contact person), so excluding him from an invitation ultimately leads to me receiving a phone call, declining him, a friend of 20 years, not to come to the party with all the other childhood friends.

My girlfriend would like me to cut this friend off, due to how he treats women. I see her point, but I am not too keen on making a large statement to an old friend I meet once every year/2-years.

I know how this sounds, but I do not see it as my responsibility to do this the one day per year I meet with all the old friends, and ruin my evening so that my girlfriend can feel that she has made a point regarding a person she has never met in her life. I have a very demanding job, and live by my own without friends in a foreign country - there is not room for additional stress.

I don't want to split the people in to different evenings, and if everyone is invited - my girlfriend will make her own statement by not showing up.

I feel that we're making mountains out of molehills.

I either answer, or always call back, since they seem important. I explain he’s got the wrong number, tell him my name, and hope that his friend is ok and he finds who he’s looking for, we sometimes chat for a bit.

However, today he sounded pretty confused, almost frail, and said something along the lines of “I don’t know what’s going on//what to do anymore.”

359,"A few years ago I lost my best friend and went down a pretty shitty road. Really screwed my life up and ended up in rehab. I didn't do that well in my first year of university (mostly B's and C's), but after my friend died I got straight D's in second year and straight F's in third year before dropping out. I've since got clean, turned my life around, and moved to the US. Last year I enrolled in my local community college to pursue engineering, and I've maintained a 4.0 so far, with 42 credits complete. When I enrolled they said they didn't need to see my prior university transcript, so I assumed I could use this as a fresh start. I was planning to transfer to my state university next fall, but they require a 2.5 GPA for entry. When I applied they required my transcript from the foreign university, and they've decided to consider it as 90 credits at a 1.0 GPA equivalent, which combined with my 4.0 from the community college doesn't even bring me close to 2.5. I have no idea what to do here. It seems ridiculous that I'm being denied entry even after showing how much I've improved. The adviser I spoke to said my best bet would be to continue taking classes at the CC until my GPA has been raised enough, but I pretty much need an entire degree worth of credits to do that...

Anyone have advice on this? I'm at a total loss here. And even if I manage to raise my GPA to the cutoff mark, I pretty much can't get it above a 3.0 no matter what which rules out internships and most jobs... ",17Nov2018,1

365,"June 6, 2018: Window company comes out to my house to install basement windows and a sliding glass door in my kitchen. Basement windows went smoothly. While taking out my current kitchen door, they break three tiles. Crew leaves to find matching tiles while the door is still out. They’re gone for 4+ hours. My house gets up to 100 degrees. Finally come back and tell me they can’t find matching tiles. Replace with tiles that do not match. Take another 3 hours to put in the sliding glass door. One of the dudes gets a ride home with his girlfriend because it’s taking so long. They keep fucking up measurements. Paint is all fucked up around the door. Do not leave my house until 10:30pm. I’m pissed and refuse to sign the contract that basically states I’ll pay the remainder of my balance. I’m thinking it’s going to take $2,000+ to retile my kitchen so...I shouldn’t have to pay that. 

Throughout the month of June and July I try getting a hold of some kind of supervisor. I’ve told the story to at least 3 people at the company over the phone. Still don’t hear anything about my balance. 

August 9, 2018: Finally get a voicemail from a supervisor at the company. Call back and leave a voicemail. Don’t hear back.  

September 6th: Same dude calls me and leaves me a voicemail stating he is going to send me to collections if I don’t pay the remaining balance. I finally get a hold of him and tell him to come look at the job. This is the first time he’s heard the whole story and seems apologetic. Asks how much I want off our balance and I just throw out $800. If they can find matching tiles. Supervisor just wants the job done right and me to be happy. 

October 3, 2018: Window company calls and says they found matching tiles. I ask if they want to come out and check that it matches before they come out with the crew/equipment. They say no. They come out the upcoming Saturday (later than they said they’d be there). Tiles don’t match. Shocker. They take out the old tiles and say they’ll be back with matching ones another day. They’d give me a call when they found them. Meanwhile, holes in my floor.

October 24, 2018: Call me and tell me they found matching tiles all the way from FLORIDA! Still don’t want to come and check before bringing the crew. Come out on a Wednesday evening. Guess what? Tiles don’t match! All of a sudden it dawns on me...There’s some tiles under the refrigerator they can use. Put the ones that don’t match under there. At this point I’m so fed up with seeing this people and dealing with them I’m like Yeah sure move my fridge and replace the tiles if you want but...I’m not paying you guys ANYTHING. They called their supervisor and he apparently gave them the go ahead. Took fucking forever again. They duct taped a tarp from our ceiling while working, and I notice after they left, the duct tape ripped paint off my ceiling! I’m kind of like oh well...I did tell them I wasn’t paying shit so I guess I deserve that? 

November 14, 2018: Supervisor calls me, leaves a voicemail and tells me that I still owe the remaining balance. 

Am I just being stubborn here? Should I just fucking pay them? It’s taken 5 months to “fix” this problem. And they never even were able to get the correct tile? They fixed the problem by doing something they could’ve done back in June, but I’ve had to deal with their shit for this long I just don’t think I owe them anything. HELP! ",17Nov2018,1
366,"Hi everyone!

I am a single father of one boy, aged 8.

My son has been interested in scouting and we have two neighbors on our block who are involved.

One of the neighboring children is a girl who is in the boyscounts (recently joined as of a few months ago as a result of their changes.

The other is a girl who is involved in the Girl Scouts.

He frequently plays with both girls at our neighborhood playground and has had the opportunity to interact with both of them and asked questions about their scouting experiences.

For some reason my son seems to be attracted more to the Girl Scouts based on how his friend has explained to him the types of activities they do. He doesn’t seem at all interested in the Boy Scouts though.

There’s just one problem - the Girl Scouts don’t accept boys (at least not that I know of).

Additionally, I am concerned as a single father who would been likely seen as “coaching” my son into wanting to be a Girl Scout that I would be labeled as some kind of sexual predator.

My son for months now has incessantly pleaded with me to sign him up for the Girl Scouts but I don’t know what to tell him other than what I’ve told him previously, which is that he can’t because he is a boy.

To make matters worse and confusing for his little boys mind is that one of his girl friends is in the Boy Scouts.

Whenever I tell him that the Girl Scouts is for girls only. He also responds “then how come Amy is a Bot Scout?”

This week I didn't expect to hear back on that deal and he asked if he could do the same just so I can play with him. (I play the same game on PC and had no plans on buying it on console.) Honestly, I wouldn't mind playing with him and said sure. I would honor our old deal and pay half the money back to him. I reminded him that he would have to get me a new copy of the game and I'll pay him back half when I can.

The next day, he gives me the game and the receipt.

hey everyone! so i have a neighbor (lets call him jack) who i have known since i was about 12. Jack is a few years older than me but has a younger sister and i would occasionally go over to their house to play with her when i was younger.  her and i ended growing apart (i got older, she got older), so we dont speak anymore. one thing that ive always noticed is how jack constantly would stare, and occasionally smirk/smile? to himself whenever we would see each other on the street. hes spoken to my friend and i once, and his friend waved at me one time and did ask him loudly ""oh i thought you knew her"" as well. i never really thought much about it before, but he started to stare more and more which made me think about him. my friend would also say how much he would stare at both her and i whenever she was over. now he does it occasionally, but for some reason, i cant stop thinking about him. i feel so lame cos im 21 and ive developed such a middle school crush on a guy that doesnt talk to me and occasionally stares at me now. now i have 2 questions 2 ask:

&amp;#x200B;

1. What could be the possible reasons for him starring at me but not saying anything? the last time this happened was this summer cos i havent seen him since.
2. what can i do to stop thinking about him? we havent spoken in years, however, i still think about him time to time and was wondering what i can do to stop it?

TL;DR; crush on guy, he always stares but doesnt talk, why does he stare, how to get over him

377," Help with concept of life and life itself... ! 
I think Im really broken. 

These thoughts are private; I mean Im not brave enough to share them with others I know yet !!:,,,,,,,(

Like, overthinking: 
   What does brave even mean; Like why amnt I brave enough to share it; Just share it, Okay Ill try-- And then I can't most of the time and then // Repeats:  why amnt I brave enough 
    How do I do this math problem another way that makes more sense to me? Uhh... Try thinking of it in pictures. Ahghhhahgg too hard I can't. And Im not even getting the first was. And because Im spending time on this Im falling behind on other things and the class is moving forward and Im still thinking about that one problem and Im failing math class and I can't even focus on what's important; 
(just focus on now; write that down later. And then, Ill try, but then the what ifs!) 

Like the what ifs: 
like, what if this isn't the best way to solve this issue of falling behind in math class? What if this itself is overthinking? What if everything Im thinking is wrong? What if I can't do anything? It feels like it!! What if I can't what if I can't? 
(But just focus on the cans Alex, like what you can do, because maybe you can't, but maybe you can! Just focus not on the thought of impossibility but on trying because it *is* possible. But then what ifs again)
What if this isn't the best way to solve this? There are smart people who don't even have to think about this issue, they just don't think about this stuff! 
(Try not to then! Somehow though it comes back))

Like that immobilized state
  I want to talk to that guy -- but other people but what about what he'll think but what about me. Just do it. Aaaagggaggagagagaaaagaga I can't 
Even for like getting up
   I should Get off the floor, Stop being sad and go brush my teeth; but but but but what if this isn't the best way to clean my teeth? Isn't there some sort of whitening strip that would work better? 

Like financial issues that I can't control really  because Im 15 only and don't have a job;      
     Like I want to buy whitening strips for my yellow teeth; But we're in a bad financial state to buy these strips. But some people don't have to worry about that. But I do ... So just get the strips?! Idk!! But I do! I do know a little... ! It feels like it doesn't even matter whether I get the strips or not! Just do it for somethings small like this!! But then it'll build up and my mom and dad and family will be hurt! But then I want to buy them for my mad teeth because Ive been so immobile by (depression) sadness that I haven't been able to brush even...! So buy it or not?? I can't decide! 
(So flip a coin; I really hope this is helpful and helps solve this at least a little.) But then if I choose to buy it then Ill worry about having been a burden financially and if I choose not to Ill keep worrying about my teeth!! So what do I do!? How can I compromise? How can I just stop worrying???? How can I make these financial decisions less black and white and easier? Can I just buy it and say it makes sense to buy it, it's worth it? I think so... I hope so.. 

Like so so so much doubt 
   Like I feel like this writing down is helpfulO; but this hurting and stuff (depression but I can't say that l) have been going on for years and has been so so bad this past two years--- I tried writing this down before and it evidently didn't work cause Im back here. And for two years !! 
     Like maybe I should just stop writing this down because it won't be helpful. And Ive probably thought about this before. 
    MAYBE I SHOULD JUST STOP THINKING AT ALL to be happy. 
    And I don't know idk Idk idk ! And that's just an excuse and maybe Im exaggerating by it feels like I don't know I don't know!! So much doubt! So so so so so so much doubt. 
And I probably do know a little bit... And Ibe told myself before but here it is again: even though I don't know everything or I don't know those little pieces that Im worried about (like my career or my ultimate interests) I do know what I know, and I only know what I know. But focusing on that ""I don't know"" is like giving up; not trying bc I do!     

Like worrying worrying worrying about my security: 
What do I do? How do I become like one of those kids my age with the money and career problems figured out bc of fame (like teen k idols, danilla bregolli, ...)? How do I figure out? What do I do in life? 
How can I just be famous and have money and have a career already? How can I just solve this issue of career and money!? How do just become like that? Idk Idk .


My stream of thoughts: 
And I know I'll regret it if I don't go and see this school play but Im in a horrible shape emotionally and academically and mentally and physically I can't go!! But just go!! But I need to take a shower cuz I haven't and change clothes and all that!! 
And then the thought of career and all that comes back!! What do I do for career? Idk idk idk! But I do know something andI shouldn't focus on what I dont know if really care about this problem bc focusing on What I don't know is like giving up and I Care so I should focus on all that I do know!! Like I have an inkling of thought that I should stop worrying so much; that I should try out for the cultural show to start that dance/ k idols thing. But then doubt like like oh I won't be able to because for the past two months Ive been so so so so immobilized by my overwhelming thoughts and obligations that I couldn't even get up from the floor or leave for school until I was pushed for an hour or so by my dad! How can I expect to be able to be in the moment??!!!  I'm so doubtful so so so so doubtful!!!! I don't believe in myself!!! Oh and then a million other thoughts when this one isn't even resolved like to name a few: my awkward relationship with this guy at my school who blocked me online-- oh! I know just continue and try to say hi or talk to him somehow by being brave and about the awkward topic of having been blocked, keep it your guys' secret? I don't know it's like living with hate--- and oh! Please don't hurt yourself, (my pseudonym AX), becauseI don't want to hurt! And then momento Mori. 

I keep thinking about momento Mori (remember Death in Latin) : like 
""What if I die right now-- imagine it AX.  What if your sister or brother or Mom or Dad die? That's a really real thought! But I think Im pushing it too too much! Like what if this guy in the subway that I like dies right now or what if Trump dies? Like momento Mori momentomori momentomori momentomori!!!! I'm pushing it too much i want to just stop pushing it so much and focus on the now? 





And then Ive lost willpower Ive fought in my mind And I don't feel like fighting anymore, I've taken a marshmallow in the marshmallow experiment of how long kids can last looking at a marshmallow and how that'll affect their success... 
 
And then a million thoughts come back like .oh oh oh oh I yelled at dad, I have a bad relationship, but don't hurt yourself, AX, just don't because don't, because you, cos love cos you cos soul cos it's better-- just don't! Next time don't tell, try to embrace that past and do better next time? 
But why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why just why???? Why should I? I don't get it

I don't get it -- to say that is almost to focus on the unimportant- and to give up, well, bc u know all that u do. 


Then Im like-- stop thinking stop thinking just do, because Just Do It, that is what changes things-- doing. 

But then Thoughts Thoughts Thoughts Thoughts Thoughts Thoughts 

Like, 
What if thinking gave me a better method? Isn't thinking doing? I don't know. I don't know I don't know whether to think or do Im stuck in this horrible abstract stuff that I hate but am obsessed with strangely. 


Fuck it's 3:40 I spent a whole of (shit ass ) time an hour or so 40 min maybe on my (fucking) instagram like running away running away and fucking escaping and I don't even know what to do 


And how are Other  people so smart and I think that Im wasting my time oh my fucking god I usually don't even have the fucking courage to curse aloud let alone say what I'm truly thinking because it can be so isolating and I might be judged and everything And Im failing in school and can't pick myself back up and might stay a semester if I don't get some help and it feels like Im not gonna go into college t this right and instead be homeless and stuff or be a burden on my family and Id rather be a homeless but that might not let me and then momento Mori they might die and maybe I should just break this down one by one and maybe not mayb maybe maybe maybe why not ? Because because -- don't hurt yourself AX 

Oh. Oh oh oh oh ohoh oh oh oh oh oh ohoh oh oh oh hyperventilating no common sense no more logic so much anxiety all of asudden and now I'm tired even though I had so much sleep and Im broken I swear Im broken 

And don't think that don't think that don't think that don't think that don't think that don't think that don't think that 

And maybe this is all just stupid first world problems and school and everything and before I had extracurricular science thing and music thing and i dropped all that because those were too stressful maybe because Ive become so so so so so overthinking overwhelmingly anxious and so dysfunctional--- HELP HELP !! 
Idk idk idk but I do and a million problems -- keep writing!? But I don't knowthatll never solve it I have a million more thoughts and instead of writing think? I can't I've thought for what feels like a million months. And Talk to others? Why why why why why why how how how!

378,"***Buckle up cus this is a long story but please i actually need advice***

Ok so about roughly 9 years ago when i first started elementary school i was very social and i made many friends, one of them being dave, we'll just call him that, and through the years we were both friends and we made new friends and we were always together, 9 years have passed, we're still friends but one day we were at a friends house and we were playing with those pool noodles and he hit me on my ear so hard it started ringing and it didn't stop until the next morning, anyways, when he hit me, i felt like the noodle wasn't the only thing i felt being hit with, it was also realization. He was very clumsy, lazy, fat, careless, and was always a bad influence when it comes to weight watching. Not to mention, i never liked to go out to public places with him because he would just embarrass me, if you just saw me with him you would think very low of me when i actually come from a very high and prestigious family and we're well known so if someone saw me with him, they would start thinking very low of me. Which takes me to the other problem, his family is, in the most respectable manner, slightly poor. So whenever we'd go out and i wouldn't have a chauffer, he'd pick me up in a broke down old car with a driver who smells so bad and i would come out of the car like i was some peasant who didn't fit in. Please understand that just because he has a driver, it doesn't mean he's rich, he has a normal indian man who came as a domestic worker and is being paid 300$ a month. He would also act so poor, always asking us to pay the rest of the bill because he didn't have enough money and knowingly ordered food out of his budget which not to mention is very very rude, he also acts so immature and would always speak in a more louder tone in public places. He's also hypocritical, he would make fun of you and when you comeback he would get sensitive and literally start crying sometimes. He also likes to start conflicts and then acts like he's so innocent while he's been caught several times before. **PLEASE DONT TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY, I DONT HATE POOR PEOPLE AND IM NOT THROWING ANY SHADE TOWARDS THEM, MY FAMILY IS VERY HUMBLE AND WE TURN OUR HEAD DOWN ON FAMILY MEMBERS WHO BRAG ABOUT MONEY, BUT WE LIKE TO KEEP OUR REPUTATION ALIVE AND KEEP IT THE SAME, ITS NOT THAT WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO GO OUT WITH THEM ITS JUST AS LONG AS YOU DONT DAMAGE THAT REPUTATION.** Moving on to the next point, we were a group of friends and we always hung out and then he started hanging out with other people, which is fine, so everyone did the same and then he had a falling out with that group of people and when he saw that some of us had similar people in similar groups he got sad and angry and started crying, for example, me and mark have two separate groups of friends, 2 people in my group are in the same group as mark, so from time to time, me and mark would see each other and post on our stories, but then he saw it and was sad and mad that we didn't ask him to join us like what???!! anyways after that we formed a new group and he was a part of it and so, one day, that similar friend asks me and mark to go out and being the good friends we are, we join him, then he coincidentally sees us and ignores and keeps moving on, until a few days later when we meet up he would ask me in private why me and mark would go out without him, this is an example of him trying to cause drama because i know damn well he told other people in our group.

We've been there for each other through our relationships, went to prom together, we'll watch movies and play games, often we'd go to a bigger town and do stuff, and the friend is still going strong!  Last week he asked me if we can be friends with benefits. Now he's a virgin and I'm not, I know I'm not the only one in his life he has offered this proposition but the difference is that we had a close friendship versus the others who were mere acquaintances. Wanting to try something new, I decided to talk about it with him. My last relationship was emotionally abusive and I felt pressured to do acts. It was all consensual of course, but my ex gave me trauma and in my younger years I was molested. After expressing my concerns to my friend he completely understood and was totally okay with taking things slow with me. I have high anxiety so my major concern was that I'd get anxious even though I should be okay and he knows how I function, again, he asked what I was okay and not okay with, and I'f ask the same and he'd express what he was okay with and not. We agreed to keep it only between us and bot to date because of our friend group. (One other friend who I convinced maybe to have a threesome with someday if our friend accepted the offer). It was a very effective conversation.  On tuesday we hung out for a bit, it was fun. On the way back to my house around nine, I mentioned I was craving a chicken sandwich so we got Mcdonalds and parked at a local pier. We tried the ""Lady and the Tramp"" kiss with a french fry... It was awkward but still hilarious. Next day, we hung out for a few hours, I offered to cuddle and so we did and his personality I swear changed. He had a softer voice, he kept asking if I was comfortable, at one point he tried taking a picture of me cuddling him and so I flipped off the camera, being the little prick I am, and he decided to save it because I was cute. Later he tried making out with me but I got really anxious and so he backed off and apologized. We still cuddled until he brought me home. Next day, I felt like I had him around my finger, he works at the diner in our school, he gave me a slice of cheesecake and I asked for a cup of ice and sure enough I'd get it. I bought him a chocolate bar because I felt like I owed him even though I didn't. It was a good day, until my ex called me. Apparently I've been excusing him of acts not named in this thread and his girlfriend's friend has been telling everyone. He asked all the person stuff like if I regretted our relationship, and I told him no... I really did.. He told me his gf was now suicidal because of this, and I know this friend hates my ex, he doesn't have a good name around here but for concern of the girl I messaged the girl who has been apparently spreading stuff, and I became emotionally distraught. I asked my friend if I could vent to him, he gave me the okay so I told him the situation. He knows I'm telling the truth and he took the time to try calming me down. His grandmother died Tuesday so he was leaving town for the weekend starting Friday morning. He offered to pick me up so we can run a quick errand with him and I agreed. After picking up a few things he told me they were celebrating his dad's birthday early because they cancelled dinner plans for the funeral. I accepted the invite. We cuddled upstairs some for for a bit before going down to have ice cream cake. Oh and my friend's mom referred to her husband as daddy so I immediately shut up and his dad called me out. This man is a pastor, you bet my friend loved that. Anyway, after eating cake and spending time with the family, we cuddled a bit more. He appreciated that I told him I'd only call him Daddy, even though it was a joke, as we cuddled, we'd watch youtube and now and then we'd give ourselves space in fear someone was going to walk in and he apologized for that because he told me that it didn't really matter because he wasn't embarrassed to be seen around me? Again it's all the sweet talk, the soft tone, it's just us. We'd kiss and hold hands, he ended up taking me home later than he planned. We parked in a woodsy boat launch (It's a spot I'd walk or bike to, I live in the countryside of our city) we cuddled in the back of his vehicle, we'd kiss, he'd ask if I was comfortable, and eventually I ended up giving him a handjob. Although it really wasn't that sexual, we kept up a normal conversation during it, we brought up random topics. I mentioned earlier that day that a boy in our class told me I should grow out my hair and flirted with me for awhile afterwards, my friend kinda sounded pissed and asked why, and to be honest I didn't know and I told him that. To which my friend informed me that he thought my hair was perfect for me, he likes my hair style and that it's cute. He also said I was pretty great, specially since I, ""put up with him for so long."" We also talked about Christmas and I told him I had plans and he asked how much I was going to spend on him and I told him I really don't know cause sales and I'm a coupon freak. He told me he's going to meet the level of money spent on him to spoil me. Which I find ridiculous but I respect it. On the way home I brought up how comfy we kinda got cause I know we're taking things slow so I wouldn't be ""scared"", but it's slow but in a very affectionate way, to the point where I feel like maybe it's because I'm being treated like a human being, but I fear a romantic connection about this. Anyway, he told me he was going to text me the next day and that everything was going to be okay. That night I texted him to thank him for spending time with me to ease my mind and he said, ""Of course, anything for you."" 
Well, 
I will admit, I did slander my ex to a few of my friends but they never liked him so I wasn't that wary, but I never accused him of said act and I'm in a small town so I'm not surprised how shit spreads, anyway, I found out some of the stuff he asked and told me were lies, so the girl and I made amends and yeah I'm pissed about that but that's a different story. As promised my friend texted me and asked how his girl was doing and we've texted here and there since yesterday. I'm trying to give some myself some distance. Obviously I haven't put everything in here but this is long as it is, he'll be back tomorrow night. Maybe I'm overanalyzing his actions but I don't think I'd be surprised if he did has some sort of feelings? The other part of me doubts that heavily, if I feel the attraction getting stronger I'll call off the fwb ordeal, I just want to interpret his actions. 

(Tl;rd) I can't tell if my fucko bucko has romantic attraction to me and I'm overanalyzing everything. ",17Nov2018,1
387,"(I’m on mobile, sorry if formatting is a mess) I’m F22 and my dad is 43 and in a relationship with a girl (23) I went to high school with. My parents have been divorced since I was probably 5, but my dad has sometimes had off and on relationships (with women his own age).  Around summer of last year I found out he was in a relationship with this girl and I was so disgusted and embarrassed. I eventually got over it, as I love him, just wanted him to be happy and figured it wouldn’t last long and that I would just ignore that aspect of his life. I don’t see him often but when I did we would never speak about it. As of August this girl is pregnant with his child. I’m so disgusted and hurt and angry and I don’t know what to do. I feel selfish for feeling like this but it’s fucking gross! She’s my age and I went to school with this girl. And on top of everything, he was a sorry excuse for a parent, he did not raise me and he’s had so many fuck ups. I feel hurt that he couldn’t properly take care of my brother (19) and I and he just dumped us on his parents to raise but he’s bringing another child into the world. I’ve not spoken to him since I found out about this. He’s not even brought it up to me, it was my grandmother who told me. She wants to invite them to thanksgiving dinner and I told her I won’t be there if  this girl will be there and I feel bad but I’m just so disgusted and angry, I don’t want anything to do with it. I feel selfish and ashamed that I’m causing my grandmother to be stressed and upset over this, but I can’t help that I feel so put off by all of this. I don’t want to make things about me, but my grandmother says she doesn’t want this girl to feel hurt by leaving her out, but she’s not acknowledging that I’m feeling hurt! What should I do? How should I react? This isn’t something that will just go away :( ",17Nov2018,1
388,"My girlfriend and I have been together for 2 and a half years now. Had our ups and downs but at the end of the day we love each other and we just want us to be happy.

Last night while driving back home from a mates 21st she out of nowhere asked me if I’d be keen on a three way with another girl. 

Now for context: my girlfriend has had a bisexual history and she admitted to be recently that she feel equally attracted to girls as well as guys. In some cases more than guys. Also the girl she asked to do the three way with we have known for awhile and we all get along with fine. She would be super cool about it and it wouldn’t be weird afterwards.

I’m not comfortable with the idea of doing MMF and my girlfriend understands that. She said to me she wouldn’t be comfortable even doing that anyway, and if she ever did it would be when she is single.

If I’m being realistic I don’t think we will end up being married or having kids. I’m 24 and she is 20. A lot of her goals and dreams and what she wants to do with her life don’t coincide with mine, and honestly I would much rather her be happy and living her dreams and doing what she wants to do, even if that means that we split so she can do that. If we ever split maybe we will meet up later in life and take the leap for real.

Anyway... I’ve always wanted to have a three way with 2 girls. Any man on the planet has thought about it. My main thing is that I really don’t know how to go about it.  I don’t know what’s on the table and I really need to talk to her about what’s ok and what’s not ok.

Any and all advice would be great. I’m definitely overthinking the situation but would like some ideas so we can explore this fantasy together without any issues or complications.",17Nov2018,1
389,I moved in with my mom to help her get better from alcoholism. My grandfather convinced me to stay at home and help and not get work. Now I'm penniless and NEED to get out of this abusive soul sucking place. What records do I have? What can I do?,17Nov2018,1
390,"Until about a week ago, I used to believe in various conspiracy theories about China believing it to be the most socially progressive country on the planet and a country that we should model ourselves after. I have left up my previous posts on here, so you can look and see what I used to believe in, as embarrassing as they are. I would delete them but I think that I have to face the reality that these are once ideas I believed in and if I'm not careful, I could go down another rabbit hole.

Anyways, I kind of start hanging out with the wrong crowd. I went to China a while back and I had a really good experience there. Everyone was super nice to me and I was really impressed with how hypermodern the cities were and how beautiful and pristine the countryside was. I met these really pretty girls at a music festival I was at too and went home with them and they also gave me a really good impression of China. Then I was back home and there were these radical pro-China conspiracy theorists I met in Chinatown and they told me all these things they believed about China and showed me some resources that were very praising of Mao's Red Guards. They argued that the modern social justice movement should model itself after the Red Guards and not knowing everything I now realize about the Red Guards, their arguments seemed very compelling at the time. At the time, I was just all innocent and I didn't realize the effect of what I was hearing. I also listened to a podcast from one of my favorite NBA players, Kyrie Irving, talk about China. I had always respecting Kyrie for the way he thinks about the world/the bigger picture. He's always been a very woke guy in my mind. Anyways, Kyrie was talking about how great China was so that further cemented my idea that America should become more like China.

After doing more research and staying up all night about a week ago, I began to realize that China was not a heaven for social justice and progress like I thought it was. I had been wrong this whole time. I had been played. China is great for many reasons but I no longer think that America should model itself after China. I was just so preoccupied with being woke that I began to distrust the Western media narratives about China. I was looking to nonwhite/nonEuropean countries for America to model itself after because I was tired of the common narrative we get fed that only white countries can be woke or socially progressive.

Right now, I feel like I need to move on from my past beliefs. I need to be on my own. I'm ready to try out a new situation. I'm ready to be in a new environment, an environment where I can be happy. And my goals haven't changed, they'll always stay the same. To be around people and interact with them, I love that.

But right now, I am very lost. I don't know what to believe anymore when so much of what I've been told my whole life is a lie. I don't know what to believe or what not to believe. I don't know where to go from here and how to improve where I'm at right now. I've been very tempted to get back into drugs but so far I've resisted that impulse.",17Nov2018,1

392,"(English is not my first language and I don't live in the US)

I met this girl 3 weeks ago, we're both around 24. We immediately liked each other and quickly became friends. However she is really outgoing, partying going to concerts type of girl while I am the most boring person you would find on a party. (last time I went to a party was like 2 years ago) so it's not really my thing. Funny enough, we somehow have great chemistry. 

She's only going to be in my city for 6 more weeks then she's going back to her country of origin. (it's the same country where I come from). She really wants to visit the capital,  and she wants me to go with her. 

My problem is I've already been there 2 times and it's not my type of place, however I know she would enjoy herself there. 
Another problem is there is no more interesting places in like a 400 km radius from our city. So the capital is the cheapest place where she can have some fun.

Anyways, I have been working really hard for the last couple of months, saving money while living with my parents so I have saved up around $ 20k. I have no car, no bills, but my job is really shitty and I want to pursue education in near future, which will cost me quite a lot of money. 

One part of me wants to go there have fun with her, other part tells me to save up every penny. However I don't want to hate my past self in the future for not going. Because that can happen when she's out of my life.

Sorry for such a messy post, I appreciate any advice.

394,"So I’ve(M) recently started uni and met some new friends. I made a close friend in the first week, let’s call him P, and another new friend let’s call her R. 

So I am several weeks into uni now and I found out that P had feelings for R, but no longer does. I also found out that R currently had feelings for P. The problem is that I have feelings for R. 

The three of us spend a lot of time together but I kind of feel like a third wheel. P and R are close friends. I’m close with P also but I feel kind distant to R. 

I don’t want to act on my feelings and I want to get over them. I really want to have a close friendship with R but I think I’m fucking it up. (She recently told P that she thought I act weird around her). 

Both of them are amazing people and I hope to stay good friends with them.

I really want to move past this but I think I’m jealous of their close friendship. Should I tell her how I feel and that I want to friends or just let time slowly do its thing?

395,"There s this guy that i ve been seeing almost everyday at school. I m a new girl to the school since I just moved here a few months ago.

He always sits next to me in the library even though our school library has two floors and even though it has a lot of other empty seats, and he glances at me whenever we re studying next to each other in the library. He always says hi and smiles and shakes his head at me whenever he sees me, even though we re not friends and even though we never talk much, and like I said he s just in my math class and he s generally a shy person. He does talk to other girls sometimes but I ve never seen him do the same thing with any of them even though he s sort of friends with them and has known them for a long time. He d pass by me and my friend (one of the girls he has known for ages) and he d say hi to me and smile but never do the same for my friend even though they know each other. He never even does that with his guy friends. He keeps asking me the same questions over and over again, like what subjects I m taking and what not, and I always answer but he asks again when he gets the chance. He always asks me abt what books I m reading since I read a lot at school. I ve noticed him glancing and staring at me in math class (the only class we re both in) but he looks away. He also glances at me in the assembly sometimes. Idk what his deal is. At first I thought he was doing all this cause he's curious since I'm new to the school. But the other guys that I've met at school haven't done any of this before. He also ignores me and pretends that he never sees me sometimes. The other day i dressed really nicely for school because I was feeling good abt myself, and I noticed him glancing and looking away when I caught him. He glanced at me once I walked into class (maths, the only class/subject we both share) even though he was talking to his friends, then he looked away when I noticed. He never really asked me to hang out at school before and we don't see each other except in maths, in the library, and in the assembly. I also noticed him being quite clumsy and nervous around me, like he dropped his papers more than once in the library when he was sitting next to me, he dropped his pen, and he almost fell. He's a shy guy but he never acts this way around other girls. We never even talk at all tbh. I tried adding him on social media because I thouhut that maybe he's just trying to be friends, but he kept my request on delay and never accepted it, although he does have other girls on social media even though he never goes out with them or hangs out with them much since he's shy. How come he treats me this way at school and doesn't treat everyone else the same way, yet refuses to add me on social media where he has all those other people on there?

396,"So, I am a teenager, living normal family life. I like to spend my off time with my irl friends on pc, playing games, having fun. I don't really get outside too much to go hang out somewhere. Thing is, In my basketball team, all of us are like a family,were close friends, my classmates, we,guys are really close aswell, but rarely go out together. I dont lack friends,but sometimes I think to myself, wont i regret having that way of life? The biggest problem is, as we all have around here, we either go out ourselves,because almost other people who hang out, go at the centre of the city (this is their primary meeting place out here) and they just smoke, play some stupidass music like kids,at fuck with others, which isnt the way of life we prefer. We better spend in saturday being 5-6 hrs on pc,than rather going out to smoke and drink alcohol.

One of my dogs has terrible allergies.  He is a full bred golden retriever and has been itching since 3 months of age, which according to the vet is very early when developing allergies in a dog.  He has been on steroids his whole life because it is the only thing we have found to stop the itching.  He also gets the occasional skin, yeast, and ear infections which all require antibiotics.  I have been to two dog dermatologists, tried multiple kinds of medicine, allergy shots, food diet, special baths twice a week, but to no avail.  I have spent thousands of dollars on my dog to help try and find a solution to his never ending itching.  He is allergic to basically everything outside and dust inside.  We go on walks everyday and he goes potty outside but other than that he is an inside dog.  The steroids are the only thing that keep him from itching.  For those who don’t know, it is not good for him to be on steroids long term.  Long term, It starts shutting down his organs, increased hunger, etc.  Is it better for my dog to have a short but itch free life or should I continue spending so much money on trying to help figure out a different alternative to the itching?  My dog is only two and already looks like he’s ten years old.  He moves very slow, has a hard time getting up, and has very drugged up looking eyes.  I just want advice moving forward.

411,"A bit of background before I jump into the issue. I’m 18 and I’ve grown up in a religious (more specifically Christian) household. My mom is religious almost to the point where she’s an extremist and my biological dad ran out on me when I was 9 so, for the most part, I was mostly raised by mom. From childhood, I was always forced to go to church and I was constantly forced to claim I was a Christian even though, at the time, I was too young to know what a Christian person is. Before my dad ran out, he claimed that he was a Christian even though he mentally abused me and only uses the Bible to justify his actions. He always forced me into being like him. I remember when I was 10, I remember thinking about what my dad was (and still is) like and saying “if this is what Christians are supposed to be like, then I want no part of that.” And because I was forced to go to church a lot by mom, I faked being religious for many years. I don’t hate my mom but there’s some issues that I don’t know how to deal with. My mom has always been a control freak. I was never able to argue with her on anything because every time I brought up a valid argument she’d tell me to “stop disrespecting me. I’m your mother.” Even though most of the time, I just sat there and listened to her ramble on. I could never talk to her about my problems because somehow I always came out as the bad guy in every situation. For example, I once told her I was being bullied at school. Instead of at least trying to help, she’d either say pray about it or say “stop blaming everyone for your problems and quit your crying, crybaby!” So the bully at school kept saying he’s my friend so I told him no you’re not. You’re a jerk who doesn’t deserve friends because he had a lot of friends at the time. I said that in front of everyone and not only did he stop bullying me, but he lost all of his friends that day. Don’t worry. He’s doing fine now. From that day forward, I never went to my mom with any problems because I was always able to handle my problems without her help. And even I did ask for her help or any kind of advice, I’d still come out as the bad guy no matter what. Most of all, I could never talk to her about religion. Any time we ever talked about religious beliefs I’d say something that came from the Bible she’d have a different belief. And being the extremist she is, I thought that she would want to go by everything in the Bible. So after that happened, she made me apologize for not believing what she did. She was nice to me in public but never in the privacy of home. Now referring to what I said earlier about faking religion, I eventually had something that was real when I was 15. She knew that and instead of acknowledging that I believe God exists and that He can do miracles in peoples lives, she tried to convince me that I had always been religious and that I should never claim I was faking anything even though she can scream at a person, say she’s not mad, and then ramble on about how “irresponsible” that person was for the next 20 minutes. Speaking of rambling, I know I’ve been making this long and it feels like I’m barking over nothing, but I need to get this out there. Anytime something came on TV that she didn’t like, she’d run into my room and say “DONT WATCH THIS TV SHOW! THE DEVILS TRYING TO SHOW US THINGS!” Even though I would never be watching TV when she came into my room to say that. Whenever she would say that, I’d tell her that the devil didn’t put those tv shows there. Other people did. Whenever I get done saying that, she’d blow up on me and then tell me to stop watching that show even though she turned on my TV and then turned it to the show she told me not to watch. Ok. Fast-forward to today. She told me that last night, she had a dream that I was disowning everyone around me and that I was headed down a dark path. I didn’t even bother saying anything to that. I was too upset to know, once again, that she doesn’t trust me, she still thinks that I’m faking it even though I already confessed to faking it then turning it into something real, and she even controls my stepdad’s religious beliefs. I’ve told him about my problems but he has no idea what to do. If anyone sees this, or even made it this far, I need any advice you can give me on how to deal with this.

412,"I have always been a kind, decent person. I always look for ways to create win-win situations and I'm typically well-liked for that. I'm not arrogant and I don't strive to be ""above"" others in any way. But throughout my life there have been people who have targeted me. I think they see my kindness as weakness and it's like they see me as a joke. 

I'm at the point now where I feel like I won't stop attracting these bullies unless I become just like them. Yes, I understand that anyone who picks on another person has poor self-esteem, but the fact is that being decent and fair with people like this does not work. It just doesn't. They see that my approach is to work things out, and they see that as weakness. 

I don't want to turn into an asshole, I really don't. But I'm sick of the lack of respect I get from some people just because I'm kind. ",17Nov2018,1
414,"OK this is gonna sound so weird but hear me out, I studied medicine because my parents insisted, but as you can imagine, I'm very dissatisfied with what I am now, I hate being a doctor and hate dealing with patients, and honestly I don't want to be in any health care system. 
What I always had passion for is Physics and CS and after studying some courses in psychology in Med school I like it too, basically if I can explain my passion then I want to know how everything works and I mean EVERYTHING, from the very basic nature of reality ""astro, quantum and theoretical physics"" to how our minds work and the idea of consciousness, those two things are my most thought provoking and interesting subjects to me, also the idea of Neural network and Artificial Intelligence and the idea of mimicking a brain which I think it needs basic knowledge of CS Psychology is very intriguing. 
So I'm here facing quite a dilemma, can't decide what to do, but my basic idea is to get a second bachelor in Physics and after that I would decide what to do.
So do you think getting a second bachelor in a totally different major than my first a good idea? Or are there any master degrees or something like that, that can combine all of these things? I know what I'm saying is pretty absurd but this feeling of wanting to learn everything can't get out of my head. ",17Nov2018,1

417,"I have new upstairs neighbors who moved in like a month ago, and since then it has been constant banging. I left them a very kind note outlining the situation, and they REALLY took it the wrong way, coming down and banging on my door to freak out and call me rude about leaving a note, and we got into an argument. So that's the relationship we have, and they have no care that they are being too loud and that we can hear them. I understand that living in an apt you have to deal with noise sometimes, but I know for a fact my roommates and I do not walk loud enough to cause such disturbances for my downstairs neighbors. They are loud walkers/stompers, which is fine when you live in q house, but when the people below you have expressed 5+ times that it's too loud (and we know it's avoidable), it's not ok.

It drives me off the wall. I love where I live but this makes me despise it. The front office legitimately does not care and I'd say they even side with the upstairs people.

420,"I'm gonna try and get straight to the point here and ramble as little as possible. I met this girl all the way back in middle school. We hit it off really well, talked to each other about all our problems, and basically became best friends. She ended up with my best friend romantically for about 4-5 years, and for some reason we decided to start dating the second they broke up. 

This lasted for almost two years. There were a lot of issues between us stemming from past relationships on my behalf, drug use, money issues, pretty much in the end it seemed (to her) as if our goals in life were different. 
 
When we started dating as well, we made it a goal to save up and move out together. Her parents were close to kicking her out, so it was very important to me and I started saving immediately, even went as far as getting a better paying job despite how hard that was for me (I have terrible anxiety). This led to me being very controlling/manipulative when she would spend her money. One time, she was doing really well, had a few hundred saved up, and blew it all on a trip with her family. I made her feel like absolute shit for it, I'm sure she barely got to enjoy her trip after that. 

Regardless, these were things I was working at and it seemed to me like we were both building each other up and trying to work through these issues together. Out of nowhere though she called it quits with me nearly two months ago. On her lunch break of all times.

Any time we talk about it she summarizes why she did this as things were doomed from the start, she just doesn't feel the same way about me, that she was always having doubts, she doesn't feel like she's ""where she should be"" in life, etc. I still absolutely love this woman and I think about her way too much. 

The confusion is from where me and her sit presently. I'm having the *hardest* time in the world keeping from bothering her. I constantly want to talk to her, and about once a day I cave and end up texting her. Anymore, she rarely replies. When she does there's always some generic excuse about how she was busy. 

Yet we still hangout from time to time and she still seemingly has feelings for me. She lets me use her car from time to time to get to work, since I got a job 40 miles away that my car can't get to when I got that job to get a place with her. 

For the first month after we broke up she still came over every so often, we were still affectionate with one another (kissing, etc) and we even ended up saying we loved each other again. A week or two ago she told me it didn't feel right, that she felt like she was using me, that she doesn't really want to come over anymore. Yet three days ago we got drunk together and she spent the night. 

She even invited me over to her place and made me breakfast the next morning. Today she isn't even replying to me. 

I feel like I'm absolutely losing my mind here. I need advice on how to handle this situation because at this rate this is going to kill me. I keep having this dumbass hope that she will end up loving me again since it feel like she does at times, but then these things happen and I don't even hear from her all day and I turn into an absolute mess because it hits me what the reality of the situation is. 

The thing is though I can't/don't ask her every single day if her feelings have changed, so I'm left sitting here wondering where we sit. What do I do reddit. Please help me",17Nov2018,1

I like the work at the moment but now I'm having regrets.

426,"So a few things about me, I’m a 19 year old university student and I’ve been with her (21 year old girl) for 2 years. I study at a university far from home and my girlfriend did not like that, after a year there I wasn’t doing too great (due to personal and family issues) and got dismissed. She was really happy about this and started telling me to apply to schools back at home which I attempted to do but ended up just appealing my dismissal and got back in for a semester. When I told her that I got back in to University because of my appeal she wasn’t happy. She started saying things like “you’re a serial liar” “you’re horrible and you’re lucky to have me” “why am I still with you” and many more things along those lines. We were on my bed while this was happening and after a few minutes listening to this I finally got up said “you’re not perfect in this relationship also” while I said this she got up also in my face started screaming at me and I had to shove her off me, after this she got up and hit my chest and I ended up slapping her. I know no man should ever do this, I am 100% wrong for putting my hands on her like that and I regret it, I did not plan to do it just after holding everything in and after she hit me on my chest it was a natural reaction. After this happened I left for school and ended up breaking things off, it was okay for a while but she ended up coming to my university 8 hours away to see me. When she came up I told her not to come many times, I insisted on not giving her my address and she ended up finding it on my amazon account. To this day she has done this 3 times. She is currently with me right now, I just expressed my feelings saying that I don’t want to be with her and I want her to leave my place and she ended up calling her dad asking for a lawyer and saying she wants to sue me for slapping her.

Now that that’s out of the way!

I come from a pretty religious family. Like, *very* Catholic. And though I’m not religious at all, I can’t help but feel like I’ve got some sort of catholic guilt ingrained within me; I can’t bring myself to get rid of my rosary, I automatically have some sort of... I don’t know, autonomous reaction when I get too close to a boy? If I think anything negative, I feel ashamed for *days*. Don’t even get me started on how I feel after hookups. 

Suffice if to say, despite the fact I don’t believe, I still feel deeply ashamed and guilty of doing the things I *want* to do, because of this sort of rejection that’s been built into me. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to overcome it? I just want to live my life, to enjoy myself, to be happy, and not feel a result of shame, especially when I reject the source of that shame. ",17Nov2018,1
428,"I have a relative who is a broadcast celebrity.She can be very funny and fun to be around and she is generous by contributing to family college funds. She is married with no children and she has a  very large inheritance. People bend over backwards to cater to her because she is famous. 

The problem is, when interacting as a family member with her, everything interaction is on her terms. You have to go to her house, you have to shop where she wants to shop, you have to eat when she wants to eat. This can be taken to the extreme. For example when I was undergoing serious chemo, she never visited but invited me to drive to her house (45 minutes) and do her shopping with her (at  very very high-end stores I cannot afford). She has no interest in visiting our child during her activities, but mentions regularly that our child will one day be taking care of her, 

Other bad behavior includes being bossy and demanding of shopping staff (butting in line for example), purchasing $1000 dollar dresses for herself regularly but...when she asked what to give our teen daughter for Christmas and we responded she said ""a gift  of a $100 sweater for our daughter is too expensive, she will find something else."" Other examples include not visiting her husband while ill in the hospital but getting others to do it for her ""because she had too much work to do"" and she just feels too sad. 

My husband and I also work hard and have meaning work, but we are not in the famous category. While we appreciate our relative for many things, we want to restrict our time with her but feel guilty, How do we respond and make ourselves feel comfortable around her?

&amp;#x200B;

I am graduating from college next month, in 4.5 years. I have just really been feeling some type of depression lately that I can't shake no matter what I do, which is why I am typing this out. I honestly feel like everyone around me has a different mindset than me, and it is finally driving me crazy. Lets start off by saying that I have always been a person with extremely high standards in anything in life I am passionate about. I have a very large ego, although I am a kind person in general and have a very empathetic side where I am constantly looking out for people around me, I don't know how to really explain it but I can easily notice when someone is feeling uncomfortable and I always take the step to try to ensure their comfort based on what I think(love problem solving/helping). Most people around me view me as an eccentric and smart/nice guy, however I definitely can be annoying at times because I try too hard to joke around a lot of the time(Really creative funny jokes, but some can obviously be stupid and bad; jokes go both ways). When I am told I am being annoying, I immediately stop, unlike many others that I deal with. I also get bored extremely easily and will not leave a room if all my friends are just staring at their phones for 20+ minutes straight, I also barely ever get excited about anything. Looks wise, I am definitely at least in the 8-9 / 10 range. After you read this, youll probably think hmm why the fuck is this kid complaining if he thinks he is so great. The problem is, I am extremely lonely. All of my best friends are extremely busy nowadays, and all my roomates want to do is drink extremely heavily, and fuck ugly to slightly above average girls who are also extremely fucking drunk and can barely remember the last day, then complain about it the next day. I really enjoy talking to girls to get to know them, not just groping them in the dark like everyone else (If youre good looking its ok, if not its creepy apparently, like WTF?) and during frat parties obviously this barely happens. When I go out to the bars, its definitely a little better but the people I go out with do this same shit and im sick and tired of it. I am now addicted to smoking weed+tobacco together like 3-5 rips per day, have been doing this for 2 years and I am aware that I need to eventually stop, but I have nothing else to waste the time in the day. When I drink, I drink a very large amount trying to get myself fucked up recenetly, but somehow I am always coherent and the one of the only people acting relatively normal no matter the amount I drink. People have told me to try to loosen up but I do not want to be a mindless imbecile that has no boundaries for himself, I already am pretty loose just not when it comes to picking up girls. Every girl I have had sex with I have had certain regrets about it and cut it off after a few times. I try to not chase perfection b/c I know its not possible, but I just have this unshakeable ego where If certain conditions of mine arent met my sex drive will literally turn off. I thought I might be asexual or something but I masterbate like 5-7 times a week to straight porn and do have sex drive when alone. I am extremely comfortable with who I am as a person I just wish more people had the same mindset. Im 22 and my roomates are 19, 20, 20, 21, 21, 24 years old. I have no idea what/where Ill be when I graduate and this just adds to it.dg

438,"So I have been seeing this guy for 6 months, and have been official for 4. I really like him and last night I was working up the balls to say ‘I love you’ when he said he had been meaning to talk to me about us just being friends from now on because he didn’t have feelings for me that way’. He said we were basically just fwb even though we had the convo that we were in a relationship about two months ago. I basically accepted it but to be honest I’m pretty hurt because other then being a bit distant last week there were no other signs, we get along really well and I legit thought he was the one I would settle down with. I talked with his sister (she lives there too and we are really close friends) and she said he talked to their mom and they both thought we were in a relationship so I’m just really confused. She also said she would like me to stay but agrees with me that I need to distance myself so if I think that would be better done moving then she understands but that she and their mom will help me getting through the breakup. He also wants me to stay but it’s kinda hard because he still wants to be friends like we were but wants it instantly and won’t give me time to get through it. What’s frustrating is I talked to him about it a heap of times before moving in that it’s okay if he doesn’t want me to and the week after I do he breaks up even though we hadn’t had any problems living together, and he decided to tell me the day before meeting his family for his moms birthday so it was awkward for the whole day. I have no idea whether I should stay there a bit until I can afford leaving or move out now to my cousins.

TLDR: Guy dumped me a week after I moved in with him and family even though we never had any issues on the night I planned to tell him I love him, asked me to stay as friends. Should I move out or stay?

439,"So I have a crush in one of my classes and I see her every other day at school because of the weird schedule we have. I have her for one class that is long and it is that last class of the day. I like her and try talking to her and  I make her laugh. She usually likes to start the conversation and says hi as soon as we see each other.  She also makes the effort to talk whenever we start to get quiet and occasionally teases me or hits me with a piece of paper or touches me.  Im not sure if she likes me or is nice. Im trying to talk to her more and more in class since we barely see each other a couple times a week but I have this one friend who keeps interrupting.

My friend unfortunately sits by himself and is always annoying me in class. Whenever we have time to work, he comes over and sits next to me or forces me to move back with him. He is getting in the way me trying to talk/be friends with this girl. I wanna tell him to F off and sit by himself or tell him about this girl. He is not really my “friend friend” more like “acquaintance friend” . He is one of those people that lie about things, yell, talk about weird things in class and won’t annoy someone else. He is also obnoxiously loud and I’m afraid of shutting him down or telling him about my crush because then he will let it out or start drama.

I am also a reserved person and not very social so I don’t want to lose this one time I can have a great relationship with someone.  Any advice on how to get rid of this nuisance or how do I get this man to stop interrupting?

Also, Im not very social and wondering how I could talk to her more or get her number. Unfortunately, the class we have together is the last class of the day and we part ways.
