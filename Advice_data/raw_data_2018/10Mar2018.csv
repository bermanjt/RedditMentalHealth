0,"This is a throwaway account, but I'm really serious about finding help and getting advice on this topic? Recently I went through a tough break up and we're still living together, every time we talk post-breakup I get the vibe that something is wrong with me. I'm not good at talking at all and it essentially ruined the relationship. 

When I was younger my mom was emotionally abusive ( maybe a narcissist.) I didn't really think that could affect me, but I truly feel like I keep going through cycles of self-destruction due to it. Most of my relationships feel one sided and I can't seem to figure out how to open up and talk. I don't like putting my feelings out there for people to wreck. 

So essentially, I'm just wondering how to improve my life after realizing my mom may have fudged me up in an awful way. My relationships platonic or romantic are super important to me, and I'm tired of losing them because I haven't found help yet. ",10Mar2018,1
1,"[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7xwmjx/coworker_19f_finds_me_25m_creepy_and_has_told_my/) is the original post regarding my situation. Im new to reddit so hopefully the linking works. 

In summary though, a friend who i've never had a romantic interest in messaged me and told me that she found me creepy and asked me to stop messaging her. After returning to work i found that it was public knowledge but that people didnt know the truth (as is the case with most workplace gossip in my experience). I discovered that this girl had told my boss and that, even though managment didnt believe i had done anything wrong, i would still need to be spoken to about it.

Anyway, after all of the stuff in the above post went down, things have been in limbo. My boss had our usual meeting and nothing was brought up out of the ordinary. I considered bringing the issue up myself but i decided that it would look like i was emotionally invested in what was going on.I kept my mouth shut but i did ask one of my superiors who i am fairly close friends with what the deal was. He said that our boss didnt consider it a work issue and that, while im still going to have a chat with him about it, it will be more of an informal thing. ""hey i heard whats happened between you and 19f. I think its a misunderstanding. Just follow her wishes and dont contact her again and i dont think this is a big deal"" sort of thing.

 This is really good news for me work-wise of course and i'm glad that i get on well with all of the managment team and its put me in such a strong position. But there is an additional complication. This was 3 or 4 weeks ago and the girl has been avoiding me at all costs. At the social event we both attend she has been avoiding her usual seat next to me and sitting at a different table. Totally understandable given the circumstances and to be honest it was a relief. However last week she sat next to me again and tried to strike up a conversation. At the time i was still very much concerned with the meeting with my boss, not to mention the fact that i have become pretty angry with her; so when she said ""hey, how are you doing?"" i replied with ""fine"" and moved to a different table. Now i find myself feeling bad. She tried to reach out to me and i turned away. The one thing i want from her is answers and i had the chance to rebuild something with her and maybe get them but i was to angry to see it.

My question for you, people of Reddit, is ""how can i get some closure here?"" My boss has put off our meeting for the last 3 or 4 weeks so i have no closure in that regard, and i dont feel like i can approach my friend (or former friend as i guess i should be calling her) without escalating the situation. I've also found out that other co-workers (including some i consider friends) have known about what has happened and also knew how she felt for a couple of days before she sent her message and kept it from me. I'm feeling very betrayed right now.

I've decided on what i want to happen but i'm unsure how to achieve these goals. I want her to explain why she felt the way she felt and why she chose the actions she did rather than talking to me. From there i can decide on whether there is any chance of rebuilding anything with her. I want to have this meeting with my boss dealt with and out of my mind, but cant really bring it up without making it look like a big deal and finally (and most importantly) i need to know who she has spoken to about this and how many friends have kept this from me. I feel like i cant trust any of them right now.  

What do i do? This is such a mess",10Mar2018,9
2,"tl/dr:  I'm getting the cold shoulder from my girlfriend of 6m, she's hardly talking to me and it's wrecking me. I need her to talk to me today so I can start a new week fresh. 
What do I say?

Me: M[24]
Her: F[21] 

Background: Due to my living circumstances, I moved in with her and her family after 3m. (Her mother was the one that suggested it) Lots of little things happened which she bottled up and it all exploded out 2 weeks ago. She asked me to move out, but we made up by then of the of the week and went on a date where she held my hand and kissed me. Through this whole time I was clear on saying I know I'm not perfect, but I'm willing to change and grow as a person if you're willing to communicate with me and help. 

Where it's gone wrong: Thursday morning she finished her first overnight shift finishing at 5:45am, I started at 7:30am and haven't see her for a few days. So I went and surprised her after to which she just gave me the cold shoulder, like she didn't even want to see me and went home. 
She doesn't text me, and if she replies 6 hours later it's a couple words. 

Yesterday morning I messaged her asking to have a quick talk, I want to work this out, is it just over night shifts and she's wrecked or is there an issue we can talk through.  


Advise:

I haven't been sleeping due to anxiety and panic attacks over this, I just feel in a limbo about where I stand and it's affecting me. What do I do? If she wants to break up that's fine, I love her, and I'll wait for her.
I just want to sort this out. 


Sorry for the long post, thankyou for all advice. ",10Mar2018,3
3,"English isn’t my first language, so please forgive me for any errors. I’ll try my best to be coherent. 

My ex-boyfriend, we’ll call him Adam, and I broke up recently. 

On the night of our breakup, I left the apartment to meet up with a few friends. I returned to see an empty box of paracetamol tablets on the dining table. There was an empty wine bottle and an empty liquor bottle in the bin. I finally found him passed out on the balcony, surrounded by empty beer cans. Evidently, he had tried to OD on paracetamol tablets and had taken it with alcohol. He responded after I shook him several times, and I brought him to the bathroom to throw up. He seemed a little drunk, but generally fine, and insisted that he didn’t want me to call for an ambulance. I had my bags packed and originally planned on leaving that night, but I ended up staying. I was shaken, but mostly guilty — I had initiated the breakup. 

In the few days that followed, Adam stopped eating, or would only eat very little. He also went out on most nights and would return severely inebriated. He spoke often of suicide. He also hurt himself physically when I was in the shower or asleep. He responded to my attempts at reaching out for help on his behalf with anger. He didn’t want his family to know, and said that they didn’t need the stress (his father’s health is in an extremely bad state, and his mother is very much affected by it). In fact, he was so desperate for me to not contact anyone that he would threaten me and my family, snatch my phone out of my hands and throw it aside, or even shove me. To him, I was being disrespectful by wanting to contact his family and friends despite his protests. I initially stayed because I felt guilty and responsible for his mental state; I stayed to ensure that he would have his meals, and that he wouldn’t hurt himself or try to OD again. I moved out very shortly after, when he started to become more aggressive. 

I still felt awful and remained in contact to make sure he was okay. I would sometimes order delivery up to his apartment. Adam has called me up twice since then, both times when he was drunk, to talk about how he’s ready to leave (read: commit suicide). He would constantly speak about how depressed he is through text, in between messages telling me that he missed me. 

He might be doing this simply for the attention or in an attempt to get the relationship back, but there are many other factors that has me convinced and therefore incredibly worried. Adam lost his job a few months ago and is in debt. Someone he trusted took off with a big portion of his savings. He has no friends, and believes that he is unwanted by his family. To elaborate on that last point, he has made many bad choices and his father makes no attempt to hide his disappointment. I have told him many times that that does not mean he is unwanted, and to talk to his family or go back home (we are not from the same country), but he has always refused. By now, he has used up most of his savings. He had a job lined up, but we broke up before then and he didn’t turn up for the training, his reason being that he simply doesn’t care if he does not have me. 

I’m overwhelmed with guilt every single day. I spend all my time trying to convince him not to die. Logically, I know that it isn’t my fault and that I cannot be in this relationship. Yet, I do not think I could ever live it down if he truly decides to kill himself. As awful as he has been throughout our relationship, I still care for him vastly and I hate to see him in this state. I’ve been trying to look for jobs on his behalf, but whether or not he contacts them or goes for the interviews are out of my control. It seems that the only way that I can stop this is to get back together with him... am I being selfish by not wanting to? I broke down recently and told him how scared I have been, and how clueless I am, and he simply told me that it isn’t my fault. (However, he told me in a text message just 2 nights ago that I “threw him off a bridge”.)

16,"Hi all. First time posting here and looking for some advice. I’ll try to keep the background short but it’s relevant to the story....

I went to college in a city 5 hours away from home, met a guy right before graduating, and we’ve been together for 8 years (now married) even though I moved home after college right after college. We did the whole distance thing for a year or so after. He used to work in a field that required him to travel a lot, so when we first moved in together a year or so after I moved home, it made sense for him to move out to where I was since he would be traveling all the time anyway. 

So flash forward to last year- I’d been at a stable job for over 5 years and was recruited to a new job with up in New England (about 4 hours north). The price was right so we took the plunge and moved. For one reason or another, the job didn’t pan out and I was laid off very unexpectedly along with a bunch of other people after only a mere few months on the job. There were no other job prospects in the area (for the industry I work in) so there was no reason for us to stay up there. Since we had to make decisions fast regarding where to move next, I asked my husband if he wanted to move back to his hometown (where I went to college and which is 5 hours away from my home). I thought it would be a fresh start for both of us after a devastating job loss.

So now, we have been here for a year and I hate it. It sucks because I’ve tried really hard to like it but just don’t. I did luckily land a job right away, but I took a huge pay cut so now we are scraping by. My husband doesn’t make much money either. Furthermore, the industry that I’m in doesn’t have a big presence here so there are really no other job prospects. There is currently no room for growth in the position I’m working now. So now I make less money and I’m unhappy with the area we live in.

My husband doesn’t make much either but he loves being back in his hometown so I’m stuck. I want to move back home as there are plenty of better job prospects there, and I am homesick, but at the same time I feel selfish because my husband has always moved to accommodate me and he loves being back in his hometown. I just feel so unfulfilled in my job and need to be challenged more. I regret taking that job up in New England last year as I wouldn’t be in the situation I’m currently in. What do I do?

Ps- we do not have kids so that doesn’t factor into anything",10Mar2018,3

Quick backstory i have been applying everywhere i can to get a better job, this police department contacted me to do a Physical Training exam, i am about 90 pounds overweight and have knee issues to boot, i went to prep for the exam and i printed out the required paperwork that the said in the email if we didn't have compleated on arrival we would not be admitted.

Honestly its a pain, but i hesitate filling it out not just out of laziness but because im not sure i can pass the physical, im not sure i want to fill all this out just to hand it in too never hear from them again, i mean there will have to be better, fitter candidates there right? people better fit to be police than me, people who are 100% sure they want to do it

I start my classes and never see my teacher because he eat icecream and has a cold, seeing different people from Mongolia or Albania every month.

Anyway, job is minimum wage, **bad sex**; can't seem to get it a lot and if I do, it's bad and I closing my eyes sometimes at night thinking not to open the next day.

32,"So, some backstory. I [22] live with my father, my mother, and my two brothers, older and younger. My married  father, not giving any details, is a massive man whore. Like probably the worst in the world. Don't believe me? 


One time when my parents were on vacation in another country, my dad just HAD to visit an old flame. On two occasions he's went on vacation with his affair partners (some know he's married, some don't.) only God can count how many times he's went out with girls to eat or something while his family was at home doing nothing. 


A lady stalked my mom at her job once. Turns out,  she's my dad's closest affair partner.


I have a six year old brother that my mom doesn't know about.  And despite that screw-up, my dad still invites girls over when my mom's gone. 


 I also feel somewhat upset towards my mom too because she seems complacent towards this. She never seemed to put her foot down despite some crazy bitch stalking her (btw he's invited her over on multiple occasions when my mom wasn't home.) despite the fact that  that's not the first time one of his affair partners has harassed us (that story's private) and despite his ""fuck your feelings"" mindset (the 1st time he went on vacay, my mom wanted to know why he was going to Italy by himself. He said he ""just wanted to."" she said fine she'll buy her own tickets and go by herself. He said if she did that then he's not going anymore. That was six years ago...) she's even TRIED to get me friendly with one of his ex affair partners (I mean, yeah  I liked her when I was younger but if I knew what she did, that would change very quickly.)


At one point I considered keeping my dad distant from my me. i.e not having him in my life, not visiting, not telling my future kids about him.  But the thing is, he loves all of his kids with all his heart. As shitty a spouse as he might be, it just feels wrong to hate someone who cares so much about you and your siblings. But at the same time, it feels wrong to just sit quietly when he invites some crazy stalker bitch into the place where my dear little brother and I live and sleep (he knows about her past behavior.) so how should I feel. What should I do?

I don’t know how to break this cycle, though. I simply don’t know how to “just” do something for fun and let go of those rules I’ve formed over so long.

43,"Man... I  don't even know how to start this so I'm  just going to start writing. Talking  to people kills me,  man. Especially when they're  looking for advice or insight on things.

Even if  it's something simple  like talking to a friend that's looking for a place to move to and comes to me all up-beat and happy talking about how  they found ""the perfect place"" and  that the ""timing could not have been more perfect"" because they're getting evicted in under a month so they **have** to move ASAP.  But then when I look into the place  they're  moving to it has the worlds worst   reviews. It's an apartment so there are years of reviews for it  and they're almost all 1 star with paragraphs on paragraphs of negative things about the place.

47,"Hello, a little general info here. I'm 18/F and have always had a hard time telling people that I'm not interested in talking to them. I've always been very worried about hurting others' feelings.

I'll be going to a technology / science college this upcoming year with a 4:1 male to female ratio and from what I've been, women have to learn to be a little aggressive to fend off all the guys...

I have a boyfriend and it's very easy to bring this fact up and use it as an excuse to avoid conversation when guys attempt to flirt, but I want to get better at saying it myself without needing an 'excuse' so-to-speak when I don't want to talk to other guys.

52,"I'm currently a college freshman in the south east. My mom and older sister, who's graduating college this semester, have decided to pack things up and move to California. Cool, right? Well I was on board at first.. but I'm not so sure. I want to keep working towards my degree and stay with my friends. I don't have enough credits to be a transfer student, and I'm technically still going to be a freshman next year because of my low credit hours. I'm not sure how I would transfer to a Cali uni?

The reason I'm afraid of staying here is because I had to drop out last semester and reapply because I was very depressed and had to withdraw from all my classes. I'm doing better this semester, but I live at home with my family and being around them helps me. I'm worried I'll get into another period like that if I go back to dorm life. I can isolate myself very quickly, and I need a social outlet that I won't have I'd I move to a state where I know no one. 

One reason I'd like to go to Cali is because I'm gay, and since I go to uni in Appalachian country there's a very small knit gay community here, and I feel like that's one factor of my depression. I do have gay friends, but I'm not super close with them. My only friend I see on a regular basis here is my fwb, and those don't forever.  It's quite lonely, but I'd hate to leave them. I'm afraid I won't make friends in Cali if I can't get into college there. I very much rely on a having a social group, I'm honestly pretty extroverted even though I'm shy. 

In short, I don't know what to do. I think it'd be wonderful to live in Cali, my friends all said they were jealous my family is moving there, but I just don't know if I could handle it. Leaving everyone and trying to enroll back in college in a new place.  Any advice?",10Mar2018,0

58,"My child is 5. His biological father is not active in his life, but my husband is. My husband has been in my son's life over 3 years, and we're in the process of a legal adoption. My son's biological father and I had a toxic, abusive relationship. I moved out of state to have my child in a safe and stable environment, and have since settled in and made a life for us. His bio dad (I'll refer to him as ""D"") was here for the birth, signed the birth certificate, but eventually moved back to our original state when my son was a few months old. D ended up getting married, and now has 2 other small children. In 2014 I received full custody with visitation at my discretion, and child support in the amount of $200 a month. My son hasn't seen D in 3 years. We used to video chat, maybe once a month, but that slowly tapered off., as did the child support. There were also 2 occasions where D and his family planned to come down to visit, but canceled at the last minute. I married my husband 2 years ago, and he adores my son. He's an amazing father, and my child calls him ""daddy"". Unfortunately, D seems to have fallen back into old habits, and he and his wife are separated. She and I have always maintained a cordial relationship, and honestly, she's the one I contact regarding relevant info about my son. 

Last year D, his wife, and myself came to a mutual agreement that D would sign over his parental rights, absolving him of financial responsibility. I even agreed to not seek arrears for the balance of unpaid child support. D has the documents now, and we're waiting on him to sign so we can start the process of adoption. My son will take my husband's last name. 

My question is...what is an appropriate way to address the fact that his daddy isn't his biological father? Obviously he'll be aware that his last name will change, but as he gets older, he's going to be more aware of his family in a different state. I want him to have a relationship with them, especially his half siblings. He's only 5 now, and I know he wouldn't grasp all of this, but I want some advice on the best way to handle it when it comes time to answer any questions he has. Unfortunately, I have no idea if D will ever get his act together, and as of right now, my son has no clue who he is. I'm totally supportive of my son eventually having a relationship with D, but also, how do I express to him that his daddy truly is his daddy? My husband loves him, and is dedicated to us as a family. In fact, the last time my son saw D, my husband drove us to that state so D and his family could all visit. That was 3 years ago. I appreciate any advice, even if you've been the child in a situation like this. The bottom line is that I want my son to know he has a big family who loves him, and ensure that I approach this the best way for him mentally and emotionally. ",10Mar2018,1

i feel torn apart, should i stick to my already planned path which i have figured out or should i take the risk, get out of my comfort zone and pursue a relationship

keep in mind the second Masters is in a private University so it's more prestigious and prominent than the other two, even though i'm not exactly familiar with all of the subjects, so changing would be a challenge and a major life choice that i never planned for.

67,"Hi all, sorry in advance for the wall of text, looking for some advice on salary negotiation. Tl;DR at the end. For some background, I've (23F) been working as a contractor in my current position since August. This job is in the marketing department in an asset management/financial industry. Before this position, I had a summer internship in sales/mkt in 2017 after graduating with a degree in marketing in May. I currently make $20/hour, or about 40k before taxes and benefits are taken out. No paid holidays, no paid sick leave, no official vacation, Kaiser health, no 401k. 

So recently, my immediate supervisor, Kent, moved positions internally, meaning the spot opened up. Given that I had been assisting him with some responsibities in that role, including assisting the team he supports, I thought I would apply for the position. For reference, Kent is about 26 and has the title assistant manager, and has been in this position for 4 years. He had pretty much started directly after school after being a contractor with them  a year. Kent encouraged me to apply and was on board that I would be a great fit for the role. So it wasn't out of the realm of possibility for me to get this position. Our manager, Eric, also said to apply for the role. 

I did so, redoing my resume and writing a great cover letter. Eric set up some time for us to have an ""Interview/discussion"". The general vibe I was getting was informal, as HR wasn't involved and it was set for late afternoon on a Friday in the brainstorming room.

So I go to this meeting having prepared a little. He explains about how he had decided to change the position to a higher level (manager), more strategic, etc., and if I was still interested. He starts asking me more strategic questions that I was pretty unprepared for, and it becomes clear to me that I'm not what he's looking for. He ends the conversation that he's looking for someone more experienced, he loves having me as an employee and wants to see me in a more permanent role, but that he doesn't think he'd be setting me up for success by throwing me into this role. So I'm pretty disappointed but manage to act pretty professional and accept his explanation. I resign myself to waiting for the next opportunity to come s along.

 Meanwhile, in the next few weeks he has about 45 applicants, mostly external and a few internal. He narrowed it down to 3 and interviewed them in person in the past week. Long story short, he pulls me aside today and basically tells me that in the applicants he's interviewed, none have had anything that I couldn't bring to the table. I've really stepped up in the past few weeks to help take on responsibilities in the wake of Kent leaving (which I definitely have, I had been given a lot more opportunities to prove myself with new projects). I've been a great employee and he doesn't want to lose me, and that he'd like to bring me on full time, probably as an assistant manager. He said with all the applicants, he'd have to be just as involved to get them up to speed, so it makes sense to invest time in me and my career.

ANYHOW, ultimately I'm looking for salary negotiation advice. I'll try to ask for a range if they ask what my desired salary is, but other than that not sure how to go about it, since the situation is kind of unique and I feel like I have at least a little leverage. I'm hoping to get at least 50k, in a perfect world I'd get 60 but that's probably unreasonable. Anyone have any advice/resources/anecdotes? All help appreciated!!

TL;DR I (contractor) applied for my boss's position after he moved departments. My larger supervisor did an informal interview and basically told me he was changing the position to make it a higher level and that he wanted someone with more experience. I accepted, he went on interviewing. After a few weeks he comes back to me and offers me the position after being disappointed with the other candidates.

72,"tl;dr: My closest friend has horrific hallucinations and I'm having trouble dealing emotionally. 

This post has been almost a year in the making. I'm a senior in high school; I'm going to graduate in less than three months. I met a freshman in summer school about nine months ago. He was really shy and didn't like talking much, but I was lonely and wanted to make a friend. I started sitting next to him during lunch on a daily basis. We would sketch together during break times and soon began to converse about our characters, writings, and eventually ourselves.

Never have I felt closer to someone before. Something just clicked, I suppose, and I started looking at this kid like I would a brother. He feels like more of a family member than anyone else I've known in my entire life, and it's come complete with the over-empathetic protective instinct that makes me go into ""who hurt you"" mode whenever I notice his tells that indicate something is wrong.

Here's the problem: I can't protect him from something that exists inside of his head. He has a pedophilic hallucination that consistently rapes him when he tries to go to sleep at night, tries to strangle him and inflict other sadistic forms of torture on him when it gets upset (sometimes in public), and threatens to possess my friend and force him to hurt his family if he tries to go for help. He has a gentler hallucination, too, but it can't protect him from the violent one. These hallucinations are with him 24/7, and have been with him for almost a decade. With that said, he also has episodes sometimes where he feels needles being stabbed into his back or freezing rain pouring on him or sees mouths opening up all over people's bodies.

I'm almost at a breaking point myself. He showed me a [song a month or two ago](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl5dSngcMEY) that is disturbingly reminiscent of what he experiences on a daily basis, and now every time that it gets stuck in my head I break down and cry. I've gone to the school's therapy department, I've spent hours talking to him about treatments and trying to convince him that he can work to manage his mental illness. He'll believe me for a while, only to have his mental torturer beat him until all progress is erased. 

Cutting off the friendship is out of the question. This is the one of the sweetest people I have met in my life, and I can't begin to process why lady luck decided to shit all over the inside of his brain case. I have mental illnesses too (though not as hindering) and am both on medicine and in therapy. I know that I need to take care of myself. Somehow, though, everything just seems to pale in comparison to what this kid is going through. I don't know how to cope, and I don't think my therapist knows how to help me cope either. I just am terrified for what happens when I have to graduate and leave my friend to the wolves. Kids are cruel, especially when someone is as different as he is.

I want to fix everything but I can't. And that thought makes me feel ill daily. Any advice would be appreciated.

I used to get a lot of attention from guys, but it never really phased me. In fact I chose to attend an all-girls highschool. I didn't talk to many guys outside my close friend group outside of school, and I never craved their attention the way all the other girls at hs did. Now I'm in college and I've realized that it's because the guys I'm receiving attention from just aren't guys I'm into. I started to wonder if it's my personality/lifestyle/whatever that's making me only attractive to weirdos. They're not weirdos because I'm not attracted to them, either. Multiple sources can confirm.

On the flip side, I've found myself craving attention from guys that aren't necessarily ugly/weird/socially inept, but just aren't my type AT ALL and I could say with 98% certainty would never date or whatever. How desperate have I become, to crave attention from people that I'm not even attracted to, and would want nothing with? I feel pathetic.

I asked a few close friends, relatives i got positive review.I have worked in the industry for 2+ years and knew they lack this service which would change the whole dynamics of this industry. I know the industry somewhat but the idea needs an app, which will be extremely crucial for the business to succeed. The problem is that I do not know the first thing about programming and making apps. I do know the industry in which the app will be used and there isn't any similar app available in my country yet. Similar app based services started in USA last year and its only a matter of time they enter my country. I am learning about the market, working out the potential problems that we may face,basically getting ready to start this. I want opinions as to how should I proceed for the app development and maintenance.(The app has to be 1 step above perfect and should be managed/innovated as the need arises,without it being at top notch level, the business will fail)

I am thinking two options right now:

1: Get a tech company to make it for me and pay them more to transfer the rights to me after say 1 year or so.(normally tech companies make a software/app and they own it and if we want to use it then they license it for certain fee) I will also pay them the service fee for maintenance meantime. then i will hire a CTO and a tech team who will be responsible for the app and all tech related stuff.

2: Hire a tech team at the very start and they will develop the app. That team and their head, the CTO will manage the tech aspect of the business, me and my team will do the rest. the drawback for this option is that I won't be able to judge the development and its quality sinch i am not a tech guy. 

Please, all opinions are appreciated an ask away for any more info that you may need.

All that and I absolutely love it there, and have even been offered a spot on their soccer team, which is something I've always dreamed of.

*Here's the catch:* With all the scholarship money I got to School A, I would (most likely) have to take out 50k-70k in loans. And that is considering the fact that I was offered their highest merit scholarship. Unfortunately, their soccer program is d3 which means it cannot help with tuition.

Now, **School B**, is also a great school. Top 100 in the nation, beautiful school, etc. etc. Really would be happy going there too. Problem is, it is nothing special in film &amp; writing (what I want to study). It is near the film industry geographically, but really doesn't specialize in that. In what I want to do, the degree would not carry nearly the same weight as School A. The social aspect seems awesome, but I also probably couldn't play soccer there. The coach is mildly interested in bringing me on my sophomore year there, but it is a big IF.

*Thing is*, they offered me a full ride academic scholarship. My college fund was left to me by dead relatives, so anything I don't use is mine to keep... meaning if I went to School B, I could be walking out with 50k(ish), instead of that far in debt.

I know, I know... this is a good problem to have. It is just really tough! Any advice towards my decision would be greatly appreciated.

**TL;DR:**

**School A is a better degree but would put me $50k(ish) in debt. School B is not as good a degree but I would walk out with $50k(ish).**

*PS: School A = Chapman University, School B = University of San Diego. I don't know if this will help or not.*

80,"So Im 21 years old meeting a friend of mine who I last hung out with in high school 5 years ago. 

I moved to a new city, but after 2 years we meet again in the same university, only once... She then moved to a new city in 3rd year...

Now Im in that city for 4 months. We are meeting for lunch and I really like her, like she was my first crush and I feel a unspoken connection type of feeling and I really want something to happen between us. 

The lunch meet is not a date, we texted and arranged to meet up becuase hey we are two people in a new city away from home that haven't meet up since high school.

84,"Im just going to cut straight to the point. My problems started freshmen year. I was a lonely kid like I never dated anyone no girls ever liked me I was chubby bad hair cut short Asian kid. I never really liked anyone. I didn't have any friends I was just lonely. The beginning of my freshmen year I managed to befriend a couple of nerdy friends who used to go to my elementary school. they were close with a lot of the girls because they were funny chill dudes. Eventually I met this cute nerdy innocent girl. I fell in love with her. Her innocence and soft voice made me fall for her. I believed that she was the one. I would talk to her walk with her home because we lived close. I remember she forgot her ID and couldn't get lunch so i gave her mine. Id go out my way to help her. Then it happend my friends forced me to ask her out and I said the most cringey shit ever. This was the first girl I ever asked and I never really had any friends that were girls so I would be really nervous around them. I told her They want me to ask u to be my girlfriend. her face was so shocked and scared and she backed away and went home. My heart was racing and i was scared but optimistic. The next day I saw her and she looked at me really really scared and I apologized for the day before. Then my friends made me ask her again. This time I asked her more properly, I couldn't look her in the eyes because I was so scared. I said Hey I really like you I think your really pretty and i would like you to be my girlfriend. She looked really scared she said she would let me know by the end of the day. The end of the day came and she said I think ur a really nice guy im sorry I cant look you in the eyes right now but I think we are better off as friends and she hugged me tight and said im really sorry we will be the best of friends. I got friendzoned hard. At first I thought maybe it was my personality. Was I too nice? thats what I thought or maybe it was my apperance. So i changed. dressing differently, I changed my hair and lost weight. I was told that I had a glow up and that i was cute. This made me feel good but i still wanted her. She ended up dating a nerdy dude and that hurt my ego. She eventually had a glow up of her own she started wearing make up and became an abg. By around this time I was a senior and I was going to parties smoking weed and drinking. I would do stupid shit I was a virgin at everything. Still no first kiss, no girl no nothing. I remeber my friends throwing parties and she would be invited and I would go extra hard on the drinks because I wanted her to see what she made me into and how i wanted her to look at me in shock. I remember her telling me about who she liked and it would hurt me. I remember thinking about asking her out agian senior year but I never muster up the courage. She fell for another nerdy dude and it hurt me a lot at the same time I was happy she was happy but it would hurt when i saw them at a dance and they were alone dancing with each other.  It sounds pathetic, but I was saving myself for her. The thought of her losing her v to him hurts me alot. her post about how great he is hurts me everytime. I tried to forget her but it still hurts. Its so pathetic. Fast foward to a few weeks ago I tried ectasy for the first time and i felt so happy and so good I lost my first kiss toa rave girl and after I felt so guilty. I was able to dance and kiss girls but when i looked around at all my friends with there girl friends I suddenly felt really lonely and realized I dont want meaningless shit I want someone to love and someone to love me. I felt so guilty about my kiss. Im sorry i just wanted to vent here :p. I just dont feel like im worth anything and that im just not good enough for anyone",10Mar2018,0

97,"There's going to be some profane/non-PC language in this post. Please do not make it the focus of your comment. 

Right now I'm 16 and a junior at a large high school, and frankly I'm a loser. I don't know where to start, so I'll start with the physical aspects of myself that I believe impede my social abilities. 

I cannot keep my eyes or hands still. I'm constantly looking everywhere and also blinking, making it hard to maintain eye contact. I'm constantly fidgeting with my hands, especially in social situations. My voice just sounds *weird*, it's not because it's unusually low/high pitched, it just sounds kinda weird. I talk very fast and often am asked to repeat myself. And then I have a slight stutter which is only present at some times (with no correlation to stress/anxiety or social situations) and with certain syllables. But worst of all, I talk slow at the same time as talking fast. Like bursts of speech, my speech style kinda reminds me of a three-round burst rifle firing. I've been described as ""physically neurotic"" and ""stiff"", and am unable to give a handshake without it being awkward. My school counselor (who's a dick) even made a rude comment predicting I have ADHD. 

Now on to my ethical issues. I have a huge procrastination problem, and I'm straight up lazy, but also smart. And I'm sure you've heard that line a hundred times on Reddit, but with me it's actually true. I'm not trying to humblebrag and hate gloating but I'm objectively very intelligent. My procrastination is so bad that if I *don't* procrastinate then people will say shit like ""Even /u/DiscombobulatedAd4 did the assignment."" I'm the reference point for the absolute lowest standard among my peers. And I cheat. Even though my friends (acquaintances really, but I'll get to that later) cheat, I'm always the most savage cheater. I'm considered the lowest ethical point and because of that people don't respect me. 

Now onto friends and how I fail at relationships. I have four real friends, and I see three of them only about every 2-3 months. But let's take a step back to when I was 3 years old and met two guys. Let's call one R and the other K. R is pretty much who I am, while K is pretty much who I want to be. So fast forward to 7th grade. R is my close friend, along with three other very close friends. K distanced himself from me and R, and always had a bit of a superiority complex. This is when I got into iFunny memes and competitive math. I never really had an identity before 7th grade, I was just a smart kid, and then iFunny + math became my identity. My mindset was just ""Nothing is serious, life is a meme and I'm here to laugh"" and still kinda is. I was already stunted socially as I had almost no social contact with girls (didn't really feel comfortable outside of my group) and saw laughing at offensive (n word, holocaust) memes as the only way to bond with friends. 

And then high school came. I was planning to ditch the idiotic lifestyle I had picked up in middle school and start fresh...but then both R and K got zone variances to come to the same school. I couldn't resist going on /r/dankmemes and iFunny, but even worse was that I started showing those memes to people minutes after meeting them. I traded respect for the joy of them laughing for a few seconds like a fucking retard. I then needed a PE credit and my dickhead counselor said I should join the football team. So it started off shitty. I was inserted into the atmosphere as an outsider while these guys had started training 6 months earlier. First day of football practice they call the sports nurse because I almost collapsed after running 1.5 miles. Every day of practice (every weekday) was shit because I was treated poorly and like the runt of the litter. I became respected in less than a second after someone asked what math class I was taking at the time. It became a kind of good time as I was regarded as the resident nerd, despite me still acting autistic every practice and never interacting with any of those guys again. I'm getting off-topic. So enter junior year (current year) and let me explain the status quo. R is a HUGE loser. I'm a loser, and he's like a double loser. He's very unhygienic, he doesn't wash his face whatsoever, has a strange smell, comes to school every day in a T shirt + sweatpants, and doesn't even have a learner's permit to drive (at 17). He may have flaws but I love him. We just play clash royale and browse reddit every day in class then go home and play PC games. K is a different story. K has a group of friends (who I know but they decide not to be friends with me) and is a dick to me. Not a dick in general, just a dick to me. For example earlier today K and his friends were walking to a door that only opens from the inside that I was waiting outside of. K said ""You know what, let's go to the other one"" and then I said hi as he walked through and he ignored it. I also was not invited to his birthday. We're just forced by our parents to be friends because we have known each other for 13 years. He goes out with his friends while I rarely do. R is too much of an autist (sorry if you're reading this fam I'm just being honest) to want to go out anywhere (for example getting food after school) and neither of us have transportation. I'm just stuck at home beating my dick and playing video games while K has a normal functioning life and R won't get off /r9k/. I've thought about cutting R out of my life because he's dragging me down but I can't. Sometimes we rely on each other's moms for carpooling, and he's the only friend that I've left the country with, and it wouldn't be good to dump my one friend for a potential friendship with someone else. Girls is where this hits the hardest. I have no female friends, and don't think I will get a girlfriend soon. A while ago I used to browse and contribute in /r/TheRedPill and /r/incels, which probably fucked me up even more. 

Respect. Something I have not earned. People ask others questions and give me commands, and I'm too much of a pussy to tell peers to fuck off. When people see I'm physically (through my retarded actions and mannerisms) less reliable, mentally less reliable, and ethically less reliable, they lose respect for me. Teachers lose respect for me when I don't do assignments when they know I don't struggle. Even people 2 years younger than me are losing respect for me. I can't help but browse offensive memes (keeping them to myself of course) and I laugh very, very easily, which causes others to lose respect for me. I tell cheap jokes all the time, even at the expense of the people I'm telling them to in order to get a cheap laugh. Even about serious subjects like suicide and car accidents. 

The worst part is feeling like I can't change anything. There's a lingering feeling that I know my life will end in suicide (no need to go all SW). I just want to know how to shape this mess into something better. Right now my plan is to lay low and suffer until I go to college and start fresh. But tonight I decided that I want to change who I am before going into my senior year of high school. What can I do in 6 months to get respect, a gf, and a life going into school in September?

(Senior in high school) Recently my life feels like it's falling apart. My soccer coach hates me for some reason. He literally doesn't trust me whatsoever and it just pisses me off. I have to fight and bust my ass to regain my starting spot, and the second I make one mistake I don't start for the next couple games.  Along with that I got capped from the university I was hoping to get into and knew I had the credentials necessary to get into.

In general I feel like I am being fucked. I'm not starting when I really should be and deserve to be. I also didn't get into the college I should've gotten into. I have no motivation in school anymore, my parents expect me to maintain my grades even though they are irrelevant at this point.

104,"Okay, so here's some background:
My mum got married to this asshole named Ryan. I disliked him since I first met him but kept my mouth shut, wanting her to be happy.
They fought all the time, screaming etc, and he was an aggressive, controlling &amp; abusive piece of shit who smoked pot all day. He's also fucking stupid, he convinced himself that his son (who he had in his past marriage) isn't his, and also that the Earth is flat. He genuinely believes this. Mum kinda just laughs it off, saying 'Well, he's a bit eccentric.' More like batshit insane.

Anyways, fast forward to now. They eventually broke up &amp; he moved out, but now they're sort of friends (cause he quit smoking pot, making mum think he's alright now) and I just loathe him. He constantly tried to convince my mum to tell me to like him again, often having fights with her and throwing tantrums that I lol'd at (like really, sorry to hurt ur ego buddy but does it really matter if a 15 year old girl likes you or not?)

Since then, he's constantly making passive aggressive and sarcastic comments, and just being an overall dickhead. I usually ignore him, but it's stopped working. 

For example, one time I didn't open the door for him (mum was sleeping &amp; she didn't even know he was coming over, so I woke her up instead of letting him into the house) and after he was let in he ran down the hallway after me and started screaming in my face, saying shit like ""We used to have a good relationship and you're ruining it!"", ""You're using the past and making me wrong!"" and ""If you're gonna be passive aggressive, I'll be aggressive!""
It scared me tbh and he only stopped when my mum begged him to.

Since then nothing like that has happened but today this drove me to the edge. I'm so angry rn.
I walk my dog at like 8pm, because I love night time walks and my dog doesn't have to interact with other dogs and can just freely sniff around &amp; run and play (she's not too friendly with other dogs, they make her nervous).
I also live in Australia and it's really hot lately, so even at like 7pm it's about 31 celsius.

Ryan took it upon himself to walk inside the house uninvited, tell me ""I'm walking Willow for a *daytime* walk. You can't walk her at night, it's a bit selfish don't you think? *I'm* doing this for *her*."" and then he proceeded to take MY fucking dog and leave. WTF?!

This has been the last straw for me and I'm fucking done putting up with him. No matter what he does or says my mum forgives him, she's so delusioned with the idea of him quitting pot and being fine now. She said to keep ignoring him but I just can't.

What can I possibly say or do to make each day less anxiety, stress and anger filled? How can I make each room in my house other than my bedroom feel less like a trap? Bc he's over basically every day, since he moved one street away.

What do I do?!?!

105,"First off, I want to say that over the years, I have been diagnosed with Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia, ADD, Depression, Anxiety, and Asperger's Syndrome (However I think the diagnosis with Asperger's was misdiagnosed). My therapist has also said to me that she is suspicious that I have PTSD. Ever since I was child growing up, I have always felt that there has been something wrong with me. I would observe other people my age (and still do to this day) and see how their behavior, freedom, and appearance would be different than mine. I always felt like the person that would finish last. For example, a good chunk of people my age have moved out, got married, have jobs, and so on while I still live with my parents, haven't got my degree yet, can't hold a job (I am 23), still rely on my parents driving me places and can’t be left alone from my parents in public. Growing up, I would feel very hypersensitive with all my 5 senses. For example, some people can't feel an ant crawling on their skin while with me, I can feel every tiny little leg perform movement on my skin. I also remember growing up that I would have extreme anger, anxiety, and depression. I remember how if a Lego piece didn't fit on the model that I was building, that toy would turn into missile flying across the room and explode into a million Lego pieces. I also remember that I would start crying from things that most children wouldn't find upsetting such as sad sounding music. I also remember that I would have severe panic attacks at just the thought of any sort of life threatening health condition that might occur (and still do to this day). I have also had a few head injuries growing up from running out of the bath tub at age 2 and slipping, having a shelf one time fall on top of my head, and running under playground equipment while not ducking down enough resulting in splitting my head. Surprisingly none of the doctors think none of the injuries have caused any set backs but of course I have never received an MRI brain scan to confirm their conclusions. My parents believe the reason I feel so shitty is because of the vaccines I received when I was younger. I'm not sure if that is the case but I feel that there is a possibility. I have also had a lot of traumatic experiences growing up from medical emergencies with me to bullying. Before my life really turned into a hell hole, It was the beginning of 2011 and I actually felt my life was going in the right direction. I had a super cute girlfriend, I was learning to drive, and had lots of great friends. I practically felt almost invincible. However, I did have the occasional panic attack which I attribute to both consuming a lot of caffeine back then and past trauma. I would sometimes have a coffee and a large water glass full of Dr. Pepper sometimes in the same day. I remember occasionally I would feel super tense but I thought it was normal. After all I was told when you are a teenager, you body changes and sometimes you might feel funny. I remember around February or March in 2011, that was when my life took a big hit. I remember had 3 really severe panic attacks on 3 different days. Once at home, at a Wal-Mart, and at my high school's basketball game. I remember after those 3 days I can say that was when I really began to have severe agoraphobia. I felt like I became afraid of everything. Being taxis, trains, elevators, big stores, being surrounded by crowds, etc. It also got so bad that the summer of 2011, I spent it inside of my home because I was so terrified to leave because every time I went out, I would get a really bad panic attack. Since then, I have received adjustments in medication, cognitive behavioral therapy and so on. I also got on and off episodes of really severe depersonalization. I had depersonalization sometimes growing up but back in 2011, I had it almost everyday. Due to how bad my agoraphobia was in 2011, I had to give up driving and wouldn't get my license until the end of 2014 (at age 20). Even though I now have my license, I terrified to even drive outside of my neighborhood and feel that my mind is too impulsive to drive safely. In 2012, I actually developed heart palpitations from the constant anxiety that I would have everyday. Thankfully my doctors said nothing was wrong, told me to take magnesium supplements, and the palpitations went away. I graduated high school in 2013 and started college but never finished. I dropped out of college in March 2015 (but went back in August 2016). I only took classes online because I was so terrified being on campus. Back then and now in college I would barely make C’s. I would try every thing from tutoring to Youtube videos to help me understand my classes and nothing worked. The only reason I haven’t ended up on academic probation is that I cheated every single class I took so I could pass. Some classes I can’t even take (such as pre algebra) because there aren’t any good websites online to help me cheat. Unfortunately I wouldn't get my first job until the end of 2015. Surprisingly after I got my first job, my anxiety started show some improvement. I was able to drive from home to my job (my job was a 3 minute drive) and I was able to be left alone places without my parents being close by. However in the beginning of 2016, I had a really severe panic attack on night driving home and almost got into a car crash at night (the person’s bumper was only 2 inches away from my passenger door!). Shortly after, someone got really sick at my job and the paramedics came while  my verbally abusive store manager and a customer were both yelling at me for not working well during an excessively long line. Combined with the anxiety from the store manager, line, customer, and the paramedics (since I’m terrified of paramedics) I had a really severe panic attack. After that, I would have a panic attack everyday at my job and was scared every time I was behind the wheel. It got so bad, my mom would have to sit outside of my job the whole time until my shifts were over and she would have to drive me everywhere again. My psychiatrist gave propranolol and unfortunately did not make even the slightest difference with my anxiety. My heart palpitations came back and I developed really bad indegestion. It got so bad, I skipped meals because every time I ate, my symptoms got worse. I also couldn’t speak because my stomach would hurt so much. I also got constipation everyday. My parents told me I had to go to the doctor. because it was so bad. My doctor pretty much said it was due to work related stress and gave me famotidine. After a few days of taking the medication and not working, my symptoms went away. Once I went back to my job, all my symptoms came back in an instant. It was like I never took the medication! I remember one day, I had such a bad panic attack at my job, I felt some sort of rush shoot up my spine and then my heart felt funny, got tunnel vision and felt like I turned into the Incredible Hulk and Sonic The Hedgehog at the same time! It was scary! The final blow that made me quit my job was one day, I had such bad anxiety, my throat felt like it closed up for 5- 10 seconds. I couldn’t speak, or breath and my mouth would only let me make awkward movements. After I quit, my mom said to me how she was worried if I would be able to ever hold a job again. Once I quit in April 2017, my life since then and now felt like it has been during 2013 (after finishing high school) and 2014. Everyday I sit home by myself all day while my parents work. Every day feels the same. I only go for walks in the neighborhood when my parents are away when I leave the house since I too scared too leave the neighborhood without my parents. Thankfully I can go to stores and different places but my parents coming with me is a requirement. Now in 2018, I can say that my agoraphobia isn't as bad as it was 7 years ago. However, I feel that there is very little hope for me being able to live a normal life. I feel like someone with low functioning autism (not literally). They grow up having all these problems but when they're older (after receiving the right help of course) they have improved but will never be able take care for themselves, have a family, hold a job and so on. I had cognitive behavioral therapy from September 2011 to December 2013. I have stopped because it was making little to no change with my anxiety. I started take Somatic Experiencing therapy in January 2014 and still take it today and have also started Feldin Krais in October of 2014. All the different therapies treatments I have helped me to some degree but haven’t made any life impacting differences. All lot of people say that my biggest problem is that I have too many negative thoughts. Even though I do agree my thoughts are mostly negative. My issue goes much further than just thoughts. Everyone has negative thoughts at once everyday (at least that’s what I assume) and don’t go into really severe panic attacks out in public. My biggest issue in my opinion, is my body and mind’s sensitivity. I honestly don’t know how long I can continue living like this. I am getting older everyday while I’m watching everyone else my age pass me by in life while I just suffer with the same problems everyday. I feel like I have tried everything and nothing has worked. I really wish I could commit suicide but I’m also too scared to do that too. Every time I hear when a friend of mine moves out, gets engaged, etc. I just start to cry so much because I feel so far behind in life and feel like a gigantic loser. I’ve probably cried at least 2 times writing this. When friends want to do stuff with me, I always either invite them to my house or when they invite me some place, I make up an excuse not to go since I don’t want them to see my parents following me. I also haven't had a girlfriend for 7 years either. I also feel so intimidated around other girls now because I don't know how to get a girlfriend, what to say to them and I've been rejected a lot more times in life than have been accepted. I honestly believe that if someone were in my shoes, they would have committed suicide a long time ago. I don't know what needs to be done, but I can't continue to live life like this. My life it isn't a gift. It's a curse.",10Mar2018,2
107,"I really don't know if this is a good idea. She was my first real girl friend. I've dated a couple girls after but none of them have come close to  making me forget her. I don't think we're on bad terms right now. But honestly with her it's difficult to tell because she hates conflict so she bottles every thing up. I just miss her. I wish I could get over her just because we're in different life phases (she's still in high school and I'm recently graduated). I deleted her number a while ago and I asked her to block me bc when I blocked her I'd always unblock and talk to her. It's just easier when someones blocked to remove the temptation of going back. ""If you want to take the island you have to burn the ships"". She's unblocked me a couple times and we've caught up. Idk if I'm blocked rn. But assuming I'm not. And assuming I can get her back. Should I just keep trying to move on? Or bc I'm still crazy about this person and assuming I can get her to go on a date w me should I try to make it work? Even tho she's still in high school and I'm joining the military? I just don't see that working. I want her to enjoy the rest of highschool and not have to worry about the stress of a military relationship. So I guess I answered my own question. How do I let this person go? Would saying goodbye help? Is it just one of things you learn to live with? Am I going to be thirty years old with a wife and kid thinking about my highschool sweet heart? It's that kind of thinking that keeps me going back and forth. What should I do?",10Mar2018,2
108,"I'm 21, and for the last 10 years my life has been characterized by videogame and porn addiction. I overcame the videogames, now I will conquer porn.  

I don't really know how to interact with females. Never had a proper relationship. Never been able to orgasm with any of my previous sexual partners (had five). For many other personal reasons (insecurity, lack of life experience and social skills, mental illness, no car, no job, no close friends) I know I shouldn't bother to engage with dating, or a relationship, for a very long time. Possibly never. I also don't think casual sex is for me, even though I am attractive and could easily do that If i wanted to. But I want a meaningful relationship. But honestly, once any girl gets close enough to me to realise how pathetic I am in my current state, they would most probably leave me. I could provide great sex and emotional support and friendship, but to women, what am I without money and social status?

I still want to socialize and make friends though. But is it even possible to be just friends with girls, if they are attracted to me? I'm also currently abstaining from masturbation, so that'll maybe make me more horny/willing to have sex with anyone, i dunno.

There's 2 girls I've been talking with and I made plans to see both. I flaked on the first plan, I want to blame anxiety/withdrawal symptoms. The second, I might still see. I'm not sure. She is obviously attracted to me, but she doesn't know how much of a piece of shit I really am. Do I cancel on her? Or just go and tell her the truth, and hope she still wants to be friends?

Do I just say fuck it and keep improving myself and completely forget about girls? Or just try and maintain platonic female friendships despite my sexual nature?

I'm not close to any family members or friends, none of them really know me. And none of them would give good life advice or emotional support anyway. Terrible parenting led me to addictions, and now I'm left with so many inadequacies. I don't know how to make or keep friends, I can't focus on my studies, I keep procrastinating. No one to talk to. Cannot afford therapy. It's no wonder I want to give up on life so often. ",10Mar2018,4

They schedule me 6 days a week and every time it's the closing shift so I always stay until 12 am. I literally have no social life anymore because of it. At the job, I work VERY hard but i don't ever get recognized for it and the few times i might be resting from doing VERY hard work, i get caught off guard by a manager and they end up yelling at me. My sleep schedule is totally fucked because after work all i want to do is go on social media and shit because even if I do go to bed right at 12, i'll still get up at 12 and all i'm doing during the day is dreading the hour i have to get ready for work. So now i'm up until 5 in the morning because I don't feel the pressure of checking the time to see when I have to go to work. Nobody else at my job has the same schedule I have. I am the only one who they schedule the night shift for almost every day of the week. Chipotle is literally my fucking life and not in a good way. I don't even wear my own clothes that much anymore.

110,"TL;DR - Went on a date, she didn’t hang out with me the entire night. Even though I drove us to the concert, I left the downtown scene alone. Now, she’s mad. What’s next?

I’ve been casually dating this girl since Christmas. We never officially called each other any form of significant other; but we sleep together a lot and act like a couple. 
I’m a huge music fan and I took her to see a special concert. 
We didn’t spend a minute of time the entire night. We show up to the venue. The music is already playing. I walk to the front of the stage and enjoy myself. She drifts to the back and is on her phone.
Break between bands
My roommate, myself, and her are all drinking beers on the patio. She notices a lady alone, so she decides to say hello. I hear the music start up, so I walk in the other direction. 
Fast forward to the night ending. I am sitting at the bar alone drinking a beer. She comes up to me with her group of 5 friendly strangers. They want to get tacos, I deny the offer, due to my freshly topped off beer and my huge social anxiety. I prefer one on one hang outs and not groups, so naturally I just hang back like always.
I finish my beer and she is no where in sight. The bar is closing and it’s cold outside. I go to my car to grab my jacket I see her on the way to the parking lot. She screams at me from across the way. “Are you okay!?” 
My social anxiety and general dislike for being the center of attention answered swiftly and quickly. I am generally a pretty honest person. I told her I was okay and continued to walk to my car. 
Once warm with my heater on and jacket. I pull out my phone to tell her I’m leaving that I’ll call her an uber when she is ready.  Then I drive off to my apartment. 

45 minutes later I hear an angry knock on my door and she is pissed at me for leaving her downtown; even though, we came together. I feel like I damaged our relationship by leaving her downtown. I feel I didn’t do anything wrong. I was basically hanging out alone all night and wasn’t about to wait in the cold for her to be down ditching me with her stranger friends. 

I feel I just need to rant more than anything; but I don’t really know what to do from here on out. Do I text her tomorrow in the morning? Do I let her text me? We both seem generally displeased with the other. I don’t know what to expect next.",10Mar2018,2
111,"Hi, 
My boyfriend works for a very reputable corporate, he earns great money and it's the best working place in the his field, yet he's not happy and doesn't feel that his work is impactful and really wants to start his own business or work on something else that he cares about (he still doesn't have anything specific in mind). 
The problem is that he's very scared to leave his job, it's really a golden cage there. He's a very logical person and he keeps thinking about it and writing the pros and cons of every possible situation or outcome, he reads soooo many books about making these big changes and the fear of change, he's very aware of his fear and keeps trying either to think about it some more, ask for people's advice or write about it to break down the issue into smaller ones, but he's not able to make the move of just quitting. 
I really wanna help, he's being doing beating himself over this for almost a year and a half and I can feel him losing energy and motivation, and his fear is only increasing with time .. and I don't want him to be stuck in a job that he hates, but I don't know how to help him, we talk about it all the time and think about it together, of what are the options after he quits and what the worst case scenarios and how we can fix them, but that's all we do , just talk and think and never any actions. 
I don't wanna push him too hard coz I know it's a very difficult situation for him, and I worried if I push him and then we run into trouble (which we certainly will coz that's life) that he will blame me for this, but he really needs something drastic or otherwise he'll stay in this loop of fear and self loathing and not doing anything for a long time. 
What can I do to help?",10Mar2018,1
112,"This is so long I’m so sorry

I went out with a friend of mine tonight, the original plan was for us to meet at the place but she said I should go over to her house while she changes out of her work uniform and showers. I said no because my dinky ass car can’t drive that far so she decides to come get me herself. So take my car out of the equation. 

As soon as we pull off she says “wait how are you gonna get home” which of course no car=no ride=no shit asshole. She says she can take me home in the morning when she has to leave for work at 5 am which I’m cool with w/e. As soon as we get back to her house after going out she goes to sleep (along with the other 6 people in this house) but not before saying she doesn’t wanna have to wake up extra early to take me home. Her sister said she can take me home later in the afternoon. Even then everything’s cool. 

Here’s my problem: my sleep schedule is opposite of theirs so I’m gonna be awake until said sister takes me home. That’s about 12 ish hours. I know how to waste 12 hours dicking around on my phone, however we are in the middle of no where=no service, but hey they have WiFi! 

Turns out, this chick’s super Christian parents have everything blocked on the WiFi and I mean EVERYTHING. Every app and website pretty much the only ones that pass through the filter are the ones that are super circumstantial and you never actually need but you have them just in case. (And reddit which is the least tame of my apps but hey at least I can ask y’all)

Anyways I’m texting my friend to order me an uber from her phone, we’re using my card and everything she just has to order it. I write a note saying “sorry for leaving abruptly but I’m not dead” then, as I’m laying out the note on the blanket I folded, I remembered they have a screeching alarm system because they’re so worried their (mostly adult) kids are gonna sneak out. So I’m stuck here. 

My options as I see them are:

A.) sit here for 12 hours 
B.) wake up the older sister and ask her how to sneak out without setting off the alarm
C.) wake up the parents?? (I’m not doing that) 
D.) “fuck it”",10Mar2018,1
113,"So basically firstly I need to apologise for the incoming rant. Onto what has happened. I'm 15 years old and got to an all guys school. My friend introduces me to a girl and her friend. I don't often meet girls so it was fun and I ended up going out with one of them. Fast forward a couple of weeks we meet up again - now this is something that really annoyed me. She didn't tell her dad that she was meeting me, her dad somehow had my number and messaged me saying I had been deceitful to his family and that he wanted my parents email or he would contact my school.Now at this point I was worried, I gave both my dad's email and a fake one I made as I claimed he sometimes doesn't check one. My dad unfortunately read the email even though I didn't want him to in which the girl's father essentially said that me and the girl had taken part in inappropriate sexual messages and met without his permission. My dad got quite mad and replied essentially apologising after I begged him not to make a fuss. Fast forward a month or so and my dad gets another email in which the girls dad essentially says the same thing has happened with her keeping secrets and that he wants all contact to be stopped - not gonna lie at this point me and the girl liked each other quite a lot. None the less my dad replies that there won't be contact. A week or so later she messages me assuring me that her parents are fine and even after I say im not going to msg you after what your dad says she still says no do. We continued talking and met under the basis that she was allowed to meet me.
Suddenly, get another email in which her dad says continued contact has occurred without him knowing and that he would contact the school if it wasn't finally resolved. Yesterday, my teacher calls me in and tells me he needs to discuss a matter of cyberbullying, now he mentions the girl and questions me about what happened - I dont lie and tell him the truth not leaving out any detail. Turns out these details about meeting weren't the problem and what was the problem was me apparently saying something of a malicious nature on a snapchat story or group chat. What I did put on my story was a screenshot of a very small part of the email which said that he would contact my school. I essentially said ""what a fucking joke this guy thinks hes emailing my dad and can get the schools to do shit - this is the 4th email i've got from him since breaking up this girl wtf lol"". I have screenshots of essentially our whole conversation to prove that she started sexual talk and that we were never rude to each other on msgs. Is there any chance I get in trouble for ""cyberbullying"" in this?",10Mar2018,5

We used to get along really well and just have friendly discussions if we disagreed on something, but for the past few months or so most of our discussions just end up as massive arguments where I act like a massive tool and I don't realize it until later. In her case, she's never done anything wrong and I feel terrible that I treat her this way. There's no one else more important to me but I've become a real asshole to her lately.

A part of me feels that I need to separate myself from her because she doesn't deserve someone like that. I feel like I can't change the way I am, because I've been aware of how I treat her for awhile now but being aware hasn't fixed anything. It feels like the best thing to do for her is to leave.

she now made a thread and shes showing my full real name and surname, a picture of me and the screenshots to make me look horrible and dangerous. I am only 16 and i dont know what to do... im honestly terrified.

1) is there anything i can do?
2) is this gonna impact my real life if i cant do anything? Like, i heard that when you search for a job they go search for your social medias and if they see that thread it would literally ruin my life.

136,"Hello, I am a 18 year old male and I have been struggling with self destructive behaviour for the last 6-8 months also i am very sensitive person and i have depression and anxiety. I grew up in a town and moved to the city when I was 15. when I was 17 I reconnected with old friends from that town which I thought id never see again because they are quite rough around the edges and are not what I'm used to with my own family and friends in the city. Anyway I ended up seeing them every now and then and would have fun smoking weed and sometimes drinking (which I only do when I'm with these people). Eventually this behaviour started reoccurring on a weekly basis. So every weekend I'd travel around 2 hours on the bus and train back to this town just to smoke, drink and every time I'd wake up the next day not in my own bed and in this town I'd feel terrible and head home ASAP. After a few months of doing this I turned 18 and got introduced to the clubs. The last month or two I've been going back to the town and instead of staying at a friends and smoking/drinking at their house we'd go clubbing and take ecstasy. The next day I'd feel so depressed and just want to go home ASAP just like before but way worse because of the come down from the ecstasy. I just want to be able to stop myself from doing this and never go to that town again but Its almost as if I change who I am when I decide to go back there. I've tried lots of ways to stop myself from going there but nothing ever works. I cant keep doing this as I need to focus on studying, family and making new friends in the city that are a positive influence.

138,"I am currently deciding between UNC Charlotte and UNC Wilmington for computer science next year. Here are my pros and cons of each.
UNC Charlotte:
Pros:
-big city, lots of job opportunities. One of the best places for CS jobs in the state.
-I know people already there, have roommates set up to go there, and have easy ways to meet people.
-The computer science course is pretty good
-the dorms are all new and really good.
-great campus
Cons:
-a ton of crime right outside of campus
-ive been told that a good majority of professors either dont care or dont speak english.
-it is mainly a commuter school, so the campus is a dead town on the weekends (ive witnessed it)
-not at all seen as a prestigious school, and the graduation rate is pretty low.
UNC Wilmington:
Pros:
-a mile from the beach and there is always something to do
-good CS program
-warmer weather which i prefer
-beautiful campus
-i have relatives always at the beach
-seen as a more prestigious school
-more girls than boys (i am a boy lol)

Cons:
-i know absolutely no one else going there so i wouldnt have a roommate yet. my brother did random roommate when he went and he had to call cop on the kid
-going somewhere and knowing not a single person frightens me.
-not as many job opportunities, although i have an internship i can always go back to for summer in my home town
-dorms arent as nice or new
-no football team(not a big deal)

144,"Hi.

I've been working in this job for less than a year (about 10 months now), in which I've been promoted and chosen to take on some exclusive projects and the more demanding clients, which I'm proud of because I worked very hard.

Yesterday, my manager called me into his office and said there was a project being arranged in collaboration with the office in Washington and one in India and some others I don't remember and asked me if I was interested in taking part of it.

He knew basically nothing about the project, other than the fact it has something to do with developing some new technologies and it will require my full-time occupation on it during the 5 months it will last, it's likely there will be a trip to the US for me in the future (I don't care that much about this but I suppose it's nice) and there ""will be overtime"" (I'm used to overtime so it's not a huge deal for me). 

My questions to him were very standard.. what kind of things are we going to develop? Am I still going to be considered part of our department? Is the job in any way relevant to our what our team is/will be doing? Will I have the opportunity to work with our team and our clients while I'm doing this project? 

He basically told me he knew as little as I know.. our director apparently told him he had to chose 1 associate and the choice had to be done by Monday (this happened Friday) so I pretty much had to decide that same day. I said yes out of principle because I'd rather take a new opportunity than reject it but I don't know if this will be good for my career, in those 5 months I will miss a whole tax season which is the time of the year I learn the most in and I'm afraid I might even lose the opportunity of a promotion because of it (tax season performance is very important when trying to get a promotion). I'm also worried I might isolate myself from my team who I like very much since I'll be working alone if this project takes 100% of my occupation for 5 months, I'll still be sitting next to them but not working with them in any way...

What should I do? Should I tell my boss no? He might empathize with my situation (he's not an asshole) or should I pursue this but ask him to consider this for the next promotion (maybe not that bluntly)?

Any advice appreciated.",10Mar2018,1

Or if we work together , and we both have time for a smoke break she calls the shots regarding when we actually go. Or for example why did I take this bag for grocery shopping when I could have took another one and it would be more efficient. And she is very intense regarding this controlling issue because she feels like she is always right, and is doing things the right way.So hopefully you get what my problem is.

We are very honest to each other, and I talked to her about it, or when it didn't have any effect I told her to just fucking let it go and relax for a bit when situations like these occured.

147,"so a bit of information 
•I go to an all boy secondary school or high school 
•Im in transition year (4th year of school)
•(for anyone not familiar with irelands secondary school system) transition year or TY is the 4th year out of 6 at school and it is optional meaning you can jumo from 3rd year to 5th year. TY is the only year that is not apart of any courses so no exams. You do activities and character building and stuff like that no work.
•I am an average student in terms of work, my mum doesnt have the money to pay for any grinds for me and she isnt from ireland so she cant help me with homework so I did everything completely alone
•I got all B's and C's in my exams, I did higher level maths and everything else was higher level aswell apart from irish, french and music.
•im 15
•I do not have physical disabilities or mental disabilities (like autism etc)

So i was at school on friday and it was around 9:15 am when I was in class and the teacher who is kind of like the main teacher for my class told me ""So, you qualify to have an SNA (special needs assistant) with you for class, and she is comming to see you at 9:30""

so I sit there extremely confused and my classmate turned around and looked at me funny and said ""You need an SNA? you? out of all people?"" and I was beyond confused and a bit angry and I felt insulted because I do almost everything for myself because my family can't help me or pay for extra help. I'm even doing one full extra subject for my exams out of school because I need more points and more higher level subjects as well as a higher level language to do (Im doing Japanese by myself and I saved money for ages just to buy myself some books and materials for it.) And the school know this.

so 9:40AM comes and it is time to go to my next class and this SNA does not show up to meet me.

So I tell my friends about it and I get the exact same response every time: them looking back at me confused as hell. So after that I try to speak to schools caretaker because I talked to him last time something bad happened to me at a school thing and he helped me out greatly. I could not find him at all I looked for him after every class and even asked the teacher If i can miss 20 minutes of class to find him. So i didnt find him

so this happened on friday and if you live in ireland you know that fridays finish at 1:15PM (school) so I could let this go and wait till monday so I seen the teacher that told me about the SNA at the office at the end of the day and I asked him ""Why do I qualify for one? my grades are good and I don't feel I need one as well as the fact that i am in TY, no other person in TY has an SNA."" (No one has an SNA in TY because TY is a non work year, so all the people who HAD an SNA last year wont have one for TY but will regain the SNA next year)

So this is where things get weird.

His response was: ""I can't tell you that im not alowed"" then he stutters and changes his statement to ""actually I dont know"" then there was silence and then he puts his two thumbs up and AGGRESSIVELY smiles at me extremely hard almost as if it was him trying to convince me of something but it looked way to over the top for me to think he wanted to convince me and then he said ""Do you believe me?"" and I wanted to say Yes and just go home but I said ""Not really, I dont"" and then he started saying things like ""Well I dont know but the SNA felt bad that she didnt meet you yet"" etc... and he said ""she doesn't know who you are or what you look like"" etc in a wannabe convincing voice and it sounded as if he had something to hide from me. 

He memtioned somw government departments or something too and as I left he said ""Okay have a great weekend"" and as I walked like 3 steps I heard him let out this laugh and it was no suttle, it was like...

it was like a catoonic laugh of a villan, very artificial and not un-controlable, It sounded as if it was very concentrated and he didnt just let it out, It sounded as if he did it on purpose and it at that point i didnt know what was going on. I laughed a lot followed by no laughing and just worry and I just remembered thinking in the sun like ""My god this school is a major joke"".

I know this other guy at school who the school forced him into going to the schools councillors on a regular basis and it was not necessary but not my business. Anyways yes a while back I went on my playstation and I was in this party with MICs and I remember he told me about how upset he was at the school because apparently the teachers all talked about it in the staff room and then one or two teachers told some students and a class about it in a gossipy way and it made its way back to him and now students are chatting shit about him. 

So this shows me the school is not a confidential place and nothing is confidential there. I am angered and a bit insulted by the schools condescending behaviour towards me on friday and they would not let me know what qualifies me for an SNA and its my right to know about things like that. 

A common theory that a lot of my friends and family all share together is the fact that my old therapist (government run) started requesting appointments with me suddenly after years and I came away from one appointment upset at the horrible behaviour and questions I got from them and the unprofessional acts of them and I requested to not come back but it didnt happen so I told the therapist that the only issue in my life right now is that: Im very stressed and angry at the fact that this therapist thing isnt ending and its depressing because my life is like anyone elses, 

I have issues like anyone else but I can get on with it myself, Im not perfect but the therapist treats my non perfection as an issue.

I think the two are connected together, someone is behind this and most people have agreed with me. 
My mum is so suspicious of this whe thing and she wants to know who is behind this and why do I qualify for this SNA, not why I need it but why? / who is doing this.

Who can I talk to? What can I do? please anything is helpful thank you for reading.

He's also seems to be disillusioned with relationships and has this belief that women are all about your status (i.e those girls prefer guys with a better car/salary). He's quite maladapted socially, and he goes on about some conspiracy theories and some pretty naive ideas for hours, although I'm trying myself to be polite around him, it's hard and I understand why good girls may prefer to stay clear.

My ex now is dating a new girl after we broke up. They’ve been seeing each other since around September. He lied to me about sleeping with others while sleeping with me, so I didn’t use protection. 

He then broke into my apartment and went through my things and found proof I cheated on him apparently and told me to not talk to him for six months so we can let our feelings die down, so we can mature and work on ourselves (I have jealousy and anger issues), and in the meantime he said he is going to try to give this new girl a chance. He doesn’t see it working between he and her but he has never dated anyone else and he wants to see where this goes. 

My ex notoriously is a people pleaser to the point where he hurts others by trying to please others. He introduced this new girl to his family and then told me it was because she pressured him and his mom was pressuring him and he didn’t want to cause any issues. 

He said he doesn’t really love her but he likes her and that she was the prettiest girl who seemed really interested in him. He straight up told me he dislikes how she is lazy, unathletic, not super intelligent, unhealthy, messy, disorganized, and not motivated in life. They’ve been seeing each other for like six months. 

He then tells me to move on, yet keeps tabs on me through social media to make it seem like he still cares about me, takes my phone calls, refuses to block me and when I tell him I am done for good, he tells me to not be ridiculous, that we will talk again one day. But in the meantime he tells me to let go. And that he will try to make things work with this girl and that meeting his family meant nothing and that he probably sees it not working out but he isn’t really crazy about her.

152,I’m an overweight woman who rapidly gained weight a few years ago from medication and now I’m trying to lose the weight I gained plus extra that I always needed to lose. So far I’ve lost a little of it through diet change and decided that adding in exercise at this point would be a good idea.

163,"Okay quick backstory, when I was 16, my parents came into some money, they used some of that to let me go to a professional wrestling school(Think WWE/WWF if you will), I trained a bit, then eventually ""graduated"" and they started letting me perform on shows.

Since then, I haven't made it far in the business, I've clearly not made it into the big leagues, but if you don't follow professional wrestling, there are many different companies, of varying levels, some where people can make money and be huge stars, even without being in a massively known company like WWE(Formerly WWF), but there are also lots of places where you work in front of 20 people, make less than 10 bucks, and you do it either because you're starting out and trying to get exposure or because  this is as far as you've made it.

Now, over the years, due to be being awkward, shy, and not an outgoing person, as well as doing stupid things that were unintentional, most of the places I went, I felt that I ended up on people's bad sides or just not having that brotherhood that others had. Often times, I'd just sit by myself and wait until it was time to go and do my stuff.

This, coupled with bouts of depression, as well as admittedly, lack of motivation and drive, held me back and often times I'd just not care to go for month or in extreme cases, years on end. But I'd get that itch every so often to go back and try again.

Especially as I matured as a person and figured out things, like what kind of character I wanted to be, where I would draw my inspiration, and more, if that makes sense. It's like it all clicked, the down side was that I am nearly 30 and don't know if it's worth it.

I went a few weeks back, got back in the ring, but as you can imagine, two years off without any sort of training to get back into the swing of things, it was awkward and didn't go well. It was muscle memory of sorts to do basic stuff, but other things felt poor on my end.

Not to mention, sitting in the locker room, I felt that when I arrived, I was thrown some hurtful comments and picked on a bit and then after that, was ignored and I just felt alone and ostracized again. After my match, I changed and spent the next like hour and a half or so, walking around the flea market they ran the show in, just trying to process everything.

I go to these shows with my family, they've always been supportive, so they asked me if I was going today and I just don't know. I don't know if I care enough anymore. If the fantasy of being out there and having it all go perfectly as it does in my head is worth the effort of spending the next year just to get to that point when I've had negative experiences and overall just haven't felt that passion for a long time.

I've tried to explain this to people, but it just seems to go over their heads. I think I'll always have that little bit of desire to do this and that what if mentality, but I don't know if it's the reasonable thing to do anymore.

I dunno, I just need some input I guess. Thanks in advance.",10Mar2018,4

I’ve tried everything I can think of to just get him out of the house and for some fresh air, but nothing is working. 

He’s going to see a doctor next week to discuss going on the sick for a little while, I’m hoping while he’s there she might suggest some coping mechanisms for him, but I’m just at my wits end. I’m giving him all the love and support I can, I’ve taken time off to be with him and tried to keep his mind occupied but I can only do so much with him refusing to leave the house. 

It’s so awful watching someone you love so heartbroken, but what can I do to try and get him through? Has anyone else had a similar experience?

How would I go about that conversation? I dread saying it but I really have to. I don’t know if they’d think I’m confused and don’t know what those words mean, but I’ve taken many many online quizzes and they’ve all said depression and anxiety. Im not only going off of the internet though, I feel many symptoms that depression and anxiety cause, and I’ve found myself over at /r/suicidewatch In the past, but I go to my IRL friends now. My life is always a battleground right now and I just want help for it. I just don’t know how to get it. I think the reason I fear it is because I’m not out to my homophobic dad and only now is my mom getting better because I came out to her. I feel like I don’t trust her, and that’s going to have to be built back up.

I did not have to work overnight last night, but of course couldn't get to sleep due to having stayed up the previous two nights, all night.

The other three girls work full-time (5 shifts/week). That leaves me with three shifts scheduled, plus two more shifts that I can cover without going into overtime. 

I've worked 5 shifts this week. This is usually fine, but I'm EXHAUSTED from working overnight shifts and now I'm having to work a 16 hour day. I told my boss about my exhaustion (I have to drive the patients) and he said ""Oh man, I'm sorry"" but then goes up to my husband (who also works for my company) and says that everyone else does it (overnights then double on weekend).

174,"About 2 years ago I moved from the Netherlands to the Czech Republic. When I moved here I was self-employed and dropped out of university to move to the Czech Republic. I made quite a lot of money on the internet every month and everything was going well for about a year and half.

However, recently my work has not been going well at all. I went from making $10k a month to &lt;$1k a month because of a Google update. I've been trying to fix it but my efforts haven't been very successful and it's been causing me a lot of stress.

On top of that the dollar has gone done around 20% in a single year. When I moved here I would get almost 26 Czech Crowns for every dollar but at the moment I only get around 20.5. Since I have all my savings in dollars and my income is in dollars my costs have increased by ~20% while my income has fallen by ~90%.

I'm considering moving back to the Netherlands to go back to university but there's one thing holding me back, my girlfriend lives here.

I met her a few months after I moved to the Czech Republic and our relationship has been great. I love her a lot and the only reason I'm considering staying here is because of her. I don't want to stay here, I want to go home to the Netherlands. I miss my family in the Netherlands and life there in general.

I don't want to stay here, but I also don't want to lose her. I miss my parents and my country but I'm worried I might regret it if I leave and end the relationship with her.

We've looked into options for her to come to the Netherlands with me but she's a student here and would have to finish her bachelor's degree here first. Once she finishes her bachelor's here she could do a master's in the Netherlands. However, if she would do a master's degree in the Netherlands it would cost 15.000 euros just in tuition fees because she's not from the EU, she's from Russia. On top of that she would have her costs of living so it's not really a feasible option. She doesn't have that kind of money and if she would do her master's program in the Czech Republic it would be completely free.

We also looked at getting her a visa where we would live together in the Netherlands but you need a specific income to qualify for that and my income is not high enough anymore to qualify for it. In addition this income needs to be stable which needs to be proven by showing that you've had sufficient income for 1.5 years if you're self employed. I would also feel very pressured to stay in the relationship if that even was a possibility because I would feel awful ending the relationship and having her be sent home.

I have also considered staying here and go to university here, I have enough money saved up to pay for it. But the only reason I would do that is to stay with her. If the relationship ends I would be stuck here until I finish my degree which would be at least 3-4 years.

Also if she fails her university her visa will not be extended and she would have to go back to Russia. She already failed a year once and now she's doing 2 years at once, which is going well for the moment, but it's a very big workload. If she won't make it she will have to go back and I will be here alone.

I don't want to lose my girlfriend but I also don't want to stay here. Especially since she could have to move back home or the relationship could end and I would be stuck here alone. I have no friends or any other contacts here, it's just her keeping me here.

Thanks for reading. I appreciate it a lot and if you have any insight I'd love to hear it. I'm just lost at what to do.

Allow me to elaborate. I have two people in my life I'm forced to deal with. They have fragile egos that didn't properly develop.

This is why they're not open to conflicting viewpoints nor debates. Their ego feels threatened. Debates themselves are a foreign concept to them just like how sharing is a foreign concept to a 3 year old. One of them looks for false things to try to keep their false sense of reality and themselves from shattering.

Before our schedules were like this I used to see her once a week. This isn't the only reason though, despite being 24 years old, Katie's parents treat her like a teen.

I wish I had more people like him in my life. Dan has a busy schedule and when things get bad he'll cut himself off temporarily. I need more people like him in my life.

My second friend we'll call James. I've known James since high school, but he doesn't live close like he used to. He's a rather far drive away now so I don't see him all that often. My parents berate me when I hang out with him, they think he's a bad influence. There is a bit of truth to that, but he's a real friend too. I remember one night I Really wanted to commit suicide and he stayed up all night walked over to my house just to help me. only a real friend does that in my eyes. I hardly seem him though because of how far he lives.

My last friend we'll call Brian, although he's not much of a friend, more of acquaitance. We used to be co workers and became friends due to mutual interest in a certain online game, but he eventually quit that game and really we haven't been much of friends.

203,"Hi all.

Basically my only friendship is under some serious strain and its becoming increasingly hard to keep it up, I've known him for about 6 years now and he's been my only friend but recently he's become almost unbearable to talk to at points.

1) He's gotten into the habit of plainly calling himself ""More intelligent"" and ""Well read"" than ""Almost everyone else"" despite having literally zero higher education, which just results in him reading wiki articles or taking talking points from random youtube personalities and then declaring himself a genius for having understood them, this becomes increasingly annoying since he will happily try to educate me on things I have a degree in or tell me how my job is done.

2) He's taken to acting like some aloof psychopath pretending like he only makes friends to ""Hurt them"" or ""Manipulate them"" which is incorrect since I know he enjoys keeping active in multiple friendship groups and has a large group of close friends, He started this act after I once joked that he was ""Too normal to be my friend anymore"" and since then he seems to be determined to argue that his many, MANY friends are just there to necessitate some evil plans he has been working on, I kind of get the impression that he's annoyed that I'm far more of a social recluse and as such I guess he feels like his complaints about social situations are somewhat negated by me, who will just say I either have no idea about such things or that I don't care about such things.

3) He's started doing these long stupid monologues about things that he thinks are side splittingly hilarious but in reality they just reek of desperation and trying too hard to be edgy and shocking, when we chat over mic I tend to just mute him for a minute or two when he starts now. All his humour recently has basically turned into shock value nonsense or just tiresome long winded ramblings which he thinks are amazing works of improvised comedy but are really just a tirade of poorly managed sentences and no payoff.

4) He seems to be in some kind of one-sided competition with me about who is the most socially retarded or introverted. He'll spend a whole day exclaiming how he hates hanging around people and how no one can keep him interested and he's just like me but then he'll go visit friends, visit his girlfriend or whatever then claim that all that is again part of some evil master plan.

I went to Portland state university and have a degree in supply chain (graduated 2 years ago). I am looking at 2 programs: the global masters in supply chain from Portland state and a masters in supply chain from university of Washington. Both are 95% online and similar in price. 

My question(s):

Does the UW name  carry more weight in the eyes of employers? I think it likely does but if I want to work in Portland (which I do) my network will be likely stronger. 

Is it silly to get a masters in the same field as my undergrad? Specialization v generalization. I remember reading an article a few years ago about the lack of specialization in the workforce. I’ve never known what I’ve wanted to do and specializing in supply chain makes me somewhat nervous (although nearly all business sectors utilize it) as I’m a bit of a commit-phobe. 

It may be trivial but I think the ‘global’ part of the PSU degree would have the advantage over the UW program on paper.

What does your hiring experience / candidate reviewing tell you? I appreciate your perspective. Let me know if I can elaborate on anything.

Thanks.

212,"Hey, I'm (14F) so sick of living in a house in constant mess. It's not hoarder level of messy, but to the point where it's always embarrassing to invite friends over. Papers everywhere, there's not a completely clean table in the house, lots of stuff held onto ""just-in-case"". The fridges are always completely stuffed with food that's 70% of the time not eaten at all. It starts to rot and nothing is done about it. 

First world problems, I'm very aware. I'm very blessed to have all the luxuries of living in a first world country in an upper middle-class family, this problem has just been an issue for years. Even my older brother (he's going to be 20 soon) has been complaining about it sine he was my age. 

My parents work from home, so they don't ever have time to really just focus on cleaning. And by the end of the day, they're so tired they just lay down or sit in front of the T.V. I've voiced how upset the condition of the house makes me, I'm always shrugged off though. 

I keep my room in spotless condition, I deep clean it every Sunday. I'd clean the other rooms, except I'm not allowed to. The majority of the mess is just straight up stuff of my parent's that they haven't dealt with (donated, thrown away, put away, etc). They get very angry when I try to make things neater and insist that they'd get to it - which rarely happened. In the cases they do, a majority of stuff is things we could easily go without. I love minimalism, though of course I'll have to compromise.

I don't know what to do, any advice is appreciated!

I'm 26 years old man and don't want to get married, I don't feel that someday I'll fall in love. 

I think some fears are the real reasons behind this situation.

First of all, I work but I'm not very well paid, I don't want found a family and make it live under poor economical condition.

I fear being cheated by the partner that I choose. and I don't want to waste time with stupid problems that I have seen in many couple.

I fear having bad and evil children, that will destroy me with the get older.

In other words, except relationships on bed and some tenderness from wife ,I don't see the benefits of getting married.

214,Hello everyone! I follow my 12 year old niece on Snapchat. I’ve been noticing that the moment she turned twelve she’s been posting pictures looking very sensual and asking her friends if she thinks she’s hot and if they should message her. If they think so.We already have had the sex talk and I know it’s strange coming from her aunt but it’s because her mother isn’t in the picture and her father well let’s just say he wouldn’t give a shit on what’s going on with her . She post videos where she singing songs about “licking dick “ or some weird crap that have made me feel weird seeing a twelve year old do this. She deletes those videos right after I see them too .

216,"Hi all,

Forgive me as I am looking for advice on a small event in my life.

I am currently in my senior year of college, with a full four-year scholarship. I study finance and investments and have a straight-A GPA (4.00/4.00). Now, the reason I have good grades is because I neglect wasting time on social events (partying, going out with friends, etc) and spend time rather learning, reading, bettering myself. I have become overly focused on my grades and I have begun to hate myself.

I want to spend more time with my family, friends, and girlfriend, but I just can't bring myself to do it. I find myself overly focused on my grades, making sure I graduate with a 4.00. I don't know why, but I have attached my self-worth to my grades, and I can't bring myself to do anything else.

I do not have a philosophy for life. I do not know what leads a good life, or how to define ""eudaimonia"" for myself. I have fallen into a depression. It's hard to look in the mirror and accept myself for who I am because I still want to change at the same time. My nature is rooted in learning, studying, and perfectionism, and I know that this will not lead to the ""best"" life when death comes, but I find comfort that it will lead to perhaps a decent life.

Any advice on the following would really help:

1) what are some types of philosophies for life that I can look at? (Stoicism, for example is something a friend recommended) 2) How can I break the ideology that grades = self worth? 3) How do you define a good/fulfilling life?

222,"Hey everyone, I am a 24 y old guy and something happened recently that really threw me off my game in life.

first some backstory:

From the age of like 15 to like 22 i had a really rough time i was in multiple institutions and built up a drug addiction, in like 3 of these years i was with a girl, this girl was my everything and our time was great, althoug others surrounding me might say otherwise, it was really intense and my mind wasn't great at the time, but she was always there and she could always cheer me up didn't matter how messed up my day was.

at the age of 18 i got in an institution and we broke up, after that i didn't speak to her for like 6 years, and i started working on myself, kicked the drug problem (almost 5 years clean now! yeey) got myself a stable job with good growth potential, where i still work and i really enjoy working there. i have been there for 3 years and more and more is opening up in this job, I'm climbing the ladder so to speak.

So things are going pretty great, I don't have alot of friends or anything but i never really minded it, i like to do my own thing and I'm quite happy on my own with my cat Gizmo :)

I always wondered how this girl was doing, and thought about reconnecting with her a few times, but never really got to it.

2 weeks ago, she contacted me through a message and asked me how i was doing, we got to talking and it was great to have her kind of back, even if only as friends.

 we talked about how our day went, what we were eating for dinner, just a friend, and I'm not really used to this feeling because i usually do my things alone although im very close to my family members.

She ended up coming over for coffee and we just chilled together at my place like 3 days or so after we started talking, it was fun, and we were instantly at ease with each other again, she laid on my couch and just told me about her life and how everything is going.

in the following like 2 days she comes to my place like 2 more times, and we end up doing some stuff..

After this happened it feels like everything changed, we still chat quite a lot, daily pretty much. but i got these butterflies all over again, and she seems to be interested in me too. although now(like 2/3 weeks later) she is keeping me at a distance, we haven't seen each other in that time anymore, we are both pretty busy and she is an outgoing girl so she has things planned on weekends to do and such.

I don't expect anything from her, but i do feel like alot of my life is suffering from this feeling. and i would love to tell her that i want to you know.. be more then friends. we are both grown up and live a stable life now, and I get this really special feeling when i talk to her or she shows interest in me.

because of this the last 3 weeks or so have been a struggle, at work my mind is only half there, and at home i dont feel like doing anything anymore, i used to game quite a bit, watch netflix all the usual stuff, now i just feel like plopping myself on the couch with a blanket and wait for her to respond to my messages so i can talk to her.

I dont know what to do. i don't know if i should respect her space and focus more on myself to get myself on track again and keep me there, or if i should ""go after her"" and try to get her to understand how I feel.

She has told me that the stuff we did is not normal for her, even though she is outgoing and stuff, and i believe her if she says that just how she acts now is very different then like the first week when we reconnected.

Did we just meet out of nostalgia and connected and that's it?

I really don't know how to approach this, because i do really like her, but my life is suffering on all sides because there is no plan or whatever, she just pops over when she has time and it's really hard to plan anything around her because i'm always like what if she wants to come over tonight, i want to be there because i want to spend time with her.

On top of this, my work is in another city, about 1 and a half hours by train from my house, i travel up and down every day and i have been planning to move there to not have this travel for quite a while, she lives in the city i live currently in, making it really difficult for me to choose what to do.

I'd love an outside perspective on this because im just getting caught up in this feeling so much and i can't get anything done.

Thanks for reading.

224,"I currently live in London; I have a spot in a nice flat very close to where I work; I've lived here for almost two years now. The flat has three rooms, one of the rooms is occupied by a guy who has been here for longer than I have, we get along fine, we kinda keep to ourselves. The third room tends to have a new person in it roughly every six months; someone moves in, then moves on, but until now there haven't really been any problems at all. Enter: New guy.

New guy is apparently dealing with some relationship issues, a recent breakup or something like that. I didn't ask for details, I've spoken to him maybe four or five times, and never at length. He seemed like a nice guy when we did talk shortly after he moved in, but we haven't really spoken in a week or so; I work a regular 9-5 and he's usually in his room when I get home; everyone in the flat just kinda does their own thing. I don't even know his last name. Like I said, we all kinda keep to ourselves, and that works for the most part. It's a quiet flat that's kept pretty clean, and we have no major issues at all.

A few days ago the new guy called my landlady and said he was having some major issues with his parents, and lost his job. I don't really know the details, but my landlady is understandably concerned that he might not be able to make the rent. New guy asks if he can pay the rent with his deposit, and my landlady is of the opinion that if he does so, that'll be his last month living in the flat. A long phonecall between them later, and he's moving out. Again, I don't really know the exact details, but if he was quietly moving out, I wouldn't be posting here.

He subsequently, sends the following series of text messages to my landlady over the past few days. My landlady, suddenly very nervous, calls me and explains the situation as best she can, and then forwards me the text messages, which I've transcribed here: https://pastebin.com/wmGHbQAA

What the fuck. He's lost his damn mind. I have no idea what he's talking about, and my other flatmate, who has been here a long time is a quiet, nice guy who probably knows *new guy* even less than I do.

My landlady is going to the police to show them the texts and ask for advice on Monday, as she is concerned for our safety.

I have no idea; I'm wedging a couple of heavy guitar amps and weights against my door at night, this guy has me kinda unnerved, honestly. What do?",10Mar2018,1

227,"Hello everyone,

I'm in my early twenties, moved recently to a new city/country and while I'm quite a loner in general, I'm trying to meet many people here so I often go to meetings (that I find on a website similar to Meetup for example). 
Long story short, a few hours ago I ended up with three woman (they're in her thirties), one that I already knew through other meetings and the other two I had never meet. It was all right, we went first for a drink and then two of them (the two I had never met) wanted to go roller-skating in a park, and wanted to go from our bar to the park (maybe 3/4 miles away) while already skating (they'd go slowly since the 3rd girl and me were just on foot). Sure, no problem, but then one of the girls told me « Do you mind ? » and handed me her shoes. 
What the hell… Maybe I'm not very nice but I didn't want to carry her shoes (and they wouldn't have fit in my bag). If it were somebody I was friends with and/or who also helped me with things from time to time, of course I'd have been glad to do it but she didn't even say please or anything… So I said « No » (but as in « No, I don't mind » although I did mind) because I guess I was afraid of being rude (and didn't have much time tot think about the proper etiquette) and took her fucking shoes (but it was pretty obvious I wasn't enthusiastic with my answer if you like). A few minutes after (we hadn't departed from the spot they put her skate shoes on), I pretended I had an errand to do (lie) and that I didn't want to go too far as my leg's been bothering me for a few days (true), so I left them. 


I've had a few hours to “process” the situation and it still rubs me the wrong way. The shoes weren't heavy by any means but that's just the principle if you like. Should I have accepted and be happy to? Should I have said “no” without explanations? Should I have said somethings like “No sorry I like travelling light”? I'm pretty socially awkward so I'm not sure what I should have done. And was it okay for her to ask it of me like she did?

He is abusive (he breaks things around her to intimidate her, screams at her, and sometimes threatens her, though I don't believe he hits her... yet) and extremely controlling. He broke her computer because she was talking to a college friend on Facebook, and also tells her that he wants kids,
 but that her child, my nephew, doesn't count because he's not Rick's. (I fucking hate Rick, but I'm nice to his face for my sister's sake.)

Lately, when we're out together, Kayla gets multiple texts from Rick demanding that she send him a photo as proof that she's really with me, to show that she isn't cheating on him. I'm extremely uncomfortable with this and I don't want to do it because a) I think it validates Rick's behavior, b) it makes me feel complicit in the abuse, c) I think it normalizes the behavior to my sister, d) I don't like random aggro assholes having photos of me, and e) I've been in abusive relationships myself, and being involved on this level recalls those old feelings and memories.

However, not doing it will damage my relationship with my sister, and if her fiance doesn't receive the photos, I don't know how he may react.

So, I was seeing a guy for 6 months, nothing serious but we saw eachother at least one a week and up until this I trusted him completely. 

I just started a new job so money is extremely tight, I had no income for 2 months prior so as soon  as I got paid it went on past bills etc, and this guy knew that, so he lent me £20, I paid it back, £10, paid back etc, nothing over £20. 

He’s in an incredibly high paying job compared to me, but on Saturday he asked me to transfer him £50 and he’d give me it in cash when he saw me same day (something about taking too much cash out and couldn’t get to a bank, so it made total sense.) his exact wording was “how much money do you have?” Which I found weird and said “I’m not saying, but how much do you need?”. He came over and everything was fine, but he didn’t give the money, he’s super forgetful so I didn’t think much about it.

On Wednesday I phoned him and asked about the money, he said he’d pay back on Friday as that is when he gets paid, I confirmed this on Thursday, he said he’d transfer it the second he woke up. 

Last message I got from him was Thursday, he’s ignoring all my messages and actively declining my calls. He’s completely ghosting me and I’m so confused. £50 might not seem like a lot for most people, but he knows I need the money. If he can’t afford to give it back he could tell me, but instead he’s completely disappeared (he’s been online so it’s not broken phone etc.).

I love this job. It's the best job I've ever had. Almost all of my coworkers are great, or at the very least tolerable. Except one guy.

One guy on my team is like a black hole of drama and negativity. At first, I got along with him pretty well. I actually thought we could make good friends. Then I started to notice he complains A LOT. He talks trash about my coworkers. I was told he's been trash talking me behind my back. I was really taken aback at first - after all, I liked the guy.

I know I'm complaining in this post, but that's because it's anonymous. I don't like creating an atmosphere of negativity.

232,"One of my friend's has a (now deceased) great grandfather who was part of the SS. The great-grandfather in question both saw active service and fought (with great effectiveness) against Jewish resistance groups.

He was almost a perfect Nazi. He didn't smoke and was a teetotaller, very good with firearms and very self disciplined. He also had a softer side as such he loved animals and his favourite hobby was gardening.

One thing stands out in particular that we have only come recently to know. According to a letter from a Jewish family who have got into recent contact my friend's great-grandfather came across a Jewish woman (she was wearing a Jewish star) having a baby during a battle. He arranged for her to have a transport out of the battlefield and vouched for her as being of good stock. He even gave her his coat so as to keep warm.

This doesn't sound like my friend's great-grandfather at all. He thoroughly despised Jews and enjoyed greatly shooting partisans and any Jewish combatants he came across.

Years later he even kept weapons in his house for if 'Mossad comes knocking' (recorded in his diary). He would not get his wish as Mossad never came and he died in his bed as an old man.

My friend has contacted the Jewish family to say that they must be mistaken as his great-grandfather was a dyed in the wool anti-Semite. Yes he had some kind tendencies and loved animals but he had nothing but contempt for Jews.

Nothing is mentioned in the great-grandfather's diary about escorting any Jewish woman, only discussion of tactics and strategy.

I've been with my partner for 11 years - my whole adult life, but lately he has been distant and non-communicative. He is fine with his online friends but is a different story between us. When I try and broach the subject it turns to a argument. 

He is very active in the online role-playing community but over the past few years it has encroached more into his personal life where he has the cell number of some of his online 'friends' and often voice chats with them out of character. I am rather understanding - he doesn't really have any friends in his day life and this is his form of socialization - but it seems to be interfering with him seeking out IRL friends. 

How should I move forward? I feel he may be staying with me for convenience and not love. I love him as much as I did the first day I seen him and just want him to be happy. Should I leave him for his own good or stay with him and hope he can figure out his issues?

Also posting on mobile, sorry for any errors!

I was in desperate need of a job, my savings we’re going fast and I needed health insurance. So I took the first job offered to me, a sales person at a phone kiosk inside a store that sells in bulk. (trying not to be tooooo obvious)

I’ve never done retail/sales, and everyone said I’d hate it. BUT it was full time, I got health insurance and I was making above minimum wage (barely) and I got commission. 

Turns out to be very different from what was advertised. Even when I do the cold calls, shamefully hand out flyers to shoppers of the store, and hound people coming in just to pay their phone bills to get something new, I’m still not making as much commission as advertised in the job posting. To be fair I don’t like sales, I’m not bad at it but I can’t stand doing it. It’s not for everyone I guess. 

I feel like I don’t get paid enough for the things I have to do, but that’s almost all jobs a college student like I can get. So I can suffer. But what makes it worse is the fact that none of our equipment works, and the promotions suck. I mean the internet is slow, the computers are slow, everything takes forever and customers walk out because of it, making the job 10x more frustrating.

I’ve wanted to leave, but I love my coworkers. There’s only been three of us (we did just get a new hire who is in training so she can’t do anything). My manager, coworker, and myself. 

My coworker hates it, and is looking to leave. My manager doesn’t mind the job. She makes good commission. I’ve avoided leaving because with only 2 workers they wouldn’t get a day off unless they each volunteered to work a 12 hour shift which is hell in retail, and that’s how it was before I got there and while I was still training.

But now I don’t like either my manager or coworker. They both suck. My coworker keeps screwing me over, taking my commission on “accident”, and on top of it I have to clean up his mistakes (aka not closing the register or not even asking a new customer what data plan they want).

My manager the past couple of days has been very petty. She went to a manager retreat and I think she got yelled at for our store’s poor performance. So she’s been on edge about that, and my coworker has just completely given up making my manger’s life even more difficult. But she can’t fire him, because then we’ll be down to two people again. 

I have worked there for about 4 months now and I called out sick for the first time today. To be fair I texted her, I didn’t call her to tell her I wouldn’t be coming in. But her phones been broken and she can’t answer phone calls, so I didn’t think it would be weird. Also I’m a mid shift so she doesn’t need anyone to cover open/close for me. I’d just be an extra body there today. 

Well here’s her [response ](https://imgur.com/gallery/SbkTb) to me “texting” out sick

YB: manager
AV: new hire
B: coworker 

Now I live 40 minutes away on days when there’s no traffic, which there is in the morning. And she knows this. I was never aware of any meeting today, and she just rescheduled it for tomorrow at an inconvenient time to be petty. Or maybe she didn’t. Either way I’m going to use a lot of my time/gas for little compensation. 

And the only reason she added that I don’t need a doctors note is because the new girl keep calling out sick and hasn’t brought a note in once. Also why would I go to the doctors for a cold? I just need a day of rest, sleep, and hydration and I should be all set. It’d be expensive and silly to make a same day appointment for something like a cold. 

And now I’m stuck. I have some money saved so I could just quit today and be okay until I find another job. Or I could suffer and waste my time, gas, and mental stability. Then when I for sure have a job, just go ghost. This isn’t a job I’ll put on my resume, or use anyone from there for a reference. So I don’t care too much. 

Any advice?",10Mar2018,2
237,"Hi reddit, 

I'm a 21 year old female. Was a super star academically in high school. I had a 4.0 gpa and 36 on the ACT. 

I don't know how it all went so wrong. 

I spent two years in college trying to figure out what to major in, feeling depressed about my lack of direction and angry that I was spending money on what was essentially my own indecision. 

I dropped out. Thing's are ok. My finances are wrecked from the money that I took out and have to pay back. I now make $15 an hour working for a company that is in the industry that I want to be in. 

I am not really sure how to proceed though. 

Long term, my goals look like:
- Adopting a dog
- Building my own mobile tiny home
- Maybe owning some sort of mobile coffee shop

I know that isn't concrete, which is partly why I need advice. 

I feel haunted by my lack of a degree and keep feeling like I'm socially obligated to go back and get on. I could get a degree in Parks, Recreation and Tourism online from my university. I could pay for it outright with the money I make at my current job. I just also don't feel like it is worth it. 

So what do you think reddit?

Why should I waste 4 years of my life in high school and then waste how ever many years in college when in the end I just die without making any contribution to anything.

243,"Okay, so this is kind of a continuation to this: https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/81zgiy/should_i_take_some_distance/, but I don't think it's needed to understand.

For the last couple of weeks, my friend and I have been discussing. We've had our moments in which we seem to get better, but we usually just end up discussing again.

I have tried talking to her to see if we can work things out, but she usually just becomes really evasive and we both get mad. She says it's too much drama for a friendship and that I'm forcing her into making things go back to normal. That usually happens after we're talking and she just stops answering so I ask what the matter is. I say she's been rude to me lately and she always says she has done nothing bad or stuff like that, which, to be honest, makes me somewhat angry. She also said she was going through a lot right now, but I just don't get why she's fine with everyone but me, then.

We are really good friends (or were, at this point I don't even know), so I don't see why one single fight should be enough to basically go from being together all the time to just not talking or hanging out anymore.

247,"I’m 21 and he’s 27. 

My brother and I have always been close. We’ve always had each other’s backs, despite him being popular and sporty and me being not. 

Well when he was 24, he got mixed up with the wrong crowd of people, partied a lot and ended up getting addicted to cocaine, and got kicked out of his post-graduate college. 

His life basically went on a downward spiral after that, he had to work part time jobs, had to move into a cheaper apartment, and his long time girlfriend, who is a saint, had to leave him because she couldn’t handle his downward spiral anymore. My brother stole money from our parents, and basically did some shady shit for his dealer in order to get drugs. 

I think once his girlfriend left him though, it was a wake up call. My parents and I had basically stopped all contact with him because we couldn’t deal with him anymore. 

Long story short, he came to me and asked for my help. I was only 19 but I did my best to help him and he got sober. His girlfriend came back to him and he’s back at school doing what he loves.  

He lives in the city over so last weekend I went to visit him and stayed at his place for a few days. 

I needed to borrow a shirt from him so I opened his closet door and a small bag fell to the floor from the top shelf of the closet. 

Yeah. It was coke. I’ve never touched that shit but I was around it enough when I was helping my brother get sober so I know what it looks like. 

I’m honestly devastated. That shit ruined his life and he’s been doing so well. 

Here’s my dilemma: If he’s doing it again, I need to know so I can help him before it ruins his life again. But maybe it’s an old bag? If it is I don’t want to accuse him of using again and have him think I don’t trust him.

252,"Let me preface this by saying that I am now 25, but I'm starting to think about my childhood more as I come across different situations and personal patterns in adulthood. If anyone could offer some external insight/thoughts/advice on this, it would be really helpful.

My sister and I have no other siblings, and while our childhood was filled with enriching opportunities that I know a lot of others couldn't enjoy that I'm extremely grateful for, my mom was a miserable person during most of it, and was a toxic force on everyone in the household, especially my sister and I. She was a stay at home mom with seemingly little stress (I know stay at home moms work hard too) and my sister and I were very well behaved. However, she complained extensively that the house was too big, she was a maid, but most of her complaints were about my dad. That he wasn't a ""real man"", he cared more about his sisters out of state he didn't care about us, was cheap etc. Constant digs at him about his appearance, how a real man watches sports good thing you don't have a brother, etc. When my dad would leave the house in the morning for work, my stomach would drop as I was ready for my mom to be start yelling and crying about how selfish my dad was. The obsession, attempted brainwashing to turn us against my dad and his family was relentless for years, and sometimes it worked. My sister and I were to ask for gift cards when our paternal aunts during holidays. Any trips to visit my dad's side of the family out of state was extremely stressful for my sister and I, as my mom was keeping a close watch for any ""betrayal"" of her, and read to praise (later on) hurtful or rude behavior we demonstrated on those trips. I remember my dad building a tire swing for my sister and I, and I followed him into the backyard to tell him that I hate him and he's a horrible person. I remember him telling me that he was a person with feelings. I felt so horrible. My sister and I would help my mom by hacking into my dad's email, my mom and my grandmother (who fueled the fire with our household tension) would plot against my dad, doing things like freeing the family dinner so it wouldn't thaw in time before my dad played tennis so he'd be hungry. Anything in favor of my dad would be met with punishment. She was good in teaching my sister and I the value of volunteering and many different things about home economics, etc. But I never understood why she thought so highly of herself for ""teaching us things"" and not allowing us to be ""latch key kids"" and being a ""good person through volunteering"" when behind the scenes she would act in such a harmful and hurtful ways. She did do nice things during holidays and sacrificed time in driving us around to activities, etc that a lot of stay at home moms do, but I never felt like she was a good mom.

I feel as though my mom's toxic behavior extended to image obsession as well, as a child in school, I felt so much pressure to be perfect, I got very good grades and was your typical teacher's pet. I remember once forgetting my homework and having an emotional breakdown. Another time, a teacher once in 2nd grade told me to sit down, and I burst into tears. Despite how well behaved and studious I was, I remember my mom picking my sister and I up from school and on the way home saying, ""everyone may like you at school, but they don't know who you REALLY are.""

But I really liked my dad-- he never said anything bad about my mom, checked in on our schoolwork without putting too much pressure on us, built us a garden and toys, just an easily contented man who also seemed to pretend that all this wasn't going on. I wish he did more to address the discontent at home, but he was busy with work but was home every night and not absentee dad in any way. He says he tried tirelessly to go to counseling with my mom but she refused. He was never unfaithful and as I approached my teenage years, I got more turned off by my mother and felt sorry for my father. I'd pick him up from outpatient medical procedures/check ups that used local anesthesia, trimmed the back of his hairline, even went to a wedding once as my mom refused to go. My sister got further sucked into my mom's behavior. I would end up going with my dad just the two of us to visit family out of state or out of country, etc.  It was almost like a real-life Parent Trap situation in one household. My dad and his family always treated my sister with kindness and were inclusive despite her behavior to appease my mom. It was just like this for as long as I can remember.

When I was 14, I was in a piano lesson and my teacher asked me ""are you going too?"" and I asked ""going to where?"" and she said ""the apartment with your mom and sister"". Two days later, my mom and sister left and moved into a small apartment, and my mom pleaded with me not to tell my dad (I did). I remember my twin sister in tears, expressing uncertainty in leaving her childhood home. My mom continued to convince her so they left together and I spent the remainder of high school, until college, in a half furnished house with my dog and poor dad.

I feel lucky, as for some reason I was able to pull away from the brainwashing and didn't find myself in the situation that my sister did. Almost 10 years have passed since they left, my mom tries very hard with my sister and I, sending little cards with gift cards in the mail, and wants to be involved in our lives. I'm not sure if she had mental health problems before, but I just can't let go of the resentment I have for poisoning our childhood. I feel like it wired my brain in a way that makes me struggle with self-esteem, and only associate love with suffering (i.e. abusive relationships). Both of my parents are leading separate lives and the space between all of us have made things healthier (my sister eventually came around, I don't know how she feels about my mom now and I haven't asked-- we aren't close at all). My mom shows she cares and I appreciate that, but our relationship is shallow and I dislike how she feels that she's entitled to phone calls (or a text when I land, when I travel?!). 

Sorry that was so long, lots went on in those 14 years with a variety of dynamics. I know it could have been worse, but it was a very sad childhood that caused me great long-term stress that I'm only now beginning to reflect on with greater seriousness. What's your take on the situation? How should I handle my current relationship with my mom?",10Mar2018,26
253,"Hi everyone sorry in advance for this extremely long post. Back in June of 2017 I caught my husband having an affair with a family friend. I was extremely devastated and didn't know what to do. Here's some backstory on my husband. He's an addicted gambler and loved to go to bars ever since he was a young teen. I trusted my husband with my eyes closed and never said anything to him when he got home at 3AM from the casino. He hated taking me and I completely understood because when I lost money I took out my anger on him. Same with the bar, I had to of course give him his own time with his friends. I'm not a drinker and will probably never drink, plus I hate the smell of smoke so I wouldn't go to the bar even if I got paid.

One day I noticed a message on his phone but I only noticed it because he was receiving a call from his sister but I didn't get it on time to him. I saw the message say something like ""we can't be friends anymore"" and I told him about it really relaxed as I didn't see anything wrong with it. He jumped off of bed panicking and yelling at me that why am I looking through his stuff. That's when I got curious. I'm not a tech fan or know anything about technology. I asked my daughter if she can set up his imessages to go to my phone (I know I did bad but I didn't know what else to do). My daughter said he received a call from ""Guerro"" and after that he was very protective of his phone. He didn't even let my daughter get near it without him being behind her. 

Something was going on and I wanted to know what. Well turns out the day after my daughter set up his imessages with mine he sent an old female friend this ""Pick up baby, I want to put my cock in you again at the casino"". I felt my world shatter. I wanted to work my problems out because we have 3 kids and one is disabled. 

He pleaded and begged that he'll do anything to fix this. Well we came up with a few things that can possibly help me out. I told him he is to ALWAYS report where he is, I will have access to his location from his phone. He is never allowed to go to the casino without me or my oldest daughter. 

He agreed. But now he gets so angry that he doesn't have a life anymore, that he can't go out anymore. And he finally realized that i was able to see his location from the ""where's my iphone"" feature on his phone. He called me one day saying ""hahaha I took off location, you can't see me anymore"" and right as I looked he was at a hotel. I was beyond mad. He claims he only passed through there but I wouldn't know since he took off his location services. My heart hurts reddit. It really does.

I ask for advice on how I can get him to not turn off location services. He knows I can't work because my son is disabled and that I can't leave him. I love him I really do. My son is only 8 and youngest is 5. I can't leave them without their father. I was thinking maybe something in Cydia can help me take off that option where he takes it off. 

TL;DR Husband had an affair and we agreed that I would check on him. He found out he can take off location services on iphone and I can no longer see where is at. How can I take that feature off his phone?

Edit: I know you will all say to leave him, but I guarantee just about every person would have a hard time doing that with any SO. Please don't only tell me to leave him. I asked advice if there was anything I could do for location services, not about whether to stay or leave. ",10Mar2018,0

257,"This is bothering me and I would like to know how you would handle yourself in this situation. I have worked for this company for the last 7 years. I started full time, went per diem, full time, and per diem etc. Lastly I have been working part time for the past two years. Back when I was full time I knew the job like the back of my hand had seniority, and pretty much quietly ran the show. In more recent years, I’m only working for health insurance and enough money to get by, my passion is entirely gone. I am at a place where I’m attempting to finish college and find my passion. 
My boss used to show up and act as a boss, lately it’s been difficult to take her seriously because in the last few years I have seen her face to face about 5 times. Mind you, although she is not at work... it appears she is getting paid to be at work. Not only that the new hires are jokes and we are severely understaffed. 
When my school schedule changed for Spring semester I picked up working Friday night awakes, I thought I would be able to study. Not the case, it took time out of my Friday studies and lingered into ruining my Saturday because I would be so tired. In February I finished the shifts I had begged for and decided that I can not be taking on those shifts. 
Flash forward to the last two weeks, my supervisor is begging me to pick up the hours. I say no several times, yet continuously get asked. Eventually my boss texts me, asking me to do the shift. She explains she has no one to cover it and is not able to herself because of family interference. Both having iPhones, I read the message and ignore it for the week.
Last night the shift begins and it appears my supervisor is covering the shift as he is texting me pictures of his energy drink collection from the night.  He is moody understandably because he works his 40 hours and maxes out on overtime every week. He says the boss was pissed because someone read her text message and didn’t respond regarding the shift. I blow it off joking saying oh yeah that was me, actually I never got a text. Here is the text I received from him “She said she texted someone the other day and they read it at like 3 and didn't respond back. She was like doesn't get more disrespectful than that”

273,"I'm 24, female and currently work for a city library. I've been working here since about September 2015. Working at a library has been my dream job since I was a child and actually getting the job was such an awesome time for me. But as of lately I find my mental health slowly deteriorating by continuing to work here. 

Let me attempt to start at the beginning: I struggle with a lot of anxiety. And since 2014 it's gotten increasingly worse. Before it mostly revolved around social anxiety, but now I fear for my safety (and the safety of my loved ones) on a daily basis to the point where it's interfering with my life. I can't pinpoint exactly when the change happened but I know in 2014, it was the first time I had to leave a movie theater because I was convinced someone was going to come in and start shooting. Since then with all the mass shootings, it's only made my fear worse. 

Well, in August of 2017, we had a mass shooting at my work. I was on my lunch break so I wasn't there during it. I lost two coworkers that day and I think a little more of my sanity. My actual worst fear, something I had nightmares about all the time came true. No one thought I would actually come back to the job, but here I am. Okay, so after the shooting I was able to mostly push everything away and live in denial. Simply getting by through living on autopilot. I wasn't sleeping and I was throwing up almost every morning before work (still am). So in November 2017 I missed a lot of work because I simply couldn't bring myself to go. My boss (who is incredibly toxic which I will get into later) essentially begged me not to quit when I finally did come back. Listening to the advice of a friend, I decided to open up to my boss and explain to her the mental anguish I was going through. Her response started with ""Not to downplay your feelings, but you weren't even there"". 

I had been warned about Margaret (my boss) since I started working here. She's very catty and passive aggressive. And what she does is choose someone to hate out of the employees and focuses all of her rude remarks and anger on them in an attempt to get them to quit. Before now I had never been subjected to this side of her, mostly because I went out of my way to avoid it and her at all costs. Well I guess it's now my time to be that employee because she has been treating me awful. My boyfriend and mother both advised me to report her for her remarks, but the problem is many people have before and she gets away with it because she's buddy-buddy with H.R. 

The job itself is fine. I work in tech services so I sit at my desk all day and watch things while I do my work, I know this is a good thing and incredibly rare that I'll find anything like it again. My coworkers are decent, I normally keep to myself, but I don't mind them. When I talked to my mom about quitting she essentially made me feel like an idiot for even thinking of it because I can't ""mess up a good job"". 

I'm exhausted at this point and really just want to quit and work on my mental health, but I don't know if I should. With me quitting, my boyfriend and I would be losing $800 of our monthly income. I know we could get by comfortably for the next 6 or so months because of my savings, but beyond that I don't know.

I know staying at the job is bad for my mental and physical health because of what it's doing to me, but I don't want to spend the next year regretting the choice of quitting. Ugh. 

Any and all advice is welcome!",10Mar2018,4
274,"I'm worried that there will come a day when there will be no services left that offer digital downloads of content that you can download to something like an external hard drive and only require existing operating software to play it (e.g. VLC Media Player, Windows Media Player, iTunes, your games console's built-in DVD-playing function). For some people, it's already their sole or primary way of consuming content - streaming through Netflix or Spotify.

I'm worried about this because this means that I can potentially never listen to or watch the content I'll like ever again, when there would be no other legal way for me to consume such content; this greately saddens me. Netflix and Spotify already take down music due to DMCA and other licencing requests, and in the case of Spotify, from artificially boosted plays. For this reason, I'm often hesitant to get into new music (be they from a recent time or from the past that I haven't listened to), since I'm worried that they will be, or already are legally available only through streaming. An example is this song, which I first came across through a YouTube video:

https://soundcloud.com/wendyicon/04-on-your-knees-again

If I create something, then I will probably have the rights to it for as long as I live (unless I licence the work as public domain intentionally or otherwise, or if someone decides they want the rights to the work and they could take away my rights to it). However, I feel like that whatever I could create will never be as good as the existing content that I like, which I have no rights or any other connection to except for the fact that I have purchased the content as a DRM-free digital download (or on a physical medium).

For games, if I wanted to create something that was as good as a triple-A title, I'm worried that I'll have to surrender my rights to the content to licencing it to the studio - if the game studio went bankrupt, not only won't the consumers have legal access to it, but I might not as well.

For other content, it's just simply ""nothing I'll create will ever be good enough"". There are specific reasons why I appreciate some content, even if it won't be regarded as one of the best by many other people. I think in the case of music and maybe fashion, I feel like they capture specific things about the time that the music was written or the fashion trend that was created, which I don't think can be replicated in this day and age, or they have an aesthetic, message or whatever it is about it that I really like, and it wouldn't feel as genuine if I tried to recreate it or if anyone else were to try and recreate it now. For TV franchises, I don't really know, but nothing else will get me attached to them no matter how good or bad others think it will be.

I can research what makes a certain genre of music sound like it, but I would best like it if I could make a cover of the music I like (which I'll still have no rights to, or fewer rights to); I feel like anything I write myself won't amount to whatever I like that already exists. I can research everything there is to making a very good game, but in some cases, I'm worried it won't amount to some of the things I like - I'm not as attached to games though for anything beyond mechanics.

Whether people like it or not, according to the people in this Discord chat I started, the content owners have the final say on how their content is to be distributed. Since I own almost none of the content I really like, I'm worried that I won't ever get to appreciate them again, and that life for me stops being a bit enjoyable without it.",10Mar2018,0

my husband &amp; i have been together for six years, lived together for five, and got married about six months ago. 
he’s incredibly funny, and we generally have a good time when we’re together. we never fight. 
if i’m honest, i’ll admit that he hasn’t really put much effort into our relationship for the past three or four years, and looking back now, even though i love him, i probably shouldn’t have married him. 
over these past few years i’ve had six serious talks with him (when i have an issue, i try to process the emotions on my own, come up with a solution, and then calmly present it all to him) about my not feeling like my needs are being met. 
i’ve tried to be really clear and specific about what i need. ex., tell me i’m attractive sometimes (he NEVER compliments me), give me any physical affection that isn’t intended to initiate sex (hold my hand, put your hand on my knee), willingly spend quality time with me (initiate a date to go for dinner, ask me to watch a tv show with you). he will always say the right things during the conversation but then reverts back to his usual behaviour afterwards. i also try to ask him during these convos if there are needs he has that i’m not meeting but he never tells me anything. 
i don’t know why i’m feeling extra bothered by these things since we got married but a couple things have happened that have really made me feel like shit:
1. my parents split up after 30 yrs of marriage (2 mos after our wedding). it was my mom’s decision and many of her reasons were things i really identified as issues in my own relationship and it freaked me the fuck out. so i insisted we go to some counselling. after two sessions he said it was a waste of money &amp; he didn’t want to go back. in response, i told him how it was really important to me and that i felt vulnerable to having an affair if someone else gave me attention, that i didn’t WANT to feel that way, and that i couldn’t see our marriage lasting long term if something didn’t change. he just reiterated that it was a waste of money. 
2. a week before valentine’s day i texted him and told him that it was really important to me that he do something little for me for valentine’s (get me a card, or sing me a song, or write down some reasons he loves me). on the 14th i bought stuff to make us a fancy dinner &amp; i had also bought some stuff from a sex shop, including a sexy school girl outfit as my gift to him. he didn’t do anything for me. didn’t even text me anything nice during the day.

there are a lot of other ways he’s pretty checked out in life. he doesn’t eat a single healthy thing. he never wants do anything. he basically just wants to play video games and i kind of wonder if he maybe has a bit of an addiction. 

i also wonder if he’s depressed. but can’t imagine him even being able to acknowledge to himself if that was the case. 

i’m not ready to leave him (i love our house, our pets, and the way he makes me laugh) but i also am at a place where i finally realize he’s not going to change. i’m considering suggesting an open relationship to him in hopes that i could get some of the attention and affection i need elsewhere on my own without breaking up the life we’ve built together. (i’ve never felt an emotional attachment in regards to sex with anyone so i don’t think that would be an issue.) 
maybe a period of an open relationship would just be a transition that would lead to a breakup. or maybe it would be a way to get told i’m pretty &amp; feel wanted and ALSO have the security &amp; comfort of my relationship with him. 

would love to hear any advice on how to proceed; on open relationships; or anything else. also open to answering any questions about anything i haven’t been clear enough about. 
thanks! ",10Mar2018,4

280,"**TL;DR:** Grad student has always felt full of shit, and hasn't stopped. How to actually determine shitfulness? + In case of actual shitfulness, is having worked on getting a PhD for a long enough time and ultimately not having it a TERRIBAD career move? (Can code, def. wouldn't mind exploring other fields)


Howdy,
I'm a PhD student (Europe), and have been at it for some years now. Now, impostor syndrome is particularly prevalent in Academia [citation needed], but at some point I have to ask; am I somehow an idiot with a STEM field degree and have I somehow fooled everyone all this time?

I don't feel any closer to being an expert on my topic, I don't feel like I have a good grasp of the field, reading related literature still feels like banging my head against a wall.
Most talks I've given at conferences / project meetings, I've compared to the talks from other PhD students and somehow I've always felt either like a bullshit peddler or basically incompetent compared to them.

I've changed fields a couple of times when moving up the academic ladder, but all of them were kinda neighboring each other anyway. I wasn't a really stellar student in my undergrad, I guess. I was better during my Master's - it also felt like less work, which contributes to the whole impostor feeling. As in, 'What if they just gave those away?!'

I'd need advice on two things, I guess: 

* How would you go about  determining your own actual level of competence in a situation where, by now, EVERYONE expects that you're not a complete klutz. (But also no one actually asks?)
* In case it turns out I am actually a klutz and this is not the encroaching deadline panic speaking, how bad is it to have 3-4 years of 'research' on a CV and ultimately not have the degree to show for it? It could technically be considered a job, and I do have some useful skills (e.g. coding...)

284,"First question on reddit...here goes...Please advise. Thank you.

I saw a forensic van yesterday and a forensic officer dusting a car for prints. It was my neighbor across the street who just moved in recently, so I don't really know them. It didn't look like a serious crime so I went about my day. This is normally a very safe neighborhood, so I thought maybe some teenagers/passerbys  broke into their car and stole stuff.

Then this morning I found a backpack and a bag with items of some value still in it. It looks as though it was placed at the bottom of a big bush and tucked in somewhat in front of my house. I retrieved the bags and took it inside. I went through the bags briefly to see if I can see who it belongs too. I did see a phone number but it looks like it was just notes and not of that of the owner. 

Later in the day, I saw the neighbor outside his house. I waved and started walking towards him. He noticed I probably wanted to talk so we met halfway. I told him I noticed there was a forensic vehicle from the local police dept parked in front of his house and they were dusting one of his cars and asked if it was broken into and if anything was stolen. 

He started to tell me what had happened. How he probably forgot to lock his car doors and that he has noticed teenagers walking through the neighborhood some nights. He then went on to describe the items that were lost/stolen and it seems to match the items I found in the bags. 

At this point, I'm thinking should I tell him I just found some bags and it seems like the items match his description. I didn't know what to do. I tried to empathize, but had to hurry back inside since it started to rain.

My intention was to contact the police dept and have them deal with it...but it seems I've found the owner(s) of the items. Should I just give it to them? and how should I approach this? or should I contact the police dept and tell them I found stolen items that may belong to my neighbors?

Also, I find it weird that the person who took the bags did not want to keep any of this. Some of it has been damaged, but I don't know if this happened after it was taken or if it was the original condition.

What is your advice? TIA.",10Mar2018,1
285,"I got offered a job at another company that's a step up from my current job (same field), slightly more money and has better prospects to climb up the ladder.

But I don't want it and I feel stupid and as if something is wrong with me. I'm 28 and I make comfortable money. I like what I do and I'm good at, but honestly I don't really care about my work and have little passion for it. I enjoy the company I'm at right now and love the people and culture and that's what's keeps me happy.

If I'm totally honest, my ambition has reached its limit. I live a fulfilling life and I've never been someone who defines themselves by work. I want to work to contribute to my family and the world, but I feel so embarrassed that I don't want anything else. I don't want to earn lots of money for expensive things, I don't want to work longer hours and I don't have any desire to be anyone's manager. I took a job interview because when it was offered to me I thought others would think I'm crazy and be disappointed if I didn't at least try.

I know there's nothing wrong with me, but I feel as if I'm missing something that everyone else around me has.

I love my family and friends, I love animals, I love that I get to do a little bit of traveling every now and again, and I love have life experiences. Should I still consider taking this job? Its more responsibility but could put me on track to a brighter career.

&gt; And all of this censorship isn’t without any prolonged effects. Scientific studies by Common Sense Media display that these 18-34 year olds in the US also spend over 9 hours a day just consuming social media off sites such as YouTube. Another focused study, in the same year, conducted by Harvard University of over 14,000 students, displayed that 60 percent of these undergraduate in the US identify as democrat, while within this group only 5 percent identify as a registered Republican or Independent. By no means is this a bad thing, but this correlation of media bias as well as the increasing hours spent online is something to consider.

I didn’t really have a position title, but basically he owns a small/med size company and was starting a side business. I ran all operations for 2 years. It was a super toxic environment and I finally got out last Aug. Now I work in operations for a general contractor. It’s an even smaller company, and although I couldn’t believe it was possible, it’s even more toxic of an environment than I was in before. I feel limited in the jobs I am qualified for because my degree doesn’t have anything to do my experience (or anything I’m interested in, really) and my experience is extremely difficult to put on paper because I’ve been responsible for all aspects of a growing business without any real formal training. I am also getting paid very well for someone my age with only 3 years of professional experience.

289,"That is the best title I could come up with.

For reference : I'm 17, and a non-native English speaker. I know some people hate teenagers, but please read.

Side story 1: I know for sure that people have their own voices in their head but some friend of mine have told me that maybe i'm thinking to much and that forces me to reconsider my situation. I have a voice in my head, my own voice. I used to have trouble sleeping since i was very young, but at that time it did not bother me that much. However, it has been affecting my life quite a bit recently. I have encoutered difficulties in keeping my concentration and emotional state during the day when the voices are to loud and I have to speak nonsense (and out loud, even really loud when i'm alone) to keep it down. The sleeping issue is getting more serious because whenever i close my eyes at night, all the noises appear ten times louder. Noises consist of, not only my own thought but also noises I have heard during the day such as people calling my name, teacher giving lessons, traffic noises, etc. These voices just all appear at the same time and they are freaking loud, like screaming inside my head. I do not know how to keep them down, sometimes I enjoy having deep thoughts, I have to admit. But most of the times, like I've mention above, they are huge issue for my life and I'm really looking forward to find a solution to keep them down.

Side story 2: Like most people, I have dreams at night. Sometimes, just like the thoughts, my dreams get really loud and they wake me up. I realise that some of those dreams are really interesting and creative, more creative than I normally am. So I guess that there is some kind of limit that keep me from a higher stage of creativity. 

Is there any way that I can turn down the volume of the noises in my head? This question is more important.

What can I do to have more creative and interesting ideas during the day like the ideas I have in my dreams at night?

295,"I was basically catfished into accepting a job I otherwise wouldn't have accepted. The job is pretty basic. It entails assembling furniture in a warehouse for one of the United States biggest furniture retailers. You definitely have heard of them, they are huge, but I don't know if I should name them. I am overqualified for this job however due to being basically broke I accepted it anyways as some income is better than no income. My problem is, I was told VERBATIM by the manager during the hiring process: ""Right now, my highest guy is averaging $26/hr and my lowest guy is averaging $21/hr, so that should give you an idea of what to expect."" ($75 day rate + commission, commission is based on how much you build) I was also told it was full-time 40 hours/week, with a little bit of overtime needed here or there. They also gave me onboarding paperwork, in which they provide an example of the pay breakdown. To summarize the example they provided, they said if I worked 40 hours, plus 3 hours overtime, I could expect to make ~$1250 pre-tax. To give you an idea of how much they are off, last week I worked 49 hours and made ~$700 pre-tax. How the pay works basically is each day, they pay you $75 just for punching in (day rate). Regardless if you work 1 hour or 8 hours, they will give you $75. The rest of the money you make depends how much furniture you build. Once all the furniture they assign to you is completed for the day, you can go home. You might get out early or you might get out late. Note that I don't choose how much furniture I build. It is at their discretion. At first, when noticing the discepancy I thought okay well my hourly rate must be low because I am new and I am not building it as fast as I could be. I have determined that not to be the cause. I tried building the furniture as fast as humanly possible. The only way to build the furniture any faster would be to grow a second pair of arms. Also note that there is an ABSURD amount of furniture thrown at us each day. I haven't worked an 8 hour shift since when I was in training my first week. I am averaging about 10 hours/day. Every week so far there has been at least one day I work about 13 hours. I have talked to a lot of my coworkers and they were open in telling me how much they are making. Turns out, no one there is even coming close to $21/hour (which they said the lowest employee was averaging). Every single coworker of mine is also very unhappy about the pay. I asked them well how come nobody says anything to the manager or corporate or whoever. Well they didn't exactly give me the answer I was hoping for. They said basically any other person they saw complain about the pay ends up getting fired. They have apparently learned to keep their mouth shut. Everyone who holds my position (about 10 other people) has been there 6 months or less, aside from 2 people who have been there longer. The turnover rate is extremely high. I assume they must be in the same boat as me and think some money is better than no money which is why they remain quiet. Anyways, I am not the type to remain quite. I am very unhappy that I was just flat out lied to, although I am scared to speak up because with my current financial situation, should they fire me and leave me to suffer a few weeks without pay until I find another job, it can ruin me. That being said, what do I do? I know a common answer will probably be to find another job which I am trying but don't know how long that will take. I would say I could go to the Department of Labor but I live in Connecticut which is apparently an ""at will"" state, so I am not sure that they can do anything. What am I supposed to do?
