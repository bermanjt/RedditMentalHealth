0,"We broke up over a year ago but we started talking again around this past thanksgiving. Even tho we started hanging out a lot again I made it clear to her that I don’t want to be in a relationship with her or frankly anyone else right now. Also, I was going to be moving to the other side of the country to attend the job corps (I just started last week) so getting into a relationship would just not be smart at all. Not to mention this girl cheated on me when we were together. But since I’ve been out here we’ve been texting every day and because this weekend was a holiday weekend I was allowed to leave campus (usually job corps student aren’t allowed to leave campus for the first 3 weeks) so I decided to go stay at a hotel just so I could have a bit more freedom than I do over there. But today I decided to take a walk to cvs to pickup some things I needed and as I’m walking someone runs by me from behind and touches my head and I notice that it’s her and I’m just standing there in shock and then she says “I’m getting food” and then runs back the other way.

 So right now I’m just standing outside cvs and I just saw her walking down the street again. I’m not even sure what to think right now or what to do. I have stuff I need to get done today and this whole thing is just a huge distraction. Is this girl stalking me?? Should I be this freaked out?",15Jan2018,2

2,"I'm 23 and currently living with my friend and about 6 other people. I'm unemployed right now and I've worked one job in my life which was a temporary bar-tending job for a few months. My friend was managing that bar at the time and he got me the job.

I did okay in high-school, standard C student. I completely failed 6th form, so much so that it was basically a waste of 2 years. Since I finished 6th form in 2012 I've basically done nothing but smoke weed and piss about whilst I was on jobseekers allowance.

I really don't know what the fuck to do, I hate my younger self for wasting so much time. I just want some kind of stable, full time job, but who the fuck would hire me? I've probably applied for about 100 jobs with very little success.

3,"I want to change my life, I am very unhappy with things. I am a 21(f) who lives at home with my controlling parents (47M) and 45f). Like most kids that I grew up around, they’d get jobs at 16 and have a car, either bought with saved money or from their parents, then you know, hopefully be moved out once 18-21. I never really expected too much with my parents because my relationship with them has never been good. My parents to this day complain to me with “Why don’t you have a job already?”, I’ll simply say “I have no reliable source of transportation, but I could use the car here (that I get to use on weekends)”, then they’ll say “Nevermind, we need it for work”. The only person who could help is my boyfriend, I have friends but they live quite a distance. All my parents do is complain to me how I’m doing nothing with my days calling me lazy, and other name callings, making me do their cleaning chores and what not. This is what my day looks like 5x a week, 8 hours a day. My family at home and I have two dogs as well, with separation anxiety, the dogs are mostly mine because I’m the only one who really cares for them in the household as well as their necessities. I could leave the house for a couple hours and come back to my dogs gone by my fathers watch; he works from home by choice and makes daily calls and needs the house to be absolute quiet (when my dad is home and everyone is home too, we have to go to our own rooms so that he won’t be disturbed). It’s so hard to leave my home just for a couple of hours to see friends when I constantly worry for my dogs, regardless of name tags on their collars, I feel a big responsibility for them and I choose to stay home for the most part because my dad just leaves them outside for hours on end with no water or food. My boyfriend claims he could help with giving me rides to work and watching my dogs at his apartment but he has a day job for 8 hours everyday  and an apartment with 4 roommates and 4 other animals. I wouldn’t want to interfere with his own things. I just don’t know what to do. My parents are verbally abusive and control me. How can I change things when I am so limited? ",15Jan2018,2
4,"I have a lot of personal gripes against how I was raised and to be quite frank it annoys me on a deep level when my mom tries to force me to go to church.

I am fucking 27 years old. But whenever I tell her I don't want to go to church she gets depressed and emotional because she truly believes i will go to hell if I don't love jesus every sunday

I've had it up to here. I am a pretty stable guy, but when I think about the sheer amount of time wasted at church and knowledge and experience I could have been gathering instead of learning fairy tales and ignoring the outside world for 21+ years.

I fucking hate that my mom is not rational enough to have any real discussion about anything in life without it leading to ""Jesus will take care of it""

I was recently laid off from my job and that means I have to move back home with her... I'm thankful shes letting me move in but I know what's waiting for me there is emotional turmoil and arguing

5,"Hi

So I recently fell for my best friend harder than I've ever fell for anyone else. We've been really close for about 2 years to the point that we can tell each other basically anything, and the reason that I realized that I was in love with her is that she helped me in a crisis of my own. She told me that I'm the most important person to her in the world and that she loves me. I obviously told her that I love her too but we both know that we didn't mean it in a romantic way.

The reason that I'm so scared of asking her out is that I'm afraid of fucking up our relationship, which I absolutely love.

I really don't know what to do, so im posting here at 4 am after trying to make up my mind for 5 hours.

Thanks in advance",15Jan2018,2
7,"So, My friend, let's call her Lilli. She had been dealing with depression for most of her life. I'm 14 right now, she was 14 too. We began to date for a brief period of time. Over the internet. Yes, I know I am going to get comments about how online dating never works. Actually, I'm sure I won't get any replies. I am just not sure what to do. In September of 2017, I was offline for a brief weekend. She contacted me, and I didn't receive the message in time. I finally got the chance to respond.

She never contacted me back.

She hasn't been online in months.

She hasn't said anything.

She had been dealing with severe depression before, so it just kind of hurts me. This kind, sweet, and bubbly girl. Reduced to a depressed mess. And I couldn't do anything.

She won't respond to anyone. I'm really worried. I've messaged her daily, hoping for her safe return.

If you would like to PM me with advice, go ahead. I am just not sure what to do. Am I over-reacting? Am I just being stupid? I hope I am. I don't want to live in a world where she isn't. I miss her. I miss her voice. I miss her smile. I generally miss her.

I have found it to be impossible to be happy now.

Can I just... Have any advice any of you can scrape up?

If you want to insult me in your comment, please keep it to yourself. I am a male, just so you know. I just don't know what to tell my friends. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so scared of losing her. But it just seems too real. I know she can't be dead. I'm confident in that! Just... What if she is?

I think I got off track.

Just please help me...",15Jan2018,1
9,"Long post warning! Sorry, guys! 
My SO had a best friend- he was even the best man at our wedding. One night when my husband bailed on our date for a party, his friend came over (uninvited). He told me that my SO had told him how much he hated me, how he didn’t want to stay with me, etc. Of course I began to cry and he invited me into a hug to console me. Sure enough, this wasn’t an innocent visit as he molested/sexually harassed me that night. 
I told my husband everything that happened the next morning... he seemed very upset at first; but since then I’ve caught him hanging out with him several times. I told him how I felt and he promised he wouldn’t do it any more. Yesterday he hung out with him again and even took pictures with him. 
I have horrible nightmares about this man and DO NOT want him anywhere near my life or especially our child. But I don’t know what to do anymore.... pls help with any advice you can. Thanks!!!  ",15Jan2018,2
10,"So I'm a 17 year old guy who homeschools. Its not so easy to find friends that I relate to. There is one girl who lives in my town who is in the same position as me, and over the years we just became best friends. 

I'm the kind of person who likes to handle a situation from the backlines, one on one. But shes a natural born leader, constantly knowing how to get people to do the maximum amount of good in any scenario. We volunteer at a youth group together, and she handles the group events while I handle those shy kids in the corner.

Herein lies the issue. I know that if she were in a political place of power, she could change the world for the better. But her family is really freaking traditional. Basically, girls can either be religious sisters or stay at home moms. No going off to school after high school. And her sisters, whom she has a lot of, are all fine with that. Whenever she asks about where I want to go to school, we talk about it, and while shes never said it, I can tell she wants to do something else. 

I don't want to come off as pushy or intrusive, and I don't want to ruin her relationship with her family(They're really close.) But I want her to be happy, and I've known her for long enough to know when she wants something. She wants to go to school.

Just hoping for tips on how to proceed...

Therefore I have considered that the only way I can make enough is by starting a side business. But I don't know what that would be - as I don't have much capital, it'd be something that I could start of small but work up to? What should I start with?

I've been really into her since we've met essentially, and she was into me in the beginning. But she is in love with another guy, his name is Y. Y and X have been together for awhile, but unfortunately, he is in college and he doesn't want to pursue a relationship while he is in college. Essentially he wants to mess and experiment with other girls while he's there, and X is surprisingly okay with this.

Anyways, Y has told X multiple times like. ""I don't see a future with you."" And X wants to move on from Y, but she is having a lot of trouble doing it. So she's decided to not have a relationship with anyone during 2018.

This is where essentially my problem lies. She's told me multiple times. ""I know you'd treat me right, I just wish I loved you"". And other stuff like that. She knows I want a relationship with her, so we decided to go on a date but she told me specifically that it won't go any further than that. Our date went really well, she told me she really enjoyed it and we should do it again. And we already have plans for another date.

What should I do here? I'm in love with this girl, she's just stuck up with another guy that she does and doesn't want to get over. I'm 17, so is she.

21,"Okay reddit, I live in manhattan, Kansas and there are two tall buildings downtown, this building was built in 1929 with the original elevator, which somehow made it through a flood, as well. It has 7 floors, we live on the 6th. The elevator worked fine for a few months since we’ve lived here and recently started dropping about a half floor, it’s pretty scary and happens randomly. It takes about 40 seconds and corrects itself, but it sucks. With no word for management about what is being done, I let them know every time the elevator messes up. They act like they care and I never hear another word. The elevator tech has been out and will randomly shut it down for an hour or more, we won’t be warned, we just come home and it’s out and we get to walk 6 flights. Again, we are never warned. It’s sometimes out for an entire day. Now, all of that sucks but here’s what sucks more.... I called to let them know it was out last night and the on-call dude tells me, yeah this is going to suck because they want to replace it and it’s going to be out a good 3 weeks soon. My problem with this, other than the fact that I have pets and am not wanting to walk 6 floors 4 times a day with them, is that my husband is having back surgery at the first of the month. I’m dealing with a property management company that does not care if the elevator is out, apparently. I’m going to email them and ask them what is going on and let them know about his surgery, but what is the PM responsible for? Do they have to find an alternative for this elevator while it’s out? Has this happened to you? Will they put us up in a hotel? Will they give us free rent? Should we move? I’ve never lived somewhere with an elevator, so I need your input!

23,"Sorry for the bad structure, I don't really know how to put all of this into words. 
This has been happening for the past 6 months to a year. It started out with me just being lazy and sleeping more but it's gotten much worse and I've only recently stopped refusing to acknowledge the severity of it. Over the past 3 to 4 months, I've stopped doing anything, nothing interests me and I don't even do the things that do interest me. I've stopped enjoying video games, even thought I like being productive and even studying, I can't make myself do it. I rarely get out of my bed. I regularly sleep over 11 hours and wake up after 12 (I've been an extreme early bird my whole life, always waking up between 6 and 7 in the morning even if I sleep late). I very rarely feel anything other than neutral, just feeling numb and sadness usually due to not doing anything for the whole day and wasting my time. Sometimes i get randomly incredibly sad for no apparent reason and then feel even more upset and frustrated because I have no reason to feel that way. Other times I get filled with motivation and want to do things and be productive but I very rarely use that and most of the time I just end up not doing anything and then become even more upset that I wasted that motivation. In the past 2-3 months, the fact that I didn't really have a father when growing up has been affecting me much more, I  sometimes feel Intese sadness, anger and frustration at this and wish that I had a normal father and did the things sons and fathers do and had someone to look up to. My girlfriend of two years who I am in love with has stopped loving me and broken up, so I feel a lot of sadness and loneliness due to that. I've been having thoughts of self harm but something personal between me and my now ex prevents me from doing any self harm. I've been told to get help but always just brushed this off as me being lazy. I would consider getting help now that I acknowledge that this is a problem but I'm under 18 and I am not willing to talk to my family about this, besides I'm more than sure that my mother would simply tell me to stop being so lazy.

I am 18 years old and currently work for a tech company. A few months ago, all my friends moved to other cities to go to university.

29,"I (20,f) and my boyfriend (26,m) of 3 years are having an issue.

He feels he shouldn't have to invite me to do anything with him, because ""as a grown ass woman, I can just ask"". (Example: watching a movie). Fair enough point, but the issue is *everything* I suggest, he says no to.

Me: ""Do you want to X?""
Him: ""No.""
Me: ""What about X?""
Him: ""Not really.""
Me: ""X then?""
Him: ""Not today.""

So I told him this, and he said his ideas are ""more enjoyable"", yet he doesn't ever actually invite me to *do* to those ideas. I told him fine, if he doesn't want to spend time with me or invite me to do anything, I'll hang out with other people and leave him alone since he ""enjoys it"" (his words).

To which he replied he would rather just ""break up than be with a hoe"" (also his words).

Now I'm questioning whether it's actually wrong to hangout with other people when someone is flat out rejecting you/would rather be alone?

I guess, in my opinion, I feel like you should generally *invite* your partners to do something together, which he feels is an unrealistic and unfair expectation. I don't know if it's because we were raised different or what, but I feel it's pretty normal to have expectations of one another. I dunno, advice?

#TLDR: Boyfriend doesn't invite me to things and rejects my ideas to spend time together. Is it wrong to want to spend time with somebody else if he keeps rejecting/ignoring me?

Edit: he ended up ditching me for the night so I'm gonna go ahead and find someone to hang out with, thanks for the advice.

Edit 2: I get what you guys are saying but god good I love the dude, can you not be so harsh please? I just needed advice.

My wife I and are in Rome right now and about to get on a cruise ship tommorow. I've been feeling really sick since we left, motion sickness on both flights bouts of nausea and a lack of appetite for the last two days and sweating alot at night. And now I'm sitting up at night with a splitting headache that won't let me sleep :(
I've been drinking tons of water and trying different medicines but keep feeling crappy. 
I guess I'm writing for some advice. I've been on previous trips and had the lack of appetite and slight nausea but never this severe.
Does this happen to anyone else when you travel and if so how do you deal with it? we've got 10 days left in this trip and I don't think I can take this for that long.
Also any advice on telling my wife I might need to go home early would be appreciated. I'm pretty sure she got travel insurance but this is her dream trip and I don't want to disappoint her.

Technology (computers, phone, internet) really is the culprit. It just sucks me in. I'm probably more sensitive to it than the average person...and it just drains me of energy and throws my focus out of whack. It's like I can't focus on one thing...I just get sucked into everything. I get eye strain, easily overstimulated, and just feel controlled by it. It's really an issue in my life.

My doctor recently let me try Adderall -- and it absolutley helped. But I never wanted to take drugs...and didn't like the side effects.

I just want to feel revitalized every day. I wish technology didn't exist, because I wouldn't have these problems.

33,"So there’s this one woman I occasionally work with, and lately she’s been acting really weird.  Over the past week she’s started touching me, putting her hand on my back for no reason, and winking at me all the time.  She also used to stand far away when she was talking to anyone, but now with me she comes up and stands about  3 inches away from me.  I really like her, I just don’t know what to do in this situation.  I’m just trying to be careful. 

The other day when I showed up late to work she seemed upset because I hadn’t been around and talked to me for ten minutes about things,she just sort of cornered me.  The weird thing is she’ll look for opportunities to talk to me when no one is around, but when someone is watching she’ll restrain herself.  Yet I can’t seem to catch her after work (only once and it was before we’d really met).  

I was running back and forth in a rush all day and she just sort of pushed me and laughed as I was running around, and we laughed and talked for 10 minutes or so.  She was really shy to begin with so now I’m seeing a whole other side to her, she’s just really cute and fun.  I’m not used to office flirting because most of the people I’ve worked with are 20+ years older than me.  There are other younger people but we’ve never hit it off because I’m more serious about my responsibilities.  I like this woman and she seems to be making an effort to show interest I just don’t know how to proceed.


TL:DR:  Don’t’ know if I’m reading to much into these flirtations with this woman.  She’s exceptionally nice to everyone, but seeks me out and makes an effort t o poke fun at me, touch me, and laugh at my bad jokes.

My issue isn't really with all of them, just mainly with 1 of the brothers, his character is just of someone who I can never get along with, he's very pessimistic, prejudice, non-objective, hates everyone, takes losing in video games very serious and gets pissy, talks shit about others but can't handle it when others talk shit about him, very passive aggressive, total weasel and a coward of a guy... every time I try to bring in new people to our 'group' he hates on them, basically if its something he doesn't like he will hate on it x10 - not very open minded and I just can't tolerate him no more.

He wasn't always like this, he became like this when he got married or he was always like this it just took me years to find out...

I truly dislike him, don't like playing games with him and just flat out hate talking to him, he doesn't have any friends in real life (besides 1 that other guy with us) and I can see why, he's a very unlikable person... but I had no choice because he's part of our 'group'

I've tried to cut ties with him before and the group before, they just text me and apologize, ask where I've been, tell me to come back, etc. I've told the brother and he completely understands, his friend also understands, they know how he is...they have no choice because well 1 is a brother and the other is a childhood friend.

The thing is with me is that I really don't have any other group to play video games with and chill with, as you may know after 10+ years of talking and playing games with each other you are kind of used to each other.

Any advice and different point of view would be helpful, thanks in advance",15Jan2018,4
46,"I have an old group of friends.  We’re all lonely and spend our time hating everything.  We never have deep conversation, and we only talk about face value stuff, like what we do in class or what we think about people.  I’m the leader, one could say, of this group.  Everyone in the group hates each other for some reason and talks shit behind everyone’s back.  It’s a toxic cycle, and I’m trying to change myself.

Unfortunately for me, I don’t think they can function without me.  With our group, it’s not a “you’re welcome here,” it’s a “you belong here.”  To put it simply, we’re losers.  And I don’t want to be a loser any more.

If I spend any more time with them, I’m afraid it’ll start seriously hurting my ego.  I need to get away from them, but i don’t know how.",15Jan2018,2
47,"So I’m 23 years old and have been working for this great company since I was 18. I have moved up the ranks very quickly, much quicker than other people in my company. I’m a manager and am anywhere from 10-30 years younger than my peers. I got a nice, early start in my career. My higher ups have told me many times that I do a great job and I am the future of this company. Lately, though, I’m not happy. I’m working 12 hour days 5 days a weeks and on my days off I am getting calls/texts from my associates and other work related things. I never relax and I have very little time to myself. All I do is stress about work. 
When I get off I’m irritable and exhausted. I just want to sleep when I’m not at work. I’m probably clinically depressed and honestly I’ve become obese and probably have high blood pressure (don’t want to go to the doctor lol). I think if I were to quit my quality of life will improve significantly, but I’m not going to find another job that I will make the same money. I also don’t want to give up my career. This is a job that I can easily retire as a millionaire, but I’m not sure if I can hang in there another 30-40 years to see that. There are a lot of people in my position throughout this company that have heart attacks or other health problems and die young. 
Basically I’m just looking for advice on stepping down. I don’t want to quit the company totally, but maybe in a few years I’ll be ready to work 60-70 work weeks and be miserable. But now I just want to be happy and enjoy my youth. Any advice would be appreciated. ",15Jan2018,2

What is wrong with me?",15Jan2018,5
49,"My tiny student room is usually quite clean, but my desk can get a bit crowded since it’s small and I don’t have much room to put my stuff which is a lot. Since September I’ve had my bed break twice (never happened to me in my life), my shower stop working and my toilet seat with no lid come off and crack (same happened to another housemate). The landlord insinuated blame on my part when I told him about the broken bed that had collapsed and caved in, he said “What did you do as the bed is new?”. My housemates upon inspection confirmed it was not new and it was a clear case of wear and tear.

The landlord never informs us when he is coming he shows up randomly unannounced. One time I had just LITERALLY taken a sh-t &amp; of course he came 2 minutes after that, he looked at the toilet in disgust - I was about to clean it right after until he knocked on the door UNANNOUNCED.

Anyway, I went back to my parents home for the Christmas holidays and I was in a massive rush for the train, so in trying to put all my stuff together that I was to take home in a frantic hurry I knocked over some things and left a bit of a mess that if I was not so in a hurry to catch my train I would have cleaned up instantly. When I got back home I remembered that my bed was starting to cave in again so I informed the landlord. I came back and the bed had been fixed but not the toilet seat. He left the broken wooden planks on the floor by my bed. To fix another problem in the house (unrelated to my room) today he came and when he saw me he started screaming at me, “Your room is ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!” etc. just going off on me, the intensity of the aggression I found unnecessary!

Is it acceptable for them to shout like that? Even in the slight chaos from panickedly and hurriedly knocking stuff into my bags, I have seen many worse student rooms! With food, piled pizza boxes and plates all over - I’ve never had my room in that condition. The walls and desk are clean, literally it’s just I’ve got too much stuff and not enough space to put them all. What do you think, is what he did ok or do you think he was just pissed about me contacting him several times to fix stuff?",15Jan2018,25

She’s nice and we have friendly chemistry but I don’t want to have a ‘friend’ that only talks to me when they want something. Is there a nice way I could confront/tell her I don’t think we should talk anymore? I’m not sure how to do it.

57,"I've always considered myself fairly good natured and easy to get along with, but even as a kid, deep down, I've always had feelings of anger. I rarely ever became upset enough to let it out, but it was always there. It sort of registered into self hatred as a teenager, but that may be something more common.

Well, I'm almost 30 years old, and I've been doing a lot of reflecting lately. In a lot of ways, I'm not too good when I have time alone with my thoughts, but I'm trying to sort my life out, and I've needed time to think. And I feel like I've come to realize a lot of terrible things.

For one, I really have no sense of who I am. I used to always associate myself as ""the geek"" or ""the loser"", but even those don't feel they apply to me. I don't hold any interest in the things I grew up loving anymore. I used to love Star Wars, for example, but now... I just feel completely indifferent. And not just about that, but about everything.

Then, there's the feeling of... I dunno, ""betrayal""? For being a ""nice guy"". My best friend has done more than any person could ever hope to expect for me, and basicslly saved my life. And yet, in so many ways, I sometimes feel like he doesn't really think that much of me. He obviously *wants* me to do well and had helped me get to where I am in life, but as someone who is deathly anxious when it comes to talking to women, I feel he just doesn't care that it's something I struggle with or bothers me (in fairness, he is not only married, but has always had girls hit on him or react favorably when he flirts, even when it's over the top of cheesy).

Another example -- and something that has more directly triggered my anger lately -- is my new roommate situation. Last year, I was looking for a new place to live, and one of our neighbors said he was to rent a room, so it worked out, and I've been here about 6 months.

We were friendly neighbors before, and I would say have become legimitate friends since. Yet, little annoyances have crept up, but as always, I've been super polite and never made anything out to be a big deal. The house always feels gross, because there's cat hair or cat vomit everywhere, he's eaten my groceries in the past (after politely asking him to stop a few times, he seems to have finally stopped), just stuff like that is sort of annoying but never seemed big enough to create a scene about.

Yet, when I get up in the morning, if the dish washer is full, then I rinse my dishes and leave them in the sink, because I'm busy to head to work. He is apparently upset about this, and has mentioned it to my friends (our neighbors), despite the fact he CONSTANTLY leaves dishes in the sink (which doesn't bother me, for the record). And he seems to be getting super pissy about it.

And you know what? All I can think is, ""I've been nothing if not a super courteous roommate. If he's going to bitch about something, then maybe I ought to start being an asshole, because I'm not some fucking rug to walk on"".

And if that sounds extreme to.you guys, well... it feels that way, too.

But at the same time, I'm starting to feel like putting all this effort into trying to be a ""good person"" just isn't getting me anywhere.

It's like... All of my anger, it feels like this fire, deep down. And I'm trying to let the embers die out, but no matter how hard I try to be nice and friendly with people, to go out of my way to help others, it's like there's nothing else for me. Nobody wants to be MY friend, to help me with MY problems. It's like my furnace is empty, and my anger is the only thing left that makes me feel alive.

I... don't know how to put it into words. It's just a strange kind of loneliness, where I feel like nobody around me understands -- or more importantly, CARES -- how I'm feeling. Like I'm secretly broken, but trying to hobble together and pretend like everything is fine, but people only want to take.

I just wish I could channel all this anger and hatred into something positive, like working out or dieting. I'm trying, but I just keep stumbling and failing, and it feels like nobody's got my back.",15Jan2018,2

It's honestly pretty sad, can anyone tell me how to stop doing this, what I'm doing wrong, or if this is normal?? I don't think it is. How do you guys keep friends for a long time?

59,"I was talking to my little sister about how no one is supposed to touch her etc because my mom is really bad at that so I decided to do it myself. And she said “But daddy tickled my tushy” 

Of course in my mind I was freaking out. I asked her to tell me what happened. She said she and him were in my parents room and he was working. Apparently she asked him to tickle her there. She said “It tickled. Then he asked if it was funny. I said yes and he went back to work.”

I’m hoping that she’s just confused and he tickled her stomach. I’m starting to get paranoid. My dad likes to take her to places a lot. For example, the other day he wanted to go to Walmart to wait for the car to be fixed. He would’ve have sat there for hours doing nothing. He wanted to take my sister and I said no because why would you take a young child to sit for hours being bored. 

And he puts her to bed a lot. My mom and dad switch days because my sister needs someone to lie by her until she falls asleep. She always asks for my dad to. 

My dad, which I’ve forgot to mention is my stepdad and sisters biological dad, is an asshole . My brother, who is not related to my stepdad, has met him and said he gives off creepy vibes. 

Should I be worried? I’ve been quiet because I’m scared. ",15Jan2018,11
60,"SO! A little context: Recently have I discovered that the man I am dating is so very hateful of many people and whatnot. Very vocal of his political beliefs, it wasn't long into the time we've spent together that he became very bold to declare them regarding his obsessive admiration of Trump, contempt for blacks, camp or otherwise effiminate gay/lgbt folk (especially lesbians or most women really), and trans folk, #lowkey racism, and general intolerance of others doing things he just doesn't like. In public is he very courteous and polite but to me is he brave enough I suppose to say such out loud. 

Myself am I (if I dare say so) relatively hippieish- I try to support all peeps in love and peace and harmony and shit.

Despite our incongruent beliefs and his attitudes, I want to help him. Talking with my friends have they warned there is nothing to be done to help save chuds like him who hold so much hate. 
But I want to believe through educating and arguing and discussing sensitive issues or topics like these am I and are we able to breakthrough and help folk realize discriminating or hating or being intolerant of others based on racist ideas and whatnot is not the way.

61,"I grew up with a narcissistic mother, I was verbally abused for 18 years and that obviously caused me some mental issues. I really had no one growing up, so from a very young age I planned my escape from my mother.  

After high school I was going to travel and ""find myself""  but I got into a very serious relationship, I  ended up living with my boyfriend  and going to school so I could be with him, he was the only person I had, he was my rock. We were together, attached to the hip for 9 months. He passed away 3 months after I started university. I spent months seeings therapists, being on meds but nothing seemed to help me.  When my boyfriend died, I moved in with his roommate, who I developed feelings for shortly after. We slept together numerous times and for a few months I was led to believe the feeling was mutual, only to find out I was wrong the entire time and now there's a new girl in the picture.

65,"I'm 22 and my life hasn't moved forward in the slightest since high school. Yeah, I've matured, got a girlfriend, have a great group of friends, but my life still feels incredibly empty. My parents are shitty people who only care about religion, I can't find a job, university fees and loans are stressing me out, I honestly have no motivation to do anything except play video games all fucking day. If it's not hanging out with friends or playing video games, I don't want anything to do with it. I have a loving girlfriend who supports me, but she doesn't understand my school situation. I am stupidly critical of myself now because of how shitty I feel for being 22 and not having moved forward at all with my life. I know I'm young and have plenty of time, but I can't help but feel shitty about being so behind. To elaborate on critical, if I do anything that might be immature, or something that a 22 year old wouldn't do, I start to judge myself and think of myself as useless and childish. If I walk through the mall with my friends and buy nothing, I start to feel like a mall rat who only has the mall to hangout because his parents house is occupied or something. I hate feeling this way and I can't talk to anyone about it, not even my girlfriend. I just feel embarrassed. 

Not much excites me these days. I don't take much pleasure in things. Hanging out with my friends is great though, I do feel genuinely happy and I do have a good time, same with my girlfriend but otherwise, nothing excites me. Sometimes I think about travelling alone for a while to explore, but then I talk myself out of it and can't bring myself to do it.

I get really lonely too. I was just chatting with my friend in discord while playing a game, and after he left I just felt lonely and I wanted to talk to somebody.

I want more things to be excited about so bad. I miss when I was a kid and tiny little surprises would make me so happy, but now there's none of that. I was super happy about getting my guitar, but now I don't even find much pleasure in playing despite it being one of my biggest passions.

I don't know, I just feel really empty like there's nothing in life I have to look forward to. So what if I get my degree and a 9-5 job? That's what I'll be doing, working to live. I just don't feel like that's a great life but it's what I feel like I need to do. I'd love to branch off and have my own business, but this stuff feels out of my league right now.

She was wearing a bright purple nail polish this time. And then it all went bad. We starting play wrestling around cause we always do it. And it ended up with me grabbing onto her leg and just grabbing her feet and smelling them and touching them while she was freaking out telling me to stop.

It was like my body was moving for me though. I wanted them so badly and I just went for it I guess and I tried to stop but I couldn't. So she kicked me in the face eventually and I guess it snapped me back into reality so I got up and started running. I've just been walking around my city since. That was at about 5:00AM. I finally just walked into Target and bought a phone charger and went to McDonald's to plug in my phone. I don't know what to do though because she's one of my roommates and I don't really want to go home and face her right now. She did text me a few times and I have like 3 missed calls from her.

77,"Hi,
I am in a weird situation and could use some advice. 
So I am recent graduate. I have just finished my Masters Degree few month ago. I've been applying to few positions. Recently I've been invited to an interview for a big company, but position required 5+ years of experience. After an interview I have received a positive feedback from the company, but they referred me to a different role (graduate engineer). I've been asked to send my grades to them. At that time, I thought grades were for proving that I was in college, so I screenshoted the results to them(was not complete list). 
      After few days I received an invite to an interview, which was full day interview on site and consisted of working environment as a team, programming test, interview and 2 hour aptitude test. So I went in and did all that. There were huge delays of getting results back, but that was no problem for me. After few weeks I get a phone call that said I have passed the interview day with positive results. 
     After the call, I've been asked to fill-out a medical form and supply references, 1 academic and 1 from my current work. In a day or two, I received another phone call as references and medical have passed. The phone call started with I have great news for you, I want to read out the benefits for you working for the company...  
     So i need to pause here for a second and add one thing before proceeding. I have 56 and 57 % from my bachelors degree and masters.,.which counts to be a 2.2 result. 
   Continued the phone call  the person said you just will have to supply document saying you have a 2.1 (which is 60%+).. I had no idea that I need that result to join them, so I said I don't have a 2.1 result, at which point the person sounded like they didnt know what to say or do(as I don't think they were in that situation before)and said they need to get back to me so as they thought I have achieved required result. 
    So I waited another 3 weeks for an answer incase they would make an exception since I passed all tests thrown at me. I get a phone call saying that unfortunately its a no.

The problem I have is that since I passed whole interview daytestsreferencesmedical, I was pretty much already guaranteed a place there... but because I was short few % in my exams they said no. Since I was pretty sure I got a job, while waiting pretty much 2months I have denied 2 jobs elsewhere as that was the company I wanted to work for.. 
    So I find myself in a paradox... I have shown by passing everything that I am capable to work by their standards, but still got a no after such long wait and from I have great news , to no, because my average % is short. 
     I have tried emailing the places I have denied before that circumstances changed, was the position taken etc.. but not a single one replied in last 2 weeks. So I find myself in a dark place at the moment. I cant sleep sometimes since I feel so cheated. 

Do you guys think its a good idea to email the company recruiter and ask them to reconsider(I have talked to the person good few times, even met them on the interview day face to face and they were very pleasant) And also explain to them that it was their fault really(in nice words) that they did not check properlyor missed my % shortage Do I tell them I have refused job offers since I thought I got job with them I do feel like I am capable to work there and I really want to..
I do realise its a long, complex question. Thank you for any answers!",15Jan2018,2
79,"How do I start sexting on Snapchat when I don’t even know if the guy is interested?

I’m not a Snapchatter (I haven’t logged in in four years) and I’ve kind of dabbled in setting, but always anonymously.  

A recent crush asks for nudes on Snapchat on a regular basis, and normally the idea would turn me the fuck off, but I find myself extremely turned on by the idea.

I’m just nervous because I’ve only done this anonymously and I have no idea how he’ll respond.  We’re both musicians and active in our local community - so we’ll run into each other from time to time.

82,"So I’ve never posted to here but here we go... I’m 23 and a senior in college close to being done but have lost all motivation to do any schoolwork. I’ve always been bad with homework but I’ve seen it become progressively worse.  I’m still okay with tests which is really the only thing keeping me afloat. 

I’ve had a long rough road in college. Out of high school I went to a college and lived there, had an absolutely terrible GPA and transferred to a community college after a year. I took a year off to work and went back two years ago.  I’m entering my potential final semester of college. 

My parents love me and try to support me in every way possible with school work to the point where my mom has watched me do homework for my winter term class but I’ve managed to manipulate her into thinking I’ve completed my work and have been classifying myself as a degenerate. 

I hate the fact I’ve been lying to them and being so lazy but I cannot find any motivation inside of me to give any sort of shit for homework that’s vital to my grade. 

I was never this bad in high school with schoolwork but got like this when I entered college and I still consider myself a relatively intelligent person and although I enjoy drinking, it’s not the reason it gets in the way of me being lazy. 

I’m hoping someone out there has went through something similar and got through it and can help me get motivation to finish my degree. ",15Jan2018,2

85,"It all started when I got a viral sinus infection that caused excess mucus to drain down my throat which resulted in a hoarse voice. The doctor I saw knew most of my family was sick and still prescribed steroids that weakens my immune system. Having never taken these steroids I didn't know it would do that until I picked up the prescription. I had taken it anyways because my voice was not getting better on its own. Because my immune system was weakened I ended up catching a stomach bug my dad had. I stopped taking the steroids immediately and ended up with diarrhea for three days. I was fine three days after, I went to my friends, ended up catching a little cold of some sort. I finally started feeling better the beginning of last week and now I'm sick for a fourth time because my brother contracted and passed a type of flu he got from his friends at school (his friend was at Med Express today) to my dad, me, and  my boyfriend who was over the house three days ago. Just to add my brother who passed the flu can't get the flu shot due to health reasons so that's completely out of the question of trying to prevent the spread of illness, it's his friends parents who idiotically don't give their children the flu shot and results in immune compromised children like my brother contracting the flu, and also pretty much an outbreak at the school every winter. I tried everything to prevent these illnesses. Cough medicine, cold medicine, raw garlic, raw onions, drinking fluids, getting sleep, sweating it out.

86,"So, I want to spend this summer in the Czech Republic, seeing all of the stuff that's there, my family, and visiting my girlfriend. I'm 16, I would like to go alone and do things at my own pace and as I like, and if I went with my father we'd just fight the entire time. I'd pay for all of my expenses and stay with family or close family friends. However he won't let me. He said we could go if we went together, which would be for 2 weeks compared to 2 months. He'd control everything I do and everywhere I'd go, and if I disagree we'd fight. 

So I propose a compromise. He'd go there with me during his time off, we'd spend some time there together, then he'd fly back and I'd spend the rest of the summer there. 

Immediately this was shot down, as it has to be ""under [his] terms."" I know he's worried about me, and that he wants to spend time with me there as it would be my first time. What I proposed covers all of this; we'd spend time together, and I'd be with him or people he trusts to watch me. It's not that he doesn't find me responsible, as he does, but *it just has to be under his terms*.

Now I think the main reason he thinks this is because of my girlfriend. If you haven't guessed, this is a long distance relationship, and spending *2 months* with her would be amazing. 

But of course, he thinks we're just going to have sex. Now, I can assure you both of us don't want that, yet. Neither of us are ready and there's too many risks, especially with our situation. The most we'd do is cuddle the entire time. But he doesn't trust me. Or at least, not her.

Now, I've offered him to talk to her to get to know her, so he could talk to her and get to know her. He agrees and then doesn't do anything.

So, any ideas as to what I can do?",15Jan2018,3

93,"Some of the details in this post might be a little NSFW.

Basically, about a month ago, I started to date this girl who I had been friends with for a while. We're both pretty young, although our past experiences with relationships are a bit different; she's never had a boyfriend before me, nor had she had her first kiss until she started to date me (perfectly normal, I just feel that pointing that out will give a bit more context to the situation). 

However, when it comes to me, I dated throughout high school and lost my virginity at 16 (I hope this doesn't come across as me trying to brag, but this is something she's aware of and I feel that she often feels pressured because of this). 

So fast forward a little, and on one of our dates we were making out in my car and she let me take her shirt off and start sucking her breasts. I took her home and everything seemed ok, but then the next time that we did this, she started to cry afterwards and when I asked why she basically said that she ""lets me do that stuff to please me"". As she puts it, she does a lot of that stuff because she's afraid that I'll get bored of her if she doesn't, and eventually leave her (this is why I mentioned that I think my experiences in the past pressure her into doing stuff she's not comfortable with).

A few days ago we were making out on her bed and she told me to ""go lower than I usually do"", which I took as fingering her or going down on her. Once I started to take off her panties I asked if she's **really** ok with me doing that. She said yes, but I stopped because I felt like she was just saying that. And as I guessed, when she was saying goodbye to me, she started to cry and told me the same ""I do it to please you"" spiel again. I tried telling her that there's more to a relationship than that and I really don't care if we don't do it. (I mean, obviously it's fun and all, but not at all worth the risk of making her feel like she just gave herself up for me).

Like I said, I've tried telling her we don't need to do that stuff, but every time we start to make out she *tells* me that she wants me to do it, only to start crying afterwards because she didn't actually want it.
 
We've tried discussing it so many times, what can I do to tell her and explain to her that that's not all I want from her?

TLDR - Girlfriend has never had a boyfriend before me, thinks she needs to do sexual things to please me and keep me, but I've told her she doesn't. How can I explain and convince her that I don't want that and we don't have to do that?",15Jan2018,1
94,"My parents have split up, and since I don't currently make enough money to live on my own, I travel between each ones house depending mostly on my mood. However, about 2 years ago I refused to go back to my Dad's house due to how dirty he allowed it to get. About a little over a week before I left I spent, alone, nearly 15 hours in one day trying to clean his house. He refused to help, saying it was unnecessary and telling my that no matter how much I cleaned it would just get dirty again. This broke my heart since, personality wise, I get along with my Dad a lot more than my Mom. However, I gave up. I told him that I would not be able to come and live with him until he straightened up and cleaned his house for himself. When I left it was flee infested, rats in the ceiling, molding in bathrooms, browning toilets, and so on and so fourth. While I lived with him I would generally try to keep the house in as much order as I could, but I was the only one doing so. Going to college, going to work, and cleaning a depressing house all on your own wears a person down.

This time, I was more or less forced back into my Dad's house. I had been with my Mom this whole time, she and I were really starting to fight and she honestly just lives too far away from both my work and my school. Work is fine since I get shit hours, but not for school. Living nearly an hour away by car is just too much for me personally(I took last semester off for financial reasons and that just so happen to be when my Mom moved). I told my Dad over a month in advance that I would be coming back and that the house needs to be clean when I come over.

To no surprise, it's not. Not in the slightest. I can't take this anymore. I can't. It's worse than when I left. His """"""""""cleaning""""""""""(if anyone can call it that) was vacuuming and sweeping. The toilets are (newly from the last time I cleaned them) browned, there's mold in the only shower, hair and dust all over, he's never stepped foot or even opened my door since I left. I can't do this. I can't spend another entire day cleaning his own fucking house. He has no excuse. He's nearly a hermit, only leaving his house to go to work or get food, without his dog I'm confident in saying he could spend days without saying a word if I weren't around. He stays home and plays Hearthstone(mostly) all day then goes to work, then repeat. There's no excuse to me telling him so long in advance and there be no progress... What do I do? When I tell him the house needs to be cleaned, he says it's useless.

I can't do this anymore, my Mom and her asshole of a boyfriend just annoy me to absolutely no end, we do nothing but fight and get by at this point, and my Dad is so useless but at least he doesn't make me wish I could bash my head in. I can't live with my boyfriend since we're in a LDR and he still lives with his parents. I feel so helpless... What do I do?",15Jan2018,6
95,"I'm 18 years old, American, not white (which will become pertinent,) and just got out of highschool. What I plan to do afterwards is neither here nor there because the problem I'm dealing with is abit more....well, let me just say it. 

I don't feel like I fit with other people. I'm not a socially awkward or depressed person by any means, and infact I can do well enough with most people. I can talk the crap, put on a personality, say the thing that seems to make the most sense but nothing more - go through the motions, in other words, but I don't feel like it's genuine. Social interaction is chore, not something I can enjoy, but I very much want to enjoy it, and I just feel like a clumsy idiot talking to most people. 

I can attribute the cause of this to few things in my personal story that aren't worth telling, but in short; I was socially withdrawn as a kid thanks to retrospectively trivial 'bullying' stuffing my childish enthusiasm down my throat, I put on a goofy and wisecracking persona around middle school not to end up a loner, and in High School - as I mentioned before - I could get along with a wide range of people as a result. I adapted. I stand in a weird middle ground between my American side and my other side (""Dear god! Could he be a Muslim!?!?!?"" I hear someone jokingly speculate, in bad taste,) and I don't feel compatible with peers of my culture nor the White/Black American cultures that predominate here, and I don't particularly care for most of the fads. I have my own preferences for what I like that I've developed naturally - thanks to the access to stuff I normally wouldn't see that the internet provides.  

That wasn't really short, but fuck it. Like I was saying, despite it all, I've never felt a sense of belonging with people before - wherever I go I can't hold decent conversation, and it's seriously bothering me. I'm both articulate with my words and horrible with them I somehow write like some wanna-be intellectual with my fingers on the keyboard and yet at the same time my internal articulation is either too brief or too convoluted. I don't fit. I can't communicate with people normally. Maybe that's why I can get along with so many, I'm just weird.

Anyways, I'd appreciate any advice you people could give.

96,"Hi. Im 21 and this is the first time I will be filing my taxes for a full time job that I’ve had for an entire year, as I got hired where I now work on November of 2016.

My concern is that when I actually filed them through the H&amp;R Block app, the actual return it stated that I was going to receive was far less than the tax return calculators were saying I should receive. Should I just pay to have my taxes done so a professional can do them? Where could I go to receive help with my taxes? How expensive is it to have someone do tour taxes? Is your tax return supposed to be a fixed amount depending on your income and taxes paid?

99,"I’m currently a senior. But I don’t feel like I’m ready for college at all yet, I only just had my first college tour a couple days ago, and I haven’t applied anywhere. And I’m not ready for college yet. I’m not mature enough to do that yet. I didn’t value my time enough in high school. And while my GPA was a 3.8 last quarter, I did very poorly my freshman and sophomore year due to depression. I borderline failed my classes sophomore year because I got very depressed after my sister died. I need one more year of high school. I want one more year of marching band because I don’t think I’m ready to leave that yet either. Is this even possible to do? 

EDIT: I’m beginning to feel like I don’t want to go to college. Or maybe I just want a gap year. I definitely feel that I am not mature enough to go to college yet. I’ve always been a little behind with this. Most of my friends are juniors and sophomores, and I’m currently dating a sophomore from my marching band. I don’t even have my license or permit yet because I don’t think I’m mature enough to drive yet. I kind of want to see what a gap year can do.

100,"To be clear these girls aren't anyone we know or see in person. It's only girls in bands or actresses, things of that sort. Sometimes we'll be listening to a song and he'll be like ""Her voice is hot"" or ""This girl is hot"" and it makes me feel awkward and uncomfortable. I really wish he wouldn't do this because it hurts my feelings, but I don't want him to feel like he has to hide or change anything about himself. Also, I would really hate him talking about girls with his guy friends and having to find out about it later or something. I don't want to feel like he's a separate person with other people than he is with me. I don't want him to feel like he has to hide part of himself.   

There have also been some other things that have been bothering me as well. He has a younger brother with a friend who's a jerk (especially when it comes to women). He makes comments that really upset me and tries to get my boyfriend to say stuff I wouldn't like. Apparently one night while I was asleep the friend showed my boyfriend a picture of some Instagram model and asked him if he'd rather fuck her or me. Boyfriend told me about this and said he'd pick me, but if he could have both he would. Another time this guy was also talking about how much p-ssy you'd get playing football in Miami to my boyfriend and asked him to picture it. I could tell my boyfriend thought about it for a second, smiled and did kind of a chuckle thing? So obviously he was thinking about it and liked the idea.   

Part of why this hurts my feelings is I feel like I'm holding him back. Like, if he wants to have sex with other girls shouldn't he be able to? I hate being the only reason he isn't. I would be happy if he just genuinely didn't want to, but I feel like it's only because he knows I wouldn't like it. I actually don't have a desire to have sex with anyone else. I think I might be demisexual. I don't have much of an attraction to anyone other than my partner. There are sometimes people I find good looking, but 'oh, that's a good looking person' is as far as my thoughts go. There's not anything sexual about it.  

I really love being monogamous. The longer we're together the better sex gets for me, and the stronger my attraction grows. Additionally, any attraction I would've had for someone else in the past diminishes. I'm afraid it's the opposite for him. I hear guys complain about being with the same person all the time.   

I haven't actually talked to him about any of this. I don't know how to. I pretend it doesn't phase me when this stuff happens. I'm afraid I'll be seen as unreasonable and irrational (not because he makes me feel this way, but because of past relationships). And I'm scared I'll find out things I don't want to know. What if he DOES want to have sex with other people? How am I going to handle that information? I'm not ready to hear that he does. It's going to tear me apart if I actually hear it.   

One last thing is that I'm the first and only person he's slept with. Before him, I slept around and dated quite a bit before I realized it just wasn't for me. So I've got my experimental stuff out of the way, whereas he hasn't yet. That's another really big insecurity of mine.  

What do I say if I do talk to him? What should my expectations be? I just don't know how to navigate this situation. I want to change myself more than anything, so I can be normal. But I've tried and it doesn't work. ",15Jan2018,13

I understand the ideas and concepts of living with grief, and even if I didn't, there's so much material out there on it. But this feels different...

How do I sort through these feelings? Does anyone here have advice on feelings to avoid putting too much thought into?

I'm stuck in a rut right now, y'know, depression, no job, no school. No purpose? I have a bf of 5 years that I live with (I'm 21 F btw) and things are a bit bland. But I should also note my mom is overbearing, and my dad lives with my bf and I temporarily. So I guess it's also weird that my dad's always around and sometimes you just want to sit naked on the couch with your bf and smoke a joint, and I can't do that lol. Anyway.. basically, I feel like I need a more positive outlook on life, some motivation, some drive.
Another issue is the bland relationship: I feel kind of like, we should be more grown up and responsible together, but usually we just kind of coexist, and I guess I want more than that? Like, me and my bf don't seem to be able to sit down and watch a movie anymore? It's weird..
Anyway;

Tldr; I'm bummed out and am looking for advice to get myself more positive and motivated!

116,"So, I have always had a problem with my mom's dog, though it wasn't until I was left in full care of him that I have almost completely given up dealing with him. I've tried to bond with him and give him the care and attention he deserves, but the only things I get in return is shit. Sometimes literally. My mom was recently deployed, and I agreed to take care of her animals, but her GSD is just a problem. He is obedient when directly asked to do things, but when he is given the freedom to make his own choices and isn't monitored 24/7, he is just a real selfish dirtbag. She hasn't neutered him, and within the first week of her being gone, he was marking all over the house. So, I confined him to her room when it was too cold for him outside. Then he started peeing in her room. So I put him in his crate. He broke out of his crate no matter what I did. He has bent the metal bars and broken all the clips I use to reinforce the latches. So I put him in the bathroom. It didn't take him long to learn how to open the door. I have to lock this dog in the bathroom whenever I need him confined because it is too cold outside for him to sit in the back yard. It seems like every time I let my guard down and give him a little freedom, he ruins the house and wastes my time. I had to clean up 3 piles of dog diarrhea in the house because he broke the crate and got into the cat food.

Yes, he gets plenty of time to go pee and poop outside.
Yes, he has access to clean water.
Yes, I feed him daily.

I don't know what to do. Every time I see this dog my jaw tightens and I feel physically repulsed. I've tried giving him attention, but he is constantly wanting to be in my personal space all the time no matter how much attention I give him and I just hate it. My mom loves him, and I have tried to love him too, but every time I think our relationship is getting better, he does something that just angers me to no end. What the hell do I do? Keep tolerating this until she gets back of course, but how do I give the dog the attention that he needs when it just disgusts me being around him? At this point, I'm sure he can tell I hate his guts.",15Jan2018,2
118,"This has been an issue my ENTIRE life. 

When i was a little kid, i attended a chess club for about 2-3 months. I never felt I was good enough and when my chess teacher mentioned to my parents that I can go to a chess tournament I stopped going to lessons. I stopped playing chess in general. My teacher had been contacting my mother months after this to ask where I am but i refused to go back.This has been the case with basketball (quit when the coach yelled at me for improper technique - i was 1 grade), swimming (after never performing well on competitions for 3 years), skiing(after they jokingly said we would ski a reaaaally steep and scary looking for a kindergartener slope), dancing (tried three times, always felt clumsy and scared to go into the cypher, though all of the teachers were saying i am doing good).

Then at school. At first i wanted to study biology. Changed my mind when even though I was performing really well and was competing at Olympiads performing really well, my teacher gave me lower marks and never encouraged me (I was in middle school. Encouragement was quite important then). 

Then I switched to Physics. In a year I was interested in Astronomy. Worked my ass off to go to a Olympiad, proved that I can be as good as people learning Astronomy for years and then next year I began slacking off, not solving enough problems, not practicing enough, thinking I am not good enough and at the same time reassuring myself that if I want and put in the work I could perform well enough. Then i just finished high school and automatically enrolled on an engineering course. 

I love the course but because of this attitude i have kind of forgotten how to work hard and regularly. I am constantly afraid I won't be able to succeed and this leads to procrastination, putting all the work aside and turning my attention to other things. And everything I need to do is study. Just put in the time.

Then... what actually made me write this post. With dancing and surfing for example I begin with a steady progress. Then reach a point where I need to break a mental barrier (a huge wave or headstand or going into a cypher) and am afraid i won't be able to do it and want to make it perfect from the first try (which is result of the fear that if i don;t do it perfectly, i will hurt myself - physically or emotionally).

Another part of my life i've observed this behavior in is with relationships. Let's say I crush on somebody really hard. I am ready to do everything and anything for them. Then, when things get serious and they show interest in me, I begin to find all the flaws I haven't noticed before (or just ignored) and lose interest.  Sometimes, I even get uncomfortable in their presence. And i hate this! Because i hate hurting people's feelings. But when I realize i feel super uncomfortable around a person I begin to ignore or avoid them. I have no explanation for this. 

I just begin things and then never finish them. And usually I am really stubborn person! I want to be one of those people that once they start something they lead it to its end. I dont know if this behavior is caused due to perfectionism, laziness, short attention span, low confidence or just immaturity. I really want to change but dont know how. Deciding to just stick to whatever I have began and don't find excuses is easier said than done. Yeah, I need a bit of advice.",15Jan2018,3

121,"So, on Xbox I have known this guy, and something happened recently and it just left a sour taste in my mouth. So I need strangers to give me advice about what to do.

Originally I wrote this in paragraphs but that was way too long, so here.

-met him via overwatch in October 
-we played together twice but lost contact
-reconnected in December (around the 20th)
-he keeps flirting w/ me (especially about my voice bc I got my tongue pierced and I couldn’t talk properly)
-he confesses that he likes me
-I only just realise
-I freak out and block him
-two weeks later I unblock him
-we act like nothing happened
-he confesses his love again
-our mutual friends dog dies (he told me)
-he tells me to try cheer her up
-I say I’m bad at it
-he tells me I can bc I’m ‘a girl’ 
-I say no and he says that I’m a shit friend to the girl
-I find out he’s been saying that I’m not his friend
-I tell him if he’s not my friend he wouldn’t care if I blocked him.
-I tell him he’s a piece of shit and blocked him.

I had been talking to the girl via voice chat throughout the day. (don’t worry I’m not a complete bitch.) She says that we’re all good and that she wasn’t annoyed at me in the first place. 

I just want advice. Should I reconnect with the guy or not? He’s just sorta weird, and his texts make me feel uncomfortable, and his friend always tries to get rid of me, and that girl I was talking about likes him.

AND I’m pretty sure when I first met him his friend said something about this girl that he liked, and then yesterday I played with her in a party. So it’s not like I’m his only crush. He’ll do fine without me. I don’t really want anything to do with him because I just feel weird. 

But the whole reason I’m asking for advice, is because I feel so fucking rude, (and I probably was)
He’s nice but as I said he just makes me feel uncomfortable a lot. 

Like I said at the start of this post, it’s just leaving a sour taste in my mouth, and it’s been bugging me the entirety of tonight, and yesterday night.

122,This isn't really to serious but I'd still like some advice. For some reason discord brings out the worst of me. I'm in a discord server for a YouTube who does theories on video games sort of. I've been banned many times but some how weaseled my way back in and I have made some friends there. About a few hours ago I got into a really big argument about not having something that a lot of other well known and long term members had. It's sort of immature but I do dumb stuff when it's late at night. This eventually led to me getting muted for who knows how long and I came back on an alt and started the argument again. I'm sure people opinions about me have decreased by a lot because I was being whiny and childish. I honestly just want to fix this mess. :/ ,15Jan2018,1

125,"Some background, may be vague at risk of getting identified. We're both males the same age between 19 and 22. We've been super close friends with each other for a while. Basically communicate with each other 24/7. We do a lot of things that would easily be considered a date if we were dating. Also we're both single if that matters.

He's my best friend regardless of these feelings and it would suck to ruin that by telling him I think I love him. That's a worst case scenario though, I'm honestly not sure how someone would react in this situation. Also, it's not urgent that I tell him, our friendship would continue normally, as it doesn't create any tension from my perspective.

On the other hand life is too short not to take risks, I'd probably regret not telling him in the future. Even if it does ruin the friendship I can always find more friends. Not to mention if he said he felt the same way that would be pretty cool^(understatement of the century).

I'm really not sure how I would tell him though, whether it be over text, discord call, or in person. I want to maintain our friendship but I don't think that's possible if I tell him, regardless of how I do it.

I've never felt this way about another man before so I'm not even sure if what I'm feeling is real, until recently I've considered myself 100% straight, I'm starting to question that now.

Any advice would be appreciated.

134,"Hi guys, I didn't really know where to post this, but hopefully this will be fine here

So recently my Christmas casual contract has ended at a retail shop. Admittedly, I am mildly neurotic, so being unemployed, even for the 10 days it lasted drove me absolutely insane, and as a result I applied for every job that I had available to me. This resulted in me being offered a job at a local coffee shop in a shopping centre. However, on top of this, I also have an interview at a local McDonald's.

Basically, a lot of my stress is stemming from if I get offered a job at McDonald's, whether I take it or not. I know that there is a lot of stigma in working at McDonald's especially if it isn't your first job, but they pay better than the coffee shop, and I imagine that the hours would be longer. However, I also imagine the work would be slightly harder, and the grease would be immense. The main hope also is that I'd be working in the McCafe area if that makes any difference.

I'm going into university this year, and I need to work somewhere that will give me the funds to actually have a social life during this time. 

I would just like some advice on what course of action to take, because right now I am feeling really confused over what exactly I should be doing. If anyone has experience working in both McDonald's and a coffee shop, that would really be helpful

138,"That was on tour with one of my favourite bands added me on insta completely out of the blue. I checked out his profile, saw he had a girlfriend and kids &amp; lived in a different country. 

I myself am engaged &amp; was just curious to see how he had found my profile &amp; if we had mutual friends or whatever. The only thing I could think of was that I follow the singer of the band he was on tour with, and somehow he had added me from his page? Idk. 

Anyway, never spoke to the dude till a couple of days later till I posted an insta story about watching Star Wars, and he started up a conversation in my dms. 

I asked him where he’d found me, told me he’d been drinking and couldn’t remember. 
The conversation went backwards and forwards for a while (I was super curious about what it was like to be on tour with my favourite band) &amp; he kept sending me photos of himself trying to be, what I imagine in his eyes, all cute and sexy. Cringey and inappropriate to me. 

Anyway, he kept trying to steer the conversation towards ‘cuddling’ and ‘playing in bed’, constantly mentioning he was in bed and tipsy. I ended the conversation here and went to sleep. 
The next day, more of the same. I pretty much shut the conversation down straight away as I wasn’t looking for any kind of flirty banter, and knowing he had a girlfriend and kids was making me super uncomfortable. 
Just as a side note, my partner knew and saw all of these conversations. 

So, because he quite clearly wasn’t gonna find a sexting pen pal fan girl in me, he unfollowed me and we never spoke again. 

I’ve just seen a post from a member of the band I follow congratulating this individual that his girl is pregnant again and this situation just keeps popping into my head. 

Should I tell his girl that he’s creepily adding girls and sending them seedy messages on social media? Does she already know and just puts up with it? Or should I just let it be and hope he grows a pair and stops his inappropriate behaviour? 

In the big scheme of things, their relationship has nothing to do with me. I don’t know either of them personally &amp; I would hate to be ‘that’ person that drives a wedge between a family, but if I were her I would want to know.

The issue that I have is mostly problematic within organization that I am part of however it's common in my everyday life in general public/work.
First a little background about me so you will understand my problem correctly.

I am direct and honest person, I try to follow logic and not emotions, this is especially true when I discuss, train and study within organization I am part of.
If I don't or do like something I say it and I do it directly, I do not soften/harden the words nor do I attack people personally.
I aim at actions and their result and try to find better ways, give my opinion on the matter or cite literature/established standards.
Knowing my limitations and knowledge I do not pose as a guru and always listen to others however I do feel strongly about my ideas/opinions which I DO change if given good enough arguments.

Often I find people taking things personally, getting offended, feeling threatened by discussion.
It's getting harder by the day and I am kind of starting to hate that more people think I'm an asshole. (or am I really just an asshole ?)

So.. I would like to understand why people get offended by discussion which is not ad persona.
How should I phrase my posts and how to speak about matters to minimize possibility to offend people.
What should I look out for in my posts to tell if I am an asshole/writing ad persona? - Sometimes I type something which is addressing issue but still is ad persona, that's why I proof read what I write and change my post accordingly.

Anytime I tell my mom I need help or I think I need to be on meds, she just says 'uh-huh' and nothing happens. She tells me I've been on a waiting list for the past year but I'm pretty certain that is a lie.

160,"I've had this really good friend in my childhood. We became friends cos our moms were friends and we did everything together, but then time went on and we kinda lost touch. We started to grow apart when I was ten and the only other time we saw each other was when we were 15. 


We were both at the awkward teenager phase so through out a three hour dinner, we didn't speak to each other once. We met each other again last night at a reunion dinner. Now that we're older we became better at socializing but you can still feel a bit of awkwardness in between conversations. I want to reconnect with her because we were really close last time but I have no idea what to say to her, she seemed like a familiar stranger.

161,"I'm looking into ""adult high school"" (VAVO) consisting mostly of people my age and up who for different reasons have not finished high school. 

All good, right?

Here's the problem. My excruciating fear of failure (it's pathetic, but even typing this it's taking all my strength to not start crying) is completely justified. I am completely abysmal at studying and at getting myself to do things - even dumb shit like finishing videogames. I have failed. Not just exams, but people who gave me ways out, who made excuses for papers I was months late to hand in, people willing to look past my technically insufficient grades and let me pass until I absolutely couldn't anymore..

Now, maybe in a school setting, with no distractions, I could get shit done. I have done so before, after all, albeit to varying degrees of success.

Even going into it with that mindset, what if I don't? What if I fail? Again? This time wasting even more money?

My depression had been with me for so long that I'm not even sure what motivation is (besides burst of mania regarding whatever my hyperfixation is at the moment) and I just feel really, really incapable and hopeless.

162,"Hello,
I have a question to ask you. How do you deal with creepy men?
 I recently had an encounter with one. I was coming home on Tuesday and before I reached the corner to my house this old guy appears. I heard him calling, but I thought he was calling for the guy walking in front of me. I stop, but  really did not want to because I was tired and really wanted to get home. This is the creepy part, he said that he wanted to marry me! I did not know this man nor do I want to. He kept asking me why I did not want to be with him,  Are you scared?  Yes , I was but I did not want him to know that because I do not know him. He asked me why I did not have a boyfriend. I lied about having one just so he could leave me alone but that only made him bolder.  This went on for 20 minutes. What`s worse is he kept saying he wanted to make love to me and wanted to is kiss me right then and  kept touching my hair and shoulders. By the then I just felt disgusted and really wanted to get out of the situation so I walked away. The thing that was the most disturbing is that I kept telling this man NO to all his questions I did not want to be with him, I DID NOT WANT TO MARRY HIM and he still kept trying to convince me to marry him. I walked back to the neighborhood store just to lose him. He comes in the store! I finally lost him when I told him I was leaving and had enough.  He still wanted my name and wanted to be friends, so I left him there. When I finally got home, I had to stand outside my house just to see that he did not follow me home. My house is visible to that store. I just hope that I do not have to see this man again because that encounter was very creepy. Should I have handled it better? Advice please.

163,"Hello,

as stated in the title, I don't know what I want to do with my life and I need some help.

I'm currently a 20, soon to be 21, year old male living in germany at my parents house.
I am technically a Cognitive Science student in an university that is around 2 hours by train away from me, but I haven't done anything for that in the last few months and will most likely quit at some point.

Since the university is that far away from me I always opted to just stay at home and watch the recordings or uploads for the lectures, but over time I did this less and less until I got to a point where I dreaded opening the website and seeing something new available and in the end I completely stopped. My parents gave me the option to finance an apartment there, but because I didn't really enjoy the topics being taught or being a student in general I opted against it.

Since I was young I pretty much just followed a path that was laid out before me, I went to kindergarten, elementary school, high school and did my A level, finishing at the age of 18.

I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do after that. There wasn't any topic that I was really interested in, but I guess Artificial Intelligence did interest me somewhat so I searched for some courses relating to that and found out about Cognitive Science. The broadness of it managed to get my interest at that time.

Since everthing worked out quite well so far I was a bit complacent and only registered at one university. Of course I didn't manage to get accepted. And since I waited too long the registering period for most colleges was already over by then.

As I had nothing to do until I could try again my parents told me to find some work and at least do something. I managed to find a 
retail job where I could earn up to 450€ a month. I didn't really like the work, but it wasn't that bad and I at least earned myself some money. I gave around half of what I earned every month to my parents and saved up the rest to build myself a PC, something that I wanted to do for a long time. 

I mostly spend my time in front of a PC playing games, watching anime, reading manga and novels, so of course I wanted to use something that was better than my old laptop in order to support that hobby.

I managed to get accepted into the university at my second attempt, although I got another rejection at first, which honestly scared me quite a bit a that time. I even hid it from my parents while I was thinking on what to do. But thanks to the waiting period of one year I had I was able to get in with the second screening. I thought that everything would turn for the better now, but sadly that was not true.

Seeing that I was able to get through school without many problems I never really got into the habit of actually studying for lectures, something that many of you will know is quite necessary in college.

During my first semester I already realized that I didn't have the discipline/motivation to do everything that was needed for my lectures, I barely managed to pass some of them by copying the homework from other students and trying to do some last-minute cramming sessions before mid-terms/finals. The lectures where I couldn't do that were postponed for 'another semester'.

And now I am sitting here with a constant feeling of dread in the back of my mind. I don't really know what to do now. 
If possible I'd just like to continue life in a similar way as of now, but that is not something that I can do. My parents, while greatly supportive throughout my life, will at some point not be able to tolerate me sitting in my room all day any longer.

I did manage to learn that I'd prefer work that I am able to do from home, work that doesn't require much, if any, contact with other people, so I looked into some options for that, but didn't really find something that I could do.

Around 2 months ago I started to learn Korean in the hopes of using that to make a living and because I enjoy reading translated Korean novels. I currently do something towards that goal every day, which is first for me, although I'm only spending around 0.5-2 hours every day on it. 

But I don't know if just knowing Korean is enough to make a living. And if it is I still need a long time to be proficient enough and I need something that I can do during that time.

I don't really need all that much money and I'd already be content if I can just live somewhere on my own without worrying about the next meal and maybe support my parents a bit. 

I'm sorry that I wrote in such a roundabout way, but I can't really express everything that I want to say properly, most likely a result of my lack of social interactions during my youth, but I still hope that some of you could help me out. If there is anything else that you'd like to know please ask.
 
I actually wanted to make a post like this for a few months now, but I always postponed it, something I do too often. 

**TLDR:** 20 year old doesn't know what do to with his life, wants to quit college and find work that can be done from home. And is knowing Korean enough to make a living?

And sorry for any bad english.",15Jan2018,16

171,"I'm a freshman in high school right now looking for some friendship advice. First, however, I'll give some backstory to all of this. Basically, I've known this guy( let's call him John) since kindergarten, but over these recent years, he's really started changing. He's become more controlling and just overall not very nice. It always seems that he tries to make tiny disagreements into all-out fighting. He's overly dramatic, likes all of the attention focused on him, and when he doesn't get his way he throws a fit. Here's an example of this (in list form because at this point it's become extremely predictable.
1. We invite a new person down to sit at the table
2. John sees the new person, puts in earbuds, and looks at his phone.
3. We then try to make conversation with the new person to not completely destroy their first impressions of us.
4. Throughout the little conversation, John makes no attempt to join in, and heaves heavy sighs like we're ignoring him.
5. We purposely try to get John involved by saying things like ""What do you think of this, John?"", and are met again with heavy sighs and complete silence.
6. John leaves the table early, and later that night we get a message about how we are trying to ignore him and push him out of the group and waits for us to come crawling back.
I've been growing extremely tired of this, and I feel like my freedom is being held back just so that I can please this one guy. The aforementioned list occurred again this week when a girl came over to sit with us, but this time, he simply got up and left. I haven't heard anything from him for 4 days, and I'm worried for him.

174,"Hi guys, I’m in a self inflicted pickle. I’ll try make it as quick as possible. 

I’m 21. My boyfriend is 22. 


I finished high school in a small town a couple of years ago. I moved to a big city 3 hours away to attend university in a field I’ve wanted to be in for years at my dream uni. I had a job, an apartment and was generally doing well. I was happy and enjoying life again after years of physical abuse from my Mother and severe depression.

Me and my high school sweetheart were doing LDR (I’d get the train up and stay with him at his parents’ or he’d come down to see me for a couple of nights) and he promised he’d get a job in my city before my lease was up. He didn’t and being faced with the threat of homelessness as I hadn’t had time to find a new place (I was under the assumption we’d live together) I had no choice but to move back to my hometown and in with him and his parents two years into my degree. I applied for a 6 month leave of absence at my University, applied for jobs up here and we finally got an apartment in a really nice location with fairly expensive rent. 

I got offered a position at a University in this hometown of mine( it’s not a good one- small campus, not many courses etc) and have a job nearby. I thought I’d be happy; 2 years left of a degree, a decent paying, new job and a nice place. I’m miserable, I hate this town. It reminds me of my abusive mother and I dislike the University, where I live and the way my boyfriend and his family treat me. My mother knows (somehow??) that I’ve moved back and has conveniently showed up places I frequent. My hometown has no one spectacular. Everyone who did well in my high school moved to the city with me and the burnouts and losers stayed behind here. Everyone is the same. 

I thought it would be the best idea for me at the time but it’s turned out to be a nightmare. I am so unbelievably depressed and suicidal, I can’t even get out of bed on my days off and I spend hours and hours crying on my own. 

I am currently copping emotional abuse from his Mother and him. He forgets everything, talks down to me, insults me, controls me financially. I am no longer happy in this relationship and I resent him for lying to me about getting a job (he had 10 months to do so.) As a result I have no savings and won’t have many in the near future. 

My leave of absence at my dream, city University ends at the beginning of March and after that I am still enrolled there and can resume when I please. The lease at my current apartment I share with my boyfriend is up in May. My Dad and step mother have offered to help me with “anything I need” but my Dad just had a heart attack and is currently stuck in a tight spot financially speaking. 

My current plan is to move into the second bedroom in my apartment, commute by train to the University on the days I have mandatory tutorials (2 days a week) and just watch the lectures online. Save as much as possible.
Find a job in the city and then move again when the lease is up here. I don’t want to break lease if I can help it. 

My phone is currently tied to a contract my boyfriend and I both pay and after dating for 5 years he knows nearly everything about me. I don’t fear for my safety at all but leaving him and living with him will be so hard but I am just so unbelievably unhappy. 

What do you guys think? What should I do? It’s 2am and I’m crying in my living room. I understand this is all my fault but I still would like a solution.

Sorry for formatting and grammar. English is my second language.

Some parameters: 1.) I need some kind of nature/outdoors element. Florida has many protected areas that I've visited, but I'm craving a scene where I can hike along a stream and look up and see mountains. After living in the city for a few years, I think it's time for me to experience a bit of seclusion.

2.) I'm very liberal. I personally don't want to live in a state where Democrats and liberals don't need me and my help. I want a state where the lines are a bit blurry. An active political scene during election years would be great.

3.) I am going to be a teacher, so I don't care about making money, I just want enough to feel comfortable. I'm a single guy with no attachments, so as long as I can make enough money to cover the basics, I'll be fine. A state where teachers aren't treated like T O T A L shit would be nice.

179,"This is a throwaway account just in case either employer even gets a hint it could be my post - I don't like to gamble too much career-wise, which is why I am here!

I have been working with a company (a sort of start-up with large corporate backers) for about 15 months now. I enjoy the work for the most part and the pay is above average for my position. The major problem with my current job is the uncertain future and messiness of being involved with a start-up. I can also spin this to be positives too. I am easy-going as long as the pay is right and the work is somewhat interesting. 
Around month 13, a recruiter from a large corporation reached out to me and out of curiosity, I accepted to meet with them for an interview. The pay was less than I was currently making, but the future seemed a little more stable and the allure of the position's tasks swayed me to accept the position. 
I know counter offers are always tricky and I let my current manager know as soon as I accepted the other position, so I did not leave them in a bind. I was not planning on receiving, let alone accepting any sort of counter offer, but what they came back with was a number I couldn't pass up. 
I then let the second company know the situation and rescinded my acceptance. 
Last Friday the second company reached out stating they had come up with a new proposal and wanted to call me today (Monday) to discuss it. 
I have a couple of reasons for advice here. 
1. Should I even entertain the new proposal?
2. How do you handle a counter to a counter offer? I don't want to be blacklisted from either company, but just need to do what's best for me and my child (single mom) and unfortunately, that means following the money and benefits. 

I know this advice is dependent on a lot of factors (enjoying the work, money won't fix everything, etc.), but IF the new proposal from the second company really is THAT good, is loyalty to my current position more important for potential future opportunities with them or with the connections I've made there?

Tl;dr: Working for current start-up company 15 months, work is fine and pay is good. Recruiter reached out from a larger corporation and I accepted their offer after interviewing. The current company came back with a great counter, so I rescinded my acceptance with the second company. The second company is now reaching out with a new proposal. Do I entertain the new offer? At what point does it hurt professional relationships made to the point it may affect future opportunities?",15Jan2018,2

Thank you so much, again :(.

**HOW IT STARTED**: I graduated high school, moved out, went to college and had a pretty decent life until about my 24th birthday in February 2016. Most of that time I was fully independent with no help from home, good credit, my own car with no cosigner, a decent place to live--all things I was very proud of having since I came from poverty. Problem is my schedule was tight; I had to work full time and go to school full time to pay bills, but at least I was almost done. Well, out of NOWHERE my dad blindsided us by becoming a full-blown alcoholic, getting a DUI on my birthday and destroying our family and his marriage to my crippled mom who would call me crying almost every day because my dad would be berating her for her illness. This is still going on actually, and they may lose my childhood home. Because I grew up in a sober home with a poor but happy and loving family, this sudden change made me very, very depressed to where I had to drop my classes or else fail, and then issues at work at the time encouraged me to quit shortly after; someone on my team called the Department of Labor on my employer for illegally withholding overtime pay from us. I took the 'blame' for calling the DoL even though I didn't (no whistleblower protections there), so that my timid and hard-working coworker wouldn't be harassed. But man, they made my life hell until I 'voluntarily' left early summer 2016. At least they lost the case and had to pay out, which helped me a tiiiny bit.

Then, my s/o at the time of 4 years and I decided to split. It was a generally friendly split, but I still had to find a place to live without a job. I had nothing saved because we adopted a rescue pup earlier that year as well that turned out to have parvo; well, financially I should have made the decision to let her die, since all her littermates did, but in my heart I couldn't, so a $3,000 veterinary hospital bill later she survived and is still alive, happy and also still with that ex. He takes wonderful care of her at least. Anyway, early fall 2016 move into new place, even more depressed, broke, missing my pup and still trying to finish my degree because I'm so close... only to make the awful decision of: my most recent ex. All I can think is he is very controlling, and I must have at the time thought he could give me more 'control' over my life. I know that makes no sense looking at it now, but at the time, I just wanted help. Sadly though, I let things get much worse before I realized the mistake I was making. He convinced me to stay unemployed for a bit to 'work on my depression', sell my car, and a bunch of other dumb things I shouldn't have done that let him control me and also put me in the place of having to rely on someone who made very selfish decisions. BUT, he promised he'd help me because he loved me, and the job and such didn't matter because his family is well-off, and I believed him. So, by Spring 2017, I had dropped out with only 4 classes left for my degree and spontaneously moved with him to the southern part of our state, where he is from--my depression at this point was really bad, I had been truly unemployed for the *first time since I was 16* and I had nothing else really, so why not?

Finally in summer 2017, I get a job after about a year of excruciating unemployment. A good one that my ex finally let me have, as a tech writer with a government contractor. However my continued employment depends on whether or not my security clearance goes through. Everything on my background is clean except my bad credit, although I'm hoping they see it is recent, situational and not a blackmail risk. I've also been warned my boyfriend/now ex being born in Prague could get me denied but I'm hoping that's not true. So anyway, I'm feeling good at first but it doesn't take long to swing back on around to depression town: the recent ex had 'bought' me a car as a gift (did not want repayment) since he had me sell mine, and he put it in my name and my insurance and everything, but about a week after I started working again I was in an accident and it was totaled. Then, to my surprise, his dad comes to me for $3.5k to recover the cost of the car. Apparently, he gave my ex the money to buy it as a project car for himself (the ex), not for me. So my ex lied to both of me and his father, and since I didn't still agree to pay his dad anyway (I really think my ex should, he is the one that lied to us both knowingly) his family refused to help me in any other way. On top of it, I quickly found out WHY I was hired so quickly and easily despite not having a full degree or government experience or a clearance--truly lucky, right? Not long after starting my boss starts making very sexual comments and asking for nudes, saying he can 'help me out' with my situation if I do so. And how he's doing me a favor by putting in for my clearance, since the company pays for it and it's expensive. I found out he has a reputation, too, so that's definitely why I was hired--and I guess the last few girls played along. I am still working there and putting up with it because, again, what else do I do? I'm afraid to say anything because of what happened at the job prior--I wasn't even actually the one to blow the whistle and they drove me out. And I can't afford to be unemployed again.

**THIS BRINGS US TO NOW**: I managed to borrow a vehicle from my dad long enough to save up $800 and buy myself a '96 Blazer this winter, picked out by my ex who supposedly inspected and then recommended the car. I should have looked it over myself but I trusted him because he's really into cars, and to be fair, perhaps he really just couldn't tell. I was worried about the ABS and Parking brake lights being on the dash but he said he looked at it and that it was a common issue and fine. Well last week, on my way to work, the entire brake system completely failed on me. INCLUDING THE EMERGENCY BRAKE PEDAL. Apparently everything brake related is rusted through--a nice $3,800 fix I can't afford. I was at least lucky that it was early enough in the morning on a very rural back road, so there were no other cars, I didn't hit anything and was able to just run off the road into a snowy field.

**SO HERE IT IS**: Due to all this, I have bad credit (apparently 511 as of this morning)/tons of student loans now due, own almost nothing (I've sold everything I can), and even though I broke up with my ex I'm still sleeping here because I'm on the lease--of a place his dad owns. I can't get a rental car because of bad credit and no credit cards (already tried my debit), and while I currently have an agreement with my ex to take me to work for now I'm afraid at any moment he'll stop or say he won't unless I get back with him. In return I cook him lunch, dinner and still clean the place (and pay for tolls/gas etc). Of course my boss and one of my coworkers have both opened up their places for free, but both of them have made it pretty clear they fantasize about all the sex they think we'd be having if I did so, so I don't really think that's wise either. Plus, what happens if my clearance is denied? I lose my job anyway. I have been looking for other jobs ever since I found out about my boss' little crush on me, but due to where I'm currently located it's difficult. I'm near the very southernmost tip of Maryland, which is very rural and most work is military/contractor work which you need a clearance for. While I personally think I'm a good candidate for a clearance (other than credit my background is as easy as it gets for them, I don't even have a speeding ticket.. or a passport) I still have to worry until it is cleared. I have no problem taking a fast food job or anything of the like, but to even do that, I have to find a way to get there first. And of course I'm extremely depressed over all of it, but cannot do any anti-depressants right now or even therapy, because I would have to report it to my employer and apparently that can also get me denied for my clearance (or get it taken away if you already have one!)

My parents are too poor to help and going through a crisis of their own, although they absolutely would if they could. I could move back but it's actually even more rural than where I am now, which means few jobs, none of which I could walk/bike to. My dad is a mechanic but is drunk 24/7 now and most of his vehicles are finally broken as well. In fact I've been trying to send THEM money to help THEM. I'm adopted with no siblings to help out. Since my ex didn't like any of my friends or anyone else I had in my life I let myself become isolated and lost contact with pretty much everyone. I don't have any cellphone service out here, so basically have no phone phone to text or call but I do at least have internet (clearly). I am within walking distance of 0 jobs (and I would 100% willingly walk 3 miles, maybe even more to work if I had to), have 0 commuting options here such as bus, we don't even have Uber..I tried. I have one saving grace: I'm sure it doesn't show much in his frantically-written post, but I'm a decent writer with a good bit of freelance digital marketing/content copywriting experience under her belt, raised on a computer, and who has gotten good enough at web design as well to have sold my first website recently. For far below market value, but hey, I can put it in my portfolio! It takes a while to build up liveable income on freelance but if I can keep my crappy laptop running and my depression from winning, I might have a chance. I'm definitely trying, but with everything going on I have been on a hiatus, which basically means starting over in terms of finding clients and such.

If you've made it this far.. honestly, just getting this far is a favor to me.. to know someone is listening, in a way. But at this point what I'd really be extremely grateful for is just good, solid advice on what to do now, from someone who has been just as low or lower and had made it through. Or really anyone with ideas. Because right now, it feels like I'm stuck with nowhere to go and will never get through it. I spent a lot of the morning crying after getting denied a rental car for bad credit, at a place where I'm a 'Gold' member so my chances were best there. I do have savings but not much since I just recently bought the Blazer which already has to be junked (hoping I can get some scrap $$ for it at least). I've got about $1000 right now between my checking, savings, and the little extra I saved in cash for emergency. **What should I do now?** To me, it makes sense to try to buy another car first before anything else, so that I may continue to work. But I can't wait around to save much more, and cars around the $800-$1200 range aren't known for being very.. reliable. What if I get another rusted-out money sink? On the other hand, taking a risk may be my only option. With bad credit, normal car loans are off the table, and I'm a bit worried about doing the 'your job is your credit' cars because if my clearance is denied and I lose my job, I probably won't be able to continue to pay. So.. yeah, I think that is the question: just what can or should I even do now? All I have is a job, $1000, and my physical existence, which comes with depression and bad credit. But hey, better than nothing.. I think.. right?

Thank you to anyone with any suggestions, and sorry for being annoyingly thankful, and for apologizing so much.",15Jan2018,2
195,The roommate from hell (lets call him FF) left two days before Christmas with zero warning.  FF claimed he would pay for his share of the rent for January because of the circumstances. Found out yesterday that he isn’t. My dad is in a wheelchair and lives with my brother they are both about to become homeless because of FF and his impulsive nature.

198,"   I live in Ohio and about 3 weeks ago during our first snow storm, I was driving up to Cleveland at night and slid into the center divider between 2 exits. I crushed one of those orange barrier cones under my car and that pretty much stopped me from full on slamming the big digital sign. My bumper is hanging off from one side and the grill is gone. (I put it in the back seat) 

   I have a little Toyota Corrolla so it didn’t do that great in the snow, but I have no idea HOW to tell my dad. I live alone, about an hour away from him, so that’s why he hasn’t seen it yet. 

  I’m thinking about taking it to a shop to at least get an estimate, is that a good idea? Also, if you have any other advice on how I should tell my dad. ",15Jan2018,3

Was out with D my bff and we were just walking about town talking killing time (she was still sort of working too) and she mentioned something about how the meds she was on were messing with the pill and went onto say that it meant she couldn't do anything with anybody. Now me being me went into a substate of over thinking. She's mentioned in the past of a friend who 'adores' her and is a similar age. I'm not around her all the time but should I assume that she's seeing or wants to start seeing this guy. Because she knows I like her butnwont do anything about it (I get attached way to easily why I got used a lot). And is it natural for me to be jealous of this guy and in a brotherly kind of way aggressive and defensive towards?,15Jan2018,2
200,"While trying to lose weight and improve my health, I've tried to increase the amount of exercise I have by walking, hiking, and some very light weight lifting. I'm not looking to increase muscle mass, but to lower my body fat and gain some mental effects (better concentration, better motivation, to feel less edgy all the time).

After years of alcohol, nicotine and MJ use (and abuse) my dopamine neurons are not in that great a shape. I bet they have ever been right up to bar, as I have been trouble with concentration and natural rewards ever since I was a kid. I think my use of these supplements has been mostly self-medicating the symptoms of deficiency in my neurotransmitter system. 

I'm trying to improve my situation and quit the intake of these substances (at least for a while) and I hope to completely be able to kick nicotine and regular alcohol consumption.

One of the problems is that when I exercise, I get a slight kick of the natural endorphins, but the effect is so very little and goes away so quickly, it doesn't work as a motivator. It didn't when I was a kid, or a teen, or young adult, long before I ever had any substance that touched the dopamine system. So I'm afraid that even if I am successful with my break from these, and keep on exercising, this ""natural high"" won't be very high. So I am wondering are there some supplements that I could look into to help me keep my goal and get a better reward from body's own endorphins with exercise?

TL,DR: are there any dietary supplements or (legal) drugs that enhance the reward from exercise?

207,"Howdy! So I met this girl on Tinder about 6 months ago.. 7 now.

We instantly got along great.  However she told me she didn’t want a relationship because she was divorced after 13 years and works like 6 days a week plus has 6 dogs and just generally wants to work on herself.

That’s cool no worries I think.   This girl is my exact type.. she’s 3 hours away.   Maybe I’ll meet her and lose my V Card.

Finally meet like a month after chatting and sending nudes and stuff..we get along great.   We make out on my couch once I work up the nerve etc etc.

Now we see each other like 6 more times.  Each time I sort of pressure her to date or to hang out or let me come stay the weekend.   She’s busy as hell and we’re not exclusive so she always gives me another chance and waves me off sort of or argues the idea.


In my head I know I shouldn’t do this but it’s like my first real relationship sort of and I can’t help myself.

What I really wanted to do was just keep seeing her whenever she had the time.. and hope she slowly started to open up to me.


So finally she has enough and deleted me from FB when I sort of force her too like an idiot but we still chat on Snapchat and messenger lightly.

I find out she’s at some cockroach hotel in my city because she got transferred as new manager to my city in under a week so my pressure was just added stress she didn’t need.

I invite her to stay with me instead and she does.  I told her I’d take the couch but she says it’s my bed do what I want.      I’m nervous so she says go down to your friends and come up and cuddle later if you want which I don’t do.


I send a cute text about her snoring and she asks that as much as I want it please don’t get attached.

I say I’m just glad she let me “repair” things and that I’m happy being just a little bit more than friends.

After work the next day we cuddle on the couch.  We then have sex a few times while she’s staying with me.  We go to toy stores together and generally just have a good time while she searches for a place to live.  

She finds one and it’s near Christmas so she’s about to drive 3 hours back to her house and dogs and mother etc and for some reason I think it’s her last night here not thinking about she’ll have to be back at least until the 1st.


I take some Ativan like an idiot and ramble on about wanting to be together.. she makes me want to work harder.. my family would love her blah blah.     She tears up and gets an angry face and I help her pack.   She says she’s not going out anymore and just going home and we kiss and she leaves.


That was the last time I saw her in person before Christmas.

I asked if she was coming back and she said No.  I pleaded like an idiot until it was rambling and she kept saying no.   Eventually after a week or two of trying when I’d see her snaps and see she was watching mine I’d try and convince her to let me “fix it” and take her to dinner.


She would deny shit she said to me over the last 7 months and stuff.. her defensive style I think since her divorce.. she takes two giant antidepressants otherwise she cries all day.   

She obviously loved her marriage where she played step mom and everything.   She obviously loves being single because she doesn’t have to do feelings... I “scare the shit out of her” is her main reason I guess.


Except throughout those 7 months we have like 400 photos of selfies everyday that I’d wake up too or random things.    She’d message me apologizing late at night if I didn’t message her and then she’d have a freak out saying she wanted to just do her and stuff and then a week later she comes to my town and we get lunch she tells me it’s fine and we make out super intimately...

The list of little things I could name that make me think she really liked me a lot is pretty big.   

So I also think maybe she’s scared of her own feelings also obviously.   

So anyway, she removed me from FB when I first attempted to fix it.. then I’d wait a few days and notice the Snapchat views or see here and I kept trying to “fix” our friendship and dug the hole deeper and deeper.      Finally she blocked my IG and Snapchat.

I sent her a final text apologizing and saying I didn’t realize it but just if fell in love with her which is why I’d always stare at her or loved her smell or haven’t changed her pillow cause it smells like her and I’m mental. 

I said I hope you re-add me to stuff one day if you want to see each other again because I’ll miss her and she made the last year super fun and special for me yadda yadda..   all of this was worded much better in the text obviously.    Even saying her blocking me might be what I need. 


Anyway, while she was staying her she’d always quiz me on her fav animals or little things.   Tell me to fatten up.  Yadda yadda.   I know she still liked me and it sucks my stoned rant was the final straw.

So now we’re no contact but I still have this feeling like she may see the funko pop or other gifts I got her and miss me and maybe message me since my only real crime was liking her a lot.

She knew it too.. like I showed a picture of her to my Oma after our second date and she knew that.    She knew I liked her LOTS before living with me for two weeks.


So anyway, my question finally...

It came up all the time randomly as we hung out that her birthday was the same day as Elijah Woods.... this happens to be in like two weeks.

Is it an completely horrible idea to have someone deliver a little gift bag with a sunflower (she loves them) and like a beanie baby and card saying happy birthday, Elijah.  

I was thinking of writing something about it being a real puppy if we were still seeing each other but I blew that. 

Because she has 6 dogs.. loves dogs.. one of them is 13.. she’d probably love a puppy even though it’s a lot of work.  

Yeah so if I refined all of that so it was nice.. it would be two weeks of no contact and shows I don’t need social media to remember her birthday.        Does it come off as stalkerish or as someone that knows what he wants and doesn’t want to give up because being scared of feelings is stupid? 

I know you can’t force someone to like you.    But it’s like a last ditch effort.     I was thinking of just having my sister walk in and hand it to her or something.        


Anyway, I was thinking it would show I still cared a lot which is what scares her but also that I don’t need social media to remember stuff and that I genuinely care for her and now she’s in my city I want to be there for her when she needs it. 

Total nay or maybe a yay?   I mean, it’s hard to convey but she definitely really liked me at some point.   She’s told me maybe in the future and that she’s guarded as hell and then tried to deny stuff like that.   She hates talking emotions and stuff but maybe the card would get her to message me and I could just play it normal from there etc etc.. 

I don’t know.   I know it’s like a fools hope probably and I should just let her go..

But life’s short and I really really like this woman.  Like I said I think I fell in love in the 7 months and that’s just crazy.  Maybe that’s not possible and it’s just lust.    But I feel like I knew it from the moment we matched tbh.  

It’s weird but she opened with a gif of something I love and we’ve literally got along great sending memes and selfies and stuff everyday for 6 months and then she just 180s on me after my stoned rant.   

I mean what’s the worst that could happen? She rejects it and I know for sure she never wants to see me again?   She takes it and doesn’t message me? 

Or maybe she messages me a few months from now because of the gifts and because like I said my only crime was liking her lots when she’s not ready.

I didn’t know they were like on again off again break until he cheated on her.   She still thinks it’s her fault though so she carries guilt around and takes those antidepressants.

Now I’m all depressed cause I fucked up a good thing I should of just kept taking slow but didn’t.    Maybe she would of opened up one day.  Maybe she wouldn’t of.   But at least I wouldn’t feel like I forced her to push me away like she warned me she would. ",15Jan2018,2

The only person I can think of to ask is a professor I've taken two 400-level courses with and that I am atleast acquainted with. I didn't do spectacularly in the classes but I didn't do too poorly either (B- and B, respectively). I didn't see him outside of class many times so it's not like there's an established relationship there. I know it'd be less proper to ask directly through email but I know he's a very straight-forward guy. We don't have a close enough relation where I'm certain he'd write me a letter though, and I really would like for him to because I don't even have a shot at applying without it.

I want to set up a meeting but I'm not sure if I should be ambiguous (I would hate to foot-in-door him or make him feel pressured to write the letter). Should I just write, ""Do you have a spare 30 minutes sometime this week that I could drop by and discuss something with you?"" Or should I add, ""I was hoping to ask you about a possible letter of recommendation so I can continue research with ____ this summer.""

215,"My life is fucked. Royally. But I'm not playing the victim. I allowed it to get this way. I allowed myself to bend to the needs of others and put myself last. I allowed myself to continue on this path without doing what I know needs to be done.

But I know what needs to be done now. 

I was married. We were together for 3 1/2 years, married for two, and we just separated in May. I moved back to my home state, away from him and closer to my family. And I started dating the first person who was interested in me. 

See, he tricked me. He love bombed me. He made me feel like I was the perfect person for him, like I was the most important person in his life. He told me he loved me after three days. Then he [microcheated](https://www.buzzfeed.com/juliegerstein/oh-great-now-youve-gotta-worry-about-micro-cheating?utm_term=.dhgL55O6V0#.duAz55P01g) on me. For two months. Until he physically cheated on me. Just a kiss, he says. But after lying to me about her for two months, it's hard for me to believe him. 

And that's the problem, isn't it? I don't trust him. I tried. Fuck, I tried. But when he gets dozens of texts messages a day, it's hard to believe they're actually from his clients like he says. Because that's what he said about her, isn't it? She's just a client. And then he'd delete the messages so I wouldn't see. 

He blamed it on me, of course. The cheating. There was another man in my life. A friend. Someone I could tell anything to and be supported by. We'd slept together right before my boyfriend and I got together. Just once. But because I didn't give him up, because I continued talking to him, my boyfriend sought someone outside of the relationship. Because he didn't think I was ""invested in our relationship."" 

He's a narcissist, my boyfriend is. No, not that casual word that gets thrown around when people are selfish. He's an actual [narcissist](https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder). From the get, he saw our future focusing around him. His business. His career. His house. It took months before he even asked me what my goals and ambitions were. He just cared about himself. He talks himself up more than anyone I know. Before he meets someone I know for the first time, I have to remind him not to sell himself. Just relax. Because he'll talk to them for hours about himself. Like he does with me. He has no empathy. I have anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. And he can't handle it. He doesn't *want* to handle it. He gets angry when I cry. He gets angry when I get angry. He gets angry when I say nothing and let him yell at me. He gets angry at me no matter what I do. 

And I can't take it anymore. 

We have a roommate. Good looking guy. And he had a breakdown last night. The cops got a phone call from someone worried he was going to hurt himself. So they showed up to the house looking for him. Only, he wasn't home. So I called him. He was at a bar. Started crying as soon as he answered. Me and my boyfriend went there. While my boyfriend was talking to someone in the bar about his business, I talked to our roommate. Tried to figure out what was going on and let him unload his frustration. In the car, he started crying again. I comforted him. At home, he asked me to come upstairs and talk more. He just wanted to talk. 

And throughout that hour, two hour long encounter last night, he felt more like my boyfriend than my boyfriend does. He listened to what I had to say. He let me talk. He stayed on topic. And I think he knows that my boyfriend cheated on me. Because he kept asking how long we'd been together, when we started dating, if we had broken up, were we broken up when we went to the bar, oh shit, that wasn't you, nevermind... 

I feel like he was trying to tell me something last night. Something I didn't get the answer to. Either he was trying to tell me my boyfriend had been out with another girl or he was trying to tell me he was interested in me (because that's the impression I got)... But I think something changed in me last night. I love my boyfriend. But I don't like him. In fact, sometimes I hate him. Because how can he treat me this way? How can he be so awful to the girl he supposedly loves? I don't know. All I know is that I need out. 

But we live together. Just moved into a new place last month. I can move out. I can. But I'd have to move in with my dad because I can't afford a place on my own, and he lives over an hour away. It would take me an hour to get to work. A two hour commute total. So if I move in with my dad, I have to quit my job. But I spent all my money on my boyfriend. Helping with bills, helping with the new house. So if I left my job, I don't know if I'd be able to afford my bills. I don't know how long it would take me to find a new job. I've been putting in applications for months (because I hate my job so much) and haven't even gotten an interview. Would I have to rely on my parents to take care of me? At 30 years old? Like a bum? 

I don't see how I have any other option. Sit my dad down. Tell him what's going on. Tell him what may happen. Because that's the only choice I can think of. I can't see a different way out. And I have to get out. I have to get out before he kills me. Not physically, but emotionally. He tears me down too much. And just when things get good... Just when I start telling people how great things are going, I do something wrong and we fight for three days. And I can't stay anymore. I deserve so much better. 

Someone help me. What do I do? Where do I go? Is there a way I can get out and not have to rely on my parents? Or is this really the only option I have?",15Jan2018,4
216,"I’m not 100% on what the rules are for this subreddit so I apologize if I break any! I will also try and keep this short and sweet. 

Firstly, let me start off by saying I am a 31F living on Long Island, NY so I know the area is tough to begin with. 

Like most people nowadays, I hate my job. Don’t get me wrong, I am very grateful for it. Although underpaid, I still get a decent paycheck, I have met wonderful people and have made the best of friends through this job, I just feel I’m past my time here. 

Once I became aware of my feelings about two and a half years ago, I went back to school part-time for accounting. What’s annoying with this is the part-time part because already being a bit older, I don’t want to prolong this any more than I already have. 

Side note: I did go to college right out of high school, I just didn’t know what I wanted to do so I didn’t take anything seriously. I wound up getting a full time job and have been in the industry for about a decade now. At least I have a 401K going and figured out what direction I wanted to go in..

Well, within a year I’ll be switching to a new school going for a program where you’ll graduate with your bachelors and masters degree but again, I don’t want this to take double the amount of time it should. 

What can I do as a job that could be flexible enough to be able to go to school full-time and still get a decent paycheck with benefits and what not? I’m freaking myself out about this and truly don’t know what to do. 

I sell my crafts on Etsy but barely make any sales with that as it is, let alone to try and depend on it. Thought about maybe starting a blog but also, that doesn’t guarantee I’m gonna be the next be blogger at all! A few years back, I got my certificate to appraise houses but could never pass that last class so I thought maybe to try and get that going? 

🤦🏻‍♀️ idk. So many ideas and thoughts so it’s becoming overwhelming. 

If you have any thoughts or input, I appreciate it! If not, thanks for letting me vent about this at least! ",15Jan2018,1

I have hispanic house cleaners that come over once every couple weeks, and I've never mentioned that I speak Spanish because they tend to not talk a lot while working. The past couple times they have begun to speak to each other more, I guess as they get more comfortable being in my house. I thought about saying something, but hate me or not, I kind of liked eavesdropping as they normally just talked about fairly mundane topics.

Today though one of the lady's daughters is working with her, and they are speaking to each other quite a lot in Spanish. The subject matter is nothing too personal, but they were talking about some personal family matters at one point, that included a relative getting arrested. Should I alert them that I understand them? Do I need to do this every time I'm in a situation where someone is speaking a language other than English, that I also speak, and is possibly assuming that I don't understand them, or should people in a culturally diverse area just assume others might understand them?

222,"I’m drafting a proposal to punish a potential active, who’s had some poor attendance to our fraternity activities. Of the activities he’s skipped out on was the ski trip to Colorado over winter break (we go to college at Nebraska, so a bit inexcusable IMO), and the road trip to watch an away football game at Purdue, also a couple of philanthropies, so basically the scoop is he’s meeting the requirements such as having good grades, he’s well behaved, and he’s paying his dues. 


I should also mention that he skipped out on most of the evening fraternity events we had this past week for the actives and getting to know their brothers. 


Would it be fair that I propose the punishment to be that he’s going to be activated, BUT he’s barred from socials/fun events, and this would include the celebration for those who are activated. The way he can be allowed back into our socials is start showing up to our activities? The rationale here for me is that if you aren’t willing to do what’s asked of you, and put in some effort, then you don’t get to cash in on the fun.

Somewhat recently, my gf has become depressed. She’s become closed off and sensitive to minor situations. I understand the struggle she’s going through and I’m trying my best to support her through the process (I put together a “happy jar”, I got her a few stress reliever coloring books, invite her to go on hikes, recommend positive self talk, etc).

The thing that’s been hurting us is that she seems to be shutting me away. She doesn’t want to be touched (ex.no holding hands, kissing, cuddling), she’ll get furious when asked simple questions (ex. What do you want to watch?), she doesn’t want to do anything other than play the sims all day (she will wake up and go straight to the sims and sit there for the entire day), and seems “cold” to me with no desire to express affection (no morning “good mornings, absolutely no sex, I genuinely feel like I might as well be some random person in the apartment). 

Now I could be a self centered douche here and making it all about me. If I am, please call me out on that. Idk...It’s just hard to stay positive when I feel like I’m pushing against a wall.

The fiance and i have been in our own condo for about two years now, and mom in law lives with her niece and nephew. Unfortunately, she's been injured for quite some time and has applied for disability but it's taking a while. She lost her job after being on leave for 6months and told the doc she wasnt't getting any better. Now, i know this sounds bad but i think she could work and she just isn't putting effort into looking for a job anymore.
 The niece and nephew both have relationships now and are stuck with her in the living room and also with paying her bills. Understandably, they can't afford it and are kicking her out. They don't have room for 5 people in one building too.


 She's moving in next month because she still hasn't gotten a job and carelessly spends her savings. She's even opened a credit card under my fiance's name and maxed it out without telling us, and pulled money from his gerber plan for botox.


 What do i do? I can't let her on the streets but she probably won't move out once she steps foot in our place. She's really bad with money and We can't afford to pay for her even if we wanted to. I've asked her to look into financial assistance but i feel as if she's lying when she says she's already looked into it.",15Jan2018,11

I had very little guidance so I chose a school that was too expensive because I gave myself the idea that no matter how much I took out in loans I'd be able to pay it back easily with my computer science degree. About a year and a half into that expensive college I wised up and transferred to a school that would be completely covered by my financial aid and I was very happy there. At that point however the damage has been done as I owe around 20,000 dollars in student loan debt. A year went by at this new college and my life outside of school went to absolute hell. I won't go into details but it messed my head up real bad  and destroyed my confidence and made me go into a depression. I stopped talking to my friends and my sisters, I felt completely alone, I thought about ending my life at one point too. This period I went through caused me to be academically dismissed from the new college and owe about a 1000 dollars to that school due to my financial aid being refunded since I stopped attending my classes. At this point I started talking to my friends/sisters again and I broke out of my depression. I got a job and even started going to the gym. I figured my plan should be to get back to college as soon as possible by paying off the college I owe money to (they're holding my records) so I can transfer to a new college (cheap of course) and get my degree in computer science.

Our landlord is kicking us out, and now my grandfather wants to go live on his own, he payed for the majority of the rent using his benefits. My mother isn't much of a mother at all, she hasn't worked in 20 years and has relied on the help of others (my grandfather, my father, and the government) since I was born. She hasn't raised us at all, so my siblings and I have naturally made terrible mistakes. I'm not sure what what kind of living arrangements can be made for us. We have to leave by the end of the month, we still haven't found a place. I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm in a bad dream. I just started getting my life together only for it to fall apart again. I'm not sure what to do, any advice would be appreciated.

I’m the only person he has told about this and he wants me to come with him to his next court date for support and I plan to and I’m glad he confided in somebody because he can be pretty closed off from people. 

The thing is, even though I know he didn’t do it, I still have this nagging feeling that maybe there’s some truth to it. It makes me feel horrible but I can’t shake this feeling and I can’t talk to anybody about it because it’s not my situation and he trusted me.

He missed 52 days of school last year because of laziness. My sister can't get up in the morning to get him ready for school. My mother is his source of transportation and is to lazy to get out of bed and drive him to school which is 5 minutes away. My nephew suffers from severe eczema and of course nothing is done about it. My nephews life consists of playing on an iPhone all day and night and feeding himself out of a box of dry pasta.

I have found the transition to being more responsible really hard, I should be stepping back and looking for the bigger picture and instead I seem to be doing all the little tasks I used to.

For the record, I lost my dad unexpectedly when I was 10, and after the very first day everything was easier. I only cried once, but I was a child who rarely showed emotions, so yeah. I moved on easily, despite missing him a lot.

However, in the past year I got obsessed with anticipating death. I'm not sure what exactly caused it. And mostly I started expecting my grandma's death - she wasn't THAT old or THAT sick, but I was continuously scared. That might gave been a slight anxiety problem, idk. 

And she got very seriously sick a few days ago, a day before my birthday. When they finally put her in the hospital, I knew. It might not have been today, but it would have been this summer. I just felt this was the year. ... (At least I got to see her and hold her hand one last time. I never got it with my Dad.)

She seemed to get better last night, but this morning we got the news. I knew it. I have cried several times, mostly when a thought or something triggers me (also been talking to a bunch of acquaintances all day so). I miss her terribly. 

But I feel a great urge to watch TV. I feel the need to make jokes (but I'm not). I don't want to mourn? idk. I want this to be over. I don't want to talk and cry to other people (everything is a tearjerker but I kind of don't want to share it with them). Maybe I'm too aware of the real world, meaning I have thought of many other things today, while my brother and mom are completely crushed. 

Is this normal? Am I a bad person? 

Which goes to another, more important question:

2) How to give support to the rest of my family when i'm so bad at these words? Is it enough to hug them, listen to them, let them cry and offer help? 

Maybe my mom expects me to initiate talks (with her), but I can't. I haven't talked about my father's death for 11 years and I cannot talk about this either. I can listen, and answer for a bit, but I cannot verbally express that sort of feelings during these times. Is that also normal? What should I do?

Also: I'm not bottling up feelings, I'm talking a lot to my boyfriend since I am more comfortable with 'outside' people.

My mental health is deteriorating from sitting at this fucking desk 8 hours a day calling people that don't answer. I work in educational sales and these technology director fucks never answer. I'm not even good at this.

Every time I try to find something else all I ever get responses for is inside sales and recruiting (HARD NO). I've thought about Physical Therapy but I'm 70k in debt already and don't have time or money for that much schooling (didn't even finish my original bachelors in Sport Management, ran out of funds and had to join the workforce.)

259,"So here's the thing, I have started my career in the university (Informatics Engineering) and at first I liked it and was excited to study it, but now I have realized that I'm not that much into it and in fact I try to avoid anything related to it. I don't know, maybe I just feel that it's too much for me because there's a lot of maths in it and I'm not really good at it.

I think this is related to the fact that maybe computer-related stuff it's not what I want to do the most. In fact I prefer to watch movies and listen to soundtracks. All this world of the cinema, the movies and their soundtracks is my weakness and I could spent hours and hours just watching movies and listening to music. And I think I would like a lot better to study something related to that like filmmaking studies or music composition, but here comes the trouble.

How could I tell my parents this? I have the age to decide on my own but they have paid me the first year of the career and I feel like a bit pressured by them because they are hoping me to have high grades in the exams and so on. They know I also like a lot the movies and the soundtracks but they think I love the career I am studying now but that's not the case.

I know this might sound dumb but it's a problem that has been floating around my head for the last month or so and I cannot figure out how can I tell them that I want to quit the Informatics Engineering career and that I want to start studying something related to movies and soundtracks.

So one of my friends (is a girl and i am a guy) recently got dumped by her boyfriend and seems to be taking it out on me. They lived together, and apparently one day when she got home from work he dumped her out of the blue. 
We have been friends for quite some time, to the point where i would consider her family. However she has been very cold and basically an asshole to me since this happened. I understand she is upset and i have tried to talk to her about it but she will not budge. I was one of the first people she told, but she just won't talk about it and it is making me frustrated. 
I understand she might just want space and to be alone for a while, but she keeps giving me an attitude, and i am fed up with it. For an example of how she is being: the other day i invited her out with my roomates and myself for a night of dancing and fun, but she flipped out on me. She yelled at me saying she had to work and how she has a rent payment and has to pay for school going into how poor she is. I told her it's fine if she doesn't go but told her not to yell at me and she just kept going on and on with how she has a ton on her plate, and that was the end of the conversation. This is not how she usually is at all, she is one of the sweetest people i have ever met. I just want my friend back and i have no idea where to start.",15Jan2018,2
263,"Ok, so I've been doing a Foundation Degree in Sustainable Construction for the last two years, before that, doing a BTEC (equivalent to 3 A levels) in the same subject. My first year of my course I didn't do so well. This was due to anxiety issues concerning legal troubles (or so I thought).

So, the head of department in college helped me get back onto the course, repeating my first year. Stuck his neck on the line for me.

I tried this year, I really tried to want to do it, I felt obligated because of the guy helping me. 

Recently my friends came back over from Scotland for Christmas, and one of them put the idea forward that I could move out of my house and to there. Here's a little about me, I'm 22, 23 this year, high functioning asperger's. Still living at home. I want out into the world, and where I live now is not the right place for me to move to somewhere nearby. I'm quite well known, for all the wrong reasons, was a bad little shit in school, and knowledge spread of me to the other five schools in town. Anyway, that's besides the point. I don't like this county, the people in it are backwards.

So, cue the last week or two of me properly planning on leaving, was going to fly out, get a place rented (my mate's moving in with me, we've been through a lot, he made me aware of my own anxiety, which I had always kind of denied. Introduced me to drugs, which were a kind of there and back again problem, no longer an issue, but I do like the occasional sniff. May not sound like it, but a very good friend) come back and pack up.

Went into college today, as I had an exam, which I planned on doing (sure why not?), told college guy, his reaction was as I expected, not exactly encouraging. But said that the choice is mine.

So here I am now, I have two choices:

1) stay on course, with a somewhat shaky compass that doesn't want to do its job, on account of its  unwilling captain. If successful in this course, I could go on to make a substantial amount of money.

2) Take a route less travelled, so to speak, still with wonky compass, but with a willing, excited, and adventurous captain. Could lead to me studying what I want. Will definitely lead to me experiencing life in the open world. Along with two very good friends.

Must also say that I'm kind of worried that if I spend too much longer at home I'll get too used to it, more ""institutionalised"", so to speak.",15Jan2018,2

265,"Hi Reddit!

I was desperately searching for advices on my current mood. I'm not happy and I don't know how to get better. Since a few times I know nothing but failure. 
At the beginning of last year, I stopped cycling, which was my passion, because it was too frustrating training really hard since several years and never winning anything.
I went to university to study Economics &amp; Management and was really excited about it because I thought it was the beginning of a new and great life. As a result, I hate these subjects.
But yeah, these are not the hardest things to deal with. The hardest thing is loneliness. I struggle making great friendships. I made several friends at university but we don't really have the same interests and passions, nor the same personality, and we don't hang out anymore because I came back at my parents' home as I'm not going at uni until next year. A girl I know since childhood and who became a friend because she went at the same university deceived me quite a lot. Another girl I was talking to via internet met a guy and don't talk to me really often since. I've got two best friends since childhood but we only see each others on weekends because of university and don't really have the same passions and outlook on life anymore so we're not as close as we used to. And yeah, the friendship I've got with a girl I met a few weeks ago (on internet, again) is - I think - starting to struggle because we don't really know what to talk about.
And as a result, all these little things make me sad, and as they make me sad, they're probably affecting my friendships and my passions again because I don't really enjoy life and am not as confident as I used to be.

So, yeah, I feel trapped. Have you got any advice to get better?

276,"Hello, 

Last January I met someone with a group of my friends, I don’t recall the much since it was brief and in a very crowded place but after the meeting that person started following me on my SM accounts.

At the beginning it was normal since we had very similar interests, we’d often discuss stuff regularly.

Then I’ve met him again by chance, and the look in his eyes when he saw me just ... creeped me out. I don’t want to sound mean but he looked at me like I’m a holy being, like he valued me so so much even though we barely had any relationship outside online small talk.

After the meeting I’ve noticed that he’d always be the first to reply on every single thing I wrote, even if it was silly or even if he didn’t know much about it. Every, single, post.


After a while, I’ve received from him the strangest message ever: he said that I’m the worst person he ever met, that I’m a liar, only using people, that I don’t care about anything or anyone and that I’m so selfish and horrible and he wishes me the worst in life.


To be frank, my first reaction was to laugh because I don’t recall doing ANYTHING to this person that would warrant such hurtful words. I honestly don’t even know the guy to do anything good/bad to him.

Anyways, I didn’t reply. After that with a few days he sent me a message to apologize.

He mentioned that he actually said all these terrible words to make himself forget me since he was in love with me. He kept on saying how the world sucks and how he is too sentimental and people make fun of him because of that.

The part that scared me the most is that the message sounded so damn suicidal, he said that he’d not been keen on living, that he’s suffering from extreme depression and is always feeling horrible until he met me and I was the highlight of his life...

I didn’t know how to reply, I was very hurt about what he said about me but at the same time I was afraid to push him (or anyone) to the edge. 
After a while of thinking I told him I didn’t hate him (because the message was so damn desperate).

After that he started to get back to his old routine of “I wanna be your friend” and started messaging me and replying to everything as if nothing happened. 

To be honest I couldn’t reply to any of his messages or comments because I felt so damn SUFFOCATED by his constant presence, people get to choose who to interact with right? Why can’t I do the same?

Anyways I have not replied to anything for 2 days, then he sent me another message saying how horrible and feeling-less I am, and how I don’t deserve anything in life and that he has a pride and won’t care about me anymore.

That was a very happy moment for me, I didn’t want to say anything bad to him because of how close to the edge he sounded but then again getting him out of my life is exactly what I want.

After that, he contacted me again saying how he is sorry and really really wants to be my friend at least, the message sounded equally depressing and mentioned how so many things in his life weren’t going the right way and I was the reason he ever felt good...

To be honest I’m sick and tired of him and his constant online stalking and hurtful words, I’ve blocked him from everything and don’t want anything to do with such a toxic, abusive and unstable person. 

I have even started to avoid any gathering where I might meet him because he honestly doesn’t sound very stable... 

I’ve suffered from depression myself and it’s not a card to use to force others to return your feelings or interact with you, at the same time I’m afraid that I’ve pushed him to the edge regardless of how toxic he is...

278,"As the title says, I’m really struggling trying to decide if I should continue to game on Xbox or swap to PC.

During the Black Friday and Christmas sales, I managed to pick up both an Xbox One X and 4K TV, and a high end gaming PC (i7 7700, 1080 Ti, 16GB DDR4 ram) and monitor (1440p, 144Hz, G-sync) for really great prices.

Unfortunately, the time I have to make returns is almost out, and I’m still having difficulty making my final decision on which route to go.

I definitely see the merits of gaming on a PC over the Xbox.

* The games run smoother with higher frames, better graphics and better loading times, if only slightly better then games on the Xbox One X right now, but probably much better in the next few years as newer games require even higher performance.
* I love the ability to get so many cheap games from Steam sales and Humble Bundle.
* It’s much easier to just jump into discord and play or chat with friends then it is trying to manage the clunky xbox party system
* There are way more games that are available only on PC that I would like to play then there are games on Xbox and not on PC
* The steam refund policy is extremely useful and has already saved me a few times where I would have been screwed on Xbox

While the PC has a bunch of advantages over the Xbox, there are still some things keeping it in the consideration

* I’ve been gaming on Xbox for years, so I already own about 300 games (mostly digital) on the system, most of which are AAA games rather then a bunch of the nonsense games filling up my steam library. Having to buy some/most/all of those games again is pretty annoying and wasteful
* While I appreciate that a M/KB is superior to a controller for gaming, it is much more comfortable for me to use a controller. Because of that, I will probably play everything but FPS and RTS with a controller on PC. And while I know that many steam games support a controller, there are some that won’t. Games on xbox will never have that issue
* I really like completing achievements and 100%’ing games, and Xbox does a much better job of making you feel like you’ve completed something and inspiring a sense of competition then steam does
* The Xbox is much easier to move around and set up which is pretty nice right now since I’m constantly going to and from college every semester, but might be far less important after I graduate soon

I would appreciate any advice or suggestions any of you have for me to help make this decision a little easier for me",15Jan2018,1

So I’m currently a first year college student in my second term of school. I decided to take an untraditional route and got an apartment with my 2  best friends instead of rooming at school. We did not plan to go to the same school it just so happen that we all got accepted and we all loved the school. I’ve known these two guys since we were in grammar school so we know each other very well.  It’s pretty sweet having a lot of room for myself, but we have had some rocky spots because my friends are messy. They much rather sleep all day than do any cleaning, but after a pretty big fight we got everything squared away and now we all do our share of cleaning and cooking etc. The apartment is roughly a 10 minutes drive from school. Now the thing I need advice on... I have an inside connection with the RA administration and they are pushing me to apply to be an RA. The benefit of being an RA is I still get my own room, free living, and a free meal plan. But, I’d be screwing my roommates over because they need me in the apartment to be able to afford it, and without me it would be a little tougher on them to rent a place out as getting approved in the current place was next to impossible. The plan originally was to live together outside of campus and save money for all 4 years of college, but I’d no longer be saving money if I was an RA. Now the RA position is not a for sure thing, but I have a pretty good shot at getting approved.

So there's this girl that I really, really like. We're both girls, and I live in a super homophobic country. I've accepted the fact that nothing can happen between us. However, she's just such, such an amazing person, that even if we weren't romantically involved, I would want her in my life because she's just so great - no joke. I'm not sure what her impression of me is. She and I have a **ton** of mutual acquaintances and friends. We've even worked together on an event before, but it was a large scale event with a large team, so I didn't really feel much. She once even smiled at me when she saw me.

The bottom line is, with all this information in mind, how do I approach my crush to hopefully start a friendship with her? I have a friend whose boyfriend literally won her over with chocolate. He went up to her when she was in the library,  said he couldn’t finish his Toblerone, and offered it to her. He then Facebook messaged her about the chocolate, they started talking, and now they’ve been dating for over a year. I would do what my friend’s boyfriend did, though I'm not sure if it'd be a good idea. It would seem a little weird, wouldn’t it?

Even with my friend’s boyfriend, we knew his intentions from the start. My crush and I are both girls, however, so I suppose that changes things a little (we do live in a heteronormative society). With all that said, I’m pretty desperate, as she’s graduating soon, and I **really** don’t want to miss my chance. She's completed all her subjects and is currently only working on her dissertation. She's often in the student lounge, doing work - though I'm not sure what her schedule is like and what days she's in campus.

Later that day I went to volunteer at a film festival and i felt  another panic attack coming on, so I decided to take my panic attack meds hydroxyzine. But it didn't work after the first dosage, and this is where I completely fucked up and took another dosage almost immediately after the first one.

286,"A much-loved friend of mine is becoming an extreme white supremacist, and I'm afraid for them and what they may do.

This friend always had a little animosity about racial issues--they felt that certain groups were favored or given extra perks based on race, such as Jews being favored for jobs in the financial and entertainment sectors, or minorities being given quotas or affirmative action measures. Over the past few years, they've become increasingly vocal about Jews running the world, blacks being intellectually inferior, etc. They also are pretty involved in conspiracy theories (this, too, started off as minor and has gotten much more extreme in the last several years).

I believe this friend has been spending more and more time reading white supremacist materials, watching propaganda videos, and falling into more radical/militant thought patterns. My friend is very smart, but I fear their intelligence just makes the problem worse--they see patterns and conspiracies where there aren't any.

I don't believe my friend would physically hurt someone, at least not right now, but I have noticed them making statements or doing things in public that make clear their racial bias in ways that are uncomfortable for other people. And their behavior is getting worse.

I've tried to talk about it with them, but they tell me I'm wrong and don't understand. They try to share books, pamphlets, websites, etc. with me, but I'm fairly liberal and this completely falls outside my world view. We've agreed to disagree on several occasions, but I'm feeling more desperate about their downward trajectory.

289,"Some background info on me/my family: 
I was born in a middle eastern country to a family with a really small religion where one of the biggest ""rules"" of the religion is that you marry someone from the religion. If you don't, it is seen as a horrendous act and a dishonour to your entire family and I risk being disowned. I do not believe in any religions or God, thus find it unfair on myself to have to marry someone with the religion my parents have. Right now, I live in Australia and I'm 18. I am going to be attending university shortly. 

I currently have a boyfriend (let's call him Q) who isn't from the same religion, and my parents found out about him. This obviously caused a huge shitstorm leading to my parents going through my phone and finding terrible things in it. Right now I have my phone confiscated and it will be for months. 
 
I am unsure of what to do. Me and Q have talked and are certain of our ability to build a happy life together. While we only have been dating for 6 months, we have known each other for over two years and only started dating when we knew we were definitely in love (due to the situation with my parents). 

I have FindMyIphone set up, so I am able to wipe off my phone entirely. But if I did so, I wouldn't be able to find it through getting it to play sound. Also, I'm pretty sure they've already seen the worst of it. 

I don't have enough money to move out and support myself through university, plus I don't drive. Currently, my plan is to suck up to my parents and regain their trust and finish university/get a job to be financially supported, while seeing Q secretly. 

What do you think I should do? ",15Jan2018,2

We fight a lot and even when I try to reason with her it doesn’t work because of her extreme ignorance. She wasn’t always this bad but even after seeing many mental health specialists and taking meds it hasn’t helped. Also half of her problem is she Denise most of her faults and mental problems. I don’t live with my dad anymore but it was also very hard to live with him because he also is not mentally well and is a alcoholic who tends to have extreme anger outbursts and can be abusive.

- Lighter fluid to dissolve the glue and reapply? (least ideal)

300,"I got the call today that my sister is in the ICU after overdosing and it's looking like she's likely not going to pull through. My mother is devastated as expected but...I just don't feel anything. 

We grew up in the same household, I've known her literally my whole life, but we never really connected. She's a daughter from my mother's first marriage and is 8 years older than me. By the time I actually found my own personality, she was basically out of the house. During her junior and senior year of high school, she started acting out, adopting a drug habit early...I was never sure with what. 

Now I'm 21, and she's has made some attempts to reconnect but I've never really taken the extend hands. We've gone out to eat now and then, but it's been less than five times in the past five years. She has lied to me and my mother for years, and we had hoped that now that she's a parent of her own she would change...but she continuously proves us wrong in that she is still this selfish and manipulative person. 

The person I knew my sister to be growing up, who was still not great, is a far cry from who she turned out to be. Essentially...the image of who I thought she was died long ago and this person who acts as a constant leech on our lives is now resting in the ICU, uncertain if she will pull through. If anything, I'm annoyed; I'm annoyed that she didn't take the time to think how this has made our mother panic and completely destroy her, how this will impact her own children. If she dies...I don't think I'm going to feel anything and I feel like a horrible person for being this way but ultimately I don't know this person, and I haven't cared about them in years.

306,"When I was much younger, I had met a girl through a mutual friend who seemed to be too good to be true. Due to my circumstances at home and trauma in my past, I was extremely reserved and generally antisocial. I had very few friends, none of which who could relate to very well and as such I always felt like an outsider looking in. Then I met her, who understood exactly what I was going through, and was the first person I had truly opened myself up to. Of course, as young and naive high schoolers do, we spent as much time together as we could until we inevitably ended up dating for a year. She was my first love, and for that year that we were together I can honestly say was the happiest I ever was up until that point. She became very distant towards the end, and I had my suspicions about it, but I didn’t act on them and ended up getting dumped. I was devastated, and I spent my last year of high school and first year of college just barely getting by. I had lost my best friend, the only friend who understood and lived through the hell that was my dysfunctional upbringing. Finally, something just clicked one day and I got over it. I had become disgusted with what I became and didn’t want to be in that place anymore. I moved away, focused on actually caring about myself, and did a 180 personality change. My dedication to self improvement was enough to land me in an apprenticeship program in the field of my dream, and life at the moment is currently going great. I’ve made new friends, and been in a few relationships in the two years I started on self improvement, but then it all came to a screeching halt. A week ago, a really good friend of mine since my high school days confessed that not too long ago, my first love had come to him and told him that she cheated on me towards the end. The guilt of it was too much for her apparently, and she had wanted to tell me all along, but felt that with how far I’ve come, it was probably better to not even contact me. I always sort of knew, but never really believed my suspicions or the clues that made it obvious later on. I thought that I had honestly moved on, it’s been four years since we’ve spoken and she hasn’t crossed my mind at all in the last two, yet for some reason getting closure has put me back in the same place I was when she left. I’m so very confused, and extremely angry at myself for feeling the way I do at this moment. I just don’t get it, I had thought this was all in the past but apparently I’m not over it and it’s pissing me off. I don’t really know what to do or how to go about this. My performance at work has suffered to the point where I was asked to take a break for my own good. Any advice at all on how to deal with this?

307,"So for starters, I’m 25, been unemployed for about 5 months and live with my parents and younger siblings in a very dysfunctional setting. This combination of factors has made me relatively depressed and it’s beginning to affect my relationship with my girlfriend. We live about an hour away from each other and since I️ don’t have a car, it’s been very difficult to see her. I️’m making progress on my job search so I’m feeling less stress from that, but the family situation isn’t improving. 

Anyways, because of all this, I️ often turn to my girlfriend for help because I️ don’t really have a lot of other support and obviously this is stressing her out as I️ imagine it would. But when I️ bottle it up for her sake, it comes back to bite me and I️ become resentful and bitter towards her for not being able to be as emotionally supportive as I’d like it. Her type of support is “solution-oriented”, which is great; she’s sent me tons of jobs to apply for and helps me with cover letters/resumes, etc. But sometimes I️ just want someone to tell me it’s going to be okay and give me an emotional pat on the back. As I️ type this I️ realize how selfish it sounds because she’s done so much for me already. However, she just doesn’t know how to help me emotionally because it’s not how she thinks and not what she would want in my position. 

We’ve had talks about what she and I️ can do for each other to not make it as stressful, but I️ still feel like getting upset when she’s not “emotionally” there for me. 

I️ guess my question is, what can I️ do to stop relying on her so much and what are some ways I️ can distract myself when the depression sets in and I️ want to go to her?",15Jan2018,1

Since she's an art major, I have let her sketch me in the past when we hung out for practice. This week she asked me if she could sketch me again since she is taking an accelerated class this coming semester and wanted to practice. However, this time she asked if I would model nude, fully nude for her since the class is studying nudes. 

So yesterday I modeled for her, fully nude. I stood in front of her for over an hour while she studied my body and sketched. While I was modeling for her we started talking about modeling and style and clothing and stuff like that. Since the conversation drifted that way, I asked her what kind of underwear she wears just out of curiosity (I figured if I'm standing here nude, what's the big deal asking a question about underwear?).

She immediately said 'that's none of your business, that's a personal question and you have no reason to know'! Here I was, standing completely nude in front of her as she studied every square inch of my body and private parts, plus she saw me in my boxers earlier as I changed... but I can't ask a simple question?

Am I wrong? I mean I bared everything for her, I stood fully nude in front of her and let her see my entire body. She knows exactly what I look like naked, yet she got upset over a simple question about underwear? Should I be upset or is she right? What do you think? ",15Jan2018,0

Since then I've seen her a few times and have only had small talk because I still blush super hard and literally can't ask her simple questions.

313,"Hello, dedicated Redditors.

I am a 38-year-old male who has been struggling for years with the issue of having a child.  For as long as I can remember, I have not wanted to be a father, though I have tried for years to convince myself otherwise.  Several years ago I ended a loving though flawed ten-year relationship with the love of my life over this issue, and various attempts to reconcile or find answers through separation or therapy have not led to any greater clarity.  I am nearly certain that I do not want to raise a child (and can elaborate on why if doing so would be helpful), but am having such tremendous difficulty finding peace with this decision and who I am.  I worry that I will miss out on an potentially amazing experience but also fear the unknown.  I'm paralyzed.

Do I not want a child?  Or do I not want a child with the woman I was with for a decade?  Will the right partner change how I feel?  Is my lingering doubt meaningful?  How can I find peace with who I am and what I want from my life?  I am full of regret and self-doubt and do not know which path to follow.

Last year I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and obsessive thoughts, and I spend so much time thinking about the pros and cons of raising child, scouring the internet for articles and forums on this subject (like Reddit!), and it’s utterly exhausting.  I would much rather be spending my time doing other and more productive things.

I have a pretty good life.  I feel financially secure for the first time in my adult life, I have a challenging and rewarding career that allows me to work educating young people (including taking groups to Africa every other year), I have two cats that I adore, I travel extensively, and I generally enjoy my quiet existence.  I visited Iceland this past August and it was one of the most amazing experiences of my life.  Could I have had the same experience with a child in tow?  I will be taking sabbatical leave this fall and will be spending six months trekking through the U.S. West hiking my butt off, something I’ve wanted to do ever since reading Into the Wild more than ten years ago.  I consider myself a wanderer, though wandering means leaving behind so much and so many, including potential romantic partners.  I simply want to find peace and purpose.  Tolkien wrote that “not all those who wander are lost.”  I agree, though I do feel lost at the moment.

I would be extremely grateful for any thoughts and insights that the forum may have.  Most people have children.  Some do not.  I do not know which one I am.  Many thanks, and peace.",15Jan2018,2

 I know that education is important and can be the key to a better life (something I want), but at the moment I am finding it hard to concentrate on school.

All I want is to make them proud of me and help them have a better life. 
 
I currently live at home with both my parents and my older brother(20). when I started college I wanted to become an ESL teacher, but now I am leaning towards a two-year degree(dental hygiene) because it is less schooling and will pay a little more. I currently do not pay for school, everything is covered by financial aid and scholarships. my dad is 74 years old, he retired last year and still works a fulltime job (48 hrs per week) and works in peoples gardens as a side job. my older brother and I also have jobs, I am part-time and my brother fulltime. I hate seeing my dad work soo much, he's already old and deserves to rest. we own a home, but the loan payments are incredibly high( around 2k+ monthly). 

My question is if it would be a bad idea to withdrawal from college for a year or two, look for a full-time job and help my dad with bills. My older brother skipped college because like me he wants my dad to works less and help with bills at home. thanks everyone.",15Jan2018,1

I opened a Wells Fargo account where I lived just before moving, because the bank I used didn't have a branch in the new location. When I got to the new location I found no one spoke English, so I opened an account with Bank of America. I failed to actually close the Wells Fargo account and to the best of my knowledge I never used the account. Now, 7 years later, LCM Filing is offering me a settlement of just over $500 or I can proceed with disputing this debt and settle in court, in which case they are asking for almost $2000, plus court and lawyer fees/costs.

I've dealt with a collection agency before from a debt I disputed and they were willing to work with me and in the end I paid, but it was never threatened to go to court. This LCM Filing said I cannot see the penalties and fees Wells Fargo is claiming until they are shown to me in court. Of course, I can make a good will payment now in which case they will speak with the lawyers and discuss settlement options and payments, but I have to give my current bank account in order to pay. I said I was not willing to give out my bank account information to someone who contacted me with a little bit of valid information about my past, to that I was told they would give me until tomorrow morning to consider my options after words they will proceed with the lawsuit.

Is this for real? Is this just a really aggressive debt collection agency? Should I ignore this? The agent claimed they would garnish my wages and pursue every penalty and court fee possible.

324,"I’m the drummer in a punk band, and we’re about to go into the studio to record our second EP. So to get ready for it, I asked the singer to send over the lyrics to all the songs we were planning on recording.

Now, he’s the kind of guy who will make sure things are done his way (as you’ll see in a sec), and he never really uses Facebook, which is our way of talking - so his replies will often take hours or a day.

One of the songs in particular is one that we are planning on releasing as a lead single and maybe even a music video - it’s called ‘Boy’. It’s a good song, we’ve played it so many times live before and it goes down good with everyone.

So we made plans for doing a music video with Boy. But we needed to make a storyline, a pitch for what the video would be about.

So one day, I sat down and read the lyrics, and I realised it doesn’t make much sense. The chorus seems to basically say “I wish this girl would notice me”, but the verses would be like “oh fuck off and leave me alone”.

So, I messaged the singer and said something like “we should change this lyric to so-and-so because what you said didn’t make sense”. But his response was something like “no, not being a dick, but we are not changing any lyrics in this song because it’s one of the only songs that’s perfect”. Basically, he made it seem adamant that he was not going to listen to us.

This led to an argument between all of us, as 2 of us (me and the bassist) was swaying for the Change side, and 1 (the singer) was swaying for the Don’t Change side.

What should we do? Stick with his lyrics that, in our eyes, don’t make sense, or try to convince the singer that our version of the lyric change is best?

Now it feels like the service year is pointless in furthering my career as it is direct service and I am going to school for nonprofit management. Furthermore, the organization I am with is small with no room to be apart of operations/a position relevant after service. 

I know that the pay is no secret when beginning a service year. My finances changed a few months ago (mostly because of graduate school but some family issues as well). I am now working 30+ hours with Americorps, full-time grad school, part-time nanny, and doing a research study on the side for extra cash. If I quit and found a full-time job, it would cut my workload immensely. Education stipend isn't worth it as I would save more on my own. 

I dislike the executive director and the work I am doing. However, we've started work in high schools 5x per week. There's a clearance required and I + the other Americorps member are the only ones with it. This is where my dilemma is. I want to search for a full-time job with growth opportunity so I am not flailing after graduate school but I do not want to leave the organization hanging. If I leave then the executive director is left to pick up where I left off with the schools. On the other hand, this is not an organization that I will work with post-service.

I should add that I suffer from depression myself (though not as severely as she does), and probably even shouldn't be as personally close to her as I am (given I'm one of her students). 

Advice ASAP please.",15Jan2018,1

336,"My best friend and I met at work about 2 years ago. She moved away in August, and we have talked every single day since she moved. We trust each other with lots of deep, personal shit. 
 
She came to visit me and our other friend this weekend. But she also invited a bunch of our old coworkers to hang out. I quit our old job last week (and moved), so I wasn't thrilled they would be there, but I get that she's more social than me.  
 
The new job I took is embarrassing to me. It's a step down in title, but it pays $20k more than I used to make and is no overtime. I took it because I wanted to move, and have been feeling insecure about the decision. My BFF knows this. 
 
Anyway, before I got there on Saturday, my old coworkers were apparently saying that my new job wasn't worth it and that I screwed up. When I got there, they were acting weird and drilling me about my new job and how much I make. 
 
I told my BFF later that I felt uncomfortable, and then she finally told me that they had all talked shit right before I got there.
 
I was offended that: 
  
  
- A) She didn't text me to tell me before I got there. I wouldn't have came if I knew that they were being negative. She knows that I'm having a very hard time with moving and with my new job. 
     

  
- B) She didn't stick up for me and try to tell them that my job was a huge bump in pay **and** no overtime. 
  
 
I feel that she was not loyal, for the reasons above. She was more concerned with having a big party with acquaintances, and posting shit to Snapchat, than sticking up for her real friend. 
  
 
Am I overreacting? ",15Jan2018,1
338,"So, long story short I wasn't thinking left my fish tank in my dorm in the dark over winter break with some plants and old fish food in it and I came back to the smell of dead things.  (Duh.  Won't be making that mistake twice.)  The tank is made of plastic.

The problem is, the tank *won't stop smelling like dead things.*  It was fairly expensive (well, for a college student) so I'd rather not buy a new one.  I tried to clean it with soap and warm water, that worked to get all of the actual physical dead plant residue out of it, but even after washing it with bleach multiple times, it still smells like dead organic matter. 

Any advice, or should I just eat the price of a new tank?",15Jan2018,2
339,"Pretty much the title. I don't know if A: He's cheating on my mom with this woman and she is letting my dad use her credit card or B: He found a wallet and kept the cards and is using them to buy things. Either way I'm absolutely horrified and don't know what I should do. Any advice at all is very welcome at this point. 

Update: I feel kinda bad but I did some snooping on previous bought items to see if her cards are being used, and yikes. She lives in the same neighborhood who’s homeowner’s board hired my dad years back to be their contractor who does odd jobs/work for all the homes there? This is just getting more and more weird.

340,My friend suddenly seems to be much more active and he is obsessed with cryptocurrency. In the past he was unstable and sometimes would skip up to a month of classes. I am afraid he may be bipolar or schizoaffective and undergoing a manic episode. How do I help him?,15Jan2018,1
341,"My partner and I recently had our first child at the end of last year. I have a decent job and hold the insurance coverage so within 30 days of the birth I reported a life event change and had her added. Everything seemed great, the bills started rolling (still much higher than expected) and she appeared to be covered. Today I just noticed that they were taking out a lot less then they should from my paycheck and basically found out that I did the life event for 2017 (so the hospital stay was covered) but didn't do it again for the 2018 period. My wife is going to kill me. It's 12 days past the ""31 day rule"" that allows for insurance changes after a birth which means they probably won't let me add her on. I am completely freaked out.. if she gets sick we could lose everything. What do I do!? How can I afford this if she gets sick with no coverage..?? Please please does anyone have advice?

TLDR: I mistakenly didn't add my newborn to my health insurance plan, now what??",15Jan2018,2
342,"So I'll try and keep this brief....I had a $25 a month payment plan set up with my Vet. Total balance was approx $150 at the start...Last October I was contacted by the vet clinic and asked prior to running my Debit card. The Vet has been most generous in their ability to work with me and my limited amount of funds. So they called to make sure it was ok to run the final payment..I agreed to run it and knew I had plenty of funds at the time to cover the final payment. 

So since October 21st  I have been confident in the knowledge that my payments were over and done with. Fast forward to last week, and my Dog is need once again for another round of antibiotics and allergy medication. He's an  AmStaff and they are often prone to skin conditions...Anyway, I call the Vet and ask for another round of meds and to set up another payment plan like before..Which of course was no problem for them to do for me..But it had to be cleared with the head Vet first...The next day I get a call from them saying that they are unable to open another payment plan because my first one still had a $20 balance and that it had to be paid off before they could open a new payment plan...Of course I was baffled and stated that the payment had been made and that I should no longer have a balance since October 21st...They stated again that there was a balance, but asked me to look through my records and they will do the same to see if any answers could be found....After digging for the evening I could find no evidence through my banking statements that no payment had been run during the month of October. However, since my phone automatically records every one of my phone calls, I had the evidence and full conversation stating that I had given permission to run the final payment. 

Now here's what really gets to me...Is that if there was any issue of any kind with that payment. Why have nearly 3 months gone by without anyone contacting me? To let me know that ""hey, there's a problem"".....Not a single peep from that time until now....And I feel a bit cheated and upset that I am still expected to make that final payment even though I made every effort to do so and they're the ones who screwed up......

What should I do? Do I still make the final payment ""With money I don't have""  or do I stand my ground and try to fight it? Do I say anything to the clinic? Do I just accept it?  What should I do?",15Jan2018,1
343,"I have been working for a company that involves real estate. I started off low level and worked my way to a position that makes big decisions very quickly. On the way I heard from coworkers at different sites that they only hire whites and would like to only have whites in the company. I ignored all of it, focused on my own work. After all, at that point there was no proof to what they were saying. I ended up taking on.. lets just say a place that was mostly African American with an all African American staff. I seemed to be the only white man in 5 square miles. I was in charge of this area and lead a staff of around 20, plus vendors. One day the Vice President of our company comes to visit and tells me to my face that he wants to turn the property ""white"". He wants to somehow get rid of the office staff and go from there. Trust me when I say I was sitting in on conference calls that included our company attorney on what to watch out for when trying to find ways to fire a few people. He was coaching us to manipulate their attitudes and actions to fit our firing policies. I'm suppose to fire one at the end of this week. I called off today because my stress level is out of control because of my moral compass going bat shit crazy. I'm not sure if I should just up and quit or go along with the in crowd because this job pays well. When is ok to say no and just walk away? No way I could win in court with these people, they have way to much money and I have nothing recorded. I also don't want to ruffle any feathers. I just want to clear my head and not do the wrong thing this week. I think the employee doesn't deserve to be fired. But when you have 2 supervisors over you, one being the vice president, I don't have much of a say... I'm pretty damn confused. Any options?",15Jan2018,1
345,"So here I am 23 years old. I've been dealt a shitty hand. I couldn't complete college because of family turning their back on me and me becoming homeless. That led to having trouble with my job and on top of school debt I was not able to keep up with my non related school loans. 

I work at a dead end job but even being the full time assistant manager I cannot afford to live on my own. I have great skills on computers and software development but in my area of the US there are no jobs relating to that field around. I also know nobody in that field and since I couldn't complete my degree I don't have the piece of paper proving my skills. 

I have tried to develop apps on the Google play store and have couple on there but one was mostly a test and the other is incomplete and even though me and my long time friend plan to complete it years have passed and nothing has been done mostly due to our situation. 

I have wanted to dropship and had a successful night of that but since I owe paypal money I was unable to fulfill that order and lost the money. Since I have no investment money I cannot afford to continue on any other platform.

I want to do e-commerce and be an entreprenuer but since I have no money to invest it Is impossible. Where I live now I am going to have to move in a couple months which I have no idea what I will do. 

The only option I see avaliable is truck driving and it's something that I really don't want to do. I'm so sick of hating my life everyday. Suicide runs through my mind at least twice a week. 

I know there's no get rich quick schemes out there and there's no magical way to solve these problems but at this point I'm just lost and all my motivation is gone. I've tried so hard to only be pushed down further by friends and family. 

Thanks for reading and if you have any advice please share. Thanks again.

346,"Hello! I'm 19 years old and graduated high school 1 year ago. Currently I'm living with my dad in Illinois and my mom lives in Texas. I'm in the Navy Delayed Entry Program and have earned my Navy Seal Contract in which I leave for in June. The reason I want to move with my mom is because there is a lot of stress in my life due to my dad causing which is me to second guess my decision. Every month I have to make a PST which is a few hours away and my dad has the vehicle and on more than one occasion threatened to not let me use it. If I don't make the PST's I have the potential to lose my contract. Furthermore, he's outright said I should move in with my mom and that it's ""time for him to take care of himself"" and calls me selfish which stresses me out even more. Also, since we only have one car on multiple occasions he's said that he won't let me use it to keep working out which I need to because the gym is a 30 minute drive from me which puts even more strain on the whole Navy thing. In between all that he's just not a nice person. If I move to my moms I don't think I would want to keep pursuing my Navy thing and maybe just act is if I took a gap year for college and join during the fall semester. What should I do?

347,"Quick background: 24 yo, graduated a few years ago with a Bachelors degree in Biomedical Science, worked for three years as an ER/ICU Veterinary Technician. 

It was a combination of being exhausted from a low-paying/ high-stress career ($14/hr; 36+hrs/wk), wanting to live independently while developing a career, and pining to travel that prompted me to apply to an international graduate school. That acceptance letter felt like a second wind. I planned the logistics and finances in the months leading up to the ship-out date. Despite leaving my family, friends, and amazing boyfriend back home, I felt prepared and ready to give my 110% for the program and for myself. 

However, life threw in a few wrenches that I will just summarize:
1) Crowded apartment with black mold.
2) Landlady threatens to sue me.
3) Move away (by myself) from campus.
4) My cat back home dies unexpectedly.
5) I fail to receive 9 of 15 credits by December.
6) Become homesick and develop an imposter syndrome.

Trying to uphold optimism I look into related graduate programs within my interests and without heavy statistics (my sore spot). I received permission to switch to another program Fall 2018. There was confusion in determining what program would evaluate my mandatory 13 month research project. Unfortunately it would be the day after the project submission deadline until I received valid information. *Failure to meet the deadline would extend the anticipated graduation date by 8 months* 

I have been trying to digest this for the past week, and my acne has not been forgiving.  This ordeal makes me reconsider why I am even in graduate school; and now I have a week to determine my life for the next 2+ years. 

Since my undergraduate studies I have flucuated on my career type education or research. I neither feel inspired nor cut-out for performing research. Digging into other career options I found out that - with alternative certification- I could become a high school teacher and earn as much as a career after this graduate school program.

My career choices for after this degree was either to teach secondary or post-secondary, or work for a public agency. I am seriously considering dropping it all, earning a certification, and teaching high school life sciences back home. However should  this happen I would need to dissemble everything (IKEA heh) that I have built up to. Not to mention the short and long-term monetary loss. 

I, as do my coworkers, believe myself to be a hardworking and open-minded person who enjoys helping others. I am fascinated with life's oddities and want to invoke that in others.  

Teachers or people with life experience - is it worth leaving gradaute school in order to teach? Is it be possible to obtain a graduate degree while teaching? Have you ever dropped out of academia?

Super thanks for reading this far! I appreciate it. 

TLDR; Homesick student not performing well in international graduate program, subsequently becoming very late in research proposal. Has to determine to stick it out two more years or return home to teach.",15Jan2018,1
350,"Generally these are questions someone would ask a parent for help. However, 2/3 of the people that raised me are dead, and the other lives far away. My biological parents, well, dad wasn't around much because he had to work 3 jobs to take care of me. Even to this day still ain't around too much and barely knows me. My mom on the other hand abused me so I kicked her out of my life. So here I am at Reddit!

Upon growing up I noticed I was vastly different from most people. I was diagnosed as an adult with aspergers, bipolar type 2, major depression, ADHD, and anxiety. Because of these problems I had a lot of difficulty growing up in the sense of being an adult and being responsible. If I had an adult figure that paid attention to me these diagnosis would've been discovered earlier and my life wouldn't have been so heavily impacted as it was.

Here's the thing. I have little to no emotions for others. I don't understand social cues. But I am very intelligent and taught myself facial and micro expressions to help me understand other people. Though what it doesn't help is me on the work place. Every employer and customer tends to notice how I have a complete lack of expression on my face and it deters away from me or they make a complaint about it and I get told to ""fix my face"" basically. 

With this bit of background I can finally get to the questions. 

How do I ""fix my face"" so to speak? 
//If you see my face there's always a blank expression on it. I can mimic expressions but if I'm heavily depressed that day like most days then I can't mimic it very well.

How do I get a job for something I am good at?
//Because of my major depression and ADHD  I haven't been able to fully focus on school since I was in 3rd grade. Despite starting college at 15 1/2 and being 22 now, I still can't complete even the most basic of degrees. Which every job I can do exceptionally well requires a master's degree.

How can I manage money better and fight my urge of temporary happiness and boredom?
//I constantly buy games or micro transaction inside games to receive temporary happiness. I've rarely been happy my entire life, and it's a feeling I want to keep so I end up wasting money I know I shouldn't. On top of that I spend money when I am bored. I'm bored simply because nothing challenges me even in school. If I don't understand something I learn it at an incredibly fast rate. 

Basically just need help on basic life crap a parent would help their child with. If you can't help then thank you for taking the time to read it all. Gives me some comfort knowing someone tried to help or at least took the time to read what I said. 

Thank you.
