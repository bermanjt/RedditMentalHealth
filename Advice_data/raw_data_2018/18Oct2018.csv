0,"Hey, so I'm a 1st year university student (18 y/o), and I didn't really like where I grew up. I got bullied in high school, got along with my parents decently, but our relationship was definitely not perfect by any means. So I moved far away for University, to get a fresh start.

I love my new environment and my new area, and I feel happier, less angry, I made real friends too.

Now the question is, my friend wants to move out here permanently, and asked if I wanted to live with him. I said yes, but I'm worried my parents will not be happy and try to make me come home even after I complete my degree. 

What should I do ",18Oct2018,1
1,"So I’ve been talking to this girl for about a wk and a half over SC (known her for a while before though). I mean, usually she’s good about getting back to me even with her being busy. It takes a while, but I really don’t think anything of it cuz it’s the same time of day usually. 

Idk I’m worried I guess and I don’t know if I should be. People say if a girl doesn’t get back until a long time after, it means she’s not into you. I know she’s busy and all, and I haven’t bought this up to her cuz I wanna respect that fact. 

Problem is, I texted her last afternoon and still nothing back. She was giving absolutely no sign that she’s tryna end the conversation, it just happened. She just hasn’t opened it yet and idk what to think. 

Like, I see this girl at least once a week outside of just talking so I mean, you’d figure if she didn’t want me to text her anymore she’s either say it straight in person or even over text. 

Another thing is, I know she doesn’t use SC often, but I just sorta feel like “she’d be responding if it was one of her friends” but not with me.

I’m not bitter over it, but I just don’t know what to think rn. I’ll give it the night, but really even if she does get back , I don’t know what to think about the whole thing in general. 

Am I just overreacting? Am I being naive thinking she might be interested? Anyone else have a similar experience and can give me some advice here, cuz i rly need it rn.",18Oct2018,1
2,"So about 3 months ago I was told I have golfers elbow and that it's a long term injury. I acquired the injury from work stacking shelves. I've had to use personal leave and take unpaid time off and work still haven't helped me pay for a professional check up and insist I still do work I'm not comfortable with. I've been told that work cover will jeopardize any chance of finding an alternate job. Is there any way I can be compensated for having to take time off and is going on work cover as jeopardizing as I've been told?

3,"So I am currently employed at place that has treated me absolutely fantastic. I mean they have been very supportive of needs (for example single dad of 3 kids issues), the whole company is basically family to eachother, in fact it is a small family owned business. However, the money is minuscule and hardly enough to live off of. Money is the only reason I have even considered leaving, and would otherwise stay in a heartbeat. Unfortunately being a small family owned business they cannot afford much more.

I have received a job offer that would almost triple my current income. The issue is that they want me to start monday morning next week if I want the job, leaving me with the task of giving my employer 1 day notice or basically quitting on the spot. I really need that job, but really hate to burn this bridge after the relationship we have had. I was REALLY hoping to be able to give a 2 week notice, they really dont deserve to be blindsided like that.

Any suggestions what to do from here or what I can say to my current boss?",18Oct2018,1

6,"I’m 40. I’m an only child and grew up in a home with little emotion. It was a loving home, very much so. But saying “I love you” from me or from my parents was and ‘if I remember’ sort of thing. Never bothered me, still doesn’t.

Growing up, I saw my dad cry once...my grandfathers funeral. Same with my mom (though I’m sure she has cried other times, usually out of frustration). My grandfather died maybe 10 years ago and I’m pretty sure that’s the last time I cried.

Suffice to say, I don’t cry. Not because I don’t want to, I’ll tear up a tiny bit if something hits me in a movie (ie, the ending scene of F&amp;F, the tribute to Paul Walker, or seeing Optimus Prime transform for the first time on the big screen). 

My wife comes from a very outwardly open emotional family. When we go to visit, she cries, her brothers cry, her mom cries, etc. I stand there just being awkward. She wears her emotions on her sleeve. I suppress or get over things very quickly. 5 minutes after a fight I’m basically like “where are the M&amp;Ms?”

In February we found out we were FINALLY pregnant. I should mention I was previously married, I have two kids (G 10/ B 8). She doesn’t just want to be a step mother. She wants us to have a baby to blend us all.

A few weeks later she miscarried. We were both devastated. Me, I kept it internal. She was outwardly sad, missed time from work, etc. Today she got a reminder and it all came back. Today I broke a record at work and I was on a high. Our emotional levels clashed.

I’m not good at expressing feelings about myself, so I’m not good at comforting her. The best I could do was hug her.

At dinner she was closed off, and I got upset. I didn’t yell or anything but I told her I didn’t like that my daughter was trying to talk to her and she was giving one word answers. I don’t want my daughter to think my wife doesn’t like her, or anything else. I guess I expected her to put on a happy face. I’m not sure. It’s what I do so that seems normal.

My wife suffers from depression, so everything is amplified and things trigger her so much easier. I’m very much the type to shrug things off.

What can I do to find a common ground with her to be more empathetic and show I genuinely care when she’s upset without making it sound like I’m upset because she’s not happy?

TLDR: I suppress emotion and my wife wears it on her sleeve, how can I be emotional without being fake?

Thanks.",18Oct2018,1

8,"I'm in the honors program at my college, and recently one of the deans made a special dispensation for honor students to be able to go for free to a seminar and luncheon that usually cost $400 a plate. I don't personally know this Dean, in fact I've never even met him. He doesn't even have his office at the campus I attend. And he's not the dean of my program. However, I think I would be remiss to not acknowledge the generosity of the gift he gave to the honors program.

So my question is is it ethical and not weird for me to send a thank you note with a bullshit cookie gram or some sort of dessert to his office?",18Oct2018,1
9,"Im currently a senior in high school and for years now it feels like I've relied on drugs to feel happy, up until about 6 weeks ago when I met this girl. We end up hitting it off really well, talking and texting each day, making plans to hang out, etc. The day I met her, I no longer felt the urge to do any drugs and even stopped because I felt happy having her in my life, even though we were just friends. A few weeks go by and all of the sudden we start becoming kinda distant, to the point where we stopped talking. At this time I'm starting to lose my mind and become all depressed because i have no idea what happened between us to make her wanna stop talking to me. I've been stuck on drugs to maintain happiness and since I stopped I came to this thinking that I don't wanna do drugs anymore because I feel happy when I'm with her. It got so bad that I ended up running away for a bit because I wanted to just be alone and away from everyone. It's been about 3 weeks since I've been back and aside from her texting me if I was okay the day I went missing, it's like she's completely ignoring my existence. Last week I couldn't take being sober no more and now I'm back on my shit, but even worse now. I've been taking lsd and shrooms before school everyday just to feel happy and comfortable with myself. I'm not sure what to do anymore, I hate to continue down this path but Im losing my mind without it. I feel like I'm stuck between drugs and this girl, but she doesn't seem to wanna have anything to do with me anymore so im having to resort to drugs. ",18Oct2018,1
10,"So some people may take this as a joke but I am being completely serious. Some people write me off as dramatic or overreacting towards the situation but what happened has truly traumatised me.

A few weeks ago I was absent during a day of class. I came to school the next day and during my geography class my teacher handed me a map (which wasn’t even that big) and said “It’s a big map, isn’t it?” in a suggestive sounding way. I instinctively said “Yes” and immediately regretted it. Since then he’s been giving me weird looks and acting suggestive.

After other assessments he has also said to me “You didn’t quite finish it” in the same suggestive way. I feel like he is preying on me and trying to sleep with me.

To be blunt I think he was trying to hit on me and basically reference his dick being big. This has given me nightmares of him raping and torturing me. I should also add that he is married with two kids. Any thoughts on this would be appreciated. Thank you.",18Oct2018,1
11,"This is pretty heavy. I just found out that my online bestfriend tried to kill herself. She told me that she's been pretty depressed lately and was taking pills to help counter it... she had a pretty bad episode last night and took all her pills + others to try to overdose.

I honestly feel pretty helpless cause if she died, I wouldn't of known about it... there's no way for me to know about it until someone on her facebook posts an RIP message. I told her if she ever needs someone to talk to, that I'm always online... but fuck, I feel like there's shit all I can do on being there for her.

The best I can do I feel is... is just watching over my messages in case she needs someone to talk to.",18Oct2018,1

13,"I'm not going to hash out all of the conversation but it boils down to this:  


1. Our calls are recorded.
2. He was blowing up before I could even explain to him the situation. Literally cutting me off mid sentence. He starts digging for information around why it shouldn't be his call. If he finds even the slighest thing (One time something was 'potentially network related' which doesn't make it my job, but he started blowing up saying ""You had better make sure!"" No dipshit, I hadn't. You are Tier 1. I'm Tier 2. You figure out that it IS A NETWORK ISSUE. THATS HOW THIS JOB LITERALLY FUCKING WORKS!)
3. Its not in my scope at work to deal with said customer. Rather THATS HIS WHOLE JOB. We work in tech. I'm network support, he is desktop support. Network = When the whole network is down. Not minor network related issues at my place of work (E.G. ""I can't access one website I need."" Would only be for me if its an entire department.)
4. He repeatedly insulted me calling me a liar and saying that I was unprofessional. He was literally screaming this so loud people beside me could hear it through a my head phone.

Steps I've taken:

1. Reported him to our supervisor the other 5 times hes done the same thing.
2. He was dumb enough to give me his employee information. Though there is a chance he lied about it. I have the times I spoke with him recorded.
3. Literally everything he said is wrong and my position/title is technically above his, but its not like that matters. We are both the lowest tiers of what we do. I outlined this in an email to my supervisor.  


What I want to happen is a written apology then for the company to fire him. Personally I don't get it. Hes screaming at me for sending him customers \*he\* is supposed to work with. Everything he says to me is more or less an excuse on why he shouldn't take them.",18Oct2018,1

16,"Hi guys, 

I'm unsure whether this is the right sub for this kind of stuff, but maybe someone had a relevant experience and could provide me with some advice for which I'd be immensely grateful. 

I'm 19 years old, Polish,  male, living in a second tier polish city of Poznań. I 'majored' in Maths and Physics in high school. I've always been interested in languages, travels and other cultures. During my early teenage years I would spend a lot of time in front of the computer and my parents used that fact to guide me towards a prospective engineering career. In high school though I had a revelation and even though I took up web development and had quite a liking for it I was still rather reluctant to go down this path as someone athletic and energetic I just couldn't envision myself working in this rather sedentary industry. I was totally disillusioned with my majors and, no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't convince myself to develop a genuine interest in them. I was still completely dedicated to language learning and would travel whenever I was able to. 

Come May, time of the final exams, as expected I performed rather poorly in my two major subjects and absolutely rocked the humanities part of the exams. I'd had this thought of taking a gap year lingering in my head but nonetheless I applied for university in my hometown, got admitted too. 

The following summer I decided to travel, been to quite a few places around Europe but long story short I ended up coming back to the Canary Islands three times over the course of 3 months. The third time I stayed for 2 months and landed a job in a familiar hostel. This was hands down the best time of my life, I'll spare you the details cause it's not a storytelling sub and that's what this post has unintentionally turned into anyway. But for the first time in my life I felt like the life I lived was something that I actually built myself. I had my own social circle, a job I landed completely on my own to fund my time there, I learned many new skills, took up new sports and learned more Spanish in three months than I had thought possible. It just felt like proper adult life, without anyone holding my hand and even though I wasn't achieving anything I felt extremely content and proud of myself. In that regard it was different from my life at home, I'd never made such close connections with people, not even lifelong friends and school would take up most of my time and I only felt like a liability cause I'd only been taking from others, never giving, I know it's only natural that parents take care of their children but I just felt it was about time they stopped catering to my needs, time I get weened off. 

This summer only reaffirmed me in my belief that I need to explore, get to know myself and actually figure out what I want to do with my life, hence the gap year I'm taking now. I'm back in my hometown, studying for CPE which I'll sit in December, as I'll need it for uni admission. Up until this summer my entire life had been dictated by my environment, my family, although supportive, failing miserably to relate to me and understand my point of view. After my grandpa, to whom I was really close, died, I moved in with my grandma to support her and, though an extremely generous and caring person she is, she's been a pretty terrible influence on my mental health and alongside my father has been undermining my efforts to stand my grounds in life and become independent. They've been guilttripping me constantly because of the fact that I missed out on the opportunity to go to university this year. 

The thing is I still haven't figured out what I wanna do in life, I'm opting towards linguistics cause it's been a great passion of mine for years now as mentioned before. But as it's not a very lucrative career path I wanted to get some experience in the job market first or try to come up with some alternative ways of making money before committing to a full-time degree. I also experience heavy wanderlust and disillusionment with my current location. My mother's fiance is an English speaking foreigner and ever since I was young I've been exposed to American culture and grew up to be rather disconnected with my motherland, where I fail to relate to people.

I want to move away from home and build my life from scratch and attain relative financial independence before going to university. My mother's still going to support me through my uni years as she set up a fund for me when I was little. Don't get me wrong, I love my family and appreciate all they've done to me. It's just our beliefs and worldview don't allign, I don't wanna sever ties with my family, I just need some time away.

I don't have much working experience apart from that summer job in a hostel. I speak both  English and Polish more or less natively. I also speak German, have a C1 certificate. I can also get by in Spanish in day to day situations and know a smattering of other languages but nothing really worth mentioning unless I'd put in some time to genuinely work on them. So basically my only skills are languages and also the little web dev and programming I dabbled in, impressive to my high school teacher but not enough to land even the most simple of jobs. 


Where abroad could I go with the little skills I have and what jobs other than in services to look for? Are there any options for unskilled workers to venture outside Europe? The further the better but I also have to be able to afford to make the leap. 

God, it must've been a very chaotic read if you made it all the way through, though I highly doubt it, and for that I'm terribly sorry. I'm not even sure of what I'm expecting here, all I know is that for the time being I'm stuck in the limbo and need to find my way out. I just don't want to sleepwalk through life and wake up when it's to late like I've seen many people around me have done. I'd rather take time to consider things now, I know that allegedly all of us do that all the time, but I refuse to accept that many people do that on a truly deep level, I feel like they just justify their rather haphazard decisions with illusory reason. Anyway, I'm looking for some genuine advice or a relatable story, thanks a lot.

17,"Hey there! So when I first entered the work force about 7 years ago, I put my info in a free resume builder and have since been adding to it as I change jobs. And when I say “add to it”, I mean I update when I left my previous job as I’m applying for a new job without ever taking time to sit and read it over. 
I’ve recently become unemployed and have put in over 40 applications (that include my resume) and have only gotten two callbacks. After reading my resume at an interview today, I can honestly say that it’s probably because my resume is awful. It has my name, contact info, and past jobs. That’s it. No skills, no awards, no professional profile, just bare bones. I’ve done a lot of research into what makes a good resume and took a lot of notes so I think I’ve got that down. I just have a few minor questions that are relevant to my personal work history/resume. 
I’m looking for a customer service type job (I’ve been applying to a lot of receptionist jobs) with the possibility of taking on leadership in the future. I want to highlight my past volunteer experience with my local EMS dept as I feel it shows a lot of qualities that an employer would look for. Would I put my vol experience in its own section, under work history, or under skills? I was there for 4 years and had a lot of responsibility if that helps.

25,"My GF works on a HR team for a company and the Director (Head of HR) is a man. The company is about 200-300 in size. 

Recently they had a large team company wide meeting where a ton of high ups had to call in/attendt. All of the high ups were asked what are some goals they have for Q4. Everyone said something including the director of HR , but he seemed to really veer off the subject. He went down a path where he remarked, ""There's a reason why the majority of leaders here at men, women just don't work as hard."" ""They always have excuses and just carry their weight."" He laughed to himself and everyone felt really awkward before the conversation changed.

This hit my GF really hard as she busts her ass working sometimes in excess of 60 hours a week. Word got around that she was upset and so he threw a 30 min on her calendar (Call was yesterday and the meeting was today). In the 1 v 1 with her he said that he ""mis spoke and people didn't understand what he was saying"". Mind you my GF was on the phone and overheard everything at the meeting. He wouldn't apologise or anything and claimed that she misheard even though 5 or so other people on the call brought it up to my GF as well. She told him that what he said really impacted her and makes her feel disrespected in the workplace because she works really hard and wants to be a part of leadership one day. He told her he doesn't want this conversation to leave the meeting.

What should she do here? What he said is clearly so messed up and wrong. If someone were to say that at my workplace they would be terminated. The problem is he is the HIGHEST person on her entire team. She is on good terms with the owner and she is on the fence about talking to him. 

She called me when all this went down and she her voice was shaky because she was so offput by his comments and that he claimed he didn't do anything wrong.

29,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I'll get right into it.

TL;DR. My friend was assaulted and I don't know what more to do to help.

I am a freshman at a medium sized school in the North East US. I have a friend (also a first year freshman. Female) who was sexually assaulted during orientation in June. She told me of this after she realized I had figured things out maybe 3 weeks into the semester and has continued to let out details slowly as the semester goes on.  have not pushed her to give these details and (as far as I can tell) stay supportive and continue to not do things like ask after more details. Her way of coping with this is making jokes about it and this is also how she's let out additional details. A term recently used was ""brutally raped"".

As this is not a big school she continues to see her rapist around campus. Not on a super regular basis, but enough. Sh has had multiple panic attacks due to seeing him/being in situations that remind her of the event. She has been to the women's center on campus but does not want to report the assault more officially. Fears of repercussions from him and also the guilt of getting someone kicked off of campus stop her from doing anything more. She has proof of the injuries she sustained and has confirmed that she has enough information to get him expelled.

My question for you all is what do I do that I haven't been doing or that might help more. Reporting anonymously myself is not an option and as much as I'd like to do something to him myself that in't an option due to obvious legal issues.

What more can I do to help her or help the situation.",18Oct2018,1

My boyfriend does make good money and we do have plans to get married. If I took a management job we’d be making a combined $90-$100k which is pretty good money for my area but I wouldn’t want to put the burden of my loans on him and anything could happen anyways. There are no guarantees.

32,"Hi everyone! 

I'm [F25] at my wits end and I honestly don't know where else to turn to. 

The story is: I met my best friend [F26] through her partner [M25] who I consider to be sort of toxic. Actually he's very toxic. At one point he disappeared for a weekend because he was upset that we were having a ""girls night out"" and he wasn't invited. He left her with a message saying ""come pick your shit up"" and when she didn't react for a few days he started frantically sending her texts saying how sorry he was.

Now they've been together for a couple of years, but have also broken up at least 2 times during their relationship. They're constantly fighting, making up, fighting again. It gets really uncomfortable going to see them. I wouldn't say he's abusive, just very demanding and emotionally draining. When all three of us are together my friend can hardly get a word in because he just wants to talk. To put it plainly: I don't really like him much and if it wasn't that he was my friend's boyfriend I'd probably would have stopped talking to him years ago. 

Problem is this guy sees me as a friend. One of his only friends in fact and I've tried to get along with him the best I could, but he's far too emotionally demanding for me. I have almost nothing in common with him either. If I ever told him that I only see his girlfriend as my friend I'm afraid she'll end up having to choose between us. 

Currently he's sending me a lot of messages and trying to hang out with me, while my friend is not talking to me much at all for the last few weeks. She's my best friend and I honestly don't want to lose her, but besides for their relationship ending I don't see how this can get any better after 8 years of the same thing. 

Is there any way I can keep my friendship with my best friend and not be friends with her boyfriend? 

TL;DR: I don't want to hang out or talk to my best friend's toxic boyfriend anymore, but I'm scared it's going to end my friendship with her. What should I do? 

Thanks in advance!

34,"So here’s what happened. I met a girl 6 months ago and we texted, called, or FaceTimed just about everyday. We ended up getting really close but just didn’t end up actually dating. And so everything was all good until last week. On Monday, regular day happy as ever. Tuesday to Wednesday is when she started ignoring me. And really took place Friday, and it’s been going on tell now. I’ve tried asking what’s wrong she says nothing. I’ve really tried to think about everything I’ve done Tuesday to Wednesday and I can’t think of anything I might have done to cause this reaction. I’ve noticed she’s seems really sad the past 2 days maybe she misses our friendship too. But then again the last few times I talked to her she wasn’t interested in talking with me, or it’s a coincidence she just didn’t wanna talk at those times, or maybe she was having a bad day, idk. 

It’s been a few days sense we talked and I’m getting the feeling if I don’t say something we aren’t gonna talk ever again. I’m wanting to text her but I’m not sure how I should say it. My question is should I talk to her like what happened last week didn’t happen or if I should apologize or ask if everything is okay or all or those?

36,"     I'm a seventeen year old junior. Once I turn eighteen in november, both mine and my mom's healthcare gets cut off. Without her medicine she's going to die, flat out. I don't see any way I'd be able to help her pay for them, even if I get a part time job, or drop out and go full time. Her anti depressants, diabetes meds, vitamins, shots, and inhalers all come out for over 4-5k a month without healthcare. 
     Just to clarify, my mother is 61 years old and unable to work, though she isn't able to prove this so any attempts at filing for disability are failed. She can't prove her disabilities due to the fact that we don't have a vehicle to get to the appointments made, which is about 200 miles away (We live in the middle of a super small town). All of her meds are supplied by the only pharmacy in town, which is super small.
     My dad left four years ago, leaving us with no income, nor way of working, along with a couple thousand in debt to a very pissed land lord. We managed to pay that off  slowly over the next year thanks to a few generous relatives,. 
     We're now stuck living off of the money that my mom gets from raising me, and the Medicare that we both receive for free. Once I turn eighteen, both of those are cut, no money, no med care. It'll be whatever I can rske in and it's going to be tough as shit.
    Is there no way to avoid all of that? I feel so helpless right now. I don't want to lose my entire family due to stupid shit..",18Oct2018,1
37,"TL;DR: I'm in college and see this friend twice a week. We're our second of two years. We knew each other fairly well last year, but then she and I became the top officers of a student group, and have thus spent much more time together since. And I've developed feelings for her over that time. The problem is she has a boyfriend. I kinda figured the crush would go away, but there are circumstances that have led it to continue, some of which are my fault. Overall, I feel like I need to create some distance between us, so that I can get over her. I'd like to stay friends, and I have to see her in class twice a week and for the student group, so should I tell her that I'm creating distance outside of that because I need to get over her? I can't figure out if I'd be doing that for my benefit or hers.

&amp;#x200B;

More details: this already feels long, but I'm working through it, what're ya gonna do? We've gotten closer outside of class and student group contexts, and I feel like we connect on some levels. We make each other laugh, we have deep conversations, and we've both shared some pretty personal details. All that said, I think my crush has been spurred on by the fact that she's in a long-distance relationship, and that she disclosed to me that she found out her boyfriend had cheated on her several months ago. She's said that she's still committed to keeping the relationship alive, and I respect her wishes there, but some part of me sees that as hope I guess, which makes it harder to get over her.

&amp;#x200B;

So anyway, my three options are: (1) don't do anything, continue spending time with her and enjoying it, then feeling depressed afterwards because of the futility and self-inflicted nature of it. This seems like less and less of a good option, but it's also the easiest, and most pleasurable in the moment. (2) Distance myself from her without explanation and (3) distance myself from her and tell her it's because I have feelings for her and need to get over her. These two are where I'm most ambivalent. Is it self-indulgent to tell her that I like her? Part of me feels like I'll have a hard time getting over her, even with distance, until I really hear from her that it's not an option. And also in favor of #3, it does feel cruel to get close to her emotionally then distance myself from her without any explanation. I guess the thing keeping me away from #3 is how awkward it will be, especially after she told me about her boyfriend. And I do need to keep seeing her at school and working with her in the student group. And of course, part of me doesn't want to do anything, because if I do nothing it ""keeps the hope alive.""

&amp;#x200B;

Help! I need other voices on this. One other pertinent piece of information is that I've avoided relationships and women for a long time, but through therapy work, I've recently gotten to a place where I feel like I can enter that realm, after getting over some past trauma. So informing all of this is the fact that there's still a lot of latent self-doubt and self-loathing from many years of isolating myself and not knowing why.",18Oct2018,1

39,"So, I currently have a full time job. The only problem is, this department is severely understaffed, so everyone on our tiny (three-person) team is working insane hours (12 - 14 hours five days a week, sometimes spilling into the weekend). 

I'm just tired of it. The management has made it very clear that they absolutely do not intend to hire more people to help us with the workload. They're just bleeding us dry for as long as we'll stick around... 

So I've been on the hunt for a new job. The catch, though, is that I have been with this company for 10 years and have never really ever had to find work outside of it. So trying to conduct a job search in this day and age has actually been a whole new experience for me and I feel like I'm a little bit in the dark... 

The first thing I'm noticing is that so many jobs seem to hire through GlassDoor, Indeed, or Zip Recruiter. While these job portals are pretty convenient, I am seriously suspicious of their reliability. Every time I've submitted an application, I've wondered if the potential employer has even been made aware that I've applied in the first place. I have a suspicion that so many ""no call backs"" have been a result of the employer not even knowing that I've submitted an application. What's worse is that these websites don't supply any contact information for the company, so there's no real option to follow up... which, I suppose, is intentional so that companies won't get bothered too much by applicants? 

This is where I'm unsure... Is my instinct right? Is applying to jobs through these websites ultimately unreliable and a waste of time? Or are there ways to contact the company directly to follow up if you don't hear anything back for, say, two weeks? 

Another frustrating thing that I've noticed is that a lot of job postings seem to be by staffing agencies. And, is it just me, or do staffing agencies seem to try to trick you into applying through them? So many times when I'm reading a job posting, I can't tell if the ""company"" posting the job is the actual company or a staffing agency posting for the company... It makes me hesitant to apply to so many job postings because the staffing agencies just seem to be everywhere. 

So... any insight on any of this stuff? ",18Oct2018,1

54,"I have gone through some things in my life. Last week I was sent to a mental hospital, as a result of wanting to commit suicide, writing suicide notes, and self-harming. I started to self-harm because of the way I was treated at home. I do realize that my situation is not as bad as other children, I learned that while I was in the hospital, where I met some really great kids that do not deserve ANYTHING that they've gone through, but I still have been affected by my experiences. From the ages of 5 to 13 or 14, I was subject to some physical abuse, and, I believe, a lot of emotional/mental abuse. The physical abuse wasn't terrible, just being hit whenever my mom was mad at me. She once gave me a bloody nose after slapping me across the face. She would use a wooden spatula or this weird wooden strainer whenever she spanked me. I don't ever remember being spanked with an open palm. There have been a couple of times when she's put her hands around my neck or grabbed me by my chin, and pushed me up against the wall. My brother has been subject to the same kind of things as well. 

The thing that was worse than the physical abuse was the things that she would say to me. She often yelled and would swear whenever when she was mad at me, weather it be because I lied (understandable) or if I put something in the wrong place, or really anything that ticked her off. She has said to me ""for someone so smart you can be so stupid"", and she has called me fat, and always told me to keep my weight at or 100 lbs, because of my height. She had been getting on me about my grades, and I would get in trouble if I didn't fill in my agenda/planner for school. Most recently, she has taken my things if they were on my desk, on my bathroom sink, or out in the open, and then I would have to pay to get it back. The price wasn't too bad, but the things she took ranged from hair ties to water bottles. I don't know if that qualifies, but it sure was frustrating, but I couldn't do anything about it. 

After my hospitalization, my mom decided to tell me 4 rules, and then she told me about hospital bills, and that that was why she wanted me to get home earlier. That same day, she left for the entire day, and didn't come back until it was time for dinner. Lately, we haven't really been talking, and she want's me to get a job, but, I am 15, and it is hard to find one, as  most jobs require 16 years of age. 

I kind of feel like she doesn't want anything to do with me, and just doesn't really want me around. Child Protection Services are involved, but I don't really know what they're doing. 

I am really wondering if I, as a 15 year old girl living in Colorado, have any say in whether or not I want to stay with my mother. She want's to move back to Montana, (we moved at the beginning of the school year), and I am really afraid that I won't make it to the end of high school, or even the end of this year, if I move, because I won't have the support system that I have here, and Montana just doesn't give me enough opportunity to be out of my mom's way. (I'd have to ride with her everyday to school, but here I can walk, and stay after as long as I want, as long as I tell my mom)

Smoking has caused my family and me a lot of trouble and even when I had to go to court, I didn't quit. The longest I've gone without pot in the last 11 years was 1 consecutive month, but I still tried to get it every day. I love the process of buying it bringing it home etc. 

I'm also a binge eater. Pot or not, I eat way more than I should in a day. I am very uncomfortable with my weight, but I have been eating healthier meals. The problem is that I cheat. Sometimes I'm not even very hungry; I eat way too much. I just downloaded MyFitnessPal - we will see.

58,"I’m a second-year undergrad in college with junior status and I haven’t had the motivation to do any internships or work. At the same time, I’m not financially struggling at all. My dad has a good paying job, my mom does housework that I sometimes help out with. Both are really loving to each other and towards me. We never get into fights or serious arguments and my parents aren’t abusive in anyway. They’re not pressuring me to do something I hate doing, but instead telling to do whatever I want with my own life to pursue my hopes and dreams. Overall though, I really have no clue what I’m doing with my future. I don't really have any particular hopes or dreams anymore.

I’ve been to most of my college’s listed clubs (that didn’t have pre-reqs such as GPA and cover letters) and haven’t found anything fun or engaging. Also, my parents don’t let me out late at night because they believe in upset. I could try to go out anyway, but I’m not motivated to do that. Even went out and tried new hobbies like biking, going to the gym, watching new movies &amp; shows, travelling and many other things I am too lazy to list. None of them really stick with me.

When I meet new people, I usually have no clue what to say other than ask the other person questions about their experiences. Rarely anyone ever asks me about my experiences. When they do, I’m at a loss of words. I’m unable to form opinions of what I’ve been through. To me, though this may sound edgy, things just happen. I’m really not sure how else to phrase this. Over time, this becomes less and less enjoyable the more common and interchangeable other people’s lives seem to be.

College life has been okay. My grades aren’t even that terrible either, with a mediocre 3.4/4. I’ve been to a bunch of parties and events, but haven’t really made friends or found such things to be fun. Tried talking and networking, but it always ends up feeling forced and awkward. Others have said to just ""do what comes naturally"", but nothing seems to becoming naturally and when it does it once again comes off as even more awkward. Same with “introvert” stuff like reading books and meditating, which feel really disengaging. 

Part of me just wants to spend all the money I have and then kill myself afterwards because I really don’t see any point in living if I’m not enjoying life. My friends aren't even that close to me either.

Tried talking about this with my family, a few therapists, and some friends, but they say they really don’t know what to say about this either because they’ve never felt such a way.

60,"**weve been together 5 1/2 years*** This past weekend my fiancé and I went out of town for a wedding and my check hadn’t hit my account yet because it was a weekend and I had brought like 100$ in cash with me. When you’re traveling that’s not much. I just figured my check would post to my account but it didn’t. So I asked him for 20$ to run to the gas station and grab some drinks and snacks for the night. He said to me “only if you have sex with me” I was like shut up, you’re joking. So a few minutes go by and I said can I have 20$ to run to the gas station before it gets any later (we were in Cumberland Maryland) not a place I’m familiar with at all. And yet again he said “only if you have sex with me”. This man had 1,000 in cash in his wallet. Secondly, I NEVER ask for money from him. Once in a blue moon. So what did I do? I had sex with him and then cried on my way to the gas station because I couldn’t figure out why my fiancé acted like I was a prostitute. 

In August he randomly gave me 200$. He threw it at me and said here. I was like what’s this for? He said just take it. Like I said this doesn’t happen. He doesn’t give me money out of nowhere and I don’t ask for it because he acts like he’s giving up his right leg for 20$. I could understand if he didn’t have money but he does. So anyways, he gave me 200$ on a Friday night. He came over and stayed the night and tried to have sex and I was so exhausted that I didn’t want to I just wanted to sleep. The following morning he wakes up and says I can’t believe I gave you 200$ and you won’t even have sex with me.

However this year as soon as we got back to school, I’ve heard he’s been talking bad about me and treating my friends poorly. Naturally this made me mad, so I cut him off. I realized I don’t need him and I’ve become my own person with my own feelings, and I’m worth something.

As soon as I did, a mutual friend of ours was upset. She was friends with both of us but me and Steven were not friends. This did make me upset, because he has been bad to her as well and she still remains friends with him. I was honest with her and told her that it makes me upset that I’m less important to her than Steven is, and that I need some space. she says she understands, and time goes by

Tonight Steven sent me a paragraph apologizing. I’ve read it over and over, and my only conclusion is that our mutual friend told him to apologize so that she can have us be friends, and she can be friends with both of us at the same time. 

I know I’m supposed to turn the other cheek and all but I feel used. I feel like they took my friendship and kindness for granted, and I’ve given them more than enough chances. I want them to understand my feelings come first from now on.

Is this wrong? Should I force myself to like Steven again to make my friend happy? 

TLDR; friend (Steven) who treated me bad wants to apologize but is being pressured by someone else to do so, so that she can be friends with me and Steven ",18Oct2018,1

71,"Hi all, I live in New Zealand and work for a company who I won't name but I'm wondering if this would be legal what they are doing and if I should be concerned or do anything about this.

The company I work at is always 24/7 and usually a shift for us is 12 hours at the office. During the 12 hours we don't get a proper ""break"" which is away from the work environment, but instead we get to sit down for 1/2 an hour every 4 hours or so. I forgot to mention, we're expected to stand up for most of this shift which would be alright, but we don't even get a proper break! During our ""sit down"" period, we still must serve customers during this period. This is all agreed verbally and there is no written statement about this. BUT I do get paid for the whole 12 hour shift.

Recently, I have been called up for a disciplinary meeting with the HR because an object was stolen from the shop when I was on my ""sit down"" period as I was not watching over the office as I was on my phone. 

My question is, what do I do in this situation!?
Is the practice they are doing even legal?

76,"I filed a restraining order against a person who has control over an old phone number that made its way into my credit bureau (which wasn't even my own phone number), and then I changed my name to avoid further stalking. I often moved and changed addresses due to continued stalking and due to joining the military (hence moving around a lot).

Recently, my new credit card was locked and I called my bank to ask what was wrong, and they said my credit card was flagged due to using my new military address for the application. Instead of calling the number they had on my profile, they called the old number on my credit bureau report (I had changed phone numbers almost once a year so there were multiple). The phone number was on my profile for 4 years with about 3-4 phone numbers afterwards. No, I never knew how to get it off my credit bureau and never thought it would become a big deal.

When the workers at the bank left voicemail on the old phone, they used my new name which the stalker doesn't know about. So what they did was call my stalker's phone number and leave a voice mail with my new name on it. ""Hey the-black-doe, someone seems to be fraudulently using your identity to apply for credit"".

The representative on the phone told me all this, and she says she doesn't know why the bank didn't use the number on my profile let alone use the oldest one instead of the latest ones. I've been banking with 6 years and never have used the number they called (because it's not even mine).

I am feeling sick right now and was crying earlier. I already received a phone call from a private investigator who told me my stalker was looking for me (he didn't tell the PI that there was a RO), even if it's against the terms of the restraining order (an RO isn't going to stop a real crazy from trying).

80,"Keep in mind - we are not punishing him for bad grades. We are pushing him for things like incomplete/late homework (4 different assignments) and 3 quizzes that he didn't feel like studying for and failed. For the tests that we actually saw him try on and get extra help for (online, asking us to help him), we are not blaming him for.

For example, he has a D+ in algebra. He could have a C right now if it wasn't for the missing assignments. So no, I don't blame him for doing bad on the tests because I know he tried. But i blame him because he didn't try on the homework.

This wasn't his first warning for incomplete homework or not studying, so we told him he can't play video games for a week. He started complaining that it's pointless to do that because it wasn't video games that were distracting him, he was just being generally lazy. We responded though that it serves a punishment that will motivate him to start doing his homework and studying because he knows if he does he will keep his video game privileges and if he doesn't he will get them taken away.

He is still complaining that we're beating unfair and that it's not the right approach, although as I said, this isn't his first warning so since our other approaches didn't work with him this is our last resort.

We didn't involve our parents in this because they're very unreasonable. I'm gonna be honest, I always had As so I was never grounded by my parents. But my older brother wasn't a straight A student, and they once grounded him for a whole month because he had 1 C and 1 B, which we both think is really unfair. Point is, they're not understanding, they don't understand that kids make mistakes and they're not perfect, and we wanted to avoid my little brother falling to harsh/unjust punishments by leaving them out of it. In the end, they'll be doing more harm than good.

We managed to shut my brother up by telling him ""if you don't like our punishment, you can go complain to mom and dad about it"" but obviously he won't because he knows they will have a much harsher punishment in store for him. 

But now I'm actually wondering, is this actually unfair? Is it unfair to ground him from video games for a week for something that we've warned him about multiple times and he still won't fixed. Clearly the ""nice"" approaches aren't working and he needs to learn his lesson.

81,"hi there,

im a sophomore in high school. this may not seem like a big deal to you, but its definitely a big deal to me, and i was wondering what you guys think of this.

my friend and i decided to run a depop store together. i came up with the idea, name, everything. i planned out what we would do. my friend didnt even know anything about vintage clothing, about selling and running an online store.

for a while i would run most of the communication, posting, etc. i knew how to get our items spread around (social media, descriptions, etc.)

she modeled + took photos. i shipped. simple 50/50 right?

we would go to goodwill to thrift for clothes, but soon enough, my strict mother refused to let me go to goodwills on sunday and she would have to thrift the clothes herself. 

we altered the system: she buys clothes + models/takes photos -- hands clothes to me, i ship + edit/post/handle the store itself.

we made it big. we had several items on the explore page, and we were a suggested seller. we rapidly gained followers and sold a bunch of clothing. 

she then screwed me over.

she wanted the profit to be 85/15. it was definitely not enough imo for how much of the work i did. i spent a lot of time packaging and posting items, using my time to do homework and study. i was furious, shocked. i felt betrayed that she would do this, after the fact that we agreed on what we would do. 

i withdrew, as she resisted. i would not be getting 15% for all that work, so i gave it to her. i gave the whole store to her out of frustration. the last thing i wanted was an end to our relationship. i had lost friends before and it really hurt. i really love her, shes the one person that i feel safe around.

of course, i can see it from her side. however, she spent an unnecessary amount of time doing extra things, and so she did ""more work"". which i sort of call bs honestly. 

but you also have to see it from my side. i felt so so so betrayed. i dont care about the money. i dont care about the profit. i just felt so USED. she just tossed me to the side after making it big. she said she had been bothered for a while but didnt say anything about it before.

my other friend made us all join a call and we went over why we were so upset. she made several points to objectify mine, and of course mine were pointless against hers. she was really angry, and i never seen her that upset. 

we finished talking, and i guess she had the store for a while. i am still bothered by it now, but i just havent said anything. it irks me whenever i see anything with depop. if i go on the store it gets me angry. 

&amp;#x200B;

fast forward 1 month // i talked to my mom in the car and she never really fully understood that it was a business. she thought it was just oh whatever type of clothes selling and never took it seriously. i explained it to her and she allowed for me to do it, going to help her take pictures, thrift, whatever she needed.

i asked my friend and she said that she already had a system figured out, meaning that she didnt want to let me back in. 

i felt so stupid. i feel stupid now. i cant believe i just let that all fly out the window like that. it seems like little high school drama, but being in my shoes at my age, you would understand how i feel right? i just feel used and betrayed. 

im still pissed about the situation but i just havent said anything. we still hang out often, but whenever i think of anything about it or see anything about the store i just go silent and get lowkey angry, but i just try to push it away. it keeps coming back and i really dont know what to do. talking to her wont do anything, and i just dont know what to do.",18Oct2018,1

90,"Writing this on my phone so, you know. 

So I adopted a poodle about four months ago. He is ten years old, about 18 lbs, and the sweetest lil man ever. He got super attached to me right away and follows me every where. He is old so was already trained, has never had an accident in the house, never growled, chewed, anything. I was so lucky to get such an amazing dog.   

Then a couple weeks ago he started acting really weird. He became obsessed with this corner in my house. Scratching and barking around it and the things there, a trunk with blankets in it and a file cabinet, so much so that I videotaped him doing it because he was acting so off. I moved everything to see if he’d lost a toy or maybe there was a mouse or something behind the cabinet but I didn’t find anything. 

He wouldn’t leave the corner even for a treat or to go outside. Eventually I took him in my room to go to bed and he went to sleep like normal. The next day I came from work and I found that he had some how managed to move the trunk out from the wall enough to get behind it and had scratched up the wall, chewed all along the baseboard, paint chunks were every where. 

It’s a heavy trunk, he’s a tiny dog, and he’s never chewed anything or done anything remotely naughty while I’ve been away. 

He lost interest after a few days. Then earlier this week he started doing the same thing under my dining room table. I’m remodeling my kitchen and there’s a stack of shit on my floor in boxes and he, again while I was away, clawed through one of the boxes. Later while I’m sitting at the  table talking to my friends he keeps walking all along the baseboard and the boxes sniffing and scratching and barking. (I again videotaped him being all crazy. If people actually read this and respond I will post the vids, I’ve never uploaded videos so I don’t want to figure out how unnecessarily 🤷🏻‍♀️)

He also peed on the floor for the first time. He’s never done that. I take him on walks every day and we have a dog door into the backyard, so he can go out at any time. There’s no reason he would’ve peed inside that I can think of. 

Then today when I got home he was doing the same obsessive sniffing in the kitchen. Going through the whole room all along the  walls, barking at the cracks between the wall and the oven, etc. I gave him a treat which he ignored. I took him outside and was playing with him in the yard, but he kept running to the door and sitting at it and looking over his shoulder at me, impatiently. I opened the door and he ran straight back to the kitchen and started shoving his little body in between the fridge and the cabinets. Barking at the space under the stove. Then he was going from room to room all around the house, sniffing in each corner, behind every bookcase, under every table. Over and over again like a little maniac. 

I was at a loss. So I ignored him and started cleaning up the house, putting away laundry. I went back into the kitchen and he’s scratching at the wall and chewing on the corner. I yelled his name and bent down to pull him away and he snarled and spun around and bit my finger. He didn’t break the skin. He growled with his teeth bared and then kind of came to and sat down and stared at me. I didn’t know how to react. 

He’s so so sweet all the time, but throughout these last two weeks he has growled at me several times and at my daughter too (she’s 13 and doesn’t pull his tail or poke his eyes so don’t start with that), like she’ll go to give him a hug goodnight like she has every night since we got him and he does one of those low rumbly growls. 

I know I don’t have a large subset of info on my dog bc I’ve had him for so little time, but In the first 14 weeks we had him he was one way and now he’s another. 

Now, do you think he’s sick in some way? I’ve researched a bit and I know dogs can have mental health problems too. Or maybe some sort of neurological thing? Could it be something simpler like mice or bugs in my walls that I can’t hear? But that doesn’t explain the sudden growling and the bite. 

I love my lil dog so much and I don’t know what’s up with him lately. I really want to figure out what the fuck is going on. Any ideas?

I want to know what i should do, I offered her to stay at my house but i know its a process to become a host. Can anyone help?",18Oct2018,1

98,"I reconnected with an ex I was with when I was younger, we've hung out a couple of times - first time I asked him for coffee to catch-up, second time he saw I was close by so suggested we go for a drink as he was free. We've chatted a few times online, including one time when he was in crisis and another when he was on holiday, we don't chat often but he has many friends and is busy so not talking often is understandable (also due to my anxiety I rarely initiate conversation).

I take burlesque classes, my ex used to do some work on the burlesque scene - there's a burlesque night where my teacher (and friend of my ex) is performing, I've never been to see a burlesque show and I've no one to go with me...but I noticed my ex had marked 'Interested' on Facebook. So I was brave and asked him if he was going, also if he'd be interested in going with me. Conversation went like this:  
ME: Facebook tells me you're interested in the burlesque show on Friday, are you going?

EX: I'd forgotten. Is that at White Swan Bar? I believe I'm free.

##### ME: Yup. You fancy coming with me?

EX: Absolutely

##### ME: Oh, I was expecting a no :P Cool.

EX: Why would I say no?

##### ME: Ask my anxiety... lol

EX: Fair point!

100,"Well, this is a throwaway because I know some people from Reddit IRL. So guess I’ll give some background. 4 years ago my first girlfriend broke up with me. We were in 1st semester of college and had dated for a year. The reasons behind that broke up are kind of fuzzy and even then I didn’t understand it that well. It was a messy break up for me (I was deeply in love and thought she was the one and that we would be the kind of marriage that started in high school), and really did some shitty and dumb things (nothing like leaking nudes or spreading rumours, just being that annoying ex that looked for any shitty excuse to try to see her and even gave her a Instax Mini for her birthday that was a couple of months after we broke up) and now I realise that it is a crappy way to deal with a heartbreak. It was a really tough year for me, I drank a lot and spent a lot of time just crying in my bedroom and thinking why she left me. Fast forward to now, I’m really better, I’m in Med School and although I haven’t really had a serious relationship since then I have grown a lot (I’ve started having some hook ups two years after we broke up and some not that serious relationships with other women and I learned a lot from them. God Bless a couple of them). I do not think the reason I haven’t had a GF is because I have some commitment issues, it’s just that I haven’t met someone with whom I really connect and I’m OK with that. As for her last thing I knew was that she was still doing her undergrad and met a guy. I didn’t do much research because I thought that was a healthier way to deal with the fact of my only love so far (hopefully) had found someone else and was in a really serious relationship. Regarding us I think (I’m drawing some conclusions based on some of our lasts interactions and some info I heard from some mutual friends) she has a really poor memory of us and of me (which again, I don’t blame her, I did some stupid shit and I regret it). She may even despise me (I bumped into her last year outside a mall, I was alone and she was with a guy I assume is her boyfriend and she ignored me although I’m almost certain that she recognised me). Then a couple of weeks ago I went to bar to celebrate my birthday with some friends and one HS let slip that she broke up with her BF and wasn’t doing that well. I didn’t gave it much importance but after a couple (or maybe a lot more than a couple) of beers I checked her Twitter (we do not follow each other since our break up) and indeed, she broke up with the guy after 3 years. First I thought “cool, that’s none of my business” but then I started to remember our prior friendship and thought “Now and then I try to message a friend from Middle School to ask how is he doing. We don’t see each other much for a variety of reasons (lack of time, different schedules) but when we get together is a really nice time. Man, I wish I could the same with her”. Since then I have considered sending her a message, asking how is she doing and maybe tell her that I don’t hold any grudge against her, that I’m really sorry for being a shitty ex and hope she is doing OK but I do not know if that’s an OK thing to do or if some people are better not disturbing. Any advice is welcome. ",18Oct2018,1
101,"Alright fellas get ready for a long and confusing story. So for the past couple of months i started trying to help my best friend’s gf after they had a couple of fights. I try being nice to her but always try to keep my space so that my boi doesn’t get mad at me. 
Recently they had a big fight and she was sad as shit so I did what i normally did and tried to help her out (mind you this was like at 2am). Afterwards, she sent me a video saying she had feelings for me and i wont lie i sort of always liked her so i did something i never thought i could fucking do in my life, show my feelings too (weird shit huh). She started saying that im nice and make her happy and we kept talking to each other for about 2 hours more and it seemed like she really liked what i wad saying. 
The next day, she starts avoiding her bf and her friend said that if he loves her he better show it now or never. Now i dont know if it had to do with me but i got embarrassed and tried to hide my face when she was talking. To not seem suspicious i took his side about the fight but i knew that his gf was the one that was right. Later that night he said how he cant take these fights anymore and how he wants to break up with her. I felt a bit guilty but i didnt want to put my opinion on this shit. 
And today, oh glorious fucking today, they are both in student council so they took a field trip. Expecting him to break up, i was anxious as to wtf was gonna happen. Well they come back and they are back together. Not thinking much about it, i go along with my day. When i get home, i get a message from her saying how she is sorry. Confused, i respond with a question mark and she started saying how she did think about me dating her but she was sad as shit the night she sent me those messages and drank lean with her cousin to help her (ik this is a dumb decision and its bad). She also admitted that her cousin dared her to send messages like the one she sent me to someone she cared about a lot. Unsurprised (something like that has happened to me like 5 times before), i tell her its ok and that its not the first time it’s happened to me. She starts feeling guilty and says how she feels like she fucked some shit up between us. I didnt want her to start feeling bad so i started complimenting her. She started calling me cute again and how anyone would be lucky to have me and said that she didnt want me to have problems with my friend. I told her that im used to things like this happening and how ive become desensitized to shit like this happening. She started saying how she should kill herself and how she shouldn’t be alive. Concerned, i told her to not do anything stupid and how its not her fault. At this point i started crying a bit too because when i was 13 i was considering suicide so that brought flashbacks. I started getting emotional too and well we both kept putting ourselves down and helped each other up again. She ended the conversation saying how if she could, she would date me but there are just too many things that would be affected if we dated. She said she was going to cry and talk to me later. She responded but i didnt see the message in time for her to see it since i was watching a movie. Now u light think what fo i want since im posting this here. Well to put it simply, i want to know what u think i should do.

She thinks I'm a great guy and really likes me. I just think, given the differences in our ages and experience, I am worried about disappointing her. I'm probably not so good at these things. She's older and wiser and has experiences to compare me to. Another thing is I definitely think she's a cool girl but I don't feel too strongly about her. Last time I got in a relationship, the feelings were a bit more overwhelming I suppose but I was also a 16 year old teenager then. I don't know whether its feasible to expect something like that again. Lastly, it's just the age difference.

109,"  

I guess I should start by saying that I am a gay man with a rather feminine sounding voice. I constantly get mistaken for a female on the phone and at drive-thru restaurants. I am nearly 30 and have had plenty of time to get use to this minor inconvenience throughout the years and it usually embarrasses the person I am speaking with more than I does me. 

Well this afternoon I was with a friend ordering at a drive-thru. I placed our order with no issue until I got up to the window where you pay and get your food. 

There were two women who looked to be in their early 20s standing behind the window laughing until one opens the window and says “I knew it” before shutting the window again. 

When she opened the window again I asked her what she knew and she stated “I knew you were a man”. I asked her what that meant and she said that she was arguing with her co-worker over if I was a man or a woman. 

I tried to tell her that I did not think that was an appropriate thing to say to someone before she cut me off and informed me that she didn’t mean any harm and that she thinks I am “fabulous”. 

I really do not think she had any malicious intent at all and I am trying to decide if I should call corporate or not. I truly do not think she meant any harm but the more I think about it the more it bothers me. I really cannot believe that she didn’t see how wrong she was for saying all of that straight to my face. I feel like someone needs to tell her that this type of conduct is not okay in a work environment. 

I don’t want her or her co-worker to get in trouble but I feel like they could use some help. I am just so conflicted on whether I should call corporate to suggest some type of training for these ladies or what I should do. I would feel terrible if they ended up getting in trouble for something so silly but I also want them to understand that this was beyond inappropriate and offensive.

111,"As my throwaway says, I’m unemployed because I suck. Also, I apologize that this is long.

A little bit of a back story: 
22F, from CT. Graduated from a trade high school, didn’t go to college until this year because I was unsure of what I wanted to do. Currently going to school online for medical coding/billing. 

I worked my first job since I was 17 at a health foods store that I got hired at before they opened. I was there since the very beginning, putting the place together. Worked my way up from cashier to assistant purchasing manager/“head cashier”. Was there for 3 years, knew I didn’t want to work there for the rest of my life, mostly bc my manager was an unstable woman whose boyfriend made me make sure she ate and drank throughout the day. Basically a manager without the title or pay. 

I got a second under the table job the last few months I worked at the store, working for a family friend who was renovating her home/needing help at her school job with grading and organizing paperwork. I quit my store job in September of last year. I was working this side job until about January of this year. She was running out of money because she had foot surgery, etc etc, so I was “laid off”. 

That’s when I started my most recent job, which was in a call center for a wax company. I needed part time because I just started school and this seemed like an easy job. Just answer calls, book/cancel reservations, send out reminder calls for upcoming appointments. Except, this job 100% sucked. It was ass backwards with just about everything. People who called in were nasty and I got yelled at just about every day. I got berated by this 50 year old woman because her wax specialist left and she wanted to speak to the manager but the manager left for the day and she wouldn’t let me help her. 

Anyways, I thought it was just me being a baby and I sucked it up. But after talking to all of my coworkers, everyone agreed that it wasn’t managed well, there were favorites, the manager was away on vacation every 3 months, and we were severely understaffed. I went on vacation for 4 days, let her know months in advance, which was hard to get the days off because “I have a wedding the weekend before and someone else already requested the time off”. 

Anyways, I went, enjoyed myself, whatever. I came back and finally snapped. I paid off all my bills for the month of October, made sure I had enough extra money just in case (I don’t really have a savings bc I bought a new car and I put it all as a down payment), and then quit. 

I figured a month was enough time to find another job. I’ve been applying like crazy, getting phone interviews, but it never seems to make it past that. It’s the 17th already and I’m freaking out because I don’t know what to do. I have enough money to maybe make it another month without working but it’d be really scraping the bottom of the barrel. I’ve considered camming/selling a Snapchat/my underwear but I’m so awkward and don’t have the personality for that at all.

My parents can’t afford to take on my bills as well because I know they’re just making it as well, and I’ve never been the child to do that to them. My boyfriend recently lost his job because they terminated his position at his company and I have way too much pride to ask him, even if he could help out. 

I just feel lost and out of control, because for once I don’t really have a plan. ",18Oct2018,1

I'm not really sure if this is the right place to put this, but I was hoping to get some advice and figure out what I need to do, if there is anything I can do, so I can get some sleep at night finally. This is a throwaway account because, ya know, I don't want to make anything worse. To preface, this has been a job that have alot of lifers working there, who get caught up in the gossip. I don't indulge in that. Never will. I work my hours, enjoy the pleasantries from fellow workers and go home. So sorry for the long story and possible errors, I'm on mobile. Any help at all, even telling me I'm being crazy, is incredibly welcomed. Thank you. 

I have worked in a large retail chain for the past several years, starting when I was 19. Throughout my experience there, there have been at most twenty people employed. It's not a large building.  I enjoy the company of all of my coworkers except one. This person, who I will refer to as Poophead because I'm a mad human being and it feels good to act like an immature little kid right now, has been working for this retail store for more than ten years. Poophead has never like me. The moment I started training, there was immediate hostility oozing out from him. You would have thought I killed his dog right in front of him. To clarify I didn't. The associate manager at the time and Poophead apparently where on the outs and I was being trained by said associate manager. It was brought up by the associate manager and others in the building why they didn't speak, but I never really cared to listen. Something about the associate manager catching Poophead doing something not very good. 

Poophead would constantly speak to everyone who was near me, except the associate manager and myself. It bothered me that he didn't know a damn thing about me, but went out of his way to make it a point to make me feel incredibly uncomfortable. It seems silly, but he would look at me to make sure I was paying attention and then continue being incredibly jovial to other workers around me. On top of that, whenever I needed help with something, he would ignore my question, shrug his shoulders and walk away. My associate manager and I went to talk to the store manager, being the third coworkers to do so, and Poophead got wrote up. Shortly after the associate manager quit. Somehow, Poophead found out it was me and the abuse furthered with higher hostility and occasional snide remarks. I found out it was my store managers that  told Poophead  it was me. Which in turn led me to believe I couldn't trust or confide in anyone. But It was as if he knew how to get away with what he was doing. He was cautious, but it only got worse. 

Flash forward to several months ago, when I became incredibly fed up with the miss-treatment. So much so, that I had told the store manager that I was absolutely done. I was crying and shaking. I was over being anxious driving to work, losing sleep and crying about having to go back, and I was all around over it. I had been consistently looking for employment elsewhere but no one was hiring as it was in the summer months and jobs were pretty much well staffed. Poophead got pulled aside with store manager and me, and we tried to have a conversation about it. I explained that I had no idea what I had done to him but I apologized and told him I was hoping we could put the hostility behind us. He looked at store manager and told him how stupid it was he was talking to me and said that he would be professional (no fucking way he is) but other than that he didn't have to do shit. The store manager didn't do anything. Shrugged his shoulders, basically said ""I told you so"" and I went home early. I was furious. I called company HR line which is basically a third party company somewhere in the states that file a brief report and send it to my stores higher ups. I told the lady I spoke to pretty much everything I am writing right now. The investigation was open for a week at best and they closed it. No one visited the store. No one conducted or spoke to anyone in my store. 

So the advice I need, is it is getting worse. My store manager told me that he can't fix personality so that's why nothing can be done. I have been told by managers that there are jerks everywhere I will work and I just need to deal with it. I know I can quit. And I've been actively searching for a while. But I want to prevent this from happening to anyone else. It's clear I am a scapegoat to him and I don't want anyone else to deal with the same pressures and hostility. There has to be something more I can do. I feel like I've called corporate so many times they have my number memorized. I have encouraged the old associate manager to call corporate as well but she is terrified. Her young daughter came in to the store to buy some things and Poophead turned his back to her and refused to check her out. Along with the old associate manager calling the store and him ignoring it as we have caller ID. 

One last example is that my mother bought a new place, and I surprised her with taking her to get furniture. Poophead was working (that's his department) and was coming over to help my mom until he saw me. He turned around and went to another part of the store. I had to wait for my store manager to come help. My mother was furious.

120,"Basically posting this for advice because I think what used to be annoying about myself has turned into depression causing and life ruining. 

I’ve always cared way too much what others thought. Always been a people pleaser. My family was good to me, strictly religious, grew up in a church that preached modesty and a dress code (Apostolic Pentecostal - no cutting hair, no pants, no makeup, no jewelry).

I was raised by grandma so I took her every opinion to heart. I’ve been sheltered. I still love with my grandma at age 28. I’m embarrassed to admit that but wanna be totally open here. 

The dress code thing is still an issue. My grandma not so much, but people at the church I attend have been vocal about the fact that I wear makeup, pants, etc. and I feel like I can’t leave because it’s my family. 

But I can’t just not care

Everything would be great if I could just not CARE what they thought - like “oh well, I disagree.” That simple.

It’s horrible. If I hear a coworker has criticized me, I literally want to cry over it. I posted in OA about my food plan, another reddit user says I should change... what do I do? I try to change it and set myself back.

I am totally sick of this aspect of myself. I’m sure it somehow started with church but I need it to end. I literally stayed up until 4 am the other night googling articles on why women shouldn’t wear certain immodest clothes - I KNOW I don’t believe in the strict modesty standards. Why is my brain so difficult?!?!

121,"Let me start this off by saying I have never, would never, and will never leave or cheat on my husband - we've been married for 6 years. Let me also say that I am madly in love with him and we are happily trying for our first baby. 

So with that said, I don't really have a dilemma as much as I do a question. My husband and I are very sexually open and honest with each other, and he has been well aware that, since he does not have as high of a sex drive as i do, I watch porn pretty frequently. Lately while he has been traveling for work I have been frequenting lesbian pornography, and when friends and I were girl-gabbing about our sex lives, one friend said her husband suggested a threesome, and she was mortified to think he would ever consider her being intimate with a woman. I told her I was of the opinion that if a threesome situation arose (which it would never in my marriage due to my husband's viewpoints which I wholly respect) I would rather the third person be a woman. My friend group was shocked. This whole scenario got me thinking..... I have always found many women attractive, and I've never had a romantic connection with any  but I got married at the ripe old age of 18 to the second man I ever dated, so how would I know?

I know I'm just a kid and I don't understand things or whatever, but I swear no other kids are like this. I see other people being happy or being accepted by everyone else. One of the reasons I always loose focus in school is because I get bored and I let my mind wander, which usually brings me to uncomfortable thoughts I don't want to think about, but I can't get them out of my head because they're burned in there. I wear out really fast. I masturbate way too much  (usually 2-3 times every day) to the point where I'd call it an addiction.

I am currently a sophomore studying electrical engineering at a small liberal arts university. 

As a freshman, I was at a the University of Washington. To study engineering at UW, you have to apply into the program. 50% acceptance rate for EE. Unfortunately, there were some family deaths and other deterrents that made me a poor candidate for the program, and I was declined. This pushed me into the small liberal arts uni. 

At this new university, though, I am not challenged at all, I do not like the study body, there is nothing to do around the campus or area surrounding the campus, and I am honestly hating my experience there. 

On Nov. 1, I have to confirm whether I am staying at this new school or returning to UW to re-apply for engineering in April and risk not getting in again.

* He once told her while she was young that you shouldn't sit on anyone's lap, not even her dad's
* She was once trying clothes on (also when she was young, she is now 26) and asking dad what he though. She said he once replied with ""wow, seems you are growing, your boobs have started to grow""
* She once asked dad to sniff her neck to see if it smelled like smoke or perfume, to which he replied ""how do you expect me to sniff you when your breasts are showing like that?""
* She was once thinking out loud, or eating or something that caused her to do an audible ""Ahhhhh"" or ""Ooooooo,"" to which he said ""you sound like someone in a romantic film,"" it has been said that he was implying a porno.

Other little stories like this exist too.

I have never seen my mom in such a state before that kind of mad) at my dad (rightfully so, in some of the cases). My parents have been on a break for a couple of months. It is that time in which my mom started venting/offloading her problems with dad to my sister. It is also that time in which my sister started relaying the above stories to my mom. My sister wants my mom to divorce my dad. My sister has also taken a stance, she is saying that if mom doesn't leave dad, she will lose all respect for mom and only use the family (since she is actually living with us) until she can stand on her own and leave us. My mom tried to confront my sister as to whether dad has ever touched her inappropriately, to which she was not able to answer.

My mom relayed this information to me because she doesn't know what to do in this situation. Does she confront dad, does she not do anything, does she sit them both down and have a conversation?

They’ve been dating for about 2 years and constantly have issues mainly consisting with John not expressing his feelings or even talking to Jane period. The best way to describe him, and remember I was best friends with this guy for awhile so I know, is that he’s misogynistic, degrading, arrogant, bad temper, and I wouldn’t be surprised if he was a borderline sociopath because of his behavior and just things he’s said to me.

144,"I am single in my 30s and live next door to a couple my own age, their infant son, and the boy’s maternal grandparents. This is about the little boy’s father, who is around my age (M).

I met them shortly after I moved in and we swapped numbers for neighbourly reasons. As part of this M and I became connected on Snapchat. After some initial confusion we each worked out who the other was, but had no regular direct contact.

A couple of years ago, M was fond of posting Snapchat stories so I’d often see them as part of my daily browsing. He posted lots of pictures of our local area as he was out and about: rivers, museums etc. Then, one day, in the middle of a group of these pictures - a dick pic. Note this was part of a story and not a direct message.

I was pretty shocked and embarrassed, I mean, this is someone I see across the fence and say hi to all the time. I waited for him to realise what had happened and apologise (surely one of his friends would tell him, if it was accidental?) but nothing came.

Wanting to avoid awkwardness the next time we saw each other, I decided to low key address the issue. So the next day I sent a message along the lines of, “Wow, that was a bit embarrassing yesterday, hope you didn’t get in too much trouble.” He responded really vaguely, something like, “Haha, yeah, won’t make that mistake again,” but I remember being surprised that he wasn’t more appalled, or at least apologetic. I had a boyfriend at the time, and of course I told him about it, but otherwise decided to let it go.

Fast forward three weeks, and I’m looking through Snapchat stories again, and exactly the same thing happens. Flowers, trees, rivers - dick pic. Different dick pic, same dick. I thought there was no way my boyfriend would believe it had happened twice, so immediately took a screenshot. I did this knowing it would notify my neighbour that I’d done so.

This time it got a reaction. He was super appalled and apologetic, said he’d been hacked and that he was deleting Snapchat. I accepted that and it became a funny story to tell my friends - who accidentally sends a dick pic twice, to all their friends? I would have been a lot more worried if he’d been sending them straight to me.

Since then it’s never really been raised. We say hello and he tells me when my cats sneak into their house, and was really kind when one of my cats died earlier this year. My (now ex-)boyfriend has always been cynical about him though.

Now we get to today. Out of nowhere, from M, a Facebook message (I’ve just come back from holiday):

M: “This will teach M to be an ass ....hahah he's got the littlest dick I've ever seen....thumb size tiny. ..😂😂😂”

Me: “?”

M: “He left FB open 😂😂😂”

Me: “Who’s this?”

M: “Hey you, hope you had a good trip. It’s M”

Me: “Thanks! Who got hold of your Fb?”

M: “Huh ?? I don’t think anyone has?”

So I sent him a screenshot.

M: “Hmmm...has to be either work people or one of a bunch of people I know who came for a dive..”

This whole conversation happened within a couple of minutes, so it was really confusing how it started off as one person (“not-M”) and ended up as another (“M”).

I’m left feeling really uneasy. His general lack of  concern (or apology) is confusing to me, because it’s what I would do if I was “hacked” three times. He just seems so chill about it.

I always had a really bad home life, and I convinced myself that my life wasnt worth much. I got into a lot of dead-end jobs, and dated some really abusive people. It took an exceptionally horrible job, abusive partner, and a pretty traumatic family incident all sort of lining up to make me decide to finally pack up and start a new life. I had no money, so I took on a lot of debt with super high interest, and moved far away from my old home. 

When I got here, I was so scared. It took a long time to calm down, make a few friends, and meet  nice girl. Well a lot of those friends are very reliable, but I seem to have lost a lot of interest being with them, but I keep them around for security. My relationship with my new girlfriend hasnt been too bad, but I think Id like to start dating other people, though Im terrified to leave the only person who could take care of me if something happened. I keep in touch with some of my family I left behind, but every message from them is a traumatic reminder of the past I endured. I work a job I really like, but do not get paid nearly enough to stop needing new loans. I know I need to make some changes, but after everything I went through, Im terrified to risk any relative stability I now enjoy. I dont want to hurt any relationships Ive made, or leave a job I actually like, because I am comfortable, and not doing nearly as bad as I was.. but I am still not happy most days.

What should I do to help stay happy, and how do I deal with risking the stability I finally get to enjoy for a happier life?",18Oct2018,1
148,"Long story ahead.

My wife and I met online about 6 years ago. She moved from her home state to live with me about 1,000 miles from her family a year later and we got engaged and then married the following year.  We hit off well and really enjoyed each others company....however I'm a gamer, she's not and I also struggled with prn. Lomg story short I cared about her so I cut back (what I felt was cutting back) on my gaming, but still struggled with the other issue...my wife found out about it about 2 years into our marriage (been married 4 years now). She nearly left me but we worked through it and continued on. However she has never been satisfied with how little or much I game. I cut back to playing an hour or 2 at night and having late nights on fri and sat. I seriously probably played 35-40+ hrs a week before we started dating. I cut back to about half that. She didnt seem happy with that. So we switched it up, and i just didnt play at all except fri to monday. I feel like she still wasnt happy. Anyway its been an ongoing issue in our marriage. 

Shes an only child...and doesnt have any hobbies or friends where we currently live (I dont either other than gaming). I dont talk to my family hardly ever due to some relational issues between my wife and parents. She talks to her mother daily and I get along with my in laws just fine. 

Im the oldest of 7 kids (im 30) but I grew up with 2 other siblings in the house (one was adopted after I left for the military the others lived with my mother, parents split when I was 2....very convuluted family unit haha). I've always played games as far back as my grandpas apple tandy 2 with the huge 5 and a half floppy drives...I enjoy them...it's not only a stress release but RPG games have great stories usually. 

My wife will play WoW with me occassionally but shes not that into it. She's been saying that I dont pay attention to her despite cutting back my gaming and trying to do things she wants and to stay out of the house most of the day on the weekend etc.

ANYWAY I went to play this evening after eating dinner and watching some t.v. with my wife/spending time with her and showering (would have been on an hour and a half before bed) and she comes in and tells me she had been contemplating cheating on me when she goes to visit her family next week....Im WTFing and trying to talk to her and she starts ranting about my game playing. We dont do much at night after work...come home cook dinner watch t.v. or random youtube for a few hours, shower and go to bed.  Usually I'll watch a show or two with her or a couple of hours of youtube and then Im across the room to play a game or two for an hour or two before bed. Anyway so she tells me this and Im trying to talk to her and find out she re-activated her dating profile online a few months back and was chatting random guys...calling them on phone etc when i would go to play my games in the evening. She swears no sxual convos took place but who knows. Said she intentionally left texts etc on her phone so id find them and it would hurt me so I'd stop playing ""so much"" and spend moee time with her. 

IDK maybe I am playing too much...but it's just really bothering me that she reactivated her dating profile and was talking ro a bunch of random guys...supposedly not sxual (but those guys were on the site looking for a relationship even if she wasnt). She says she closed the account again because ahe felt guilty about doing it. I just dont know what to do. I like having me time...but I know its important to her that we have us time without anything else...but then we just sit there....or we watch t.v. and that gets boring after so many nights. Ive encouraged her to make girlfriends so she has people to talk to and hang out with but she almost seemingly refuses to do so.

I do love her...but I just dont know what to do...and I know I had issues with prn...but two wrongs dont make a right....right?


TLDR Wife of four years doesnt like how much I game, isnt much of a gamer herself however will play with me occassionally. I struggled with prn and she nearly left me but stayed when she found out about it. She claims shes tried and tried to get me to spend time with her when I already spend most of my free time with her. She decoded to start talking to guys on dating sites and giving them her phone number a few months ago....felt guilty and stopped but is shocked im upset.",18Oct2018,1

151,"I do not know what to do next for college and I need advice.

I am a high school senior with a cumulative gpa (not counting senior year) of 3.0 very easy classes my freshmen and sophomore years but my 

gpa as a freshmen was 2.6 first semester and 3.0 second semester. 

Gpa as a sophomore was 2.2 first semester and 3.0 second semester. 

As a junior I decided to take ap classes to challenge myself and received a 3.67 first semester (mostly b's) and a 3.83 second semester with As in all of my advanced placement classes (ap us history, ap biology and ap Spanish 4) I also got 4's on all of my ap tests. I am the president of a zero waste club at my school and where we host beach cleanups, give speeches about straws to the city council and talk about ways we can reduce our own waste. I also am playing my first year of varsity tennis this spring, almost have my Eagle Scout, I volunteer every week and will be receiving my seal of biliteracy.

I wanted to go to UCI but after realizing that their average gpa is much higher than mine I don't think I can make it in as my sophomore gpa probably ruined my chances. 

I want to be an environmental scientist and be head of the EPA some day or take any other opportunity to help the environment as best as I can. I have the option of getting 2 free years of community college. I also have the option of filling out the fasfa and trying to get financial aid to go to a 4 year. 

Here are my problems with both options 

Community college pros: free for 2 years, same classes as a 4 year? Can transfer to a better school for undergrad and hopefully transfer to an Ivy League for my masters

Cons: is it harder to get financial aid after community college? I can't see myself affording college in 2 years. And if my chances of future financial aid go down after going to community college I would rather go straight to a 4 year
Work environment most people at my community college don't pursue higher education I consider myself disciplined but would prefer an environment that encourages me instead of not.

4 year pros: I can get financial aid and get away from home

Cons: probably can't get into a good university right now due to my sophomore and freshmen year grades. Will cost money. Don't want to work full time and go to school. Would transferring from one 4 year to another work? Do perfect grades in community college carry the same weight as perfect grades in high school? Do extracurriculars from community college matter? 

What should I do, given my stats what university would be a match for me and would it be able to get me to a position where I can positively influence the environment ",18Oct2018,1

155,"I’ve struggled with mental illness since I was a kid. I only started addressing it as an adult, as my mother was too busy drinking to care and my father believed prayer was the answer. *wonder why I’m so fucked lol*

Seeing a therapist is the most I’ve done. My town has 2 therapists. Both are also pastors. Oddly enough, growing up in an abusive and super religious household doesn’t create someone who is comfortable seeing a religious therapist who preaches during sessions. 

I’m trying to find a new therapist and I’ve been trying to see a psychiatrist. I called and they said to leave a message and they’d call me back to make an appointment. That was 2 months ago and I haven’t heard back. Because I’m crazy, I’m convinced that they didn’t call because they don’t want to see me. They don’t like me, think I’m just looking for drugs, think I’m too crazy to help, etc. I just know that I need real help. 

I am considering checking myself in somewhere to get the help I need. That comes with a ton of issues for me, mentally. I can’t justify spending the money when we have bills to pay and better things it could go towards. What if I go and they just drug me up until my insurance runs out? If I have a bad experience and I want to go to a different facility, will they think I’m just going from place to place using them? ANYWAY, how does a crazy person get help when they’re too crazy to get help? I don’t know what to do, so I just do nothing and continue to suffer. Ha. Haha. Life is fun, amirite? ",18Oct2018,1
157,"So  let me give some background info ,I have been with my wife for 15 yrs married for 3..out of of the last 5 yrs I have been through cancer, 2 major car crashes where I should of been killed I have 3 major surgeries as a result of stuff after my cancer, and as a result of all the trauma that I have suffered to my head and other life changing events I have been diagnosed with ptsd and a impulse control disorder and depression, As a result of the diagnosis and the constant trauma ( every year for 5 years one the events happens) my ptsd got worse as well as impulse control disorder all intensified. I have been in therapy for 3 yrs as a result of of this. A month ago I had a temper flare and my ptsd got triggered again and my wife left, we started see a marriage counselor 2 weeks ago I have always been honest with all therapist I have seen, and the new that me and my wife are seeing has stated yes 100% I have these problems in front of and to wife and everything that she says that has caused her to want to leave is a result of those diagnoses but she still doesn’t want to hear it. I admit now that I have taken the pain medication out of the mix ( I stopped taking them I felt it was contributing to the issue) and was put on a mood stabilizer and I am starting to feel like myself and I am a lot more aware of my triggers and my temper is not as strong and I have a lot more control. How do I make her see that all she has been upset about that has driven her away was a result of my condition and not just who I am? She did not believe me and won’t listen to me and didn’t really seem to buy this therapist backing me on it.I love this woman with all my heart and never ment to drive her or my son away. I can’t see myself with anyone else. How do I make the love of my life understand that the person she is angry with the last 5 yrs was not my true self and I had no control over my emotions or anger and depression and that her leaving and me asking for help ( and I got it) has put me back in the path to being my old self? I never ment to do the things  as result of the one and only love of my life leaving with the only child I can ever have  it made me seek more help and set me straight or at least on the path of being better.

160,"Sorry in advance if this is a long one, but I want all the details conveyed. My sister and I frequent a restaurant in our area... and by frequent I mean it’s our absolute favorite spot. Best happy hour in town, amazing food, we go so often that MORE THAN ONE of the servers know who we are and know our regular food and drink order. 

Tonight, we came in, got a table, got a server we didn’t know which is no big deal. He took our order, and one of the girls that always serves us came and sat down in the booth us. Said hi, told us she asked him if she could have our table because she serves us all the time and he said that he wanted the table. We love her, but oh well! We just want the good food and drinks, doesn’t really matter who serves us. 

We got our food and then around 10:30 (they close at 11) our server came to check on us. I asked if we had time for another round and he blatantly held up his arm, looked at his watch, and said “can you down a glass of wine in 30 minutes?” Clearly feeling awkward we said no. My sister and I have both worked in food service, so we get “leave by close” concept but most of the other servers never care if we have another round especially if there’s a lot of tables left, and tonight there was. 

We continued to eat our food feeling a bit dissatisfied with our server. Suddenly my sister had GIANT eyes and is looking at the wall that is connected to our table. I look over to see what she’s freaking out about and it’s giant LIVE roach crawling pretty close to us/our table. I grabbed the girl walking by (who happened to be a manager) and she was so mortified she hardly had anything to say other than “I’m so sorry and tonight is on us” she then explained that they sprayed yesterday that maybe “they are coming out from....” and then trailed off realizing implying that there were roaches in the kitchen did not make the situation better. She let us move to a different table to finish our wine while she killed it. 

Well, our server had already run our card. So “it’s in us” wasn’t an option. She came out and nonchalantly gave us each a free appetizer voucher. After she walked away our normal server came over to tell us she “heard what happened”  and started to explain the “we sprayed yesterday thing” and trailed off in the same way realizing that’s really not the most appropriate response. She then told us that she told the manager we were “the best people that could happen to because we are chill and we come there all the time” this was also upsetting. Should a regular be responded to in a less apologetic way because we spend a ton of money there and know the servers on a friendly basis? 

I get that it wasn’t like a crazy infestation or totally worst case scenario experience. However it was probably the worst restaurant experience either of us have ever had. From the service, to the roach, to the reaction. 

Are we crazy, or is justified that we are both sitting here contemplating if we can give up our most beloved spot after an absolutely horrible experience? ",18Oct2018,1
162,"My wife (25) and I (M-22) are both introverted people, but I seem to have a much easier time being liked by people and building friendships and relationships. She really struggles to connect with people - others often see her as a strong leader and someone who is admirable for being smart, capable, and organized, but they are much less likely to feel drawn to her as a person, even though she is very kind, thoughtful, genuine, and funny. Unfortunately, I think there is a self-reinforcing dynamic at play: She is constantly hurt and frustrated by people not being interested in becoming her friend, and that makes her less willing to invest time, energy, and vulnerability in seeking out new relationships. 

This is a big struggle in her life and a source of real anxiety, sadness, and self-doubt. At the end of her time in high school, all of her friends ""abandoned"" her with no reason or warning. Since then, she has really struggled to build new relationships or trust people. It was a difficulty for her in college and has only seemed to intensify since graduating. Sometimes, I fear that she really sees me as her only true friend. I am happy and grateful to be her friend, but I want her to be able to find fulfilling relationships with others, too. My heart breaks for her when I see how unhappy and hurt she is after meeting new people who seem totally uninterested in getting to know her better. 

What advice do you have for adults who struggle to form friendships? And how can my wife help people connect with her and like her for who she is? Lastly, is there anything I can do to help beyond supporting her and showing her love and friendship myself? ",18Oct2018,1

I don’t know why I’d bring it up. She’s so so much nicer to me than she used to be, like a completely different person honestly. But it still bothers me because I spent much of our youthful friendship otl hating her for the way she’d treat me and speak to me (to the point where I hated when people would compliment her or she’d succeed, which she did often). 

We parted ways for a year when I left for college, right around the time she decided her (ex)bf of the time was more important than me. She apologized to me about it before I left and things were kinda okay but they really weren’t and I kinda purposely lost touch with her while I was gone. Unbeknownst to me, he was crazy abusive and I never knew about it. All I saw was her giving as good as she got, but it turned out it was absolutely horrible behind the scenes. Bc of this her self esteem is shattered now but she’s with an amazing guy now who treats her awesome and I’m genuinely proud and so happy for how far she’s come and who she’s become; the problem is, even tho i genuinely don’t hold the way she used to treat me against her, it hurts to know that she doesn’t know how bad she used to hurt me. It got to the point once where a mutual friend said she didn’t like hanging out with her bc of how she spoke to me. She was constantly condescending and would belittle me so casually and it was just such a part of her she never noticed the way it hurt me or the fact that she even did it- which is why I don’t think she’d believe me if I said anything. 

Even now she doesn’t compliment or uplift me unless it’s to put herself down in comparison (although she’ll do so to other girls but it’s about the same way) even tho I compliment her genuinely all the time. I know it’s because of her insecurities but I don’t know how to address any of it.

She’s not a bad person and I know she loves and cares about me but I don’t know how to explain to her or even get her to believe that she used to treat me like shit at times. Not all the times but she was really manipulative often and sometimes I’ll jokingly mention memories and situations when she did something kinda fucked and she’ll just not remember it which is why I’m so concerned.

172,"This was meant to be much longer, more descriptive and informative as there are many important details regarding my situation, but for the sake of sleep and the upcoming conversation, I'll try my best to keep it short.

Due to an unexpected series of unfortunate events this summer, including 1013 hospitalizations, lost job/no income/no money or savings, no luck finding gainful employment for almost two months now, I'm currently in debt $600 to the person I'm subleasing from. I've been corresponding with The Giving Kitchen (an Atlanta-based charity) since July after my release from the hospital, jumping through hoops to try and get everything they need to be considered for a grant for help, but it's not looking like they'll be able to with this current arrangement as they are unable to pay a person directly, and instead apparently require a business entity, in my case a leasing/rental agency. They can cover deposits and 1st month's rent, if I found somewhere else to go that I could furnish such information for them, but that would still leave me in potentially compromising debt to this current subletter for the foreseeable future, which doesn't help matters in any way.

There is one other person here also subleasing from the same ""head of household"" who is planning on leaving by November, tentatively, due to her own unhappiness with the HOH, who is also herself wanting to move out as well. To my knowledge, only the HOH and one other person who no longer lives here are the only two people on the lease, so there is much uncertainty about the current nature and future of the lease.

The three of us are scheduled to sit down together in the morning to discuss things, and while I have given both of them a brief run-down of my circumstances, I'm still at a total loss of what to do.

This isn’t just an urge like *aww bro I wanna be epic and have a tattoo*, it’s more personal. Pink Floyd’s Wish You Were Here has been a significant part of me, and I feel strongly about the song, it’s meaning, and the band itself. The band’s music has helped me a lot through some difficult times, and I feel strongly about them.

However, I almost feel like it’s unnecessary and sort of irresponsible to get a tattoo. I wasn’t thinking of getting some extravagant mosaic put on me, more or less just a simplistic dark side of the moon line art with “wish you were here” below it. Or maybe *Wish You Were Here* art.

My wife and me had our daughter 2 weeks ago. After the pregnancy (C-section) my wife had heart complications and was diagnosed with SVT. ever since coming home with the baby. My MIL has been staying with her at night to help out. But even so, she's been overwhelmed with everything that's going on. I personally feel that it's because she's not getting enough sleep. So she's being woken up by the baby and she feels absolutely exhausted/at the end of her rope. She's up 2-3 times a night with baby. Then stays up all day because instead of taking a nap she tries to stay awake to spend time with me. (I don't ask her to, she insist).

I work night shift. So I sleep about 5-6 hours during the day. And work all night. I try to help out as much as I can during the day. But she's still overwhelmed and has a lot of anxiety for when MIL has to go back to work (Monday), and can no longer stay with her. 

Should I plee with work to try to move back to Daytime? It will be a pretty good size pay cut (10%). Which will make us a little tight on budget. But I'll also be able to help her more, and maybe ease her anxiety.

I've been trying to slowly distance myself but I really feel like I need to just tell him off right now, send him a text telling him exactly what I wrote here. However, because he is known for lying and has already gotten my good friend kicked out for petty/jealous reasons(it was over a girl), I worry that he will turn this around and try to fuck me over. 

I want to stand up for myself but I'm also concerned. If I do something, is text or in-person better? My reasoning is if I take care of it through text, I won't need to bother with being around him again. If I say nothing and just keep trying to avoid, I will feel annoyed at myself and I will feel more paranoid. ",18Oct2018,1
181,"We’ve been together for four months only. In the beginning, we barely saw each other and it seemed as though our relationship took place purely over text. One month in and we hadn’t got out on a single date. 

At this point in time, it was summer break, so he wasn’t all that busy. I nearly broke up with him over this, but we talked about it and he said we can go out for real. For the entire month of July, we met up a couple times a week and went on little dates. It was honestly fun and oddly I yearn for those days again. Things started going a bit downhill once August hit. I felt some of that excitement wear off...once again I was only seeing him maybe once a week, but we didn’t really do much. 

Now he’s started school again so understandably he’s busy. I see him once a week and only get to spend a few hours with him. He’s only a 15 minute drive away (I don’t drive) and I wish he would drive to see me more often in his free time. He never calls me either. Only sends cute texts throughout the day. It’s sweet and all, but it’s starting to not be enough for me. Last night I had a really bad argument with my mom in which I left the house in tears and went on a long walk and all I wished for was my boyfriend to be by my side. But I would feel so needy calling him up and asking him to drive 15 minutes to see me when gas isn’t cheap. 

I understand that this isn’t really his fault and it’s just a matter of having conflicting schedules. I’m not in school so I have a bit more free time on my hands. And, no, my whole world doesn’t revolve around my boyfriend. I go out with friends, I have hobbies, gym, I work. I have a life outside of the relationship. But I crave more of my boyfriend’s physical presence. 

I’m not sure if I should break off this relationship and find someone who doesn’t mind making the drive a few times a week to see me, and has more of an open schedule. I would feel too needy asking my boyfriend to squeeze in more time for me. I feel like if he wanted to come see me, he would. If he wanted to pick up the phone and call me, he would (and tbh if he at least called more often it would satisfy me more). I don’t know why I should have to ask for these things. ",18Oct2018,1

183,"I'm in my 6th year of college. I've had some great semesters, and some shitty semesters. My mental health is very unstable. The good semesters have been in times of good mental health, and the bad ones in times of turmoil. Right now is the latter. I am registered in 5 classes and haven't done anything in any of them in months due to my mental health suffering severely, as well as my mom's (she has schizoaffective disorder and I have to go over there a few times a week because I'm the only one who has any hope of calming her down when she's having psychotic episodes). I have an appointment with a new doctor in a couple of weeks and I'm hoping he can help me with my medication so I can get back on track. My plan was to drop 2 classes and salvage what I could from the rest, but I accidentally missed the withdraw deadline and I've calculated the totals from what I've missed so far and now I can only hope to pass 1 class. Regardless of whether I drop the entire semester or not (which I still have time for), I will still have to pay the school $7,000 in tuition, so I don't know if it's worth it to stay and at least get credit for one class for that money because on the flip side I'll get 2 F's and 2 D's added to my transcript. Or is it more worth it to drop all the classes to avoid the bad grades on my transcript and just pay the $7,000? Keep in mind, the $7,000 is coming from private student loans. I'm already $30,000 in debt and will require another $15,000-20,000 to finish school, which I really want to do, but at this point I'm not sure I'm even capable of it. I used to be a straight-A student and it kills me that this is what my life has become. 
I really don't know what to do right now. I can't afford to repay my loans if I don't graduate school and get the job I'm going for. I was thinking of talking to my teachers and seeing if they'd be willing to work with me if I worked really hard to catch up and turn in all the assignments I've missed, but my anxiety is holding me back and I'm worried about what they'll think of me and what they'll say. 
Another issue is that I do receive some financial help from someone close (not a relative) to help with living expenses while I'm in school. Obviously I wouldn't feel justified accepting this if I failed out or dropped this semester's classes, but I would be so anxious about telling them I couldn't take it anymore for those reasons because I don't want them to be disappointed in me or think I've been exploiting them by not telling them sooner (the only reason I haven't told them of my current situation is because I kept hoping I'd be able to salvage this semester).

184," How can I turn my life around? I'm really scared of the road my life is heading down and I need to stop it but I don't know how. I'm a Sophomore in college studying Engineering and I'm just wasting my life, and being a pathetic self-pitying degenerate. I have horribly low self-confidence and anxiety. I have friends but I feel like it's just out of seeing each other all the time or them having been my friend before I was the mess I am. It's like I don't even know what I did to get these friendships and I'm scared I can't do it again, or be 'On' enough and they'll leave me. I feel like I've lost all hope in my life getting any better and me becoming someone I can be proud of. I've tried self-improvement so many times, but I feel I can't maintain any gains and I get and I get this pit in my stomach of despair and feeling hopeless.   


I feel like it's hopeless sometimes, I'm ugly, only slightly smarter than average and that's only when my anxiety isn't controlling me, I'm terribly boring, never know what to say and have absolutely no charm.

188,"A little back story: I knew this girl since 2nd grade and we attend this weekend scout like thing. I’m going to call her T and for the majority 2nd grade to 8th grade T and I knew each other but never really talked. When I started high school, my friend group from scouts began to slowly disappear and I eventually joined the same circle as T. We became closer and I developed feelings like her. Notes that these feelings at the time are probably just hormones and I was a young high school student. 

As T and I became closer we talked more and  after around 4-5 months I confessed and she said it was cool since neither of us are looking for a relationship. As time moved on T and I assumed that I moved on but I didn’t.


Present day: I still feel a lot for T but not in a high school romance way anymore. I don’t know if I can call it love but every time I’m around her it aches and I get a feeling I can’t put out in words. The only thing preventing me from asking her out is well T. T made it clear that she didn’t want to date nor was she interested in me in the slightest. T also had a rough pass with losing friends due to relationships (prob why she isn’t looking for one) and T is to most people in our scout group, a bitch. She’s really condescending at times and basically very commanding making others dislike her and I totally get their point. But I see something different in T others don’t. 

I honestly don’t know what to do.  I don’t know if what I’m feeling is anxiety or love or whatever. I know T isn’t an angel but I just can’t help feeling whatever that is I’m feeling.  I’m just a shy college freshman that is confused with this.

191,"Throw away account for reasons but I wanted to put this out there because it has really been bothering me.

I just started a new job and it happens to be at the same place my husband works. We have been married for many years, a few kids, have our ups and downs but overall pretty stable. 

A few months ago my husband started casually name dropping someone he works with. He was very open and honest and was never gone late nights or doing anything that would seem weird. He’s had female work friends before and I’ve met them and everything was always out in the open and OK. Nothing weird. But a few weeks ago I went to his office and he completely blew past this coworkers desk and didn’t introduce me. Later on I told him it was weird and I had wanted to meet her and he shrugged it off and said my visit was so impromptu that he didn’t want to interrupt her. 

Fair enough.

A few days later he mentioned he needed to go run an errand and as I was coming back from lunch I happened to see her in the passengers seat driving with him. She didn’t make eye contact with me and actually looked like she turned her head like she was trying to avoid me. I asked my husband again and he said they both needed to run an errand and it was just around the corner. Again, he was being very honest and I know just being in the car with a member of the opposite sex is not crazy.

So I bring you to now, where we all work in very close proximity to eachother. She hasn’t introduced herself and is avoiding me. My husband hasn’t introduced me. I feel like something is amiss. I can hear them talking sometimes from my desk and it seems very casual but I still feel like the whole situation is disrespectful. Lots of people in our office have spouses that work in the same department. A lot of people know I am his wife and have introduced themselves.

My husband thinks I am making a big deal out of nothing but I think there is only a few reasons why this woman is avoiding me and not speaking to me but I don’t know how to approach the situation. I don’t want this to become an HR issue and a part of me just wants to put on my big girl panties and introduce myself but I feel like that isn’t going to make the situation any better.

Does she like my husband and now feels awkward? 

Did my husband maybe tell her not to talk to me? He claims he has no idea what is going on and says he too is frustrated but if that was true he should introduce us (which he still says he won’t do because he feels like he doesn’t want to get involved in whatever issue “we” I.e. me and this woman have between us)

194,"tl;dr in title sorta.

Posting on a throw away bc sometimes my gf likes to go on my phone and “pretend” like she’s just “clearing notifications.” 

so my gf doesn’t want me to be friends with a female who i work with. her jealousy really spiraled out of control when she first found out about her. she was a girl, but in a way she’s a bro. we would go to break and sit in her car during the summer time bc i didn’t have ac in my vehicle, and the place i worked at didnt have ac. 

we would talk about each others SO and pretty much just talk drama. one day she told me that her bf has abused her with a belt. my gf decided to “pretend to clear notifications” and she found the dm’s on instagram. read through them and told me that i shouldn’t be talking to her anymore bc my bro female friend is telling me about her abusive relationship. she says it’s a hint that she wants me bc one of her messages said “i’m afraid to leave him bc i have never been in a relationship with anyone else but him, and i’m afraid that ill ever find anyone else.”

I ended up just dropping it and telling her that i would stop talking to this bro female friend. she made me block her on everything. apparently i was still following her spam account on instagram and she dm’d me one day asking for something she needed back from me. (a box knife that is essential for our work.) and i decided that i’d just keep it a secret and message her on there bc i missed my bro female friend. the dm’s and face to face contact were the only times we could be friends. 

gf currently doesn’t know about the second account, and me messaging her. 

gf got her license recently and decided to come see me at work. me and bro female friend still park next to each other. she wondered why that car was always there next to mine and asked who it was. i said “idk,” but she ended up figuring it out. idk how. but now she’s saying i’m flirting with her bc i told her that i still wave and smile at her when i see her at work.

i also ended up buying a car from my gf’s mom. i ended up wrecking it, and her mom still hasn’t signed the car over to me. i only paid $200 for it + damages of the wreck ($200) and all the problems it had. (around $1500-2000) so all together i’ve paid $2400. tonight i got pulled over taking a co worker home from work, and got a ticket for $185 for “fail to display current tag.” ive asked her mom plenty of times if she can either sign the car over, or validate the tags and she said she would. hasn’t done it since.

195,"Hi, just a bit of background,
         I come from a really conservative muslim family with 5 kids and growing up I've been restricted from doing so many things, swimming, riding a bike, going to the movies, camping/travelling ect. Things my brothers were allowed to do.
        Ive never been close to my parents but my relationship hasnt been terribly awful either, luckily I've been allowed to work and study but im always expected to be home by 6pm or by sun down. 
        Recently I began seeing someone who was not muslim and we both really clicked however we decided to end things because theres no way my family would ever have accepted him as he was and we had to keep the relationship a secret and that only caused him to become anxious. I do believe in a God however I do not entirely agree with everything in Islam.
       My parents expect me to find a partner the traditional way, the way they did and the way my sister got married. Get introduced to a muslim from our community and sit with him a couple of times and decide if i want to marry him.
       I've been wanting to study abroad but that is also not allowed until I'm married and even then I wouldnt be allowed to go on my own. I want to travel and partake in humanitarian projects but again not allowed. 
        So I've been thinking recently the only way to take control of my life is to move out but even that is not something my parents would allow so I would have to do so secretly and may very likely have to sever ties with all of them. They're good people and they mean well albeit a little irrational sometimes and they truly believe that what they're doing is in my best interest.
       They're not physically abusive except when we were younger and we'd get a beating for doing something wrong but now that we've grown up my parents have not laid a hand on us. However these restrictions have become suffocating and unbearable and make me feel helpless. My life had been set up for me before it had even begun.

The thing is she isn’t looking for a relationship at all more of just being friends with benefits I guess, she always talks about us hooking up and all that then goes straight back to saying we’re just friends. Anyways like two days ago I told her how I really felt, how much I liked her and how I wanted a relationship with her and she just completely shut me down. She said she isn’t ready for commitment even though she likes me a lot and started telling me to get over her straight away. This legit fucked me up and I’m never in the mood to speak to anyone anymore, including her but I feel like if I tell her how much it hurt that she just shrugged me off like that I’d seem really desperate or something like that. And for the first time ever I haven’t told any of my friends anything, no matter how much they ask what’s up because I feel like I let them down as well, they’ve been talking about me and her getting together for so long and I don’t know how to deal with this. Anytime one of my friends even mention her or when I see her my mood is ruined and I can’t deal with it, knowing that I can’t even get a girl I’ve been chasing for the better part of a year.

214,"My bro is 20 and he’s been playing a video game where he met 2 girls who are 20 and a guy who is 46. He’s planning to meet with them all at Disneyland since they all got ‘close’. They literally met on a kids game and it makes me wonder what a 46 year old MAN is doing playing a DISNEY GAME. He was saying they were all planning on getting a hotel room and he will have to share a room with the freaking guy. What kind of 46 year old has anything in common with 20 year olds? The 46 year old apparently said he’s married and has kids. Like is your wife freaking cool with you hanging out with 20 year olds? If that’s even true?! Apparently he’s only seen pictures of all of them too and no videos and when he asks they said no. And the girls are supposingly ‘flying out’ to meet at Disneyland and the 46 year old will be picking him up FROM HIS HOUSE. Why would you even give a stranger your address? Plus I’d like to mention, the 46 year old is paying for him, Disneyland and the hotel and everything. Wtf? Could this be me just tripping? Apparently my brother told him he can pay him back when he gets a job. I know those kind of people go on those sites to lure out NAIVE people and he isn’t listening to me saying ‘he knows it’s gonna be okay’.

216,I am really anxious most of the time. I do everything posssible to not get into fights or any kind of altercations if possible. Just last night somebody cut in a line in front of me and I didn't say anything as I was didn't want to argue or get in a fight of any sorts. It really makes me feel cowardly. I've been depressed and anxious for almost five years now and have been dealing with these without talking to anyone but the feeling of being cowardly just makes me hate myself. It feels as if I am useless and incapable of anything and feel like due to this I may not get anywhere in life. I also avoid getting into relationships as I feel like nobody deserves a coward like me and that I would only be a burden to anybody.

But as I thought more about it, I cant help him. I tried for 8 months and didn't work. He needs professional help. (I told him that yesterday) 

He had it rough..but he is playing the victim card... A lot. He doesn't have emotional maturity or family support (he is 29 by the way) 
I'm really confused, but I thought the best was to block the toxicity because I can't take it anymore. He says he is a changed man but then I remember all of the shit that he did to me...

220,"So I recently went and did some window shopping for phones, because everyone can dream, when I saw the Samsung Note 9 at a pretty good price. Not gonna bother actually giving the price because of rates and taxes and such, being a bad comparison for someone that lives where phones generally are cheaper. I can at least say it's about 30% cheaper than when it first released, including the fact that it's on sale at the moment, which just makes me want to get it even more. Been looking at a subscription fee over 2 years, to make the price nice and bearable, and I know I won't be needing a new phone in that time. Spec and capability wise, anyway. I have payed off phones like that in the past, and didn't at all have problems with the method itself. However, when I did it then I was paying it off for just a year. Funny thing about that is that barely a month or two after having paid it off completely I went and lost it a night I went out into the city, partying. It was still in pretty good condition, save for the back which had a crack or two, which I really didn't mind. It's also worth noting that I've grown a lot better at not dropping my phone and generally being a lot more gentle with it. But the thing is, with the phone I'm looking at now, is that I'm afraid of signing up and then losing the phone before those 2 years are over. Be it from breaking or being taken again. I've never really been one to get my phone repaired, though if I am to keep it for 2 years+, I really wouldn't mind throwing 100 bucks at it to keep it repaired, should it need it. I'm more afraid of it being robbed, thanks to having my other phone being robbed. Do mind that I did go and do pretty much all I could to see if I had just lost it, but I'm almost certain it was stolen. I've never had troubles with my things being stolen before, generally keeping them too close to lose them and such. Perhaps I could switch the sim from the Note to my current phone, whenever I have to go out to town, where I lost my phone last time. On that note, I've also grown better to give my phone to friends with bags, that I know will keep them safe in those conditions.

Hope I wasn't too rambly. Any general tips for keeping a phone nice and intact, not to mention in my hands, would be most appreciated. Or perhaps if you think I'm just young and stupid, wanting the newest thing, I'm more than open to hear that as well.",18Oct2018,1

I'm very sexually inexperienced (I've never done anything more than make out with a guy) and I think he knows it, although we've never talked about it. I know he's not inexperienced in the slightest. I like him so much, but he's really my only close friend I have here. I want him to know how I feel, and that I want to be with him, but I'm afraid it'll ruin our friendship and then I'll have nobody. But it's eating me alive. It's all I can think about.

Should I shoot for the stars and if I miss, settle for less? 
Or should I settle for less to begin with?

238,"Okay, it's actually a really long story but I'll cut it short. I'm a guy and I've gotten close to this other guy friend of mine. Initially, I did have a slight infatuation on him before we got to know each other better, then it kinda became a crush.

So we went on an overseas trip tgt for about 4 months (school trip) and I became clingy to him, and kind of emotionally manipulative at times, which was my bad. That made him really mad at me and hateful for disrespecting his boundary. I gave him space.  From time to time I tried to apologize or make it up to him, but he was still angry and sometimes still flare up at me, saying quite mean things like I don't think u deserve my friendship, or telling me to fuck off. I cried in the midst of all that scolding, which probably made him more mad. Okay.

So, I let him be for a really long time, but it kind of made me bitter abt how he had reacted to me - when I went up to apologize, I kept asking myself if I truly deserve what he said to me. Before we head back to our home country, I sat down and talk to him again and he seems like he wanted to mend it back, but he didn't feel sorry for saying all those mean things, but I myself still feel hurt by what he said. (Yes, I know I may b a bit too sensitive about it.) We head back, and I distance myself as a result of his hatred he had for me during the whole trip and he got more mad at me for keeping my distance even after I explained why I was keeping my distance.

Now we don't even talk, and I don't know if I should even try. Most of the time I tried to talk, it was me initiating it all the time. It has come to the point where I think we are both cooled off about it, but the pain of what he said and done still lingers and it's hard for me to always feel like it's my fault, and my responsibility to do something about it. I wish he would at least do something about it on his end. Should I talk to him? Or should I just leave it be?

239,"So I’m struggling to give a name to the kind of behavior exhibited by my brother, and struggling to deal with it. It’s a recurring issue, and here are some examples.

It’s always in sneaky ways. At a bar, he’ll ask me buy the first round, then he’ll get the next, and demand I get another while promising he’ll get the next one —  but after I get that round, he’ll say he’s done for the night and refuse to buy the next one, but if we want to stay out, it’s my decision so I should buy the round.

He’s a musician. Sometimes he’ll “buy me a round” which is actually free for him, and then he’ll make me buy him another round once he’s gotten to his limit of free drinks. Or he’ll get me a round but say he can only afford a cheap beer, but then when I offer to order another round of the same, he’ll change his order to the most expensive stuff in the house. He calls me cheap if I protest.


He’s generous, but there are always strings. My car broke down and he offered to let me use his spare, which I didn’t ask for. While I had his car, he would demand that I buy him meals and get work done on his car in exchange for the favor. I felt like he honestly wanted to help, but was also using me to get work done on the car that he’s too cheap to pay for himself. I ended up giving his car back so I wouldn’t be on the hook for these endless demands. 

He keeps meticulous track of his money transactions. Anytime I do him a favor out of the blue, he thanks me but somehow belittles it, as if it it pays off a debt — “oh nice, appreciate that, seeing as you technically still owe me for such and such...”

If we are out on double dates with our girlfriends, somehow no matter what, I always end up paying the lion’s share of the bill, even though he buys the most food and drinks. He lies about being short on cash and is terrible about IOU’s. He always short me by a few dollars, and when I confront him about it, says I’m being cheap. He is always asking if I can lend him a few bucks but never gets me back, says I’m cheap for asking about it.

He is also quite wealthy, by the way. I’m not. 

If I owe him money, he is relentless, and sometimes charges me interest. 

He does this to a lot of people, not just me, and he’s been called out a lot for being an entitled pain in the ass, but a lot of my friends agree we have no idea how to put into better words just what exactly he’s doing. He’s never apologized and plays victim. 

What is the most succinct way to diagnose this behavior, and what do I do to deal with it? I’m sick of always getting taken advantage of, and yet he plays victim and says I’m taking advantage of him. I’ve hemorrhaged hundreds of dollars over the past few months because of him. ",18Oct2018,1

246,"20M here. Throwaway of course, but I never make posts on reddit (is anxiety applicable for discussion on internet??) so bare with me if I make mistakes. 

So the other night, this girl I’ll call B  invited me to come hangout with her and 4 other guys that I’ve associated with, one being an actual friend. I’ll call him L. 

I met B at L’s house some months back. She was interested in me and got my number and I ended up staying the night at her apartment the next 2 nights. Following this, L decided to quit speaking to me.  

Anyways, I had been drinking already, and took an Uber to her apartment. I brought my backpack with me, which is actually my gym bag. I had some nice J’s in them, (a gift from my dad) and didn’t take them out (later a mistake) shoved my bottle of vodka in their, and a bottle of Apple Juice. 

Now, after I got dropped off by my Uber, I remember walking, and trying to find her apartment # and I couldn’t because my sense of direction was poor due to me being intoxicated. This was around 1:45 AM. I ended up finding her apartment, and right when I walked in was the last thing I remembered. I blacked out (I was on my 6th or 7th mixed drink, and probably had a little under half my bottle left) 

The very next thing I remember was being on the couch and I came back to life to B telling me to “get the fuck out”. I was completely confused, I had no idea what had happened. And I especially have no idea what I did to upset her. L ended up getting me in his car, my first interaction with him in at least 2 months, and took me home. I don’t remember talking to him, or the car ride home, but I remember just little flashes of it. Like a fading scene here and there. 

We got to my house and I remember standing in front of my house and talking to him. I had a quarter of my bottle left at this point (B stole my J’s, apple juice, and some other minuscule items in my bag while I was blacked out, how I had my bottle was a miracle I don’t remember) I do remember drinking straight out the bottle at this point, lord knows I didn’t need it, 

Now, at this point, L started telling me how he quit talking to me because of his feelings towards me. He’s bi, and I’m straight. He hinted at wanting me earlier in our friendship, but I made it crystal clear that I’m straight and not interested.

After drinking more, I was clearly not in the right state of mind for any of the following to happen. At this point, it’s still like faded scenes. He was hugging me telling me how good looking he thought I was, and put his hand down my pants and grabbed my penis and started the motion. He said he wanted to give me head, and I said sure, let him in my house and we went to my room. 

From here on out, I don’t remember anything except having whiskey dick, and looking down at him at some point, which is fucking engraved in my head now. That’s it. Next thing I remember was waking up again, and he was asleep down by my legs and I woke him up and walked him out then went back to sleep. 

After waking up hours later, I felt complete and total regret for ever leaving the house and all the events that followed. I would have never allowed him to do that while sober, and I kinda feel like he took advantage of me, especially with him moving out of state the very next day.  

This has constantly been on my mind, and I feel like a piece of me is now gone. I can’t explain it, it all might sound stupid. I’ve never been in this predicament before. I can’t tell anyone this. My appetite has been gone, and I have been very short tempered because I feel what I can just describe as a dark, and dull feeling. I have felt very depressed since this night. 

A truthfully honest question I have is, was this my fault? And by that I mean, I let him in my house. And I didn’t try to stop him. Do you think he knowingly took advantage of me? And what can I do to deal with this? If you read this, thank you!

247,"I (18m) met this girl (18f) a few months ago and we quickly bonded over two months. We would talk semi-regularly and since I was never in a relationship before, I thought she may have had feelings for me.

Then about 2.5 months of knowing her, she tells me that she’s interested in me. At the time, i was as well but we were approaching the summer break for our college and we wouldn’t be seeing each-other a lot, so I lied and told her that I wasn’t interested in her. Over the summer, we hang out just the two of us and it was really nice, but i was still unsure if i had feelings for her or not. I was afraid of hurting her if I was just infatuated.

So college stars up again and a week into seeing her regularly I know that I would love to be with her. The problem is, she tells me at the end of the week that her and my best friend hooked up near the end of summer. This shatters me and I tell her how I feel (a brilliantly planned move, totally not stupid) and she tells me that she still has feelings for me as well. Another issue is that my best friend knew how I felt about her but he still went in and now I feel betrayed by him.

Is it normal that I feel like I should just wait until another opportunity comes for me to be with her? We talk regularly and I know she still has feelings for me, so I’m conflicted on what I should do, i’ve never been in a relationship before and I’m scared that I missed out on a super important experience in my life",18Oct2018,1
248,"Basically if none of my friends/acquaintances talk to me voluntarily, as in, they say hi to me first, I’ll think all day about how no one likes me enough to reach out to me. I’ll be sad all day. I will go a while purposefully not saying anything to anyone so I can see if anyone says hi to me first, but no one does. OR I will go without saying anything because I’ve decided I’d rather be alone and not have a friend. After a couple days of this, I cave in and I reach out to someone, and then when they reply to me, I think “They do like me!” Then my day is better. And then again, I’ll go a couple days without saying anything to anyone, and then I get sad again blah blah blah. It’s this constant cycle of thinking if they like me or not, and having to test it. How do I stop thinking about this and just be normal?

I remember last year when I didn’t really know anyone I could easily message, I would be lonely, sure, but I didn’t let that ruin my day like now, I was perfectly cool with it. I didn’t think about it all day, I was used to it. I want to go back to that but it is so easy to message another person. They’re right there on my phone!! Not easy to ignore them! I think, if I’m sad I can just easily approach this person. So I always do.

I have a feeling any advice given here would be “people can tell if you are clingy and they avoid you” or “like yourself first”. I already do! What’s wrong with wanting people to talk to me? Or you’re gonna say, “of course your friends like you, don’t worry about it”. I know that, it’s just what gets to me is the fact they don’t like me enough to want to talk to me of their own accord. Because if they did like me a lot, they would want to speak to me without waiting for me to say hi first. Or you’re gonna say, find new friends. But it’s not that easy to do that so I would like to avoid this “solution”. Pleas don’t make me have to do that.

You know that quote, “it’s better to be alone than to be with people who make you feel alone”? I would be by myself, but then I miss attention, and I get sad. They’re not bad people either, they haven’t done anything bad to me, so why should I just avoid them forever? I feel like the quote talks about people who ignore you and are mean to you on purpose. 

Maybe the need to talk to someone, even if that means I speak to them first, is more important than the need to know if they like me that much or not. Because of the latter is why I go days without saying anything and why I get sad. I don’t know why I care so much about this.

This has been on my mind for weeks. Thanks for reading.",18Oct2018,1

I’ve read this is a common extortion tactic, where people sign up fake profiles that look real, screenshot your pics and videos, and then threaten to send them to friends and family.

258,"Okay, a little background. I'm male, bisexual.

I believe that there are two types of friends: those who really care about you, and those who are your friends because they need something from you. I accept the fact that I have more friends in the latter category.

Yet, I have this friend. We started out as ""true"" friends, I guess. It was just last year since we became friends, and I was okay with him teasing me with almost everything (although at times, it gets too much and I end up crying alone in my bedroom). Despite the somewhat-rocky road that we have in our friendship, I truly cared for him so much that our friends would tease me that I was like his very own mother. 

One of the key characteristics of our friendship was me tutoring him (I am quite adept at school with him being above average; and we're about the same level of laziness, only with me actually being able to take notes in class). He'd always ask me to tutor him. That was our bonding moment, I guess... apart from all the times I answered his assignments (because somehow I got something from it... like an online task or something; I'd get the perfect score).

It's our last year of high school, and we're all applying for our dream universities; I joined him in applying in a certain scholarship and we got to go around several places. We finished all requirements together, and there was nothing wrong with the world.

Or maybe that's how it seemed.

The few past days, he just seemed different. And I don't know why. His aura was just.... different, I suppose, like he was giving me the ""cold shoulder"". I tried reaching out, but all I got was replies of ""eh"", ""I don't know"". When others try to talk to him however, he's normal: lively and happy. But with me, he's just bland and clearly does not want to talk with me.

I started getting anxiety attacks. I got drunk the other day thinking what went wrong and started texting my other friends, saying that I miss him (of course, in drunk texting lol).

I have different theories on what went wrong.

1.) My friend's university has a certain grade cutoff for the applicants (i.e., a GPA of 3.5), yet he had a low-lying grade (like 3.0 or something?). And of course, he felt the pressure. I mean, both of us. He had to raise his grades up, and with that he thinks he needs extra mentoring with me. 

Now, I agreed to help him (like I always do). I taught him everything he needed to know. He was happy for a while, but as time passes by... he just seemed so disappointed in me. He didn't actually tell me but it was just present in his face. When he grew tired, he'd go to another person and I'd get abandoned.

I have a hunch that he's been using me from the very start because of this and that our friendship only revolved around me helping him with school. If I decided that I will not help him further, our friendship ends there. He'd find another friend of his to ask, and the process is repeated.

2.) Sometimes, we'd have a plan (most of which us meeting up so that I could teach him stuff), and I won't turn up.

I understand that everyone gets frustrated with this kind of attitude; however, I try my best to ""make up"" for that attitude (i.e., me tutoring him the next day) but he'd plainly turn it down. 

After all, he has a lot of friends to hang out with so I'm clearly not a problem; he can have another me in a second.

3.) The other day, he invited me to go to a local bar to drink with our other friends to celebrate the end of the semester. I think he was influenced by my other friends to go there.

But we had another plan: go to the mall and eat at a good buffet restaurant. He invited me to go to another place and just abandoned our own plans.

Well, to be honest, at first I was jealous. I was hurt. Who would want their plans to be spoiled just like that! But as I slept on it, I realized that there was no point in staying mad about it, so I figured out that I should go. I even dressed up nicely for the part.

Yet it turns out, that plan was cancelled because he got sick. I understood that he needs some rest but eventually, all of our other friends went to his house to party. Without me! It was all over their social media, and I felt alone.

4.) The past week, me, my friend, and some other classmates were hanging out by the school library because I was doing our assignment. We told me to come with them to the cafeteria, but I said no. I was too busy with the homework and I told them to go on without me (I won't feel left out; I enjoy my alone time). They were being pushy about it. I felt irritated and so I agreed to join them.

But then, I got lost and I couldn't find them so I went back to the library.

They came back for me and I thought they thought I was angry at them for some reason (but in reality I wasn't).

5.) I'm completely overreacting.

259,"I really struggle with being able to eat. I've always had weird things with food. My mind likes to make me think something I'm eating isn't what it really is. The first time I remember this happening was when I thought bananas resembled slugs.. or my grandma made a joke that mustard sounds like mouse-turd, even though the mustard thing doesn't even make sense, it used to seriously gross me out, I couldnt eat mustard. There's so much foods I relate to other gross sounding things that I repeatedly tell my self, it's just food, it's not what my brain keeps thinking. Doesn't matter how hard I try to tell myself it's just food, the disgusted side almost always wins.

But my doctor told me she thinks I'm malnourished. It's not that I don't eat because of body image, I am just always nauseous/dizzy. I understand this can make me dizzy and sick feeling but I've always been like this. As time goes on it just gets worse and worse. It can't be stress and anxiety because it's just always there. Even when I'm super hungry, I can only eat specific things i.e., crackers, bread, potatoes, raw veggies, protien bars. That's basically what my diet has been revolving around. She claims my difficulties with eating are from anxiety but Idk, my appetite almost immediately dissipates once instant eating an actual meal. The idea of stress doesn't seem like a solid reason either. In fact the reasons I were stressed before are all dealt with and done. I don't know what to do. I've thought about CBD oil but want to know if there is any other roads I can go down. I do have health problems. I have scoliosis and a low BP. I'm going to be tested for POTS. I don't know.

260,"This is a very futile question I'm asking, but it has always been on my mind since I was younger. I'm currently serving in the US Army and I just don't know where to go in life. Growing up I always wanted to be in the Marine Corps, but I never got accepted due to a supposed ""back injury"" that I received playing football in high school. At the time of enlisting I decided to go into the Army since it offered the best job path I was looking for. Now I'm South Korea and I'm just confused on what I want to do. Every single day I feel I'm wasting my life since the military is not what I want to do anymore. In my head I feel that I should pursue a computer career due to my natural ability to learn and find interest with the topic. When I seek others (adults with experience) they seem to just mix up the bowl more than what it already is. I just feel more confused. From people telling me you don' t want to do your hobby as a job, to others saying that I need to focus on this and that, but I just don't feel the drive to do it. Sometimes I just wake up and I'm super excited to conquer my future career (as of now it is Computer Information Systems). Most days I wake up confused and angry that I can't get my head straight on what I want to do. A lot of people in the Army tell me to just re-enlist and figure it out later, but most of them haven't figured it out either since they are still in the Army and always talk about getting out. My goal is to get out of the military and finish my degree at Clemson University. As of now I'm on track to do that, but again my mindset keeps conflicting with that. It makes me feel like a kid who doesn't know anything, trying to find his purpose, but simply cannot. What am I doing wrong? I might want to add that I'm not one for relationships, as in female relationships. I've been with girls and only one for longer than a year and ever since we broke up I have felt this way. I think sometimes it's me wanting a relationship again, sometimes I think it's the natural laziness in me not pushing hard enough to be successful. I have tried multiple hobbies from playing instruments, photography, or even hiking. What should I do? Is it something that will eventually fade away as I get older?

These are some things about me that I hope supports an answer:

* 20 year old male
* I would say an ambivert
* Stationed overseas for the first time
* Very humble 
* Was once diagnosed with ADHD, but seemed to fade away with time (I think)
* Naturally good at learning things when I apply myself

Yesterday I received a message on Facebook from a complete stranger (no friends in common). At first I thought it was some kind of spam, but I was curious. Here's how the conversation went (let's call her Alice):

Alice:  ""Hey, I know we don't know each other, but I need some information from you. It's really urgent."" 

Me: ""What's up?""

Alice: ""I really don't know what to write, and how to say this, but before anything, I need to ask you to leave this conversation between us""

Me: ""Sure.""

Alice: ""I accidentally opened my dad's Facebook and read some messages between him and your mom. I can't really say they've ever met in person, but there are all kinds of messages. And now I don't know what to do, or if it's even a right thing that I'm writhing to you. You're older than me, so I expect you will find something to do. Please don't tell anyone I wrote to you.""

The conversation ends here. I haven't yet opened the last message, because I don't know what to reply, and I don't want her to think I'm ignoring her.

&amp;#x200B;

I've done some research, and there is a possibility her father and my mother have met each other before because both of them have lived in the same village, but the father moved to a different city, and my mother moved to a different country quite some time ago and she rarely got a chance to go back to her home village (about 3 times in the last 20 years). So what Alice is saying might be true. 

&amp;#x200B;

I need advice on two things. 

Mostly, I'm concerned about Alice, because it looks like she needs help about going trough this, and I don't know how to help her, or how to reply to her at all.

The second thing I need advice on is what do I do (if this is true). Don't get me wrong; I'm not worried about myself, I'll be fine. The problem is I don't know how to approach my family about this, because my mom and dad are (from my perspective) happily married and are really good parents, so I don't want to ruin that by telling my father about this. I have no idea how my mother would react if I told her I found out. And my biggest concern is my little sister (10 years old). If this goes out in the open, it will affect her the worst.

&amp;#x200B;

I know Alice asked me not to tell anyone about this, but I really need advice on how to help her. And if she is, by any chance reading this, I'm sorry, I really don't know how to help you alone.

The week often starts peacefully, and then suddenly in the middle of the week, she will start yelling at me, finding negative things I do, such as sitting in front of my PC at the evening when I’ve just got home after being with my friends, I also do a lot of chores.

My brother just got a girlfriend too, and she disliked her, and tried to find every single negative thing about how she lives her life. 

And now she is telling me that I should get a job (Which is not a bad idea) but I’m still studying for the last year, and I’ve been stressed out lately, and Don’t know if I should work yet, when I told her that I probably won’t be working during christmas, or in a little while because I have on the job learning for a month, we are not in desperate need of money either, she flipped on me, as usual. 

And because it’s stressful at home, and it has been rough years with my friends, had to leave them all for another group, I started using nicotine, Well she found out, and is even more mad at me. 

It’s not all bad to be at home, sometimes it’s great, but I’m here seeking advice on What I should do, and a little bit of venting.

273,"At this point in time I am a college freshman halfway through first semester. I am second guessing my decision to attend the 4 year state school that I chose. Ever since getting here I have been in a real funk, lots of anxiety and stress. Maybe I’ve been depressed too but I’ve never dealt with that before so I’m not exactly sure. 

Im not passionate about my major I just chose it because it seemed just as good a fit as any other. I have few friends here but I’m pretty introverted around new people so I haven’t made a lot of new ones. 

I’ve been starting to think about going to a community college for two years and getting an associates. I don’t know what I’m doing or what I wanna be doing. What I do know is that I am not very happy here so I think I need a change. I feel like going to a community college might be a better option because it is way cheaper, I could live at home, I would be in 2 years instead of 4. 

If you have any thoughts or advice please share.

And so everything was all good until last week. On Monday, regular day happy as ever. Tuesday to Wednesday is when she started ignoring me. And really took place Friday, and it’s been going on tell now. I’ve tried asking what’s wrong she says nothing. I’ve really tried to think about everything I’ve done Tuesday to Wednesday and I can’t think of anything I might have done to cause this reaction. I’ve noticed she’s seems really sad the past 2 days maybe she misses our friendship too. But then again the last few times I talked to her she wasn’t interested in talking with me, or it’s a coincidence she just didn’t wanna talk at those times, or maybe she was having a bad day, idk. 

It’s been a few days sense we talked and I’m getting the feeling if I don’t say something we aren’t gonna talk ever again. I’m wanting to text her but I’m not sure how I should say it.

Yesterday evening when i came back home from work, my mom came to my room with a serious and disappointed face, (although she was acting normal all day, she even called me during lunch time to make sure i ate on time). Then I asked her, 'mom you look tired, are you okay?'. She asked me 'what kind of stuffs do you keep in your phone?' I asked what stuff? (i was quite confident i had no porn, nothing). She said 'I saw what you shot in the bathroom and kept in your phone', My face dropped in embarrassment and a minor shiver ran down my body. I was speechless and wanted to slap myself so hard for stupidity i did. Then she finally ended the conversation saying 'I'm your mom, and you're still my kid'. And left the room, while i was still sitting there with a puppy face, embarrassed head to toe.

Since then, she again went back to acting all normal like nothing happened. But here I'm at work, stressing upon that.

286,"Using a throwaway because people know my handle and I'm honestly so ashamed of this situation and how far I've let it go...

&amp;#x200B;

To make a long story short, in December of last year I took on a very large editing project for a well known website.

A little over six months ago my father died and I asked for some time off, but wasn't sure how much. He said he understood completely, and I haven't been in contact with him since. Since then my mental health has deteriorated, I've been physically assaulted, am having issues with my enagagement (basically he's the one who assaulted me so am getting out of an abusive relationship), family issues, developed a substance abuse problem... the list goes on. I was anticipating takign only a month or two ""off"" but now it has been seven. While I am finally feeling ready to get back on board (and to be honest I quite need the money),  I feel so ashamed and anxious about the whole thing that I have no idea what to even say to him since I feel like it's been so long at this point I've just been ridiculous and unprofessional.

To be clear, our payment terms were agreed upon that he would pay half upfront, half when finished. I had managed to finish a bit over half of it before everything happened, so in that sense I think we are pretty fair and square; no money owed on either side essentially. However, this is the kind of project where you really want consistency and the same person looking over everything.

I've logged in to the app where all my work is for me and it doesn't look like anything has been changed, so it certainly doesn't seem like he's hired someone else to replace me/do the second half. I also haven't heard anything or had any nudges from him on Skype, which is what we use to communicate. So it seems like he's still waiting for me...?

I jsut have no idea what to say. I feel so ashamed and I'm worried and anxious about his reaction and feeling like I need to explain myself. I'm also worried I will recommit/come back alive from the dead and then end up dropping the ball again.

How do I address him after he hasn't heard from me in seven months??",18Oct2018,1

290,"I am a senior in high school. The past eighteen years of my life has been a rollercoaster, now I know this sounds cliche and everyone has a story of how their life has changed, what’s shaped them as a person, and everyone has their unique tribulations and victories. I don’t know where to begin. Am I frustrated at life? And I frustrated at my parents? Am I frustrated with myself? I live on my own. My mom has border line personality disorder, our relationship is terrible. She got married this summer and has moved to a town with her new family that she’s “always wanted” -good Christian man, with three kids, stable job, and wanting more kids- they live about an hour and a half away. She still finically supports me primarily, she pays the bills, pays the rent. I just have to pay my gas for my car and get groceries. While to some this would be a dream come true, no parent, “no rules” expect my mom has made me question what I always have, does she really care about me. Living in an abusive household, dropping me off at random people’s houses so she can go out, and a major symptom of BPD, never acknowledging my accomplishments. I am lonely, I have a boyfriend and friends but I still come home to an empty house every night with the normal anxieties of senior year with no one to talk to. I feel as though I have raised myself, as though I am alone, and as though I have no importance. Is this just some teenage funk I’m in, am I depressed, am I dramatic? I don’t know.

long story short... he lives in another town and so do i, so our only connection is on the phone through an app call snapchat. he hits me up we talk and he asks me to join him in playing computer games and phone games i took out my time in my life to do that becos i liked him. hes in his earlier 20s , im in my mid 20s. Anyways,  yesterday the app i met him on i seen where he posted p2p so i confronted him about the sitaution and he denied it and said we was hacked. so i let it go but still didn't trust him after thar becos i seen similiar posts he say something freely like that but so bold. anyways i became upset i told him he should have some respect and not post those things , he told me ""there's no loyalty in a no relationship"" to remind you we WERE IN a talking stage.. am i bugging shouldn't you still show respect to someone you are talking to soon to be with and you claim you like so badly? later that day he blocked me from viewing his story on his social media and posted another girl CALLING HER his WCW with heart eyes emojis, he never made a post about me calling me that.

so i confronted him about that too and he said so what i knew her for four years and she just aint a nobody to me.. that shocked me.. in all kinds of ways.. if you felt it was a normal thing to do.. why would he block me from seeing it, i had to find out through a friend. 

He wouldn't ever told me about this girl he posted if i never found out.. so my thing is if he lied to me about those simple things and denied it until i confronted him.. and we not even a couple should i continue talking to him. i dont trust very easily and this is the reason, bcoz you give in to some guys and they are lowkey doing things like this. 

Ps: he tells me he have alot of exes and he have girls he can be with n have sex with if he wants. that was a turn off bcs why should u tell a girl that. i dont tell him that which i could but thats irrelevant. he tells me i kno you talk to other guys but i dont talk to other guys in no way freaky or affection type of way as he do girls. i cant help who i attract but i can control who i entertain and i keep levels. he doesn't.

297,"So I've never asked for advice before &amp; I thought a lot about this before finally deciding to come here to do so.

My co-worker is actively attempting to get me to fired or make me miserable enough that I simply quit. A now retired co-worker warned me she would do this if I didn't fall in line with what she wanted but honestly at the time I didn't believe him. My co-worker was at one point married to the business owner who himself is now happily remarried.

My trouble started when the co-worker, I'll call Mary, approached me about doing some design work that was in direct conflict with what the owners new wife does for the company. I told Mary no because I didn't want to step on anyone's toes, certainly not the owners new wife. I could tell immediately what I'd said flipped a switch in Mary. She went from being what seemed like genuine kindness to extremely cold &amp; alienating.

My former co-worker had said that over the years he worked with her he watched her ""get rid of people"" who annoyed her or didn't do what she wanted.

Mary's office is across the way from mine. I heard my name mentioned a couple of times while she was on phone calls so I started killing the music in my one earbud when she'd take a call to better hear what exactly she was saying. It quickly became apparent she was lying about me to people. She would say I said something I hadn't to point blame for something squarely at me. I brought this up to the owner &amp; his wife. They said they would have a talk with her. For the next year Mary was overly sweet. Occasionally I'd catch her giving me dirty looks but when she'd see I noticed, immediately approach me &amp; again be overly sweet to the point that it was cringe worthy.

It was around this point I started to notice the business owner getting distant. He's a busy guy but always used to email or call to check in on things a couple of times a month but that just seemed to stop entirely. The only time I would hear from him really was if something went wrong on a job &amp; he wanted an explanation as to what happened. Like I said though, he's a very busy man so I simply chalked it up to him being pulled in too many directions at once.

One day I get a call from him out of the blue &amp; he says ""Okay.. Give me your side of this thing."". I honestly had no idea what he was talking about &amp; when I said as much he basically ended the call. Later that night I started thinking about it &amp; it dawned on me that Mary must have called or emailed him in distress over an incident that never happened. I started thinking &amp; there were several instances over the span of few months where Mary would simply stand up, grab her laptop &amp; walk out of the building. She would come back the next day &amp; nothing would be amiss. About 3 months later Mary gets a call, she says ""No, no.. That's not necessary. It's nothing I can't handle, you don't need to speak to him about it.""
Now I have no proof but what I believe transpired there was she reached out to her ex-husband, my boss, &amp; complained about something to him which got him so fueled up he called to make sure she was okay &amp; was about to call me out or reprimand me for it before she stopped him. This sort of thing has kind of a two pronged effect. One, it ensures there's no conflicting side to her story &amp; two, it makes her look like she's a leader who can handle the other employees.

I failed to mention it earlier but Mary definitely has her heart set on becoming the manager of our office. I know this because she left for several years when the owner got remarried. When she came back she straight out told me she intended to become manager. See Mary &amp; I were seemingly good friends before she originally left which is why I didn't put much stock in my now retired co-workers words of warning when an announcement was made that she'd be returning to the company. I don't know if it was just owner getting remarried or what but she seemed hell bent on getting some revenge of some kind when she left. Now that she was back &amp; telling me she was going to push to be manager my first thought was that I love my job &amp; working for this company. I wasn't going to let her come in here &amp; destroy it. I told her then, before she even officially came back that I didn't think her being manager was a good idea. She got cold then but I blew it off because I simply wasn't looking for it. I assumed she was back because she'd gotten over things regarding her ex-husband &amp; was ready to move on.

I have an email into my boss that I need to speak with him today either on my lunch break or after hours. He's already responded that either time would work. I could really use some advice here. Part of me wants to direct him to contact the retired co-worker but that guy is extremely religious &amp; it's just not in his nature to talk bad about folks. He really went out on a limb warning me like he did &amp; I don't want to betray his confidence.

298,"So here is my problem. I don’t know what I love to do. I don’t have anything that I feel passionate about or could see myself putting all my time and energy into doing.  So a little background on who I am. 

I am in high school and I get good grades. I have 3.9 GPA as a junior and I take all advanced classes. But they are all horribly boring. I like some of them like micro economics and biology but I don’t love them. When I get done with school I’m so glad it is over. I also work for the parks and rec for my county. I work with little kids either doing summer camps or reffing their sports and it’s fun but I’m not passionate about it. I volunteer at my state’s science museum on the weekends too. I do activities with little kids and that’s fun but I don’t particularly like kids. they scare me. I also have hobbies. I play video games fairly regularly, I do origami, I play soccer and tennis, and I go biking. I am also a Christian. I go to church regularly and enjoy it but I don’t want to go all the time. 

I do a lot of things but I don’t partially love any of them. I don’t get that “fire” in my belly feeling about the things I do. But I guess I’m making the assumption that other people do have things that they are very passionate about. I feel like everyone around me has one or two things that they a LOVE to do and they could spend all day doing that thing or talking about it and their life revolves around it. It becomes part of their identity but I don’t have that “defining” part of me. Or maybe I do and I just don’t know it. 

So they question I’m asking I guess is, how do you find your passion? What does it look like? Do I need to find my passion? And what does it say about me that I’m not passionate?",18Oct2018,1
299,"I understand I am posting this to Reddit and that this is going to piss a lot of people off, but I will not change my mind. Too many evil, disgusting men have walked into my life and have forever changed my perception of them. If I see a group of them, my hair stands up and I need to remove myself. Especially if it's the rapey frat boy groups that are at my school. If I go shopping, I will avoid male employees. When I get my car done, my hands get clammy from having to talk to them. And, no, I'm not going to ""trust"" for the ""chance a nice man comes along"". Fuck that to infinity because the stakes are too high. I won't tell you to go digging in a snake hole in case you find a jewel. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways I have male relatives who I love very much, even though I fear sometimes that they act like the exact people that have left scars on my life. For example, my dad came home frustrated one day when I was in middle school, talking about how he wants to smack a woman because she ""looked at some other guy"" instead of him and that she was a ""selfish whore"" for not giving him a chance. This upset me a lot because my dad tended to voice these opinions frequently and it's a big contribution to how I think men perceive women. I've had uncles and friends of the family express similar grievances, all very negative. All women are selfish. All women are ""bubble blowing pin heads"" if they reject them. All women will use you. Women are crazy and cannot be reasoned with. Etc etc etc. These were the messages that they were drilling. Its upsetting. I grew up feeling like this evil wench that needed to be fixed and express complete servitude and grace towards men in order to be a good person. And that lead to more issues...that I don't think I'll discuss. 

I have a boyfriend, I have male best friends, and my family is still around. But within the past two years it's been harder and harder to be receptive to these people because I can't help but feel this complete aura of evil when I see a man. I don't feel safe, I don't feel trusting. I just feel scared and a part of me wishes I can have male strangers removed from my life completely, which is wrong. But I can't help but feel this way.

But everytime i try and better my life (ie workout more, keep my house more clean than usual, learn a new trade, etc) i get overwhelmed and start to be extremely agitated and unhappy. i have been through therapy and truly believe i have for the most part gotten over the traumatizing events in my life and now i really just want to move forward. i know there's lots of people that were in similar situations to me that really took the reigns and succeeded in bettering their lives. i'm not special. i just hope someone could read this and maybe give me some pointers on how to deal with stress in a better way than just starting, getting agitated and overwhelmed, then stopping.

303,So there's this girl who has been my classmate for several months. I started to like her few weeks ago after we have had some friendly conversations and greetings. But when I texted her she always gave me short replies and she doesn't accept my friend request on fb. I was sad and brokenhearted and started to grow dislike/hate feeling toward her.

304,"My best friend has been diagnosed with bipolar depression, and she takes medicine for that. I was really proud of her for taking that step to improving her mental state; however, she has become very needy too. 

I don't mind listening to her or offering my point of view, but it occurs several times a week. I have some mental and emotional issues of my own that are coupled with chronic migraines. I never really tell her about my problems because I don't want to seem like I am trying to discount or one-up her issues, so whenever I am struggling, I just keep it to myself and work it out on my own. 

I also tend to withdraw from her whenever I have trouble and she sends me long texts detailing panic attacks and all. Then, she becomes short and annoyed with me if I don't give her my undivided attention. She also tells me all the time that no one ever stays in her life and how no one ever wants her around, and I am afraid that is a passive-aggressive referring to me. 

How can I tell her that I cannot always be expected to be a therapist, provide my undivided attention, give her long paragraphs of supportive words, etc. 24/7? I am afraid of hurting her feelings, but it has gotten to a point where chatting with her leaves me in a negative place. ",18Oct2018,1

306,"I'm going to preface this by saying this feels SO stupid to write, but here I go anyways. A couple days ago, I was FaceTiming my boyfriend, and we were talking about a mutual acquaintance. Long story short, this acquaintance comes across as if she's really fake and always trying to get something from you, but she's actually a nice person once you get to know her a little better. I said something like ""Kate seems really fake but that's just her personality!"" - meaning that she's NOT actually being fake. Anyways, it sounded bad. 

The issue I'm having is that my roommate's name is also Kate, and it's occurred to me that she may have heard me say that and then thought I was talking about her. I don't think she heard - I was in my room and she was in hers (on the other side of the house) when it happened, but both our doors were open. I just moved in about 6 weeks ago, and we're friendly but not CLOSE close, if you know what I mean. I feel like I should ask her if she heard and clarify if she did so she knows a) what I meant and b) that I wasn't talking about her.

309,"Hello to start out this is a throwaway for obvious reasons because I needed to share my thoughts with someone because they have been troubling me for a while. Anyway im 20 years old and im in my second year of college in a field that I decently like and I feel like I wont pass this year because I have to do my math exam from last year since I failed and then I have to pass another from this year and I've always had trouble with math so if I fail I was considering getting a job out in Germany/Austria since the pay is way better than what I would be getting here (I have a high school diploma from the field im currently studying for my college degree). Im fluent in both english and german but im not sure where to start looking for a job so there's that. The next thing I need help is with my girlfriend of 2 years... over the 2 years I've been starting to become less and less ""in love"" with her, she's nice to hang out but our sex taste is so different that I do not know if I can go on for so long but im afraid to break-up with her since she has a sad story basically her parents abandoned her a few years ago and she's been living alone ever since then and she told me im the only thing she really has right now (besides her sister) that makes her happy so I feel so terrible for having the thoughts that I have but I feel like I have a responsibility for her and its way too much for me I do not want that kind of responsibility at my age it's just too much and I've tried to break up with her once and she was crying for 2 days straight telling me not to do it. Im so screwed. And the last thing im looking for advice is I've been working at a job that's relevant to my degree and well they're expecting me to work for them after im done with college and it's cool and everything and I love working with all of them we're kind of a family but i hate the thought of working at this hard job from 5-8 every day and I mean the pay is good but I want to go outside and explore other countries but it feels like im backstabbing everyone that has been going out of their way to help me learn and everything.

310,"So I’m about to turn 30 and I still get mistaken for being 18. While many people would see this as a great thing, I went through a breakup about a year ago and trying to date girls around my age is extremely difficult. I was never good at it in the first place, but I started dating that girl 5 years ago so things have changed. Either I go after the girls who naturally come to me, and when they find out I’m 7+ years older they suddenly get less interested, and trying to pickup a girl my age I don’t even get the light of day as I’m some kid trying to pickup an older woman. I should mention the fact that girls are hard to come by in my small town too so it’s not like I get to go out and try to get 20 different numbers in a night. 

I haven’t really changed my image for 10 years I feel is part of the problem. I’ve had the same shaggy hair, t-shirts, and flannels. Just imagine your typical skater/snow bum. The fact that I have a “baby face”,  super skinny and can’t grow facial hair doesn’t help either. But when I get into “nice” clothes (not suit and tie or formal stuff) I see myself  in the mirror and feel like I should just go shop at Tommy Hilfiger, it doesn’t feel like “me”. 

What are some things I can do to look older, and accept my new “image”. I know my self confidence has gone down, and I’ve gone into a slump of depression. I’d love to be my old self again. ",18Oct2018,1

One day, I was having a good time and he told me to ""shut the fuck up because it wasn't necessary"" and that my friend should also shut up. He was playing the game with us, and this has been happening more. I started to realize a trend that when John plays a game he gets extremely toxic. Two examples being that when he plays Rocket League on console he shit talks (through typing) to teammates and others say that they are faggots and they should kill themselves. The other example is that my playstyle in games is calculated yet reckless. So we were playing Mario Party with 2 friends and I was looking at the board, seeing where to land. He then calls me a pussy and that I should start playing the game. I told him I'm just seeing what I can get, to which he replies, ""shut up you fucking pussy and do something! You play every game like a pussy.""

What do I do? Me and my friends refuse to play with him because of his toxicity.

315,"I wanted to write this to see if I am in the wrong, or at least a little bit of advice what to do.  I could write up the entire back story but instead what I will say is that my mom is a raging alcoholic who has ruined the family, my sister and father are both narcissists, and my twin brother and I have never really been close up until the past two years once the house of cards has fallen.

&amp;#x200B;

So I will just jump into my conclusion.  Last night my mom sent an email to all the kids essentially saying how there was some miracle with my brother and I, and I was curious about it. I wasn't going to respond to her and feed that flame, but my brother shared the screenshot of the email to start a conversation in a group text with my sister and I.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister then texted me separately and put out the biggest bomb of my life. Let me preface this by saying I am 25 now.  She told me that I wasn't a twin, but a triplet. and that the other kid had died.  I was pretty blown that this entire thing, was told over a text message.  I called my dad to clarify, who said ""it isn't that big of a deal"" which I feel like it actually is, that this has been kept a secret from my brother and I.  My sister then started saying what an asshole I am for saying that this was too big of a thing to just casually text me.  It makes sense now as to why my parents didn't tell my brother and I who was born first until we were 18 so they didn't have ""middle child syndrome"" but what this shit is this?  There have just been too many secrets.

&amp;#x200B;

My family sucks. I hate saying it, but they are all mentally abusive, have been physically abusive, and at this point I think I am done.  Would it be shitty of me to just say fuck it and cut ties with everyone? I am sure I would still stick with my brother, even though we are not super close, at least I know he isn't playing some sort of social experiment.

320,"Ive done a bad thing. For context my friend threw a house party the other night which turned into a sleep over. I shared a bed with her and this guy she thought she was beginning to have a crush on. At this point I'd had about 4 glasses of wine (obvs not an excuse) but the guy began to spoon with me. For some reason I thought it would be a good idea to run my hand across his stomach and then unthinkingly put it down his pants.

Yeah. 

I don't have feelings for him or anything and I took it away immediately (he replaced it on his stomach again) but because it was so late when I woke up the next morning I thought it was just a bizarre, weird dream so I only told my friend about the spooning. Unfortunately he told her about where my hand went as well (something I hadn't thought had even happened)

It's a mess. And I need to talk to her in person to apologise (already apologised to the guy) but I really don't know how. I'm terrified. I know it's stupid because I'm not the victim at all and I've done something really stupid and hurtful but if anyone has any ideas on how to get over myself and approach her I'd be so appreciative.

You would think I or he is joking but no. He was dead serious. He didn't eat meat for a while (still ate fish though) and got it in his mind that somehow he was calmer or something and got hurt for me belittling his views.

323,"My brother is now dating my friends ex wife. 

They started going together before the divorce was finalized and she has convinced him that everyone in my friend circle are evil stalkers and capable of doing harm to both of them. Mind you he’s only briefly met some of them and his only opinion of them is what she has told him.

 My brother moved in with my dad maybe 3-4 months ago to save money and she moved in with him shortly after. She was living at a friends and was being evicted for many different reasons, then convinced my dad she had nowhere to go and her dad did not live in the state when in fact he lives maybe 10 minutes from where she works.   

 Neither of them are paying him rent or helping with bills, he is old and recently retired. My dad has asked my brother to ask her to move out after he found out the circumstances of their relationship and that her dad did not live out of state. My brother has not mentioned anything to her at this point and my dad is too nice to bring it up any farther. I feel they are both now taking full advantage of him.

  They’ve spent every second together and now everytime he talks it is her words coming out of his mouth, talking about peace, cutting toxic people, newfound bible thumping (it’s not breaking commandments having sex with someone else because her marriage was toxic) and of course that everything is somebody else fault.

  She claims to just want to finally find peace and be left alone yet continues to throw domestic violence and protective order charges at her ex husband. My brother is completely convinced he is following her around and showing up everywhere stalking when he doesn’t live in the same city and works out of town up to 6 weeks at a time. I asked my brother if he believed this and he told me “yes he keeps showing up”  when I asked more he only knows that he showed up to take possession of the vehicle she was driving that was given back to him through the divorce, in the middle of the night while everyone was asleep to make sure there was no contact with her. 
   
 I’ve tried to talk to my brother about her influence on him and he denies all of it and can’t give explanations on anything, talked to him about our dad and that he’s not happy in his own home (he told me he locks himself in his room whenever their home) and my brother tells me I’m wrong,  he is in full support of her and I’m not trying to put her down to him by any means I just keep asking to think for himself and see what’s happening.

 I feel it will be too late by the time my brother opens his own eyes and he will be the next one in court with all kinds of charges or at a loss some other way, he’s already burning bridges with family. Within 3 weeks of meeting she had him convinced to sell everything he owned and to move out of state where he has no support from family.

  This is my younger brother I feel it is my job to protect him and his future but I’m getting the “let me be an adult” kind of attitude. I’m losing him and I can’t do anything about it. I will not support the relationship between them and I am especially pissed off at them taking advantage of my poor dad.

 Anyway I just wanted this off my chest and maybe some suggestions on how to handle or move on from this, it’s affected my friends, family and kids and wife because it seems to be the only thing we talk about lately.

For this reason, we aren’t able to do much together. I understand this; so i try to do things that are really affordable or in the past i have hosted things at my house and invited them/ friends over. I am not that far removed from the struggle of being broke. I’m 27, i had the broke college experience and i was raised in a lower class home. I get. 

My spouse and i bring in a really large salary now thankfully. I am planning to go to NYC (which is about an hour away) get a really nice hotel, and do my Christmas shopping. My friend expressed wanting to join. This is great ! I didn’t want my spouse to come, as i would be doing a lot of shopping for him. 

However, i don’t know if it is going to be assumed that i will be covering the expenses because i have less financial restriction. Nice hotels in the city around the holidays are going to be at a minimum of 300 dollars a night in Manhattan, which i am prepared to pay. This is a trip i have planned for, for months. I, however, don’t know if it is fair that i pay that or more to accommodate my friend. I know parking will be expensive also, and i will be ubering around to shop/ bar hop/etc. 

How should i ask my friend gently is she planning to contribute to the room, Uber, parking, etc ? Also, because she is not from the area- how do i let her know realistically you are not going to find a desirable 150 a night room in the city, without sounding like an asshole ?

I thought he was very handsome, grew attached to him and I immediatley tried talking to him, he didn't talk to me right off the bat but we came to be really good friends, best friends even. A few months ago, he went into the ""f**k my family"" phase and he and his dad had a lot of fights, and at one point he went to live with his friend. To make matters worse, my anxiety was causing me to have visions of his dad brutally murdering him in various different ways and they still invade my mind, along with other visions of the same theme with different characters. I hadn't seen him in a very long time until just recently, and before that he had attempted suicide. I don't know what I would have done if he had succeeded, he has since moved back in to his dads house (That was a long time ago like in april). Between the time he moved back in and the time I had seen him for the last time in a very long time, both his dad and my mom were saying so many bad things about him.

334,"So a little context, this has been going on for about a month now. About a month ago in the same week I got out of a year long relationship and started a new job. The breakup affected me for about the first week or so but i really feel like I overall got over it pretty fast. It was a mutual break up and I wanted to for a long time but didn’t know how because she was my first girlfriend.  I also started a new job that is somewhat active (stocking) and has kind of weird hours it’s 5am-10am I get up at 4am to get ready and go to work. I have an ok time getting up for work now, I’ve gotten pretty used to it. But by the time I finish work and get home at like 10:30 I’m already dead tired and if I decide to lay down right then I could literally probably sleep until it’s time for work the next day. Why is this happening why am I always tired and capable of sleeping an insane amount of hours? No amount of sleep seems to be enough. My parents thought it was depression sleep because of the break up. I thought that made sense at first but here I am a month later and I have no feelings for my ex. I don’t miss her, I don’t want her back, I blocked/muted her on all social media because out of sight out of mind.  So I really don’t think I’m depressed over her. I get to see my friends more, I’ll talk to other girls and even hooked up with one since the break up. I really feel like it has no affect on what’s going on with me but the timing seems too coincidental. Is it my jobs weird hours making me like this? More insight I was more or less lazy and unemployed for like a year before this job.  Did I get too used to the bum life that the few hours of working I do now just exhausts me? I really just want to get to the bottom of this. Now that I’m no longer with my ex there’s so much I want to do. I want to go back out and socialize, I want to get passionate about the gym again, I’m doing the steps albeit slow to go after the career I always wanted but put on hold for my ex.

I didn't really like my studies but because i was stupidly in love with her, I applied to continue my studies in the same class as her. We moved in together in an apartment and life felt really good. She had her own psycological problems but it didn't bother me much because i loved her anyways. after about 4-5 months in to the semester she told me she didn't feel the same way that i did for her and it devestated me. I had put all my time and money into this girl to make her feel loved, but i think my love for her was to much for her; wich i totaly understand because i could be really jellous at times. When she broke up with me i started abusing drugs and alcohol, and because we went in the same class my grades dropped and i stopped showing up for school. The bills started cumulating and a dug myself further and further down in missery. i eventually dropped out of school.

I recently told my parents about my prycological problems but not about my money problems. My mother and father are supportive but everytime i dissepoint them a real shitstorm happens with yelling and stuff. I don't argue back and just sit there and soak up all the coments of what im doing wrong. I have seen my doctor about my psycological problems and I have been granted a terapist.

339,"Hi everyone,

The title pretty much sums up the idea. My friend was in a relationship with this one girl that he truly loved. He had been in countless relationships with other girls so it's safe to say he had experience for break-up and heartbroken. However, I've never seen him head over heels for anybody like her.

They were doing well until one of his spontaneous depression surged up, causing stress on their relationship. They broke up but in his mind, he believed that they were simply taking some time off so that he could heal and come back.

Of course the girl didn't get it and moved on later with another guy after 2 months. He was shocked and shut himself from friends and family. I was the only one left that he was able to talk about his feelings since I'm sympathetic enough to listen.

I really want to somehow convince him to move on without being pushed away cause he's a really stubborn guy. He has been having these unhealthy thoughts that she might change her mind and they could be together in the future after he's become successful or something like that. Recently, he's been taking sleeping drug, skipping class and neglect his social life and I can't persuade him the other way.

If there's any psychological therapy advice or things that I could do to implicitly influence his decisions, I would love to hear from you guys.

340,"I met with my advisor two weeks ago who urged me to get a Master of Science rather than take a job. I've been on the job hunt for a few months now and have a couple of attractive offers I've yet to choose from. My mind and body are screaming for me to get out of school and work for a while, save up some money and get a nice apartment, maybe a new car, find a sweet girl and settle down. That's always been my life goal -- an easy simple settled life. I can always come back for more school if I want it. Everyone from the industry tells me to do that, but those in academia always bring up the fact that not many end up coming back.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm afraid of selling myself short, like I could have more in life with a little more school. On one hand I've almost got an undergrad degree and a job and life can be simple for a while, and I can move up in life on my own accord. I have no motivation to continue on the way I've been in school and am dying for a lifestyle change but I fear that if I don't get the degree I'll miss out on some good things. What those things are I don't know -- a few extra grand a year or letters after my name aren't worth it to me, but if it made the difference between middle and upper class I'd be more inclined to stay in school. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd eventually like to open a company of my own someday rather than work under people, and the degrees I'm urged to get may not be as useful for that purpose as an MBA. I'm still not sure quite what I want to do with my future and can't bring myself to set aside time without the right intentions in mind. There are opportunities now that I may not have as I grow older, and that goes both ways.

343,"Using a throwaway because I want to be able to tell the truth and not have this follow me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

A guy (John) that I went to high school went raped my friend (Jane) our junior year. To be completely honest, Jane is not very smart. She's from a poor family, had a bad upbringing, and just in general was an easy target for a guy that wanted to take advantage of her to get his rocks off. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because we were friends, Jane came up to me on a Sunday morning at church and told me that John had come over to her house late at night, like 2am. He was drunk and they started getting physical. He forced himself on her and had sex with her against her will. He finished inside her and left. When I found this out I immediately diverted Jane to the pastor's wife and my mom, who is a nurse. They took care of her for the short term - I know they went and bought her plan B but I can't remember if they got a rape kit done at the hospital or not, and I don't really want to ask my mom to find out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty soon after (like a week I think?) Jane and I were talking out on some church trip. She started to tell me the full story of what had happened, and without her knowing it, I pushed the record button on the camcorder I had in my hand. Somewhere in the old church intern's iMovie files there's a 20 minute long testimony of what happened. It would be a real stretch but I think it might still exist. I don't have a copy of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

After I heard this I went to the liaison officer at school and told him what had happened. He brought Jane in and talked to her, but Jane decided she didn't want to bring charges on John because ""I don't want to ruin his life"" and ""what if he still likes me?"" All the dumb insecure bullshit reasons you could imagine. Never mind the fact that this guy committed a literal crime against humanity, she was willing to let him off the hook for it. I begged for her to press charges but she wouldn't. It was like in those sex ed classes in middle school where they talk about girls who will have sex with guys just so they'll stay with them and like them. I always thought it was just a made up scenario, that everyone would be able to see through that nonsense, but I was wrong. The whole thing just faded away without anyone knowing what John did.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Issue**

Flash forward to this week. It's 6 years later, Jane has dropped out of college down south, lives with her sister, has a few jobs waiting tables, and has been dating some guy for while now. I haven't really talked to her in like 3 years. Meanwhile, I see through Facebook that John is now engaged to some girl he's been dating for a while. They look happy and all that. He's graduated college and lives in the same town I live in with his now fiancé. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the thing. I want to tell the fiancé that John raped my friend. She deserves to know, right? Maybe she already does know and has forgiven him. I don't want John to figure out that it was me that told his fiancé, and I also don't want him contacting Jane afterwards if this blows up. Jane lives 7 hours away, so she's safe at least for the immediate future, but if this dude loses his fiancé over this I don't want him hunting Jane down. 

&amp;#x200B;

I live in the same town as John and fiancé. I see on Facebook that she works at a pharmacy here and it looks like she's a masters student at the university here. Do I try to find her at work and deliver a letter to her through a third, unrelated person? Do I see if I can somehow get ahold of her school email to send it to her that way? Better yet, do I even bother with any of this at all? 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a dumb, lowly first year law student at the same university John and fiancé went to. I'm trying to cover my own ass on this and do my best to not have this tied to me or get wrapped up in it. I don't know if Jane would be able to figure out that it was me that told John if it came to it. John would definitely have no idea it was me that told his fiancé if I can just find a way to get the message to her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also with that secret recording I made I have her story while it was still fresh in her mind. That's something in my back pocket if this ever spiraled out of control and I need more evidence. I'd still have to go hunt it down. This is a one party consent state for recording if that matters.

&amp;#x200B;

As a law student and eventual lawyer isn't my job supposed to be to pursue justice? To my knowledge, this guy got away with it and never had to face the consequences. At the same time, I don't want to restart something that could lead to a nightmare situation for Jane. Look I get it, I'm a cocky kid who is making his own stupid judgments on justice and you're right. Is this vigilante justice? I guess. I just want to know what the best thing to do is.

345,"Recently met a woman, about 28 y/o professional in accounting at an out of town conference event, we really hit it off and had some meals together but nothing sexual while there. I'm 35 male.

But it turns out we do live in the same town and I've been seeing her since then (a couple of times a week for a few weeks) as well and communicating a lot. It has since turned sexual, but she is married for a few years. Her husband is a little younger than her. 

She's told me about certain marital issues, they fight a lot, he's often angry, sexually he's not very interested, not affectionate etc... she also has just expressed personality traits she prefers in me, like just social, confident, emotionally calm etc.. compared to his shyness, timidity, social awkwardness etc...

She's recently expressed guilt over the situation and sort of wanted to break it off, but still wants to see me 'as friends' and she'll be coming over to my place again this Saturday. She's kind of expressed the 'we shouldn't, im a bad wife' sentiment before but it didn't actually stop things from escalating. So I'm not sure if she's serious this time about stopping or not. 

She's been fairly clear about really liking me beyond just sexual and that a lot of her pull backs have been because she's worried about getting too close and that she can see a life with me and she wishes she could be with me always etc... however it's clear she's still undecided on the marriage.

If it was a possibility, I'd simply want to be with her outright. I kind of feel stupid for saying it, but I've outright fallen in love with her in a brief time and don't want to be without her. But I also don't want to try and push her into anything she's not comfortable with or try to push the idea of a divorce or anything.   


I'm kind of looking for any guidance here, I'm kind of convinced that like 2-3 years from now these 2 are divorcing anyway. There's no kids in the situation. I am trying to fond a way to navigate this, to be sensitive to her who must be more emotional and conflicted about it all, but I don't want to go back to being 'just friends' I want to I guess fight for her, I really want her in my life.

347,"Backstory: my new neighbours moved in a couple of months ago, they brought with them 2 dogs and 5 cats. When they came round to introduce themselves the man said something along the lines of “one of my cats is a very dominant Tom who will fight for territory with your cat”. Great. Hi neighbours. 


It was foretold and it has happened, my previously happy outdoors cat is now an incredibly terrified indoors cat currently nursing multiple bites and scratches and a pretty serious limp (I’ve been to the vet he now has antibiotics). He is literally a shadow of his former cat-self and I’m not sure what I can do. 


My cat has always had the run of both indoors and outdoors but I would generally leave him out while I go to work (amongst other reasons, so I can set my burglar alarm). He still -wants- to go outside but invariably when I let him out he comes back in an increasingly worse state. My vet bills are mounting and I’m genuinely concerned for his safety. 

Can I approach my neighbours and if so what kind of resolution am I hoping for? I feel that they are to at least some degree responsible for the medical bills, given they had told me this was going to happen in literally the first conversation I had with them but obviously these are animals that we have little control over..

348,"Throwaway as my brother might know my account. 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently learnt that my brother some years ago when he was 13-14 spent 60.000dkk or about 9.000usd from my father. I knew he spent some money but I thought it was ""only"" about 1.000usd, today I learnt it was in fact 9.000 and that he never gave an explanation or anything really to my father. I am still not sure if my dad really got any of the money back I tried to ask him about it but didn't really get an answer. I have a slight idea what they were spent on (CS:GO skins) but I am not sure.

&amp;#x200B;

We've never been that close my brother and I but recently we've been talking more since I've gotten into PC gaming and more into tech and now I am not really sure what to think of him anymore. Just the fact that he apparently didn't give any explanation and I assume even apology, on top of that he's been acting more and more like an asshole towards both my father and mother who are seperated. He's 16 now by the way. I kinda went through the same phase I guess because I dropped a laptop I got as a gift from my father which was pretty expensive and I felt guilty over it, it was still functional but just had a small dent on the side but in the end I stopped using it a year or so later because I just felt bad when using it and I was quite moody when interacting with my father at times after that, it's gotten better though so I'm wondering if my brother is going through something similar or maybe it's something else? 

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure how to handle this either, should I just ignore it? I want to ask what it was he bought but I don't know if that would be that great of an idea. Not sure if anything at all can be done about it now as it's been such a long time. My father did manage to cancel some of the payments before they were processed but this was all in a month, I'm not sure how he managed to buy for so much in the span of a month as it wasn't just one big ticket item but multiple items at about 8 eurs my father told me.",18Oct2018,1
349,"This is a bit of an odd question I know, but hear me out.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never had a computer in my room, nor a charging device for any electronic (DS, Phone, Etc.). It's just something that's never crossed my parent's minds. This was primarily because my room is very small, as my closet and bed alone take up over 25% of the room. The 1 spot where something might be able to fit, there is no outlet near it. My parents have been renovating our house recently and pretty soon they will get to my room. I will move into my brother's old room (he's moved out). It's a bit bigger, but not by a whole lot, but big enough to fit a desktop computer in it probably. Currently, my computer is in a room we call ""the computer room"" which is just a room where our modem, computers, and all of my dad's paperwork for his business is located. An office, but much bigger and has 2 extra computers for me + my mom. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm 19 now and I'm feeling like It's been well past the time that my computer should be in my room and not in a public space, and moving to a bigger room soon (within the next few weeks) is the perfect opportunity to present that. But I don't think my parents fully trust me.

&amp;#x200B;

Between the ages for 14 and 19, I have abused my parents trust on several occasions. Them catching me on my phone late at night many times and staying on the computer late. For the past 4 months I haven't done any of this, but I don't think that's enough time for them to trust me on this issue.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a plan, and I want to know if this plan will work or if you guys have any other ideas on how I should phrase this. My plan is to say that I should have my computer in my room, but to make sure I'm in bed at a decent time, they set a time that I have to be awake every day. On school days this is my alarm at 6:50AM, for weekdays it can be whatever they want, lets say 10:00AM for now, and I have to be awake within 10 minutes of that time or I lose privileges such as my computer, phone, doing more chores, etc., So it's my choice if I want to stay up to 2AM playing video games instead of getting more sleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

I primarily want this because it's very awkward at this age being in the same room as my dad. He's kinda old, so him sleeping at 2PM and snoring on the weekends, which forces me to mute my mic while playing video games is irritating. Or him making business calls from home all the time during the day. I just wanna be in my own space, and given the ability to be more accountable.

I met this girl in my class she was around 18 at that time and i was around 19 and she admitted to being a bit curious to who i am because of my personality. She asked me if i could be her 'adopted brother"" which i think now is a code red. I agreed since at that time i thought it was a nice to have someone be interested in me (22 now and still a virgin) 
We made along just fine and i actually became a fond of her and she became a fond of me, even admitted admiration to each other
Until half a year later i decided to go to a different country to work.
I told her i will be back maybe a year and it was a promise unsure. Around a year later i had a crisis in my life and had a depression-like feeling and this turned our relationship into a disaster. 

I should note that she has this long term suitor she turned down quite a lot already but still consider him as a friend and they sometimes go out since they have the same group of friends.

So while i get this feeling i told her to be stop meeting with the guy because I'm jealous of what's happening between them having meet ups. She just doesn't want to so i told her to maybe give him a chance since the guy seemed nice ( i was wrong)
I forcibly pushed her away from me and told her that my life is in really bad shape.

We split confused. But I'm friends with her sister which after the split i became close with (another code red) and the sister became attached to me as a chat mate and both of them thought i was into her (the sister)

After another year i came back and met with her and only then would i know that she and that long term suitor of hers are now in a relationship. I was in shock and had a broken heart, when i asked her why they are together she told me that she was scared because i pushed her away before and maybe i like her sister more now and that maybe if i tell her that it is what she thinks it is she would be destroyed emotionally(code red).
 I talked to her about it and told her that i like her still very much and talked to her about leaving his newly boyfriend. She agreed and we spent some time together happily i thought.

After a month i had to go back to work in the same other country and assured her that I'll be a better person compared to before

I should also note that this girl is a religious person who wants her firsts like first kiss to be from only one guy.
Few days after I've been working again she told me that she and her ex had some things happened while they were together (few weeks before we met) when the guy kissed her and touched her until she said no. She said she was afraid to do anything with what the guy was doing to her because she thought that maybe the guy had the right to do so. She described herself as dirty and impure

I told her to stay away from the guy but she insists on being friends with him and since they are in the same group of friends i agreed. 
She then later on asked me if it was okay for her ex to be waiting for her after school (code red) and bring her home (with public transport) to which ofcourse i declined immediately.

Now after we are go through all those stuffs she decides to make me a friend and an adopted brother. I don't know what's happening between her and her ex.

She still has 2 or 3 years to finish her college so i don't know what to do whether to be serious in pursuing her or just let her be a friend",18Oct2018,1

She's not materialistic by any means. She likes sending me letters and that sort of stuff and I've sent her chocolates etc. My problem here is that I tend to go overboard and I know she doesn't like someone spending a ton on her(she buys her own stuff).

362,"So, quick back story I am living with my mom, she has this unfortunate habit of taking in more living things than she can take care of, I have 5 siblings and in the house we have 4 cats, 2 dogs, 5 chickens (backyard). Recently her boyfriend found 4 kittens in his shed. My sister who is in school to be a vet urged her to take them to the shelter. She of course did not and decided she wanted to keep them. I got involved because...I wanted to help rehoming them to people who will take proper care of them and not my mom who is a little loose with her parenting (and fur parenting). My sister gave one to her boyfriend, my mom decided to keep two, and I made the decision to give one to my co-worker. She made an appointment at the vet for a week and a half from when I gave her the kitten and I thought all was well.

Wednesday afternoonish I found out my sister's boyfriends kitten died and looking back I should have told my co-worker right away but I knew the kitten was going to the vet so I figure ok the Vet will check the kitten and if anything is wrong they will fix it right? I'm not going to make a big scene and get her upset for no reason.  Well, she took the kitten to the vet the same day and to work afterwards, found out they are two months old. The kitten looked exhausted but she said everything was fine. So figure the kitten is tired from being out all day everything will be ok. 

Last night she reached out to me asking how the other kittens we're doing because the vet said his temp was low and to watch him. I told her the truth about the kitten that didn't make it and reached out to my best friend who happens to be a vet tech about the situation and they said that small animals can have trouble regulating their temp and as long as it has a blanket everything will be ok. 

Kitten didn't make it through the night, died from an infection.

How do I make this situation better for her? I feel like I flat out broke this girl's heart. I gave her a tiny little life for her to love and it died a week later. I feel like shit. Everyone is saying it's not my fault but it feels like it is because I meddled in things I should have left alone. My sister is going to talk to my mom about the other two kittens that are still alive to get them proper care. I kind of wish our kittens died and not the ones we gave away. It's awful what we did and I will never ever do anything like this again. But I want to know how I can make it better. My coworker is devastated and I feel responsible.

366,"First time posting, so sorry if in the wrong sub. Probably going to be a long one too. This is not meant to be a downer or a vent, just trying to find direction.

I'm a 21 year old male college junior, and it just seems like ""life"" doesn't like me. I'll try to do my best at explaining what I mean by this.

Background, ever since I was little I've had deprrssion and social anxiety, and as of 2 years ago, after being fully honest to therapist and doctors, schizo-effective. I've always felt different, like I was a mistake that the universe accidentally let slip by. I've never had any close friends, never dated or had a girl interested in me, and don't even feel comfortable around my own family. It feels like I'm the black sheep in the family. I guess to cope with this, I've constantly talk to myself and inanimate objects, having hour long conversations alone in my room everyday. When I got into college, I really tried to be more outgoing and social, but it never seems to work out. It seems like people just naturally dislike and avoid me. Doesn't help that I have a naturally mad/sad looking face. I've joined clubs that interest me, the only things really being video games and sports, but still feel like I'm ostracized in them. As if no one wants me to be there. I think people can hear my thoughts, and hate me because of this. People say ""fake it till you make it"", but I can easily look people in the eyes, smile, listen, and laugh when talking to them. But later feel uncomfortable and discouraged after the fact. Whenever I meet up with friends, whether it be with new one's or old one's, I still never feel apart of the group. I truly hate my face and the sound of my voice, and just can't look past them. I would try to actually be more confident, if every time I tried to be more confident, it didn't backfire right into my face. I probably would just consider those times bad coincidences, but it's so consistent I can give multiple specific examples of this happening regularly. It's to the point where I am honestly afraid to be confident about anything, because I know something bad will happen to me. It feels like something in the world is try to keep me in check. Like it has to always remind me that I'm ugly, unintelligent, and terrible at everything. Can't really love myself, when there's nothing about me to love. This used to make me extremely depressed, and I took meds to try and help this, but they didn't really help. After a while I just kind of got used to the fact that everything will end badly, and that it will not be better, but could get worse. It's almost entertaining to see myself get a little feeling of hope, and then have it immediately taken away. I now laugh at my misfortunes, as if I'm watching someone else, making comments like ""what the hell else did you expect to happen"" and ""you know what, you deserve that"", but to myself. I'm realizing that I'm my only true friend and the only person looking out for me. Even when I put myself down, I know it's ""me"" try to keep myself at a safe level of mediocrity. I don't know if I'm sad or not, but I don't feel happy either. I just feel like I'm wasting space, that someone else could have had instead of me.

I guess I'm just try to understand if I should be embracing who I am, or changing who I am.",18Oct2018,1
367,"Made a throw-away for this, in case people who know me recognize this story. Don't want it to compromise the anonymity of my regular account.

**The TL;DR:**

This ended up being stupidly long, so the TL;DR is this: girl I was  friends with in my mid-20s and had a huge falling out with after a  pretty toxic friendship messaged me yesterday and we are getting  together for coffee soon. Despite having long moved on, I still hold  resentment toward her that I know is stupid and that I wish I didn’t.  Regardless of whether we ever become “friends” again, I’d like to get to  a place where I am happy to see her happy and I want to be rid of the  toxic side of myself that still for some stupid reason comes out when I  hear about her or from her. Anyone else been in a similar place? How did  you get past it? Because I honestly, truly did believe that I had long  forgiven her and I genuinely don’t wish bad on her and I would love to  be able to be friendly acquaintances again, but there is this side of me  that just can’t shake the “frenemy” thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Long Version:**

In my life, I’ve had plenty of friendships fade over time and plenty  in which we grew apart, but I’ve only ever had one friendship end in  what I’d call a “falling out”. And it was a particularly bad one.

The falling out occurred over 6 years ago and I had been friends with  the girl for just under 3 years. In that time, however, we had become  weirdly close. We lived together and did \*everything\* together and our  relationship was very much like that between sisters. While we were  ridiculously close, we also had some ongoing issues throughout our  friendship, which eventually led to our falling out.

She had done very weird competitive and jealousy issues, which mostly  came out when we were drinking. If we were out at a bar or a party and I  was talking to a guy, she’d swoop in and put on her best ditzy blonde  act and start flirting with him. On multiple occasions during our  friendship, she would start fights with me out of nowhere about really  stupid things, usually when drinking was involved. During these fights  she would say and do very hurtful things fully with the intent of  harming my self-esteem. I’d usually tell her in the morning what she had  said/done, she’d apologize, and I’d forgive and move on. I let a lot of  things slide because I knew they were based in her own insecurities.

Throughout the course of our friendship, she consistently acted as if  we were in competition with one another, and it seemed she was  constantly doing things and saying things to prove that she was the  prettier one, the funnier one, the cooler one. It was very hurtful and  it did take a toll on my self-esteem and my mental health. I didn’t want  to be in competition with her, but enough of that behaviour and you get  sucked in. Near the end, I did find myself often comparing myself to  her, and even asking mutual friends if they thought she was prettier  than me, etc. I hated the person I turned into with her around.

The straw that broke the camels back, though it came after many ups  and downs, absolutely shocked me. I had confided in her that I thought I was in love with my best guy friend. I opened up to her about it and she helped  me sort out my feelings and encouraged me to tell him how I felt. I was  pretty certain he only liked me as a friend (which turned out to be the  case), but I couldn’t just keep pretending it was purely platonic from  my side. With her encouragement, I decided I was going to tell him how I  felt that coming weekend when we were all camping, at some point when I  was able to get him alone.

The first afternoon of that camping trip, we had all finished setting  up our sites and were hanging around having a couple of beers. He went  off to take a leak and then stopped by his truck to grab something. He  was alone, so I thought fuck it, now’s the time, especially before we  all hit the drinks too hard. As I was walking over to him, she saw me  walking over, got up and walked over to him and put her arms around him  and fucking kissed him. She looked directly at me before she did. He was  confused about it and that’s when she decided to confess that she liked  him as more than a friend…

I was absolutely devastated. I couldn’t believe she would do that to  me, and I had to spend the rest of the weekend acting like everything  was fine because wtf was I supposed to tell everyone? They could all  tell there was coldness between the two of us, but I just said we’d  gotten in another one of  our stupid fights and not getting along super  well at the moment.

She and my best friend ended up seeing each other for about a month,  but it was pretty rocky because he kept finding her flirting with other  dudes when they went out and other obnoxious crap. During the time they  were dating, I had broken off my friendship with her but didn’t give  anyone the full details of what caused our falling out. 

When they broke up is when I finally told him the entire story of  what had happened between us. He was every bit as shocked that she would  do something so cruel as I was and lauded me for how I had handled the  whole thing. It turned out that he saw me as a sister and hoped that we  could still be friends because he loves me very much. We are still best  friends, my feelings looong faded and became purely platonic, and we are  both now engaged to fantastic people. All’s well that ends well.

About a year after our falling out, she messaged me asking to meet  for coffee because she wanted to apologize and explain some things. I  met with her, she told me that she was genuinely sorry and also told me  that she was in therapy to deal with issues of childhood sexual abuse  that she believed was the cause of her overtly sexual and competitive  behaviour. She had discovered that the abuse had left her believing that  her body and her sexuality were her only source of value, and she  believed that was why she had become so toxic and competitive towards  me. It made sense, I forgave her, and we moved on. We both agreed at the  time that we were probably never going to be friends again and that’s  ok.

So, why am I bringing this all back up now? Well, she messaged me  yesterday asking how things have been and if I’d like to get together  sometime. I said sure, we chatted a bit, and we’ve made plans to meet up  for coffee in a few weeks. She is still friends with some of my  friends, so she does come up from time to time, but we haven’t actually  seen each other since that coffee meet up 5 years ago.

I want to see her, I want to see how she has been and really move on  and I want to get to a point where we can see each other around again  and it not be weird. But I find that even after all that time, even  after knowing why she was the way she was, a part of me that I do not  like comes out when I hear about her or talk to her. This fucked up  competitive loathing bubbles up and I hate it. I have never, ever been  that person and I don’t want to be that person. But over the last few  years, any time she has come up in conversation I’ve found myself  annoyed that she also had a boyfriend and I was, therefore, not  “winning”. I push that shit right back down and I am incredibly ashamed  to feel things like that.

Well, when she messaged me yesterday she congratulated me on my  engagement and said she was happy for me and that I deserved it. I asked  what was going on in her world and she mentioned that she had ended a  long term relationship but was good with it, was in therapy and was  still working on herself. The biggest part of me is happy to hear that  she is working on her mental health and genuinely does want her to be  healthy and happy, but that small, competitive frenemy part of me felt a  twinge of validation in hearing that her relationship didn’t work out.  How fucked up is that? I feel genuinely terrible about the fact that I  still have that hatred towards her. I don’t want to!

Has anyone ever had a friendship end like that? Did you ever manage  to just grow the eff up and get past the crap? How can I defeat that  stupid toxic side of myself and just get to a place where I see this  woman as just an ordinary person who I want good things for?!",18Oct2018,1

She's come down to see me countless times, even just for one night stays and it makes me feel awful. The distance has put strain on the relationship, but I can tell that she wants it to work just from her visits.  

I've always been extremely jealous in my past relationships just because I am a naturally jealous person. I really like this girl, and I knew that my jealousy only stems from my own insecurities. I never act on my jealousy, because I know my jealousy is always misleading.

Last night she went out with some friends for awhile. She didnt snapchat me for most of the night which is totally fine and expected. I knew she was with her friends having fun and wouldn't have the time to check her phone every 5 minutes.  

I woke up to a message this morning from her sent at about 4am asking if I was still up. She wanted to talk. I immediately had this gut-wrenching feeling in my stomach. I messaged her back saying I fell asleep but asked her what was up. I was anxious all morning. In my mind i knew it was nothing because last night we were talking about how excited we were to see each other tomorrow.  

I wait patiently for her to wake up, scenarios running through my mind that just make me sick. When she finally wakes up, she told me that she just wanted to call me and tell me how much she loved me, but figured that I had probably went to sleep.

I have a friend who is also a co-worker. For awhile we had a FWB thing going on till she decided to go official with the other FWB she was with. While I am happy for her, it does get annoying when she shows me pictures of his body randomly, and gushes about him and various sexual details of her time with him (And her time with a female friend of hers as well). Afterwards she was gushing over another FWB of hers, then a new co-worker who she has been flirting with the entire time for her own amusement to his reaction.

&amp;#x200B;

Now we come to the actual problem. Enter Co-worker #2. I don't care for him, as he is very smug and arrogant and just the worse. He is leaving today, after being with us just for two weeks as he leveraged his spot with us to get a higher spot in the company. However my female co-worker is gushing all about him cause they share similar political views (She is a hardcore Trump supporter whereas I am very much in the Sanders camp). This new co-worker has been a smug jerk to me, and the female friend keeps saying I should give him a chance. Course after today I will never see him again (Which does make me happy).

&amp;#x200B;

Today while at work, she starts telling me to tell him about the time I won a small sum at the local lottery. This is not a story I tell many, and I do not feel compelled to tell \*HIM\* of all people. So I feign ignorance on the topic. She then blasts me for my disliking him, and laments that she is tired for having to consider everyone else's feelings before her own and that she is being shamed for being nice to him. All while earlier, she was overly sad and sure to tell me how she is so sad he is leaving and how he was so perfect and amazing. I refused to get on this train and now she is giving me the silent treatment.

&amp;#x200B;

I just felt fatigued at how she always threw these things in my face. How she brags about her very active sex/love life, while my own is lacking. How she wanted me to like this new co-worker only cause she thinks he is wonderful cause he is as right-wing as she is.

He still messages me with the usual ""hi, how are you"" and honestly I want it to stop. 

I don't want to be too confrontational or rude, but at the same time I've been nicely declining his advanced but it hasn't been working. I see him in person sometimes as we are in the same club and it's just too awkward of a situation to be in sometimes.

How do I get him to stop bothering me for reals? I've never shown him any signs of interest and I've already told him I have a boyfriend. I've always declined his dates but he won't stop messaging me.

385,"I’m 19 and I have 2 other sisters. They have already moved out so it’s just me at home.

Ever since they moved out my mom’s having a harder time to let things go. It’s hard for her to throw away anything. On top of that, she keeps going to flea markets, peddlers malls and places like that and buying stupid nics nacs. 

I can’t throw anything away without her telling me “No, I can use that.” When it’s literally been sitting on a shelf for years.

My mom’s always been this way but never this bad. I want to secretly throw things away when she’s not around but I don’t want to throw anything away that has true sentimental value. 

For example, my aunt (her sister) died in 2009 and she was a dental hygienist, so my mom kept her teeth cleaning stuff, like the thing that they take to the back of your teeth that has a hook that  scrapes off plaque 

She has a whole ziplock baggie full of that stuff. I want to throw it away but I don’t know if it means anything to her.  I mean she has a plethora of my aunt’s stuff that’s just collecting dust. 

She has so much junk in the basement, it’s ridiculous.  She has a lot of my old toys and Christmas decorations that are broken. 

I haven’t really tried talking to her about it because,  I’m afraid she’ll end up have a nervous breakdown or something. 

I don’t know what to do, I can’t really afford counseling or anything like that. I’m afraid when I move out this house, it’ll be like one of those houses you’ll see on hoarders.

389,"I’m 17F, and a few days ago my dad found a condom in my wallet. He was obviously very upset and told me I wasn’t allowed to see my boyfriend anymore because he doesn’t want me having sex with him. 

I suspect that he found a way to spy on my phone because I was texting my sister last night when I noticed that his phone kept going off everytime I sent a message to her. 
I thought it was just a coincidence, so I sent her another text two minutes later, and his phone went off again! I think what’s happening is that the app he’s using is sending him a text to notify him when I text people or when people text me.

391,"Before you call me a douchebag, I want to clarify a few things. This person put himself in this position, by his antisocial behavior and isolation during teen years. He wrote threats to a lot of my classmates, because he thought they made fun of him in middle school. Also, tried to ruin their reputation by posting disgusting stuff about them online. He kept telling me how he wants to commit murder and idolized serial killers. He had delusions. Now he is depressed and without anyone in his life, but I am the only one he has kept somewhat in touch during the years.  


I kept in touch with him, because I was afraid he would turn on me. I have avoided him for about 2 years, because he wasn't around my town, but now he is back. He keeps calling me and makes up excuses to meet me, like ''oh, can you help me do this and that''. It is becoming very hard to avoid him, because he is persistent and also quite depressed and lonely. I do not want to meet him by any chance, as I've been seen with him on the street by people he used to threaten and I do not want to sabotage my reputation. He also does not has anything going for him. He is constantly a downer and has negative things to say about everything.   


Every time he calls me, he seems more depressed and I can hear it in his voice how much he wants to meet up. He knows where I live and work, so a lot of the times he wants to just come there and hang out which leaves me with not a lot of excuses. His past lust for murder and destruction is very unsettling still, because I don't know if he has matured. He still seems a bit bitter, but not as much as before.   


How do I safely cut contact with this guy? I feel that he suspects that I am avoiding him, because I always have an excuse.  I would cut contact completely if he didn't know where I live, work or new some personal stuff about me that he could post online. I used to be friends with him years ago, so don't blame me, please. Only as of these past 2 years or so I've understood that I need to cut this guy lose.",18Oct2018,1

And so everything was all good until last week. On Monday, regular day happy as ever. Tuesday to Wednesday is when she started ignoring me. And really took place Friday, and it’s been going on tell now. I’ve tried asking what’s wrong she says nothing.

401,"Hi, I'm a 19 years old adolescent and I've started to notice that I can't really cope with pressure put on me. I started noticing it with the task of finishing my driver's license. This was a few months ago and I'm still not finished, but I should've been already.

I can't really learn and pass the theoretical test you have to take and it makes me nervous. If I don't finish the theoretical test, I can't do the practical test so I have to learn for it but I'm not seeing any progress. My results don't get better and I already payed 1050€ for my driver's license so stopping isn't an option. The real pressure put on me is the factor of time, I have to finish my theoretical test before Nov. 3rd so I can finish my 2 remaining driving classes on that day and the 5th and do the last practical test shortly after that. If I finish that, I'll be done. Nothing to worry about, happy with a driver's license and a car that I'll be given.

But there is also a new factor in play of my newly started education as a physiotherapist. I love it by the fact that it's so interesting and I really do wanna know almost everything I'm being taught, but I'm putting pressure on me again.
I have to learn 25 Latin vocabular terms for a test paper in 5 days, have to learn every bone in Latin so I won't have issues later on as those are the basics. I like it, but I'm starting to question if it's the right career path for me. I could damage my body, my health, everything for an okay-ish paycheck in Germany. I'd have to move to a different country if there'll be no rise in wage in the mean time I'm still learning. Also another huge issue is me not being able to pay for it. Yes I have to pay 350€ for it per month. Usually you get paid doing an education but not with this one. The payment method isn't even safe and set so if it doesn't work out and I can't pay for the education, I'll have to end it.

I'm not depressed, nor suicidal. Killing myself is not an option. I also really like this girl and were so close to being in a relationship, it just takes another serious talk and we could be a couple. 

I feel like I'm a rock on top of a spikey peak on a mountain. I either fall to one side where I fail at everything that makes me looking forward for the future and be at the bottom again with no plan on how to get back up, or fall to the other side where I receive my driver's license, have a safe way to pay for my education and get good grades/can learn easily and lastly have an amazing girlfriend.

This is too much pressure for me and I can't handle it. The love aspect isn't giving me pressure, but I can't say I'll be happy if we don't get together, whereas the driver's license and the education are the main pressure inducing factors for me. Please give me advice.",18Oct2018,1

406,"So, basically as the title says I'm a mature student (mid-late twenties) who is studying Japanese and Linguistics at the University of Manchester. I'm currently a month into my course and can't stop thinking that my degree isn't going to be ""worth"" much after graduating. On a personal level being able to speak in Japanese will be a fantastic achievement and I do enjoy learning languages. This being said, I'm worried that just being able to speak Japanese is a pretty useless skill. On top of this, with technology and AI advancing at the pace it is currently I could ultimately become ""redundant"". I planned to complete my degree and move on to do a MA in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) as I'm keen on leaving the UK to pursue a career. I still think this is a viable option for me as I have experience teaching abroad and, no matter what advancements are made technologically, there will always be a high demand for teachers and their roles will just evolve to facilitate learning. Before teaching abroad I'd always worked in sales and marketing roles and ultimately became a Business Development Manager for an IT company. 

I'm just worried because I feel that my options would be ""limited"" after graduating so I'm looking to assess them. As I see it, these are the options available to me:

* Carry on and complete my degree but at the same time self-study in another area for the next four years. This, in theory, should give me a solid knowledge base which will allow me to apply for a different MA course to TESOL.
* Raise the issue now with my university and change course (ultimately I can teach abroad with any degree if I wanted to pursue that option after graduating).

To get into university I did an access course in teaching. This included subjects like psychology, biology, teaching and assessment. I had offers from Uni of Warwick, Uni of Leeds, Uni of Manchester and SOAS. They required me to gain at 30 distinctions and 15 merits from my access course. I achieved 45 distinctions. The assessments were all essays and reports apart from a couple of biology exams. I miss writing essays. I wanted to give you this information as obviously there would be some course I wouldn't be able to get on to with this qualification. Subjects I would consider taking on instead of my current choice include computer science, biology (or a subdiscipline) and disaster management. I'm also have a keen interest in economics.

I havent seen him in 12 years, we communicate via email,  I just want to see him tho and thank him in person for his friendship over this difficult years 

However the past months in his emails he has hinted and kinda confessed that he still loves me, and what is worse is that he is currently engaged. I really dont know what to do, and these messages have only happened while I was planning to do this trip (he doesnt know about this trip, as this is mostly a family trip)

so tl:dr should i meet a dear friend/ex knowing that he still loves me or should i keep my visit secret and spare him of the pain of having to see me (and probably saving him issues with his engagement)? (and just fyi, i have no attraction to him, so i wouldnt be a cheating option for him, nor that he would try to do any moves with me as he is very socially shy and respectful otherwise)

409,"Hey all. I’m going to share with you a little bit of what I’m struggling with at the moment.

So, one of our most important characters dropped in our musical. She’s not a lead, but sort of like a tertiary character. She’s popular, but not essential to the story. Think of like.. Peppermint Patty from Peanuts.

Anyways, my director thought I would be the next best fit. I’m flattered— but I’m not sure if I want to take the role. I’ve done about a month of character work already on the original character I had. I would keep all my lines &amp; have a few more, the problem is my character is basically the opposite of what he’s asking me to play. My original character is a peppy, bubbly girly girl, but the character I was assigned was a sporty, agressive tomboy. 

So I’d most likely have to do completely different character work, and the lines I have for my original character aren’t.. the best fitting for the one that was offered. I’m really conflicted because it seems like a great opportunity, and I like the character... it’s just hard because of how attached I got to my original.

Should I use woman? Is using woman too formal? A female friend of mine said she thought woman is too informal, and said she prefers girl. I don't real use the word ""gal"" it would be too strange to use where I live.

414," A coworker of mine who I have been on a team with for over a year now seems to proactively exclude me from things …especially as of a few months ago. As of recently, they are fully ignoring me. For most of my time working with this person, they have been generally friendly and helpful. They love to be the center of attention in groups, be perceived as a “party animal”, and seem keen on hanging out with people that can help them climb the social ladder at work.

A few months ago, my team shifted, and our teams’ boss changed. As a result, one of my existing team members became my manager, while everyone else on my team was now managed by a different boss. It felt like the dynamic had changed a little after that. Since then, this coworker has done a few things that have made me really question what the heck is going on. There were several occasions where most of my team was invited by them to some post work event, lunch, or happy hour and I would not but would figure it out retroactively (asking about where everyone went and why they left work early left me with zero responses).

In early September, this coworker reached out to me all friendly out of nowhere saying that we needed to catch up and that we should get lunch sometime. After that, we were on decent terms again because I appreciated them reaching out, but we never got lunch.

Fast forward a few weeks and I see that this person suddenly BLOCKED me on all social media. I decided to be friendly about it and texted them saying something like “hey, what happened to your social media accounts.” No response. Ever since then, although I see them almost every day, we barely engage or talk. I feel so uncomfortable around them and as a result it makes me not want to be around my team.

I am almost positive I did nothing to cause my coworker to block me (they were the ones who originally added me). I have never been anything but nice and helpful towards this person. This seems so childish to me, like silly social drama that people get involved in in middle school. This person and I have known each other for over a year and have mostly been on good terms until now. They don’t speak to me, don’t say thank you when I hold the door open for them, nothing.

417,"Three years ago I was sexually assaulted. I was getting over a breakup and found this guy on Tinder. He seemed nice, and we had similar senses of humour. We met up for drinks, then I hopped in his truck and we looked at the stars in a field. When he drove me to my house, I invited him in. We wound up having sex, but as it progressed, he became more rough. He bit me in places I did not enjoy being bitten, leaving bruises. He ignored my grimaces. He started going too hard, and it hurt and I was absolutely not into it. I said stop, but he didn't. I tried pushing him off of me, and he just slammed back into me harder. I wound up just laying there and taking it, making no sound or motion. When he finished, I shoved him off me and ran into the bathroom where I cried. I cleaned myself up and kicked him out of my house. I never spoke to him again. I joked with my friends about the bruises all over my body, calling him 'The Shark'. I was a strong girl, and refused to let myself think I could have been assaulted. But I was.

I still went on Tinder, but I found the idea of meeting with a stranger scarier. So for 2 years, I almost exclusively dated friends of friends or guys in my classes in uni who I'd known for months. Occasionally I would work up the courage to go on a Tinder date, and usually they were fine. Then a year and a half ago I went on a Tinder date with a guy I'd been speaking to for a few weeks. He wanted to make me dinner, so I went to his apartment. We sat on the couch, and he aggressively kissed me. At first it was fine, but then it very quickly became too much for me, so I tried pulling back but he pinned me to the side of the couch and used his weight to keep me there. He pulled his dick out and told me to give him a handjob. I told him my phone was ringing, so I faked answering it as I put my coat and shoes on then quietly opened his front door and booked it down the end of the hallway then ran down 7 flights of stairs. I didn't stop running until I was 2 blocks away from his apartment building.

A few months after that, I moved across the country to start a new job. I love my new city and job so much. But I haven't been able to make friends very easily here since all I do is work. I am still petrified of going on dates with strangers. In the 15 months I've been here, I've been on 5 dates total. It took me 6 months after running out of that guy's apartment to go on the first one. I would talk to guys on Tinder or in person and would genuinely like them. We'd arrange a time and place to meet but I'd get a panic attack and cancel at the last minute. I still do this. I started talking to my exes again because they're safe, in my mind. I know I can trust them. But I don't want to have a long-distance relationship, so those fail too. I just can't get over this shit.

Before anyone asks, I'm not in therapy. Only my best friend knows about both events that I think caused this. I don't want to talk to anyone else about it. I probably need therapy, but the waiting lists are months long and I frankly can't afford it, nor do I have health insurance that would cover it.

The money was intended to be used for his car insurance that he pays for twice a year. She ended up having an emergency and couldn't pay him the money. He was fine with it, because she suggested that she puts him on her car insurance policy and she did. Turns out that she had to put her name as an owner (she is not one) and when he called the credit union that he got the car loan from to inquire if he could add her as an owner to it, he was told that he cannot. So, she sent him the proof with her name and his as the owners and when he went to email it to the credit union, he realized that he could alter the owner name and have it still look authentic.

423,"For those of you do not know, the fertility awareness method (FAM) of birth control is a non-hormonal method where a women tracks her periods to determine when she is most fertile using temperature, mucous buildup, and using a calendar for reference as well.

My long-time girlfriend (23) and I (23) do not want to get pregnant right now but hormonal birth control is really giving her some issues (almost exclusively migraines). She's using the ring and is swearing off all other hormonal methods, including IUDs, even the copper paraguard IUD. Now she has discovered FAM through her Instagram fitness circles and wants to switch to this.

Abortion is off the table for us (she's against it), so I always have felt comfortable using condoms in addition to a very effective method (&lt;95%), as having a child would be disastrous right now.

FAM is anywhere from 76-88% effective according to planned parenthood (12-24 women will get pregnant per year).

I would be fine with FAM in the near future when we get engaged/married and become more financially stable, as having a surprise pregnancy would be less hindering on our careers and lives.

I've tried to politely direct her to IUDs because I know that they generally have less side effects than other hormonal methods.

As a clinical research scientist, I know that FAM can be somewhat effective if used perfectly, but it is nearly impossible to do so, as periods can be altered by many factors as simply as sleep and stress.

To get the crux of my point, I just feel very uncomfortable using FAM and condoms to prevent pregnancy and I am not sure what to do about this issue. I feel a lack of trust that she would be able to predict her cycles accurately (I love her to death by she often forgets to take out her ring on time). All it takes is one slip up with a condom and/or FAM and the chances of a pregnancy increase drastically.

Times like these I wish I could push through some of the male contraceptives clinical trials to take more control regarding birth control.

I soon realized that this girl is depressed and suicidal.

Every now and then, she goes into a depressive vent and talks about harming herself or killing herself. She has already confessed to harming herself once before, and I recently just talked her out of possibly committing suicide. She seems pretty genuine about it, saying things like ""I'll be watching over you"" and ""I'll miss you"" and such like that. Every now and then we talk about more positive things, but it often comes back to this.

I try my best to be a compassionate person. I have a lot of depressed friends and I have talked a friend out of suicide before.

I just have too much on my plate right now to worry about. I want to be there for this girl, but there's only so much I can do from here. I have urged her to talk to her family, to consult someone for help, to call a hotline, but she refuses each and every time. I worry that if I leave her alone, she might hurt herself.

431,"Ok so here's the story- i (17 M) live with my sister, my mom and my dad. For some reason we are ALWAYS in financial trouble, my dad always has to borrow money from his friends to pay the bills and sometimes to even put food on the table for us. There was even a time when we were 4 days a row without eletricity in the home because there wasn't enough money to pay the eletricity bill.  And i never understood that, because my dad earns enough money for us to live without financial difficulties. One day my parents were having a fight over financial issues, and in the heat of the moment my mom called him a ""junkie"" and said that he's a cocaine addict, suddenly it all made sense to me, we're having all this financial difficulty because my father is using all the money on his addiction. i confronted him about it and he confessed that in 2017 he used cocaine but ""just a couple of time"" and swore that he was clean since then. I believed him, until i started to see signs that he's still addicted to it,  sometimes when my mom is out working i enter into his room you know to talk about my day or say hello and i can see as i slightly open the door that he quickly hides something that he's holding in his hand( in his pocket, sometimes he just puts it behind his back) , and when i enter i see that he's nervous. And this didn't happen once or twice but a lot of times, so one day i decided to confront him and just asked him to show me what's in his pocket. He REFUSED to do it, even when i kept insisting, and told me to leave him alone. I'm almost sure he's addicted, I don't have proof that he's still an addict only very reasonable suspicion.

434,"I’ll try to keep this as short as possible. 

So I’m 20. I’ve been going to college from 2016- last spring 2018 where I just stopped attending classes. My gpa and credit count are both terrible. Im not doing bad in college because the content was too difficult, but because of my lack of interest and motivation. Also I’m not sure if it’s college itself, or living in the city. But I got pretty depressed and figured I couldn’t continue. I also don’t think college was providing me with any real value that I couldn’t learn on my own from just reading books and gaining real life experience. I want to start my own business. I know that I’m very intelligent, and I know that I can do it. however my problem is my severe lack of confidence. My mind eats myself up with terrible negative thoughts waaay too much. Currently I’m sitting in my parents house, unemployed, applying for jobs. And I have no idea what I’m supposed to do next. 

Should I get some boring retail job part time and then work on building a business simultaneously? 
—
Here’s what goes through the negative part of my head when I think about this option:

• Is a shitty retail job really all I’ve amounted to so far in life?
• Why aren’t I in college partying and having fun with friends? This is supposed to be the time of my life and Im missing it? 
• Why aren’t I getting a degree for validity, security, etc.? 


Or,
Should I go back to college? 
—
And here’s what goes through the negative part of my head when I think about this option:

• why would I go back to college? College is a scam and provides no real educational value that i couldn’t get from real experiences and reading books with my genuine interest in business etc. 
• what if i go back and just get depressed again? After all my gpa is already shot and credit count is abysmal. 
• why would i go back and live in that place? I can just go up and party on the weekends when I want to. 

Overall I just don’t know what to do. I think I’m set on one choice and the negative thoughts rush in. Then it’s the same for vice versa. 

I also have this strange guilty feeling for not being in college, doing the thing everyone else is doing, and really getting that college experience. (I already do have some college experience since I’ve been going, but for some strange reason I feel some type of guilt for not truly getting the real college experience, I guess because I didn’t make that many new friends, I usually hung around the kids I already knew before college) 

I just wish I could stop harping on all the negatives and just fucking pick something. I’m trapped and stuck and for some reason I feel guilty for literally no reason. I’m 20. This is supposed to be the best time of my life and I feel like I’m wasting it, even though I’ve had so many great times and experiences already. 

I just want to live a great life full of great experiences. I don’t want to look back and regret anything, and I don’t want to miss any great experiences. 

I think (and hope) that once I get truly invested in something that all these negative thoughts and feelings and guilt will disappear and I will feel fulfilled. However the problem is that it feels impossible for me to get to a place like that. 

If someone could just give me some type of advice or point me in some general direction that’d be great. I’m so stuck and so frustrated. 

The end-all date for college is November first for me to pick my classes for the spring if I want to go back on academic recovery. ",18Oct2018,1

Idk what to do, there must be something wrong with my perception of work and free time or something, but wtf is up with me.

445,"So this is probably going to be a longer story, but hear me out.

I'm 18 now. I'm a gamer, but my grades are fine and are not going to drop off anytime soon. I love gaming, it's a passion of mine, and I spend a significant portion of my day infront of my screen (probably 5-7 hours average, honesty hurts. damn.). I however don't feel addicted. My circle of friends isn't that big, but I go to a friend's party from time to time and I game with a lot of them together, I also spend most of my break time in school with my 2 closest friends. I also just spent 1 week off my PC on holidays and didn't ever wish that I could sit in front of the computer that time. I was however really excited to sit on my gaming desk again :).
If you can motivate me, being far away from my PC isn't a problem. And that's going to be my general theme for my question; motivation. 

Specifically, the motivation to change. For a long time now, things like self-organization and order aren't my strength. Given my recent personality changes and the changes in the way i think, I have now the desire to change those things (reorganizing my room, proper usage of a calendar among others). However, in day-to-day life, I never find motivation to actually think about that, instead, I life my passion and spend the time I should be productive and creative on gaming. 
Adding to that, my parents (with whom I've had many talks about this subject, they are very open and helping people) have told me that, whenever I was productive before gaming, when I really did something that day, everything was fine. If I did not however, it seemed to change my personality for worse, I was getting more angry and annoyed at them, I didn't meet mutual agreements i would normally meet without question. 
I even notice this effect myself. I get annoyed ingame MUCH earlier, with myself and with others.

Now the juicy part: I tried to change myself already, starting a calendar, tried working out more. It never lasts more than a week before i lose track of those things and stop. I never seem to find the motivation after the school in the best time of the day to to the things i want to do, so I can have a gaming session in the evening that not only feels better, but also feels like I'm playing much more then the clock actually tells me. 

Like I said, I've had a METRIC BOATLOAD of talks with my parents, I've told them this problem for a while and we tried lots of things. I I however feel that advice from them doesn't work anymore, it feels like it doesn't touch the problem I feel like lies below the surface. and to be frank, those 2 close friends I have are not the ones that would know better as well. 

I need advice from some other source, so Im asking you, Reddit. What do you think is my problem and what advice would you give me?

TL;DR: an 18 year old wants to change himself for the better, but doesn't find the day-to-day motivation for it. (this info is not sufficient for tackling the actual problem, mind you)

446,"For the nerds: the old version of the software was Java based, but is losing all tech support come December 31st. The new, mandatory upgrade software is web based and, as a result, is significantly slower. We were told it would be about a 20% degrease in speed. Okay, fine.

But this simply isn’t the case. It’s substantially slower. I did some test timings yesterday and it’s actually 300% slower than the previous program.

My frustration is that the program didn’t change. It got a new look, but it is still structurally exactly the same.

So, I haven’t been using it. They wanted us all to “get comfortable with it” but it’s literally the same thing. So instead of spending every day with my thumb in my ass waiting for the new program to load, I have been extremely defiant and said I won’t switch over until I am literally forced to.

I’m usually not stubborn/opposed to change. Typically I welcome it. But I think it’s absolutely absurd that we are being forced to decrease our efficiency and no one is doing a damned thing to fix it.

Today, I was confronted about my lack of usage of the new software by my boss and will be having a meeting tomorrow, but it sounds like it will be less “tell me why you’re frustrated” and more “use the program or you’re done.”

Is there something else I should do instead, whether it be more or less direct? Should I take the time to guague if she's interested in me? If you want to know more info, please ask.

**I'd appreciate advice regarding my questions, I already understand the risks with what I'm doing, etc**

453,"20M here. Throwaway of course, but I never make posts on reddit (is anxiety applicable for discussion on internet??) so bare with me if I make mistakes. 

So the other night, this girl I’ll call B  invited me to come hangout with her and 4 other guys that I’ve associated with, one being an actual friend. I’ll call him L. 

I met B at L’s house some months back. She was interested in me and got my number and I ended up staying the night at her apartment the next 2 nights. Following this, L decided to quit speaking to me.  

Anyways, I had been drinking already, and took an Uber to her apartment. I brought my backpack with me, which is actually my gym bag. I had some nice J’s in them, (a gift from my dad) and didn’t take them out (later a mistake) shoved my bottle of vodka in their, and a bottle of Apple Juice. 

Now, after I got dropped off by my Uber, I remember walking, and trying to find her apartment # and I couldn’t because my sense of direction was poor due to me being intoxicated. This was around 1:45 AM. I ended up finding her apartment, and right when I walked in was the last thing I remembered. I blacked out (I was on my 6th or 7th mixed drink, and probably had a little under half my bottle left) 

The very next thing I remember was being on the couch and I came back to life to B telling me to “get the fuck out”. I was completely confused, I had no idea what had happened. And I especially have no idea what I did to upset her. L ended up getting me in his car, my first interaction with him in at least 2 months, and took me home. I don’t remember talking to him, or the car ride home, but I remember just little flashes of it. Like a fading scene here and there. 

We got to my house and I remember standing in front of my house and talking to him. I had a quarter of my bottle left at this point (B stole my J’s, apple juice, and some other minuscule items in my bag while I was blacked out, how I had my bottle was a miracle I don’t remember) I do remember drinking straight out the bottle at this point, lord knows I didn’t need it, 

Now, at this point, L started telling me how he quit talking to me because of his feelings towards me. He’s bi, and I’m straight. He hinted at wanting me earlier in our friendship, but I made it crystal clear that I’m straight and not interested.

After drinking more, I was clearly not in the right state of mind for any of the following to happen. At this point, it’s still like faded scenes. He was hugging me telling me how good looking he thought I was, and put his hand down my pants and grabbed my penis and started the motion. He said he wanted to give me head, and I said sure, let him in my house and we went to my room. 

From here on out, I don’t remember anything except having whiskey dick, and looking down at him at some point, which is fucking engraved in my head now. That’s it. Next thing I remember was waking up again, and he was asleep down by my legs and I woke him up and walked him out then went back to sleep. 

After waking up hours later, I felt complete and total regret for ever leaving the house and all the events that followed. I would have never allowed him to do that while sober, and I kinda feel like he took advantage of me, especially with him moving out of state the very next day.  

This has constantly been on my mind, and I feel like a piece of me is now gone. I can’t explain it, it all might sound stupid. I’ve never been in this predicament before. I can’t tell anyone this. My appetite has been gone, and I have been very short tempered because I feel what I can just describe as a dark, and dull feeling. I have felt very depressed since this night. 

A truthfully honest question I have is, was this my fault? And by that I mean, I let him in my house. And I didn’t try to stop him. Do you think he knowingly took advantage of me? And what can I do to deal with this? If you read this, thank you!",18Oct2018,1
454,"This has already been reported to the police once the incident happened. I just need a matter of opinion from a stranger, on what is best to do at this point as time has passed, as now it is an awkward situation within my group of friends.  

About me: 18 years of age and I’m from Scotland. I have passed my driving test in February of 2018

This incident happened in June of this year. To put the situation into a summary. My former friend was at my friends house in his car on the road that only has enough room for one car. There was 5 of my friends there excluding him. I had arrived late to the house so to get down the road the only way to get passed was to go into my friends drive way but my he and my friend were blocking the drive with their cars and were signalling to reverse my car down the long straight road.

I proceeded to reverse down the road as they made me do (but could of let me into the drive and completely avoided this entire situation) but I made it into a joke taking my time and reversing slowly up the road. I had a smile on my face because I thought it was funny but he seemed not too happy about it but I shrugged it off and didn’t take it too seriously. 

Anyway to the important part. After some time of trying to have a laugh I got to the corner of the road  where there was a farm with a road that I could turn into. I reversed my car into the road but went back into the road to straighten up my car. I looked at him and he didn’t seem to happy he then crawled his car closer to mine, I just stared thinking he was getting too close to my car. 

Out of complete shock he then just rammed into the front side of my car. I jumped out of the car confused and angry, the car rolled forward as I didn’t put the hand brake on I then shouted something like “what the f*ck have you done to my car”. He got out with a red face and then stared to hit me I was in shock and not prepared but I started to hit back in self defence. My friend got out of the car behind him and pulled him off of me. I had marks on my neck from what I can remember and was crying as I looked at what he had done to me and my car. 

All my friends in my friend group like me and him and they continue to be friends with him which is what makes it awkward. I haven’t forgiven him for what he has done to me and nor have I had an apology from him. He paid the damage what he did to my car which was around £900. 

I just need an opinion on what to do my options I would say are to: 

• Ask for an apology and forgive him.
• Still not talk to him and continue to have an awkward friend group where me and him don’t speak but everyone else speaks to one another. 
• Leave the friend group that I have had since s4 in academy and move on. 

The police came to my house on the day it happened. I didnt press charges, I just wanted the damage paid. The police got back to me 3 whole months after to say that they would give him a warning. 

Thanks for the help. :) ",18Oct2018,1

I'm currently having a tough time with school, I'm a finance major at the moment my first two semesters i did really good had a 3.6 gpa. The problem was the school was in the the middle of nowhere and I was miserable I probably went weeks at a time without talking to someone and it was expensive. I switched schools to the one i'm at now and I'm just doing terrible i'm back home and commuting so i'm saving money but my first semester there I just stopped showing up and it dropped my gpa to a 2.7 and got academic probation. I skipped a semester and I'm in school now and I'm basically falling every class. I'm planning on dropping out tomorrow so I wont get kicked out but i'm wondering if I should just give up I'm basically 3 semesters behind. I think if i switched majors it would help because I don't really want to be in Finance, the only reason I chose that major was because I wanted to join the DEA and that was one of the majors they looked for but that's obviously impossible join now. I Just don't know what would be possible to do without school I wanted to do business administration or just something less math focused but I don't think I could get a job with that. My question is should I just quit school or try and with majors and see if that helps.

I am a 24 year old female who went back to school after a six month break. I have achieved many things in those six months. I got a certificate in customer service, security guard card, and a peer support specialist certificate. I have intern at an employment office for a month and intern at a homeless youth shelter for three months. Also, my mental health was getting a bit better.

I went back to school thinking I knew what I was gonna be. I thought I was gonna be a social worker or someone who would fight for justice. But after my internship with the homeless youth shelter, I have decided to not go down that road. Documentation, confrontation, and all that jazz was not I signed up for. I'm a people person but I enjoy people in short bursts which works for someone who has social anxiety.

After being on medication for awhile, I have realized that I'm passionate about everything. I love science, math, animals, any form of artistic expression, reading about international issues, languages, cultures, etc. I can't focus on one thing cause I love all the things equally.

Now, my issue is that I'm in school lost in a sea of confusion and thoughts. I'm barely attending my classes and seem to be losing focus. I start work soon in retail and I'm gonna start therapy to address my anxiety and my many mental illnesses. I have been thinking of dropping out of college again to focus on myself and other things but I'm not sure. It's gonna be a tough decision since you need a degree for almost everything. But I don't want to stay in school if I'm just as confused as I was before.

It’s affecting schoolwork now too- I keep doing homework literal minutes before it’s due because I didn’t have the motivation to do it until I absolutely had to. A lot of the time I just don’t do it at all and make up some bullshit excuse.

Okay so background: I am a 21 year old female whose lived at home throughout university. Im in my last year and have a job at an accounting firm in my home town. I’ve always felt bored with my city and craved adventure as a person. Additionally, i got out of a serious 3 year relationship at the end of july. Around mid august a guy (who looks a lot like my ex but thats my type so its besides the point) who lives in a city 12 hours from me and I met. we started talking and he would always say how i needed him as a boyfriend and we should do all this cute stuff together and get married, obviously in a flirty way but i started to get attached. We talk everyday but usually not about ourselves much, its very flirty and sexty. so fast forward to now, i ask him what were doing here, he is very honest with me about how he thinks we both got carried away and since we live so far actually being together isn’t super realistic. Which is completely fair, but im not down to keep sexting so i tell him it best for us to stop talking and he’s super apologetic and nice about it.

My actual issue is this. I put in a request to transfer at my job to a new city a few days ago and i just got a call saying theres a good possibility my transfer will go through to work in his city. I want to move for me and be in a new city close to the mountains and experience living on my own for the first time in a new place. That being said, im nervous that theres a small part of me that wants to go just to see what would happen and I definitely dont want to move for a guy ever especially in this situation. Its always been a dream of mine to live in a big city, I have a career level job waiting, but it is extremely expensive to live there, and i only know a few friends and am leaving my family at home. My friends say im being very impulsive and are cautioning me about moving. I genuinely don’t know if im making the right decision. Any advice at all here is super appreciated, I know i didnt really ask much of a question lol. I am excited and scared at the same time to move and I think the reasoning is because it will be my first time being totally independent, but dont know if its also cause im afraid it still might not work out.

I would like to be able to afford some cosmetic procedures to remove the hollowness and spider veins I have around my eyes and temples (I look like a freakin Tim Burton character ya'll), but that would be several thousands of dollars. That being said, I've heard that you can earn really good money as a stripper here in Atlanta.

Now here's the conflict -
I live with my boyfriend and work with him full-time operating his family's business. Now money's tight in the company, so there's no possibility of getting a raise. 
I've casually mentioned my consideration of becoming a stripper and he really didn't like it. He said I was ""annoying him and acting like a whore,"" to which I say ouch, but understood. I don't want him to feel like the guy with the whore girlfriend who grinds on and flirts with other guys for money. But I really need to fix what's going on with my face, you guys. 

Ever since I was a kid, I've felt afraid of my face. It's terrifying - extremely deep set eyes with a web of dark purple and blue veins orbiting them, Its just awful... Especially because I'm really pretty besides that! I spend almost hour every day doing my makeup just to cover up my issue, so I can go outside and not get looked at like I'm severely ill or on crack or something. I have to wake up over an hour before going into work (I start work at 7 am), and that time is really starting to add up and make me cranky. Also, I'm 21 now and I would like to feel like I can be naturally beautiful before I start aging...

Anyways, he understandably doesn't want me stripping. I have considered other jobs, such as waiting, but I work a physical full-time job and honestly don't have very much energy to work another 5 hr shift at a restaurant a couple nights a week, for less than a third of the money I would earn stripping. I've heard strippers have incredibly flexible schedules and oftentimes have the option to just go in whenever they want. Honestly, it just sounds like a good way to make a lot of money in not very much time.

So.. I'm torn, you guys. I really want to be able to make this money for the procedures and to invest it in the market, but I don't want to lose my boyfriend's respect and I don't want him to feel like I'm not loyal to him, or any less loved. I guess I would just like some advice weighing out my options, hearing people's opinions, and maybe seeing if there's a way I can explain this to the bf so he doesn't feel like he's losing me.

If anyone has experience stripping and could answer these questions it would be incredibly appreciated! 
1. Is the money really that great? What are your average nightly earnings as a stripper in ATL? (also if you don't mind, which club?)
2. How much physical contact is there (I'd much rather not to have to grind on guys. I also don't want them kissing me or touching my genitals.)
3. What are the hardest parts of the job and how do they affect you emotionally?
4. Are you in a relationship? How does your partner feel about it? Did you start stripping before or after you began the relationship?

Thank you all for your time and input!!",18Oct2018,1

473,"I am a student (24f) still living at my parents. They are both heavy smokers and have been long before I was born. Few years ago I (finally) realised how bad cigarette smoke in our house is affecting me and I have been avoiding it ever since. Im really trying hard, which unfortunately includes spending very limited time with them. Anytime I bring up that I dont like them smoking around me or something similar they get sooo annoyed. Almost childish, rolling their eyes and saying just shut up already and all. 



I know this is new for them, I have been living in this since I was born, it has been even worse when I was a child, because we lived in a smaller flat where mom and dad smoked in our kitchen/living room (it was a big room for both purposes). I was ""okay"" with this, because I didnt know better. 



The first thing you might say is that I am old enough to move out to my own appartment, and I know this. But I want to finish college first and it is impossible to support myself while doing that. I study biology and my college has up to 35 hours of classes per week (many of those are mandatory), which takes almost as much time as a full time job. And that doesnt include studying, field work and assignments.



This is why I decided to stay home (just 2 more years). If I moved out they would not support me.

I tried to ask them (nicely) to just close the door in the two rooms whenever they smoke (it would still smell, but less) but that is just something they wont do. They act like teenagers when I ask them (rolling eyes and say how I should just stop being line that) or yell at me or just do nothing. Usually they close the door but it only lasts until someone leaves/enters the room. At that point my request is long forgoten and door stays open.



Are there any other solutions I could use? Like masks to wear, special air purifiers that would make air safe to breathe? Just anything. I cant even go to the kitchen or to the front door without inhaling cigarette smoke (or holding my breath).

I bought some pringles at my schools shop and waited for dismissal time to wait for her to come to me. Now this plan was totally dependent on whether or not she would come and sit next to me. Some time passed and I thought she was not gonna show up, so I started eating the pringles instead. Halfway into the can she shows up out of nowhere and sits next to me, almost choked on a chip btw. I have prepared for this moment and decided not to punk out, soo I then offered her some chips.

&amp;#x200B;

As we ate we talked a lot about random stuff until finally it came down to me asking her for her number, which she did \^\_\^ . We talked a bit on the phone but that is about it, now I want to ask her out to the movies on the weekend but I am worried about something. We are both 18 and I am really worried about how exactly we are gonna meet up, I don't have a car and neither does she. I really don't want to look like a loser in front of her by having me or her parents drive us there. Perhaps get a friend to get us there?",18Oct2018,1
477,"I told the guidance counselor at school that i was receiving dick pics from my guy friend, and they held a meeting with his parents, the principal, a police officer, and it ended with him leaving the school crying so hard he was hiccuping. Even though  he was a good friend of mine, i couldn’t let him continue sending me these pictures ( which he claimed were a mistake even though he sent them 8 times on 3 different occasions)  because we’re under 16 and it wasn’t legal. This happened yesterday, and the pictures started on Friday. Of course, since Friday he had been telling me not to tell anyone. But i did anyways. 
I feel incredibly guilty about it, even though everyone keeps telling me i did the right thing. He was a good friend of mine. He supported me through everything i went through and i supported him. 

But then he started changing sometime in May and became a closeted pervert, involving himself in risky sexual situations and sending pictures to multiple people, including me. I was the only one that told someone about it. 

I’m glad he was able to learn his lesson and not get detention or suspension, but his phone is taken away and, according to the people who were at the parent meeting with him yesterday, his parents were mad at him and he was absolutely humiliated (hence the crying).  
Only a few people at school know about this, and they were told by the principal to not let it get out and to keep it secret. So i guess it’s good that this won’t ruin his reputation. 

I saw him at school today. I ran into him (quite literally) between classes and he didn’t say sorry or anything, just ran away. 

I can tell he’s embarrassed and angry at me. And i feel horrible because he’s feeling that way. Even though he did it to himself. 

I want to apologize to him, to become friends with him again, because hopefully he’s learned his lesson. 

But i don’t know for sure that he’s changed. And he’s probably furious at me, and would never want to talk to me again. But i miss him so much. I want things to be the way they used to be. 

What should i do? Should i apologize and hope we become friends again, or should i just leave him alone and never forgive him?

482,"Plain an simple: My mom doesn't know how to drink. When she is sober, she's one of the most wonderful people I've ever seen. When she's drunk she's probably the worst human being I've ever met. 

Everytime she gets drunk she acts violently, doesn't take criticism from no one, get manipulative and complacent, cuss like a fucking drunk sailor and refuses to cooperate in any shape or form. And everytime she drinks she ALWAYS, **ALWAYS** look for a fight with someone from the family. And the worst part is that she mix it with her sleeping meds, so in the end she never sleeps and end up acting like a walking zombie the whole night cussing, breaking stuff and fighting with my dad, using the worst possible offensive words possible. She becomes a monster

We tried SO MANY times to get her to stop drinking or to just drink moderately, and everytime she agreed to do it... only to go back to her old ways and everytime starting over again. My dad almost got a divorce because of this. She cried and begged him to come back (and he did). She promised she would never drink... Guess what happened in the week after this fight? Yup, she drank and caused trouble again

Now, I know she has her reasons to do it. She lost her parents way too soon and had a terrible childhood. But that doesn't give a person an excuse to get wasted like Haddock and start saying profanity thinking that she has a pass just because she had a bad life. Having a bad life doesn't mean that you get to be an asshole to your family. And the worst part? She always come up with the fucking excuse of ""I was drunk! people do that when they are drunk!"". NO FUCKING SHIT, THAT'S THE PROBLEM IN THE FIRST PLACE!

I want to help her. I really do. But I can't do it if SHE does not want to change. She's one of those people that complain about the problems instead of solving them. This has been happening so many times, so many fucking times that I wonder how my dad is still married to her. This needs to stop.

486," So my friend, I'll call him ""Dave"" met this girl online through a video game who I'll call ""Mina"".

They started going out after spending some time together and Dave got really attached to her. He has depression and anxiety and a bunch of shit in his life and so does Mina apparently. So they bonded and she was kind of like the one thing holding him together (I keep telling him we're here for him but we can't be there for him like a girlfriend can).

Then one day Mina sends Dave a pic of her neck with two red bruises on it (that obviously looked like hickeys) and claims that these 4 girls at school ganged up on her, choked her, and she almost died. Saying that they were also starting rumors about her being a slut and stuff.

Dave didn't believe her, he knew they were hickeys right away and told me about the whole situation and he became really depressed, sending me heartbroken songs, and told me that even if she was cheating on him he'd still stay with her because he's ""scared of being alone"".

To be honest I started getting really pissed at her because of this but I didn't interfere, I waited for him to confront her about it and he gets back to me today and now the situation has become a 180 for him.

Mina told Dave that the hickeys were because a guy at school has been taking advantage of her and she freezes up when it happens and can't move. She's also claimed to Dave that she's been pressured in the past to send nudes to this dude.

And so Dave calls me up and tells me the news, obviously believing this girl and feeling sorry for her. But I just don't believe yet. I mean let's be real. She's claiming that a high school boy took advantage of a girl IN SCHOOL, where people walk around. And even if they went somewhere secluded WHY DID SHE FOLLOW HIM? Not to mention why LIE and make up a fake story to Dave? Even if she was ""too scared to admit the truth to him"" then she had all reason not to say anything to him at all, and certainly not send a pic of her neck.

However Dave is convinced that was just a ""cry for help"". And he says he has no choice but to believe her. He's also showed me messages of their conversations and honestly it sounds like she doesn't like him anymore. Saying things like ""Are we always gonna be like this? Telling each other about our problems then going silent because we're too moody afterwards?""

I feel like she's a pathological liar or some thing. I don't know what to do or how I can help him. He has really bad depressive episodes and I'm scared that if something goes more wrong with this girl she'll break him. He said he stopped eating for 2 days when he thought she cheated.

    So, a few times I saw some cigarettes in our backyard, and I never could see my mom as someone who would smoke so I just assumed it was the people who used to live in this house (moved here 2 months ago). 

     Then, I was looking for something and saw a pack of cigarettes. Normally I would only think, “oh my god, my mom smokes.” But right now, she lost her job recently due to a downsizing and says things like “I think I have ptsd” or “I think I’m depressed” and sometimes she just seems down. 

     So now, I’m thinking that maybe smoking is just the start of something worse. I really have no idea what to do or if I’m making too big of a deal. But my mom is such an amazing person, she does a lot of community work and really cares for us but she’s not been having a good month.

     Im just wondering if I should throw them away and pretend like I never even knew they existed. I really don’t want to talk to her about it, I mean I could I just don’t think it’ll go well. I’m just really conflicted right now, am I completely overreacting? Advice please?

I have aspergers and find it really difficult to become good friends with most people, but this guy I have really connected with and he loves me as a brother too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Problem is, I will regularly get jealous if he invites someone else somewhere first. If we are going out in a group, I will ask to be there first so I don't feel like I am joining onto a group. I get frustrated that he gives others so much more time than me and I will take him up and complain for ages about silly little things. He genuinely looks at me like a brother, as do I with him, and we are best friends (he has confirmed this to me plenty of times), and we help each other out with a lot. He never complains about my behaviour although I know he wants to but doesn't want to annoy me further. This isn't healthy for either of us and it's not fair on him but it's hard to just flick a switch and stop being so jealous and anxious about someone taking over me.

Don't want this to ruin the friendship. How can I make this stop?*


Hello Ladies and Gentleman, I feel like it's time for my first ever post on reddit.

The one I'm describing as my best friend is a fellow student of mine. We got to know each other 7 months ago, since then we've been constantly texting and always seeing each other in and outside of university. We've quickly grown relatively close over the last few months.

I immediately noticed that he was an interesting and fun guy that had the ability to fascinate me with his words and behaviour. This practically never happens with other people I meet (the only exception was my ex-bf). He's intelligent, loyal, can be really sweet and is also quite attractive. And he knows that. I like the way he speaks, gesticulates, moves, even smells.

Over the last weeks, I've caught myself thinking about him very much, also imagining being close to him, physically and psychologically. (I should admit that we've already cuddled twice on MDMA, which was probably not the smartest move because of the bonding, at least on my part. I'm thinking back at it a lot and feeding from the memories.)
I know fantasizing is not a good thing to do when I want to keep a stable, platonic friendship with him but it just comes so naturally to me. Now I sometimes suddenly desire to hug him when he's standing in front of me or wish for him to just embrace me and make me feel loved.

Yesterday we went to some party on the campus together with another fellow student that he's friends with. I contrast to me, my best friend is quite sociable, also had a few beers, cheerily walked around and talked with some people while I was standing alone with his friend mostly. And I found myself looking for him all the time from the other side of the room and even getting a little jealous whenever a pretty girl approached and talked to him, wishing he'd rather talk to me. His ex-gf was also there and it was uncomfortable for me to become aware how he fell for her but has no interest in me (which he kind of told me and his behaviour is in line with that, also he's 8,5 years older than me and I'm probably not mature enough for him).

I know, those are bad signs, the realization hurt me and this needs to stop before it's getting worse and potentially ruin the friendship we have. He could find a new girlfriend anytime and I would just have to deal with it. I'm feeling kind of silly and emotional, like a whiny, little, naive girl, especially because I know rationally, that even if he *was* interested in me romantically, a relationship with him wouldn't work out.

I've been in one relationship and hooked up with two other guys so far but I would say I've never really been in love. There was a lot of uncertainty, anxiety, no real honeymoon phase and so on. Don't know yet if I'm even the type for being head over heels. My mom would always tell me, if you're in love, you'll just know.

I wouldn't say that I've already fallen in love with my best friend, nor am I sure that I definitely will. But I might be on the path to it and I'm afraid.
I care about him very much. I notice that his moods and opinions directly get through me and affect mine. His words can heal or strike and hurt me. He's the person I'm wanting to spend time with the most, especially since my female best friend moved away. I'm growing fonder on him and from the start he has evoked these positive and exciting feelings in me that I recognize from my first boyfriend, even though they might not be intense enough to be called love.

I feel like I don't have any other choice but to be alone here but the anxiety and depression are eating at me. 8 months ago I was far from this point I had my life on track.

I'm a needy person, because I want to feel desired/loved, because I don't feel that from anyone and very alone. 

I want to not be needy, so I try to put up emotional walls, but then find myself even more alone.

When I feel alone I feel more depressed and anxious.

We couldn't talk too much about depression in class and I also just wanted to talk to him outside of school, so I added him on Snapchat. It started out fine but later on he gave minimal responses when I wanted to talk and usually ghosted me half the time, which I was usually mad about even though he has ADHD.

I have anxiety so I have a hard time asking anyone to hang out, since I was afraid of rejection. He said if they where my friend, they'd say yes. At the end of the school year, I asked him, he said no. 

He does have some of the problems I have and didn't hang out with anyone outside his neighborhood at the time, so I tried to understand. I tried to keep in touch, but he barely responded to Snapchat and he refused to voice chat since he didn't like it.

It felt like he gave his other friends better treatment over me. I eventually just got so frustrated and upset that I decided to tell him go fuck yourself with a huge wall of text that I kept adding to until he opened it, and he said he thought of me as a friend until then. I tried to apologise after that but he said it was over.

I did send him something before summer ended saying I don't want to be on bad terms with him and the only thing he said was ""idc anymore."" 

He's in my first class everyday now, a drama class, and we haven't talked since. I avoid him and it's obvious I avoid him. I have anxiety about him and I'm afraid of talking to him. I said hi once but he sounded upset when he said hi back.

I feel alone and isolated in my first period and when I see him talking to his friends he seems legitimately happy without me and I feel like I'd be bringing him down by talking to him agian but I'm misrable being alone. Everyone in that class I feel like I'd like is in his circle and its hard to talk to them since he's around them a lot and they even hang out after school. 

If I did try to talk to him again idk if it should be in class or on Snapchat. Should I try to talk to him again or should I leave him alone?

I know I can switch therapists and stuff but my anxiety is really high and I don't want to make my therapist feel bad. Plus there's a chance that I might see them if I'll still be going to the same hospital and I can't deal with that awkwardness. 

Lots of people have been working hard to get me this therapy and they are telling me to go through with it because I've waited such a long time, but my gut feeling isn't agreeing. I'm extremely torn at this point and I don't know what to do. I still have major anxiety problems and my depression has calmed down a little after seeing a school counselor, but I still don't really want to go to therapy. My dad was really against the idea of me talking to a therapist and so I feel like if I tell him I don't wanna go anymore, he'll pull all the ""I told you so""s on me and I can't deal with his opinions. Should I just cancel or should I keep going to my appointments? I really don't know anymore.",18Oct2018,1

507,"Hi all,

So for some background, I am a high school senior and I have two friends that I have been really close with since freshman year. This year we are all seniors and we all were able to get off-campus passes for lunch. So for the past 2 or so months that school has been in session for me, I've drove us somewhere off campus for lunch almost everyday. 

&amp;#x200B;

One friend in particular, let's call her Ashley, takes the school bus home everyday because she doesn't drive and her parents are at work when we get out of school. Ashley HATES taking the school bus. She complains it's hot when she walks home from the bus stop and that she doesn't like her bus driver. We joined Key Club, and there is a meeting every Tuesday after school. Well Ashley can't go to these meetings because the buses leave soon after school ends, so I told her I would take her home after the meetings every week. Her house is the complete opposite direction of home for me, so when I take her home I'm driving like triple the distance that I normally would if I just went home. Gas is expensive, so my dad told me that if I'm going to do that then maybe I could ask Ashley to buy me lunch once a week in exchange (lunch is usually around $5 or less). So just keep in mind that I already take her home at least once a week, every Tuesday.

&amp;#x200B;

We have a quiz in one of our classes tomorrow, so Ashley asked me yesterday if I wanted to study after school for the quiz with her. This is pretty common: I drive us somewhere to study after school (some cafe usually) and then after studying I drop her off at home, then drive myself home. Well today is the day we were supposed to study after school, but I was feeling really tired and we reviewed the quiz content and it seemed pretty easy so I didn't think that the study session was necessary. I told Ashley that and she said some kinda passive aggressive things like ""why did I predict I was just gonna go home today"" and ""I wish it was cloudy today"" because she doesn't like taking the bus/walking home. I have cancelled on her maybe twice before this, months ago though, but it wasn't like she had no ride because she takes the bus anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

I texted her when I got home and said ""I'm sorry I feel bad but I have a lot to do today and studying together is useful but I feel like we also waste a lot of time which isn't necessarily bad but I have a lot to do today and I'm pretty tired. I don't mind taking us to ""X"" cafe by our school but sometimes it kinda sucks because then I have to go home twice as far and I already drove us for lunch everyday this week."" 

&amp;#x200B;

She hasn't responded to my text message even though my other close friend said that she's definitely on her phone and she just sent my other friend a snapchat. I feel kind of angry, like she sees me as some kind of Uber that drives to lunch and then drives her home a few times a week. I don't know. When I don't feel like driving off campus for lunch, we all chill in the library and do homework or chat, but she says she hates being the library and the people in there make her uncomfortable. The few days that I didn't want to drive for lunch and stayed in the library, she complained that she was really hungry and made me feel bad about it. Basically, she expects me to drive us somewhere for lunch everyday. Which I don't want to, because most of the time that includes spending money (which adds up quickly per week) and also uses a lot of gas. Any advice would be welcome.",18Oct2018,1

I’m very open about my sexuality to people who ask or if it suits the situation for me to say about it, but that is with people my age mainly. 

The thing is I want to tell my family just to get it out of the way as it is unlikely that it will be brought up in any way in my house (more on this later). It will just avoid anything later like the question suddenly being sprung on me.

In my family, we don’t talk about relationships or sexuality. It’s just not the sort of thing my family talks about. I want to know how to bring this sort of thing up without it being sudden to them. I know they won’t be very negative as they aren’t at all homophobic or anything but it’ll just be good to find a good way to tell them. I’ve thought about just waiting and seeing if I ever get a boyfriend and tell them then but I feel as if it might get back to them in another before then.

Thanks.

I don't know if she likes me as well but she has said stuff that gives me hints like she asked me my star sign and said ""our signs are 100% compatible"" then I started laughing and was like ""ok"" cause I was a bit surprised she said that. she then said ""oh um as friends tho"" cause I think she was embarrassed. Also one of my friends asked her what do you want in your perfect guy and just listed off a bunch of features I have. Lastly, she started asking our friend group questions of what they would do in a certain relationship situation and after I said my answer she said I would be the ""perfect boyfriend and my girl would be lucky.""

513,"So this is a difficult one... I really am desperate for help. So I would appreciate it, if you can give me your neutral opinion on this matter. Please help me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 21/M, I'm a student and english is not my mother tongue (for the grammar nazis out there). Long story short: My father was a gambling, painkiller taking, alcoholic ""sociopath"" (I see him as one, because he uses a lot of people for his own gain... he lies a lot so he seems smart and educated, even tho he has no clue about it. I don't know if he really is one, because I'm not a psychologist... but you know what I mean). Of course he is/ was depressive.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of him and his constant rants about me (when he was drunk) and how much of a drag I was ( ""you're a disappointment to the family"",""you shouldn't be alive"", etc.) - which btw. did go on several years, every week or so - I got into a depressive state as well. When I was 15 my mom and dad got a divorce, after he faked? committing suicide (We still don't know if he really meant it... He just left, did go into a hotel, wrote a ""last note"" and then drove into a bar and drank until the police picked him up... He doesn't have a driving license anymore, because they caught him 4 times already drunk in the car. He's also the guy to fake something like that, he always tries to show how bad his life is and how bad we are, etc.) . With 17 I got into a mental hospital because I nearly killed myself. He really changed me... I'm still struggling with self loathing and self respect. In the mental hospital I told him, that I never want to see him again.

&amp;#x200B;

So in the past 4 years I visited him like 2 times with my mom and only messaged him for his birthday or holidays.

&amp;#x200B;

Today he called me (2h long conversation). He told me he changed, that he lost weight, doesn't drink anymore and that he's sorry for what he's done to me. In the conversation he lied again several times. He invented stories how he and my mom met (He told me like 4 different stories about that in the past 10 years) and also facts he made up. I just can't trust him. I told him I don't want to meet him, but of course, this destroyed him.

And now I'm scared about him committing suicide or doing something else stupid. I don't want to meet him, because I hate him and what he has done to me and my sister and mother is unforgivable... I know that if I'm going to meet him I slide back into my depressive state, which means I'd drop out of uni, which is the thing I LOVE doing. I really am desperate for help.

514,"I had an exquisite post all written and then accidentally refreshed the page and lost it, so here’s the quick version:

Happily married man has new girl start at work in different department. Man and girl really hit it off due to basically being the same person in two different bodies. Man and girl have fun, witty banter and man loves her infectious smile.

Man makes aquaintances easily but has few actual friends. Man is excited about girl as a potential actual friend. Wife is cool with man hanging out with girls and doing activities because wife trusts man.

Today, girl compliments man on his beautiful eyes, humor, and nice muscles. Girl touches man on the shoulder and arms during conversation. Man wonders, “Is girl attracted to man?” Man begins to question the tingly feeling he feels when girl smiles at him. Girl later suggests going with man to her favorite restaurant.

Man is perplexed. On one hand, man would very much like girl as friend. On other hand, man does not want to risk getting into compromising position with girl, because man loves wife very much.

Man is perplexed as to next steps. Man posts to reddit. Man’s judgement is clearly questionable.

515,"Hello! I'm a current computer-science major in my FIRST semester and I'm questioning my choice of major. When it comes down to it, I chose comp-sci for the earning potential and possible entrepreneurial opportunities. Midway through the first course, I'm not sure if I'm cut out for this. I am doing well in the course (projected A) but I find it hard seeing myself doing 13 more computer science courses in addition to three more math classes and other requirements.

&amp;#x200B;

I've looked a bit into accounting, and it seems like work I'd want to do. The hours are more likely to be less (minus busy season) and it seems more stable. The problem is, 90% of accountants seem to regret going into accounting, and a lot regret specifically not doing CS since there are more opportunities in the field, plus way more pay (about 40k difference/year between a software engineer and an accountant). I also like the business side of the field. It would also be an easier degree to get.

&amp;#x200B;

In the same amount of time it'd take me to get a CS degree, I could get an accounting degree (with a comp sci minor!) and an accelerated masters in accounting because of the credits I came into college with. I don't want to make a $40,000/yr dollar mistake. If I crammed CS classes, I could be done in 6 semesters, but if I took 2 extra semesters I could alleviate my work load significantly and only have to take 3 classes for four out of seven remaining semesters.

I have been with my GF for the last 3 years and I want to make it clear that i'm not worried about her cheating on me or anything like that. She loves to go out with her uni friends and have a few drinks in clubs and whatnot and I would never stop her from doing that it wouldn't be fair. I never went to clubs because it wasn't my scene and she was fine with that because she would never force me to go. She would go with her girl friends and I would go to the pub with my guy friends. I never used to worry as much until last year. The first time I went to a club our friend from abroad had come over so naturally I felt obliged to go. We where in one club and I hated it. I was stressed out in that environment and had to step outside and take a walk around with another friend leaving my girlfriend in there with her friend and our friend from abroad. During the time I was gone someone spiked her drink and when I came back she was lying passed out in the gutter with her friend and the abroad friend trying to contact me. The first thing she said to me was to give her her phone because she had given it to me. She hadn't and I found out from my friend that another guy had been supporting her and talking to her until he turned up and then the other guy cleared off. Anyway long story short (there's a lot more to that story) she's was fine in the end she crashed on my couch and I sat up all night with her. She told me in the morning she drank her drink and felt strange, next she remembers going into the toilet and the next thing she remembers is a guy saying he was her boyfriend and she was going with him. This freaked me out to the point of I will now religiously get the last train home on a night out in a large town. I can't go to clubs and the sheer thought of it makes me panic (sorry if that sounds pathetic). She avoided them for a couple of months but soon went back out although I made her promise me that she wouldn't go back to the same club.  She still hasn't over a year later but every time I go out I worry non-stop. I don't know if I trust her uni friends. Am I being judgemental? I've never properly met them. Should I meet them? Would that help? Whenever I can I drive her there and back but I feel like I restrict her then and I can't always do this if she goes out midweek because I have work in the morning. I go over every scenario in my head and ring and hope she says she's having a bad time and wants to come home because I'd pick her up. Does that make me a bad person? She says I sound angry on the phone but I just get so panicked that I can't control it. I don't sleep I just think what if something happens and i'm not there? What if the people she's with leave her there? What if someone steals her phone again and she can't get in touch? 

To get more to the point of the advice required I need help to stop worrying so much about it. I hate being a buzzkill for her. Can anyone help?

Should      I also try to shoplift from a Target? Could possibly do $20,000  with    the help of my friends (who are helping me pull off this). So  far so       good, no news reports and nothing out of the normal

Also, I am terrified around almost everybody let alone her. I am finding it hard to get the courage to speak to her. I've never liked situations that involve risk, and this one proposes a lot. This is because I am constantly worried about what other people are saying for some reason even though I really don't care. Also, I'm not one for awkwardness and if she says no seeing her around school will be very very challenging for me because she's friends with my friends and therefore by extension my friend at the moment.
If I do nothing it's easier because then there's no risk and no awkwardness at all, but I really want to do something. 
I think I plan too far ahead, because every time I play out the situation in my head, I don't know what to next. I don't know if I have the ability to be able to talk to her like I really really want to do and get to know her. If we do get together I, for some reason, feel like I need to have what to do planned out in advance otherwise I will be anxious, but I really don't know what I'm doing.
Whenever I'm with her, I seem to divert the situation to anything else, despite the fact that I don't actually want to. I think maybe that I just need to build up my confidence but I'm not sure how to do that. Do I just need to 'brave-up' and just go for it?
Our school recently broke up for half term so I won't see her for a week or so. I don't know if the is the ""opportune"" time or not because on the one hand if she says no it gives me time not being at school but on the other hand if she says yes I don't know what to do after that. I don't want to seem desperate but then again I don't want to never see her if we're just starting out. Also, I don't particularly want to be asking her out not in person because I think that's lame, but I don't want to wait too long because then I'm just procrastinating and I'll never do it because I'll over evaluate it in my head and convince myself not to do it for some reason.

Long story short my 5yo was diagnosed with cancer the day we moved into a new house, previous owners were liars who left us with cockroaches in the kitchen and rats in between the floors and we had to hire a lawyer to go back on them while doing chemo.

We flew across the country for a special amputation called a rotationplasty for our son, and when we got home our family dog was mauled to death in front of our 16yo daughter who suffers with depression. She spiralled from all the stress and attempted suicide right before Christmas last year, and we were split between two hospitals trying to save both our kids lives over the holidays. During all of this, both our cars broke down and both had to be replaced, our furnace had to be replaced, we had to redo an entire one side of our roof thanks to the lying previous owners, and we just haven't had a chance to breathe.

Anyway. Our son has had his 6 month scans and they were clear, which is awesome! And our daughter was diagnosed bipolar over the summer, which maybe doesn't sound awesome, but when she spiralled again last week and got admitted to the crisis unit again, we acted and got her a place across the country in a great residential facility so she can get the help she needs. 

So that's where I need help. I haven't relaxed for at least a year and a half. There's been crisis after crisis and my husband and I are wound so tight. Like, blood pressure, anti anxiety and antidepressant meds tight.

If you read any of this, you can see that we're fucking broke. Don't get me started on the medical system, we met our deductible January 12 this year and have spent thousands out of pocket above that flying all over the country for medical needs, and on new (haha new to US) cars, furnaces, fricking omg. 

I picked the hotel I'm in because of the free breakfast, bought some ramen and bag salad (and a bottle of vodka, I have my priorities), but what the fuck do I do for two and a half days? How can I relax and go home to my boys feeling at least a little bit okay, while leaving my daughter here to work on herself? Um....I mean, what can I do with no money? In case that wasn't implied.

I say I love Yellow-
They LOOOOVE Yellow. 
Then throughout the week they'll make small comments about how beautiful yellow is. 

It started off as them just repeating statements I would make but worded a little different and it would be said as if they just thought of it. For example, let's say we were talking about birds. It would go something like this:

Me: I'm not a big fan of birds because the chirping can get annoying in the morning, but they can be pretty cool looking. 

Them: Yeah, birds can be so beautiful but sometimes they can be a little too loud with the chirping when I'm trying to sleep.

The most annoying part is that I don't know how to confront them about it since they seem pretty insecure about people liking them. 

Any help would be appreciated,
Thank You.

531,"At my school we have Chromebook carts that teachers can rent out and use for their classes. When I took a Chromebook I realized that some girl forgot to sign out and I could access all of her passwords. She used the same password for practically everything. I signed into her Instagram and was showing some of my friends who told me to sign into her Snapchat. I did and then posted funny (at the time, pretty stupid looking back) things on her story like “Getting a nose job!” and “#Proud” with a picture from her memories or her and her friend.. touching tongues? I had no idea who this girl was but I ended up logging into her parent’s Facebook Messenger and PayPal since they had the same password. I donated $1 to charity on the PayPal and sent “What’s up?” messages to random people on Messenger, thinking it was hilarious.

Well, word spread around fast that I “hacked” some girl’s Snapchat and she found out it was me and was furious. She says she’ll sue the school if they don’t expel me. I messaged her on Instagram apologizing and asking if I could call her or if we could talk about what happened and asked if I could do anything to make it up. She told me that even though I don’t know her, I messed with the “wrong one and will get it”.  I’m pretty terrified since having discipline on my record means I can’t be in any Honor Societies and will really mess up my chances at getting National Merit and getting a scholarship to a good college. 

What should I do? I think I should talk to her in person and apologize sincerely, but she has early release and I don’t know when I’d see her at school (I’ve literally never seen her before). I don’t think she could sue the school because it was her fault for leaving the account signed in, not the school. I’ve talked to some relatives who have legal professions and they say it won’t get that serious, but rich people have a big influence on my school. Another thing to note is that she does shrooms and weird drugs like that, if that somehow helps my situation. I also am writing a bill about increasing Cyber Security in Youth &amp; Government Club so I could pass it off as some kind of “social experiment” if it comes to that. 

I’m super lost and scared right now, so if you have any advice please let me know. Thanks so much!",18Oct2018,1
534,"I think most people are lazy, apathetic, and only focus on helping themselves. 

The thing that bothers me the most is they just ignore or don't pay attention to the pain in the world. They don't even try to help. 

They don't want to hear the truth on anything, and then complain that they are lied to. Like how the fuck do you even socially interact with a person that is really unaware like that? 

When I am honest with people they don't like it at all, but the alternative is to lie or to speak in half truths. I hate both of those options.

I have zero irl friends because all I can find is those kinds of people. I even try to be friends with them, but I hate every single second of the interaction. They don't talk about anything interesting, and I don't think their demeaning/mocking jokes are funny at all. Maybe it was because I was home schooled, but I don't see the point in mocking your friends all the time. 

I am an extrovert, so I can't cope with zero interaction, and I hate that, but it is true.


I understand that not all people are like this. Like I said before I think most people are like this. 

How do I stop hating most people?",18Oct2018,1
535,"I posted in r/offmychest earlier about how my sister is being what I consider “verbally abused”. I did forget to mention some stuff in my post because I was filled with tons of emotion and just needed to rant. I’ll state more facts in this post seeing as I’m in need of some clarity.  My sisters boyfriend is not a horrible man in fact he is one of the kindest people I know, this does not make him perfect though. He’s made a few decisions that don’t sit well with me but I’ve always brushed them off. He’s constantly promising us things which makes us feel like everything is going to be okay and it usually isn’t. These examples may get long but I really just need to explain the spectrum. After a huge fight him and my sister separated( not by breaking up but by him moving in with his brother a couple states away).  She still went to visit him and things seemed to be alright. After a months or so apart he informed us he was receiving tons of work and he had a job opportunity for us that payed two times what I have ever made. I was floored and couldn’t jump fast enough at the opportunity neither could my brother or sister. So we packed up and moved to find a better life. Life in fact got 10 times worse. We moved in with his brother who has two kids( he has more but they don’t live with him), and a friend of my sisters boyfriend. Durning this time tons of bad things happen and we quickly move out. Me and my brother are still working with my sisters boyfriend but we haven’t even gotten paid( if we did it would have only been very little to feed us or whatever) we are baffled at the lack of communication with pat. Turns out he was giving his brother money anytime he asked ( this equaled up to like 4K in like two weeks and he also received 6k from family for a job he was supposed to do). He owed me around 3k and I haven’t received a cent, but he payed the bills and fed us so I brushed that off. Time went by and I got fed up and found more stable work. We ignored the bad vibes of the past and grew over it. Nows where I get into the verbal abuse. Ever since he moved in with me and my sister ( which was really to help lighten the bill load, and I guess because they love each other) he has gotten pretty aggressive when drinking. Maybe not always aggressive but his emotions are definitely heightened and he’s like a ticking time bomb, you never know if or when he will burst. We tried to be cautious around him but you can’t do that all the time and eventually he burst. He begins by talking down to my sister which usually was a joke and they just messed around that way...but then he got serious. He would start yelling at her and tell her she’s stupid and that whatever she said was stupid. He would berate her and even once he was so sure she had sex with some other guy my sister wasn’t sure if she had or not but told him it would have been rape because she definitely wouldn’t have said yes. He then said you probably did something to to make him think you wanted it and blamed her for this imaginary idea he created. When they are arguing he constantly try’s to one up her and make himself seem right. My sister isn’t a peach but I don’t think it matters . This is just so wrong to me no matter how you look at it. When I used to drink a lot I had more confidence and have fought him physically a couple times, he is much stronger than me though and usually just took my beating. Him and my sister fought again last night and she was real upset about it. He had been drinking and she has been trying her best not to because it became a problem for her. She realized how he kept talking down to her and seemed to be firm about him needing to change. Well he came home and they left to go handle something and sure enough they come back as if nothing happend. I’m just at a loss, I have no idea if I’m mistreating him by giving him the cold shoulder or if I’ve been mistreated. I don’t know how to help my sister. She isn’t as strong as me and my brother, where as I can just say “fuck you” and never talk to him she cannot. She loves him and sees him for the man he can be not for the man he has changed into. I’m tired of his empty promises and I don’t know how to make my sister see what she’s putting herself through. Part of me wants them to be happy and clings to the hope that he will change one day. The other half just wants him to finally leave us the fuck alone and let us be happy. Please does anyone have guidance? ",18Oct2018,1
536,"I have a friend at work whom I considered myself pretty close with, despite some differing beliefs and values  We have shared a lot of personal information  with each other and had a strong working relationship Her 15 year old child also recently had been coming  along to work, and talking with me and we had connected on social media. The child had been struggling with public school, friends, etc.

Then one day, out of the blue, the child asks to call me and is in tears saying they came out to their parents as trans, and parents aren't accepting, and they left work trying to find a bridge to jump off of, and is hiding in a bush. 

I immediately go to the child, console them, tell them I'm there for them, and take them back to my place. After getting them settled, I text the mom and say child is with me and okay. Mom immediately demands my address and says her and husband are coming. It's just me and the child at my house, child is scared and so am I, I call crisis line, crisis line is suggesting that I call police. Parents arrive shortly before police. Father seems angry, and eventually child goes with police to Psychiatric Emergency at hospital.

Dad talks about how child is manipulative, and claims a ""demonic influence"" is affecting their child. But mom hugs me, says I need to take care of myself (I'm admittedly in poor mental health currently), and then they leave.

Mom then is not returning to work, doesn't want anyone to reach out to her. I then find out someone is talking to her, and she's apparently considering divorce, so I reach out to her and just say I care about her and child. She sends message basically saying I need to cut off all contact with child in order to continue our working relationship, that it's not my place to counsel her child. I agree.

However, child keeps contacting me via Instagram and snapchat. They are currently not living with their parents, and I know mom is devastated. I delete snapchat, but don't feel good about completely cutting off contact in case there is a crisis. I still view insta stories for signs of crisis.

I have recently been laid off work for my mental health, am also struggling with my own gender identity. I made an Instagram for alternate gender expression, and followed the child, who realized it was me, which I confirmed. However, I then deleted said Instagram. At the same time, mom has blocked me on instagram. 

I feel like I already broken both promises to both people. I don't want to damage the relationship with the mom further, but I don't agree with her not accepting her child. I don't want the child to feel I have abandoned them, as an adult they feel safe coming to in a time of crisis. They continue to message me, say they miss me, sending me memes, etc. The mom has asked me not to tell child that she asked me to cut off contact.

I feel very stuck in the middle, and don't know which is the best option. I feel like no matter what I do, I am letting someone down and permanently damaging a relationship. I don't feel good about blocking child, but they keep sending me messages and it's just a reminder of this difficulty.

There's no right thing to do, and no way to not hurt someone. What do I do? ",18Oct2018,1
537,"I totally lost it while driving in the car with my mom in the passenger seat. Im in my mid-twenties and for decades, I got used to suppressing my anger even when I could feel the rage could literally drive me to crash the car and kill us both and just had these intense, scary thoughts of just fucking destroying her and pummeling her because she pushes my buttons for hours because I just take her barrage of mental distress. I don’t mean literally kill her, but the human mind can create some very violent thoughts. I never acted them out of course.

My mom, whenever she gets upset at even the slightest thing that my dad says, like “you should try going out for a walk every night with me” (concerning losing weight), she suppresses HER tears and anger she feels towards those comments, waits until my dad leaves and when we two are alone for a drive or something, she cries and rants about it. I console her and try to stay quiet and neutral. But it ALWAYS ends up with her tears transforming into anger and somehow I am the scapegoat for her problems and she blames me for never being on her side and that I am “just like my dad.” This also happens when my brother says something unknowingly that hurt her or a stranger or her friend. She is hypersensitive to criticism.

I am a good son. They even admit it. Too good I guess, so my mom tends to cross the line with me many times because I just take it and never express my annoyance or anger. I’ve always been like this.. even as a toddler all I needed was food and sleep and I rarely, if ever, cried like other babies. I’m a natural introvert.

So every rant I just suppress my anger and in my head I’m thinking “how the fuck am I involved in this and why do I have to take this shit? Jesus Christ, when will this end?”

I completely lost it today and shouted on top of my lungs and she sensed the psychopathic rage that had been boiling for years of suppression. I did it for around 10 minutes straight until we arrived home and we haven’t spoken since.

We are generally very close and kind to each other when this kinds of things don’t happen, 
which I guess adds to the reason why I suppress her rants and turn the other cheek, because I don’t want to hurt her feelings by telling her I don’t care and she should solve them on her own. I told her this while yelling today. 

What should I do so I don’t go on these psychopathic episodes of rage? How do I set clear boundaries? I got in the habit of suppressing negative emotions so I don’t set the boundaries clear when it first happens.

Help is very appreciated.

538,"I'm currently living in a student apartments with my sister and friend (Vivian) I've known for awhile now.

Every bed space is on its own lease and won't effect anyone if one moves out. Upon move in, the apartment was dirty, carpets were stained, and it was smaller than what we expected. If ya'll aren't familiar with student apartments, they can only show you a model home before move in.

We all complained about the condition it was in. It is way overpriced for what we are getting. I told my roommate we should just rent a house because it would be way cheaper. I've been so proactive and finally found 3 subleasers. 

I don't think Vivian thought it was actually going to happen and she seems on edge and hesitant and is avoiding me. I know she doesn't want to move out and feels comfortable here, but I still want to move out. I KNOW she's going to think i'm being mean since we signed together at this current place. ",18Oct2018,1

I'd say our relationship is very strong. I don't have her in any of my classes. But, outside of school, we talk a lot. She lost a good friend over the summer. Then in succession to that, she lost her grandpa. She was in need of support over the summer, and I aided her in that.

542,"So a little bit about myself before the main idea. I moved to Canada from the middle east in 10th grade. In the middle east I had a ton of friends, however in Canada I had some friends but not very close ones. Around senior year I started becoming more and more depressed, had an appointment with a psychiatrist and have been diagnosed with depression. I had weekly meetings with him and they were great. But in senior year I began losing all of my friends. Not because of them, but from me. My depression made me wanna stay alone, we sort of just drifted away from one another. So senior year was my worst year in highschool and here came university which was gonna change everything, right? nope. in highschool i did not do any drugs, but i began part taking in them in university. i moved in residence of the university, have roomates which i do not interact with really. i began smoking weed often, tripping from shrooms and lsd. I know that those drugs are not inherently addictive, but with my depression, lonliness and bad habits of being lazy all day it made me have a dependency all the time. literally if i had to think of the best times i have had in my life, some of the times when i am high or tripping would be at the top of the list. i am spending more and more money on these drugs, even wanting to do stuff like DMT and MDMA. i am not studying gfor school, bwill porbably fail. i dont know what to do. i have tried a lot of times before and after university to become better, i would eat healthier and exercises for weeks or months on end. but the second i get the taste of just being a lazy person i go back to my old habits. idk what to do. if i am not fully productive, i will fall back to being lazy, but i dont want to live a super productive and stressfull life. idk what to do anymore.",18Oct2018,1
543,"A friend on Instagram posted that she found someone made a Facebook account and  is pretending to be her husband. The person has gone far enough as to even post pictures of their kids.  I was wondering if anyone can offer advice as to how to handle this or can lead me to a subreddit that would help with something like this. Is there any way to have the account deleted?  


This is what she posted:

""There’s a person on Facebook who has been pretending to be Omar and reposting mine, and Omar’s photos as their own. Not only that, but this person has been having conversations via FB messenger with people that Omar knows from over seas, giving them false information about upcoming shows, and saying stupid ridiculous things on their status (or whatever it’s called). Yes, we’ve tried contacting Facebook about this. No, they haven’t done a single thing. Omar and i are NOT active on Facebook. .  
.  
Omar knows a lot of people all over the world due to his many years in the rockin’ scene with his band Omar and The Stringpoppers on Wild Records. He’s also been an active barber for the past 17 years, so this guy knows A LOT of people. I’m assuming that the person behind this account feels pretty great to be “friends” with so many people, but reposting our kid’s photos and spreading false information is not cool. .  
.  
If you know anyone who has been communicating with this fake Omar Romero on FB, please let them know it’s not him. Nothing that this person has said reflects the opinions of Omar or myself. The photos of our boys that this person has been sharing are screenshots from our IG account.  
.  
.  
A couple days ago, it was brought to Omar’s attention that this person was asking for a back up band for a show in Europe. That’s simply not true. Omar does still perform a few times a year, both locally and over seas, but he would never ask for back up on Facebook. The logistics of his travels are handled privately behind the scenes. .  
.  


I know the person behind this fake account follows me on IG, because they’ve been reposting my pictures also. If you’re the person pretending to be Omar, and you’re reading this,.. F\*\*\* Y\*\* and GET A LIFE.   
Omar’s not that interesting (his words, not mine) lol. .  
.  
Lastly, I’m sorry for the long read, but if you have any tips on how we can track this person, or get this account taken down, please DM me""",18Oct2018,1
