1,"We broke up four months ago. I wanted to try to fix things, but he was smothering me and wouldn't give me space. So I said we should move on. He pretended to commit suicide then he started making bogus accusations and threatening to get revenge. He then apologies and I blocked him. He emailed me asking to make peace. I again said there's no chance of fixing it. He threatened to get revenge for not giving him a chance and said ""watch this space"". I warned him that I will report him and he said he doesn't care he's getting revenge now. Two weeks after that I unblock him on fb and see in a mutual group he posted basically that I'm a prostitute and I charge R250 an hour. Which is not true.  He did not put my name In the post but said he is thinking of doing so. He does not know I've seen the post.  Today he emailed me saying he's sorry and he would like to be friends. I did not reply since I am planning to get the order on Monday morning. I think I have to go through with the protection order (if he threatens or makes any false statements, harms me etc he will immediately be arrested). But I'm scared it will anger him and cause him to retaliate any way. He is not a rational person. ",29Jan2018,1
2,"Okay so I have been dealing with a lot of anxiety when it comes to food. Ever since I came back from a camp over the summer and lost a couple pounds my junior year of highschool weight has been my concern everyday from that time. I don't eat certain things cause I'm afraid and when my clothes feel a little tight I immediately freak out. Currently I am a freshmen in college and I am very active but I'm still so nervous. I'm walking back from the cafeteria right now and I feel so anxious in what I'm wearing I want to rip off my clothes because I'm so scared and I do not know why. Everyone says I look fine and even my doctor says I am at a healthy weight. I am 5 foot 5 and weight about 127-128 but it's not enough for me. I want to be skinnier but I don't want to do it I'm a unhealthy way. Right now I'm scared and I hate he feeling. I just needed to rant because this feeling comes and goes on it's own. Sometimes I feel like a million bucks and other days I am afraid to leave my room and I change my outfit about 10 times. When I was home I would weighh myself 3-7 times a day and without a scale I just follow my emotions and how tight I feel in my pants. 

I'm getting help with the therapist on campus and I'm making progress but now I'm slipping... I've tried for so long to fight this.

3,"I posted about this a week or two ago and received a lot of great advice, all of which I followed. The story goes that I’m a senior in high school and a guy raped and assaulted me, my friends told the school, the school kicked him out for a while, his rich family hired a lawyer, and now since the school is scared of being sued they’re letting him back. I can’t leave the school because I’m the valedictorian and otherwise very involved in the school, but I can’t be at school with this literal sociopath. Every time I see him I fear that he will murder me. Thanks to advice I got from my last post, I started the process of getting a restraining order, I consulted legal help, I told the school I will get a lawyer if they continue to subject me to this misery, I emailed every member of the school board / school district authorities, started a petition, etc. However, I am a minority woman and my rapist is a white male and my school is run by white males. Furthermore, he’s an adult and I’m still a minor. I have cited every section of the educational code that forbids the school from doing what they are about to do, but it has been fruitless. Does anybody have any further ideas besides just suing the school? This situation is terrible and has been going on for two months, and I just want it to end. Thanks! ",29Jan2018,0

9,"I’m 28 and working a “dead end” job with little interest of going to school because nothing offered here excites me. 
I have no 5 year plan and I *HATE* myself for it.

Since 2010, I’ve lived in 6 different states (not including repeated moves to the same states). Bouncing from coast to coast, unable to even commit to school because that requires a form of commitment to a certain area, or has based on my interest at the time of the move. Online school for a degree isn’t my cup of tea but I’m considering it just to get it out of the way. Decent jobs are hard to come by without a degree or education of some sort. I’ve got almost 10 years of experience in office environment work but can’t seem to find a job that pays more than $35k. 

My job now doesn’t pay all that well, doesn’t offer health insurance, and doesn’t offer much as far as growth. But! I have never enjoyed coworkers more than this bunch and the job itself is relatively easy. Never once have I sat in my car prior to going in dreading the upcoming shift. I mentioned I was considering moving and was offered a pay increase (TBD) to incentivize me to stay. But besides the crappy paying job with coworkers that I love, there’s nothing else keeping me interested in living in this area. No friends, no decent school, the general population stresses me out. 

I have an opportunity to move in with friends in a couple months (April or May) to an area I would enjoy a hell of a lot more. There are more multiple community colleges in the area which would help me narrow down on a certificate course that I have the chance of enjoying. Friends, being a homebody not by choice is getting old. The environment seems generally more pleasant. More of what I’m into. Not sure if I’m romanticizing this or what. 

Just........ I’m torn. Scared if I stay for the job I’ll continue to be a “receptionist loser”. Scared if I move to continue my pursuit to happiness it’ll go south and the move was all for naught along with the last 9 moves, scared without having a enjoyable foreseeable future that suicide will be more tempting (cause what really is there to lose when you have nothing to lose).  I’m embarrassed to be this age with nothing to show for it - sick of feeling like a loser. 

TLDR; feels like a loser, almost 30, moving every year, has opportunity to move again to possibly brighter future but love for current coworkers is making decision to move extremely difficult. ",29Jan2018,2
10,"Hello! Thanks for all advice in advance. Apologize for the long post. 

I graduated college in 2016 and has been working at my first out-of-college full-time job since. It’s an extremely small field, so extreme that basically everything I learn here will not be applicable to any other job that I will take in the future. There are only about less than a hundred business entities that are doing this type of business in the entire United States, and also because my bosses have been nothing but extremely nice to me, I would never ever betray them and work for someone else. If I’m going to leave my job, I’ll basically have to start over in another field completely.

I have an IT-related degree. So if my goal is to max out my income potential throughout my career, I really should be doing some IT-related job (business intelligence, data analysis, or actuarial science are some of the fields that I would potentially be pursuing, given what my degree and my past internship experiences are). 

My current job is not IT-related at all. I got into it by luck and by accident. I’m highly valued in my current field because I’m also fluent in another language besides English. 

In my current field, employees don’t typically get paid much (at my company we have a 30 year employee and she makes a bit less than 70k — my boss told me that), I’ll be making 70k in my third year starting 2019. If you work in IT related field, you’d know that a six figure or above salary is very common. My boyfriend’s aunt is a manager at a big insurance company and she makes 250k a year. However, it is not in my current field. I may potentially be one of the highest paid employee in the entire field, but it’ll never be comparable to an IT career. 

So now, my boyfriend has to move in 3 months to another state for a new job. My boss obviously didn’t want me to go, so he offered that he’d make all the accommodations necessary for me to be able to work from home for him. I have to say I’m very touched by it because a lot of my work duties right now have to do with managing files and organizing stuff; things that you can’t really do if you are not in the office. 

My boss also told me I can negotiate my salary with him however I want, because I’m already the highest paid employee (if you consider I’ve only been there for less than 2 years), so there’s really not a pre-existing scale that we can follow. I’m thinking 70k for 2019 (which he agreed), and at this pace, I’ll probably be making 100k by the time I’m 30. But it’ll just be capped there. I don’t think my boss can ever offer me anything more than 120k (and that’s only if I work for him for over 10 years), because at that point he’d be better off paying two people 50k a year to replace me just fine. Also the fact that everything I’m learning at my current job right now (its A LOT and super fun!) cannot be applied to any of my future jobs scares me to no end. 

I do apologize for the long post. But I hope by now I’ve given you, who are so kind to read through this, enough of a picture of my current situation. 

I feel like 1. “Working from home and making 70k? You kidding? It’s a killer deal!”but also 2. “Hey girl, for your future’s sake, you should probably quit this job as you move out of state and start in any of the above mentioned fields (business intelligence, data analysis or actuarial sciences) asap so you have much more of a job security and income potential in the future.”

15,"I am sick of my kids telling me they think I am a worthless crap father just because of how I treat them. I have had them homeschooled(they used books and online, I do not teach them as I have to work 9 hours each day), never taught them how to drive, never let them join activities(my opinion it is a waste of my day to bring them places), to meet others. This is just my parenting style. I have punished them ever since they both were 3 everytime they would show an emotion(cry, laugh, etc.) I would punish by belting them.

17,"So I'm 34, and have a steady reliable job that I am lucky enough to be able to do from home. I currently live in a very small town, my hometown that I grew up in. I had lived in Nashville for 4 years and absolutely loved it there, but I made the mistake of moving back here after a breakup and facing having to live on my own in the big city for the first time. But now I really regret coming back here, I wish I had stayed in Nashville. It feels more like home to me than this place does.

So now I'm stuck here, I rent a nice 3 bedroom home, and my best friend and mother  both live in this town. But I am very unhappy here. I don't own a car or drive, or really want to, and this town is not at all pedestrian friendly. So I'm stuck at home 90% of the time unless I'm with my mother or a friend. I've tried online dating but I just don't connect to anyone here. It is a small redneck town and I feel out of place. 

I want to live across the country, in a somewhat bigger city, which has public transit, and more open minded people. I fell in love with AZ after a visit last summer, and want to move there, possibly Tucson. There are also better career opportunities there for what I really want to do in the future after I finish my degree, whereas here there is absolutely nothing even close.

So lately I've been thinking about this plan. I want to find someone looking for a roommate in AZ, unload a bunch of shit that I don't need, and put all the rest of my stuff in storage. Then hop a flight to AZ and just start over there. Again,  I already have a stable job, I can do my job anywhere in the USA with an internet connection. After I got moved, I would be able to save up some money faster due to having a roommate than I can here. I would then of course look for my own place, as well as see about getting some more of my belongings shipped or moved out to AZ.

It may be smarter to just save up a bunch of money and try moving that way, but honestly I am just so unhappy here, and want to go now. It's also hard to save up money, since I currently pay rent, utilities, and food and such all by myself. After I get my tax return, I'll probably have around $1,200 , so that'd get my storage building set up, a deposit and rent on a room, and a plane ticket.  So that'd be all I need really.I figured I could tolerate living with someone else for 6 months to a year or so. I'd have a whole new environment and city to explore.

what is everyone's thoughts on this? It is a big step and it is scary. But I really want to make a change in my life. I feel like if I don't do this, I'll just stay stuck here, and never save up enough money on my own to be able to ""move comfortably"" or whatever, the normal way. ",29Jan2018,2

22,"Ok kids, I'm just gonna lay it all out on the line here. I've gotten myself in a really screwed up situation here, and I'm trying to dig myself out of it. There are a lot of contributing factors and comorbidities that are making it incredibly difficult for me to see the light, as it were. 

I'm gonna try and make this is clear as possible and try to highlight the most important things for me: 

December 2017: living with my fiance, we plan to get married in summer 2019. I had moved out and gotten rid of all my furniture and 90% of my belongings so we could live together comfortably. I walk in on him with another woman. Well, fuck. I call my mom and pack my shit up and stay with her while I figure this out. 


&lt;1 week later, my car gets repossessed. I had a separate bank account which the car payment was drawn from. I had a set amount transferred into that account, or so I thought. I work say a very small company and had assumed my boss/billing department/HR/payroll had submitted the paperwork but turns out she hasn't. 

So here I am, dealing with a broken engagement and the loss of all that shit, homeless(ish, I did have a couch to sleep on), less than 10 boxes of my personal belongings, and no car. 

January 2018: did I mention I have a chronic pain condition? I am supposed to get shots every 2-3 months to relieve some of the symptoms so I'm able to work and function. I was due for these shots in November, but lost my insurance. I scheduled to get the shots done when I got Medicaid. 

Clinic calls me, says I don't have a valid insurance so they cancel my appointment. I had called to inform them that my insurance was changed in December. I talk to their billing department and see what's going on, and they have had the wrong insurance for over a year. Wat

They send me a bill that has since gone to collections for over $8,000 for the past year of shots and discharge me as a patient for non payment. I've never received a bill from them, ever. Not even an EOB from my insurances. 

Great, so now I have a repo on my credit as well as a giant collections bill. 

There is a housing shortage where I live. I have been looking for places since April of last year, somewhere my man and I could have lived together. I can't afford even the lowest priced apartment in my town and within bus routes to work. 

Also, I applied for low income housing and was approved. Yay! I was ready to move in last Wednesday. I get a call from the lady who was helping me, and they said that they can't rent to me because I'm a full time student. I have been out of school for years, but I JUST got approved for FAFSA and was able to start back up again. So that place is out. 

I feel like the universe or whatever is just fucking me around right now. I don't have a home, I don't have a car, I don't have $300 to my name, and I had to call out of work twice last week because I was unable to get out of bed. 

Let me tell you about my mom tho. She makes over $120k per year and could easily buy me a nice car and place to live. She's absolutely insane, though. She is dating a guy I went to high school with and is an investor (?) In his friends car repair shop. When this all happened she said they had a car for me that I could HAVE, she bought it outright and paid for all the repairs. Today she tells me that she gave it to her boyfriend to sell to pay for some overhead in the shop. I could go on about her, but long story short I believe she's a narcissist and that's that. 

Guys, please help me. Please. I am so absolutely heartbroken and feel like there is no possible way for me to get out of this.",29Jan2018,2

24,"This might get weird. 

As far as I know, I was born after 11pm on May 25th, 1987. For 30 years I've celebrated May 25th as my birthday. My driver's license says May 25th, I'm listed on my children's birth certificates as being born on May 25th. All official documentation relating to me specifies my birthday as May 25th. 

And then I needed to get my birth certificate for a passport application. 

And it says May 26th. 

Now, my parents knew about this. And instead of rolling with it or trying to correct it then, they just decided to ignore it. Apparently someone wrote the wrong date on the certificate and no one bothered to check/care.

So for a passport application, my birth certificate needs to match my driver's license or other ID. That leaves me with some choices.

1. Take my actual birth cert. to the DMV, explain and try to get the birthday on my ID changed.

2. Go through the process of trying to change the date on my birth certificate from May 26th to May 25th. 

I'm not sure which one of the above is the right answer, nor am I sure how much of my life is actually tied into my birthday. 

Any ideas?

25,"I started a new job in a firm back in August. I am the personal assistant to the owner/boss. I work 4 days a week. This is a small office, 5 people including myself.

She asked him why she just doesn't ask her to do it since she was right there. well, I don't know either. I honestly think she is jealous of me for some reason.

33,"At one point at my organization, my boss hired a paid intern to work on our conference planning team. I did not interview or hire this girl, but I was the one who supervised her and delegated responsibilities to her. She was naive and fairly talkative, which led to her and I chatting quite a bit during downtime about her life and her plans for the future. She came to me for advice a few times for various things, and at the end of her internship I ended up reviewing and helping her revise her cover letter for the job she has now; she is essentially a salesperson/event coordinator at a Main Event location in our city. I am friends with her on Facebook and instagram and I've chatted with her a few times since she left.

Last week my boss came in and told me that she (the ex-intern) had applied for an position in our organization and the admin vetting the applicants had come to ask my boss what she thought of the girl. Apparently her resume and cover letter were terrible, but since she had interned for us in the past, our admin was willing to overlook it if my boss gave her a glowing recommendation (side note: she did not receive said glowing recommendation so she won't be getting called). I contacted the admin to see if she would share the application with me so I could see what was so wrong with it, and since she DGAF she sent it over.

You guys. This application was atrocious. I'm not sure if she completely forgot to attach her cover letter or if she genuinely thought a 2 sentence email with a resume attached was enough to qualify as one. Her resume was cluttered and WAY too long, she listed volunteer experiences from high school that were completely unrelated to anything she was applying for, and she misspelled several things including the *name of the school she got one of her certificates from.* I know for a fact that our admin has no intention of calling this girl in for an interview, but part of me feels like I should reach out and say something or offer some pointers on her resume. Would that be out of line? Especially considering I wasn't the one who she submitted the resume to? I imagine its already going to be awkward enough realizing that a place you interned at for months won't even give you an interview for an entry-level position - maybe it's too much on top of that to give unsolicited advice in her resume? On the other hand, she's clearly looking for new jobs, and she's *definitely* going to have troubles getting one if that's what she's sending people.

Before we started talking she dated a guy for a year or so and then she ended it. They still text all the time and she still has pictures of him in her room. It kinda threw me off.

Despite her saying she doesn't want a relationship she tells me she's only hooking up with me and doesn't want to with anyone else. Also I'm pretty sure if I got with someone else she would be pissed. Is she just using me to get over her ex? Should I move on or just kinda stay as a FWB. She says she cares a bunch about me.

Do people have to ride in front of cars or can you ride like near the side if you feel like you cannot go as fast as 55mph... etc?",29Jan2018,4

47,"Hello! So I was looking to seek out advice on a work situation and thought maybe I could get some guidance as to what to do in my sutiation.

I was hired two months ago by a company as a part-time employee. They claim that individuals can move up quickly (as in move into other areas of career interest). They also have it listed as one of their core valuesvalues that they value individual growth and development. The position that was offered to me correlated with my previous experience of being a teller. I had formally left that position as I was looking to get into something more intellectually engaging and task oriented, as I am an individual who likes to be challenged. 

I found out from another employee after I was hired that apparently they have all of their employees with an 18 month residency requirement, which was not disclosed to me at all during the hiring process or in the job posting itself.  I called our hr to gain clarification on this, since there was no official policy stated for part time employees (only full) and every person I talked to gave me a different answer. Their FAQ'S were updated in 2013 and 2014. One of the gals mentioned they use these only as guidance and no official policy is in place. A gal who was in my former position received an email after these updates stating part time employees do not have a residency. 

Why does this matter? A full time position is coming open that I am qualified for. I have been told by hr the only way I can get my application into the candidate pool is to get a waiver, which only happens when there are absolutely no qualified candidates. I want a chance to apply for this position and I feel I have been hired under false pretenses as none of these ""rules"" were stated to me along with there being no consistency as to what policies are actually in place. What can I do to challenge this? Is there any smart way I cam go about getting a chance to interview?",29Jan2018,3
48,"Hi redditers.

So as the title says,

I recently found out that my closest friend was gay. However, I only found this out because he left his Facebook chat open on his phone, and I was being nosy. We are usually very honest with each other, and I want him to be comfortable coming out to me. But I don't know how to mention this to him, without sounding like an asshole for invading his privacy.

Any advice would be really helpful.

Thank you

50,"I'm 30 years old with a B.S. in Criminal Justice; I've been in law enforcement since 2011 and am a USMC veteran. 

Last year I was fortunate enough to spend a few weeks out West (Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada, etc). I tagged along with a co-worker who had been drawn for an antelope hunt in NV and ID. We also did a controlled cow elk hunt in the Sawtooths and went smallmouth fishing in Hells Canyon. Upon returning back home, it's all I've thought about. 

I've got family in the Livingston, MT area and we used to visit them frequently. I've been searching job forums and the like (governmentjobs.com, USAjobs) trying to find something in those same areas that would allow me to live out West but to also be financially secure. 

Boise FD is hiring. A couple towns in Idaho are also hiring lateral police officers. Truthfully, I'm open to anything new or different. Both those areas start at around $50k/year.

I'm kicking myself for obtaining such a narrow-minded degree. I've learned rather quickly how expensive you can make western hunting. Tags, applications, gear, etc. 

I'm open to any ideas/advice/input which would allow me to live in Idaho and be able to spend time outdoors and still afford those interests/hobbies. Most of the seasonal jobs with USFWS or BLM pay around $14/hr.

TL/DR: Turned 30, got depressed at how fast life is moving by, now I want to live in Idaho and hunt and fish. ",29Jan2018,3
52,"Hi, this is my first time posting here. I apologize for the long post but it's a difficult situation for me.

I am a sophomore at a private christian university (I'm not a christian but the rest of my family is), and despite somehow achieving sophomore status, I'm doing very poorly. By that I mean I was recently placed on academic suspension, but my parents caused a major shitstorm and appealed it so i can continue to try and bring my gpa back up. 

I never wanted to go to college in the first place. All i wanted to do is work a minimum wage job and try and see if i can kick off a career in drawing comics. I am totally fine with not being rich, I don't care how much money I make, drawing comics is worth more than money to me. 

My parents of course wanted none of this, and so they forced me into going to college and majoring in computer science, which they are now paying for. In addition to that, they are paying for all my other shit, including a way too big 2 bedroom apartment (&gt;$800/month) as well as literally every type of insurance they can think of. 

I simply have no motivation to continue doing college, and my grades are suffering because of it. I'm not a lazy person, far from it, actually. It's just every time I have to do homework, I have to put a lot of effort into forcing myself to actually believe that this is what I'm supposed to be doing. Schoolwork takes a hundred times more effort than anything else, so I have a tendancy to procrastinate. Even when I do complete schoolwork, I take so long doing it that I don't even have time to finish it all, let alone have time to work on other things. I haven't touched my sketchbook in nearly a year now. I had an actual mental breakdown today over the fact that I had been working on a single piece of calculus homework for almost 12 hours and i still was not finished with it. 

It all sounds stupid and cliché now that I've written it all out, doesn't it? It should be pretty obvious what I should do, abandon this sinking ship and go do what I wanted to do in the first place. The truth is, becoming financially independent of my parents at this point is going to be a major problem, because i now owe them a rediculous ammount of money. The reason they're paying everything for me now is because they think I'll get a well-paying job once i graduate college. I believe I can do it eventually, even without getting a proper job that requires a college degree, and I'm willing to work hard to get there. I want to at least try to make the comics work out for me, I won't know if I don't try. Am I just being too naïve? I guess I just need someone else to tell me that I'm actually doing the right thing, or to give someone the chance to stop me from making a mistake. I have a bit of prior job experience, and there are plenty of places hiring around here, so I don't think getting a job will be too much of a problem. I already found a few places for rent close by that are less than $100/month. 

And so I find myself asking the question: should I pack up my shit and leave?

Please give me your advice.",29Jan2018,3

I can’t stop crying at the fact that one day we will all get old and remember the “good” days when we were young and be helpless to do anything.. this might be because I lost 4 very important people to me in 1 and a half years and I’ve been remembering them a lot lately and crying that I can never see them again or talk to them or apologise etc  idk where this is going but is there any way to stop this?

54,"Background: I'm a college student right now.  Finishing up my last semester so I'm swamped.   I have PTSD so I have my dog as an emotional support animal.  

I have neighbors who moved in a few months ago.  They are a family with a Mom, dad, and two small children.

At first we seemed to get along and I helped them out when they moved in.  

Since I'm so busy, I barely have time home besides at night.  I try to take care of our shared backyard and clean up after my dog.   I apologized and the mother snapped at me and yelled.  Obviously, I started cleaning more and apologized.  A week later, the dad saw me cleaning and said don't worry about it.  He knows I'm busy and trying my best.  I should ignore his wife.

So my roommate and I hear them arguing a lot.  They also are having people over at night driving their cars into the backyard, blasting music, and screaming. 

I feel so bad for the kids.  I know it's not a good environment.

Tonight, I had a couple friends over and we were hanging out and watching movies.

I go to let my dog out, and in the dark I hear one of their friends scream at me, ""You better not let that dog shit over here.""  I said okay and he is staying on my side.  The friend continued and screamed ""I'm serious.  He shits over here and I'm gonna come make you pick it up.""  I'm getting annoyed and not happy about the threat.  I calm down and say ""Alright.""

The guy continues and screams ""I'm serious dude!""  At this point, my dog is done so I go back inside.  

My anxiety is a little raised, I had to take an anxiety pill.   I don't want to cause more arguments.  I'm obviously gonna try to clean more, but I don't take kindly being threatened, even slightly.  

My roommate thinks they are crack addicts, but no proof.  

I don't know whether to reach out to the landlords, etc.  if I try to talk to my neighbors, I don't believe it would end well.

68,"Long post - apologies in advance. Also, I'm trying to keep this post as anonymized as possible so some details may be slightly altered to preserve that. 

I'm nearly 40, single, with a house and amazing dog in a city that I dislike but have remained in out of respect for my aging parents. Last week, a company that I represent has asked me to relocate (to Midway City, about halfway between Old and New City, five hours away from each), work for them, and run a facility they're opening as part of their expansion plan. It represents a significant step professionally and brings me geographically back to Old City. 

I'm super-conflicted and could use some guidance. Feedback preferred from people who were in similar situations, or parents of people who were in similar situations, but truly will appreciate any and all opinions.

**Backstory:**
I am an adopted child (yes, we're starting at the start), an only child. Mom is a German immigrant. Dad is good 'ole 'Merican.  All of Dad's family is local to Old City, all of Mom's family is in Germany. We spent the first 14 years of my life in, let's call it Old City, around his family, and then moved nine hours away to, you guessed it, New City. We moved to New City as a result of a significant promotion opportunity Dad received. Mom was a part-time worker (worked a few hours while I was in school). We were relocatable.

I've now spent 26 years in New City. Never loved it but stuck around out of respect for my parents - it's a rural German thing. You stick around with your folks to care for them during their golden years. Rural German parents do not live their sunset years in nursing homes.

I'm single (but have an amazing dog), built my career here, bought a house here. And it's still just my parents and I in New City. My parents and I are very close. Once weekly family dinners, drop-in visits (yes, with a call ahead), the whole nine yards. All of the rest of our family is either in Old City or Germany.

Brief sidebar about my parents: They're aging, they're in their 70s. Dad is retired and with multiple health issues, some which could become quite significant in the next few years. He's very clearly in that slowing down phase. Think slightly less active than Grumpy Old Men but not some sad mental image of the old guy in slippers shuffling down a hall. Mom still works but is retiring this year, she's vibrant and relatively healthy. They own their home, have built their network of friends, are quite financially secure. 

My friends are happy about the idea (even the friends I have in New City, as we all love visiting Old City when we can, and now they would have a free place to stay). 

I haven't discussed this with my extended family.

I did discuss this with my parents. They don't want me to leave them. They're afraid of what will happen. They don't like that they'll be left alone here and that I'm five hours away. They believe that their only option will be to go to a nursing home when they hit that phase of their life.

I want to go. My vision is that I can rent out the house (said local friends can manage the property and we have discussed a workable compensation plan for that). I can come down once a month, even twice a month, to visit my parents. When an emergency comes up, I'll have the flexibility to come down here at pretty much a moment's notice.

And most importantly, they can move in with me instead of a nursing home when that time comes or, honestly, whenever they would like. We can make it work.

All that said, they are still against it and that's where I'm conflicted. I'm an only child. I can't abandon my parents, but it wasn't my choice to move to New City, and now that I have the opportunity to move closer to Old City (and the career growth), I really wish to take it. Again, five hours away. Not cross-country.

I know youtube is getting bigger and bigger everyday, and while I really want to start a channel, I feel like what I want to do may just be dumb and not worth it. 

The whole of my channel would be about helping others with advice on life, mental illness, and personal experiences of abuse and trauma I've faced. I'm might even start logging my weight loss journey in the mix some where. My main topics would be around different mental illnesses, abusive relationships, toxic people, and help provide sources to reach out to when you're struggling!

I just want to help people and try and make a difference, but I'm not sure If a youtube channel is the best way. I know I like giving advice and helping others, and I love to talk about stuff like that, but I just don't know how well it would be received or if it would even make a difference with anyone!

72,"This post has been done so many times, but hear me out. The main problem is in the last paragraph.

I’m a Spanish Education major (Spanish pedagogy), and I’m about to start my Latin Am Studies minor, but I am just gonna rant about the things that are draining me.

It took time to adjust to my first year of school, but I basically put myself in an environment where I was learning a lot and it was exciting. It was kind of the perfect combination of becoming more aware and having fun with it too. I probably struggled about as much as I am now, but I was still having fun.

I’m on trimesters, so I started the fall in Spain; it was not a perfect experience, and I did wanna go home, but I loved the classes I was taking. I did struggle with homework though, but the professor was very leinent with homework times, so it didn’t matter really. I also did a homestay so I couldn’t miss class. 

But this is my main problem; I don’t wanna push anymore. I feel like I kinda pushed myself to my limit my first year, and because of that, I feel like I shouldn’t have to continue pushing myself so much; I have no motivation to push. I also lost a good amount of friends, because people separated and did their own thing, and people get busy, so I lost a lot of my friends. I also am part of a group and feel a lot more out of place than I did last year, and it sucks. I especially hate that I am taking a theology class, although I like the teacher, which has a shitload of reading and stress for something that has nothing to do with my major! I am taking my first pedagogy class, and I am doing okay, but I feel like I’m barely floating for some reason. I feel like all I do is go to classes and do homework, even if I procrastinate so much.

74,"Ok, yeah, maybe I came off as that ""whiny 17 year old who feels entitled to everything"" in the title but I swear, I'm not trying to be like that.

First issue: my parents still give me a bedtime and force me to go to bed even if I'm not tired. Sunday-Thursday  bedtime is 10:00, Fridays and Saturdays it's 11:30. I'm in the bed rn, actually. As a 17 year old I really feel like I should be able to go to bed whenever I feel like I'm sleepy. I literally can't go to sleep at 10:00, so I'm basically on my phone until it's between 12 and 2 am trying to pass the time until I fall asleep reading fanfic. I try to explain to my parents that I can't sleep until then but they still make me. I'm not even allowed to watch my TV after 10:00 to help. Whether I go to bed at 1 am or go to bed at 10 then fall asleep at 1, I still get the same amount of sleep. I don't understand why I can't just enjoy some Overwatch until I get so tired I start playing Junkrat like the Xmas noob I used to be. My dad unironically tries to relate by talking about how he was like me at 17 and was allowed to stay up, he tells me that he ""understands."" If you understand how I feel and understand my inability to sleep when you want me to, why are you still doing this? I really feel like I should be able to go to bed whenever now that I'm literally a few months away from being a legal adult, or at least I should have a bedtime of midnight. 

Problem 2:

My parents won't let me drive by myself. I guess that's a bit misleading. I've had my license for almost a year now. My parents finally said they'll let me drive by myself. Basically they said they'll start by letting me go to the store by myself on Sunday mornings. Ok, fine. But this was three weeks ago and they keep saying ""well we haven't had to go to the store."" At this point I'm getting annoyed because every time I  offer to go to the store for them or something they say stuff like ""no, remember what we said?"" Other kids my age have been driving by themselves since 16, and I'm almost 18. I feel like I'm falling behind everyone and maybe my parents don't really trust me, even though they say I'm a good driver. I should be able to go places and go whenever (I'm even ok with excluding rush hours if you're that nervous), just let me have some fucking freedom.

Problem 3: My mom and the computer. Sometimes my mom can be kind of rude about the computer. I've been doing schoolwork all day with no breaks except for food, and by 6 I'm ready to relax on the computer. The problem is, by that time, my mom has claimed the living room as her relaxation space and she doesn't like to hear me on Overwatch voice comms + the sound of our mechanical keyboard clacking during her Hallmark movies. Ok, I get that. She says I can geton when she goes to bed, so I just go in my room and listen to Fall Out Boy until then. Which ties into the first problem. My mom tends to go to bed like 30 minutes before I'm supposed to. So that only leaves 30 minutes for me to play OW. 30 minutes is NOT a lot of time on OW, maybe enough time for one competitive game because finding a game + skirmishing can be up to 5 minutes sometimes. Then the actual match lasts from 10-15 minutes on average. So that's 15-20 minutes out of 30. No time for a second match. I've told my mom this but she gets mad at me for it. Sometimes she goes to bed when I do and tells me ""oh well."" She should either let me get on earlier in the day without fussing at me to do homework, or let me stay up later to play.",29Jan2018,1

When I do have the confidence to ask a girl out I always get rejected, don't take it well, and would most times start insulting or act like a jerk.

It was pretty obvious to me at that point that she was full of it, but I was embarrassed for her so I didn't say anything.

Eventually I realized she was making up shit about her kids too. It started when the boys were at our house one weekend and I asked them what they wanted to be when they grew up. The youngest one said ""I probably won't have a job because I'll have to take care of my brother"" I asked what he meant and he said that since his brother is disabled his mom says that he'll need to help care for him when they're adults. I had no idea what he was talking about as clearly neither of them are disabled. They're both healthy, functioning, smart boys. I asked his mom about it and she said that the older one has autism. I didn't really see it myself, but okay. Since then she's said he has OCD, ADHD, ODD, aspergers, epilepsy, tourette syndrome, deafness in one ear, color blindness, depression and amnesia (yes, actual amnesia). She's said her older son has slipped discs in his back and has to sleep on special mattresses (this was explained to me after a slumber party at our house in which he slept on the couch). All bullshit. Neither of them are on any meds and neither have been diagnosed with anything. They're just perfectly normal kids.

This year she moved closer to us and our kids go to the same school. We have 4 children in the same grade. Unbeknownst to me until recently, at school registration this year she noticed that her sons were in separate classes while my daughters were in the same class. She spoke to a coordinator and had my daughter moved out of her class and into her ""special needs"" sons class, so that she could be his ""helper"". 

The final straw was last night. She's always made little remarks to me about my kids ""kid 2 seems like she might have ocd"" ""kid 5 is going to be on the spectrum"". I've just ignored it, I don't like confrontation. But last night my kids slept over at their place and this morning my 11 year old tells me that she gave my 6 year old an allergy pill and when my 11 year old asked her why she gave it to her she said because she has ADHD and has trouble getting to sleep. Not cool. 

Idk what to do here, she obviously has severe mental issues. She's ruining her children, and now she's starting in on my children. I don't like drama, I don't really think I could ever confront her about this. Cowardly, maybe, but I'm just not one to confront people. I've spoken to my children about the dangers of taking medicine when it's not necessary and I've told my 6 year-old that there's nothing wrong with her and that if she had a disorder a doctor would tell her, not a family member, but what about *her* kids? And herself for that matter? Aside from the twisted medical crap, she's a decent person who obviously needs help. Does this all seem like munchausen by proxy? Is there anything I can actually do for them? Anyone I can contact? Anyone dealt with someone like this?  Thanks!

82,"The guy I’m talking about is someone I’m running an anime club at our high school . I love that club and I wouldn’t give it up for anything. 
I didn’t know I was going to run it. My classmate (the president of the club) just told me I was. I have a bad habit of being unable to say no, so I went with it. This guy and I started hanging out, again something I don’t want to do but can’t really say no to. 
He’s really creepy. 
What he does is that send me these cringey texts that are wayyyy too personal and when I tell him to stop he blames it on something like his little sibling. He constantly finds excuses to touch my hair or my hand and it’s very uncomfortable. He distracts me during class by texting me and sending me mediocre anime vines that I have to watch because he’s right there. 
I’m really socially awkward and I don’t know what to do in this situation. I don’t want to hurt him since he seems like he has a rough household. What do I do? ",29Jan2018,8
84,"I'm currently a freshman in college and have not made any friends. I try so hard to make connections but nothing has worked out. I go to tons of club meetings and try to sit with the same people in class. I've even studied outside of class once or twice with the girl I usually sit next to. That's been the extent of my socialization though. After not making any real connections last semester I've just been demotivated and distant since coming back to campus. I spend all of my time alone studying or watching Netflix. Not healthy, I know :(

To escalate matters, I need to find a roommate by late February... I've tried asking around but haven't had any luck finding someone. I'm starting to consider just trying to get a single next year but I know that would just make things worse. If it wasn't for my current roommate I seriously would have gone the entire weekend without speaking to anyone. Thus, a single room would not be good for my mental health.

Or possibly do the computer science specialization, or the programming major(I think it was information systems technology specialization, sorry I can't remember.) But I come from a poorer family and I have the FASFA money which gives me 5,900+ a year and the standard loan that is 5,500 the tuition is 5,500 and so the grant covers the tuition, but I was wondering if I should use some of the loan money to buy PC parts to build a pc and/or a MacBook pro.

87,"In an attempt to keep a long story short, I am currently a freshman at a university. It has been the only university I've ever wanted to go to since I was younger. It's rather difficult to get in to, and I worked my butt off in high school to get accepted here. But now I live here and go to school here and well... I hate it. I hate the city it's in, I hate how big the classes (and the university in general) are, everybody here is pretentious and rude. It's so extremely difficult for me to make friends based on the sheer competitiveness and size of the school. Our majors are ""competitive"" or capacity-constrained, meaning that I might not even get accepted into the program I want and receive a degree in what I want. All of these facts lead to me wanting to leave and go back to my hometown (only an hour away). The university I go to now actually has a campus in my hometown, but obviously it's about a quarter of the size, much easier to accepted in to, and overall just not AS prestigious of a school. BUT, if I transferred there, I know I would be getting a degree in something I WANTED to, it's much less expensive than the area I live now, the class sizes are smaller (it's in a much much smaller city), and I could get a job somewhere I loved because there's an abundance of coffee stands in the area and I'm a barista. 

So basically, part of me wants to move back to my hometown because I KNOW I'd be happier. I'd feel so much less isolated. I could see my family whenever I wanted. School would be so much more do-able and enjoyable. BUT, part of me feels like I shouldn't give up on something I worked SO hard for for the last almost 5 years, despite how miserable I may be right now. Also, there's a bit of a pride issue with me. I would feel rather embarrassed since I would almost be ""down-grading"" schools, and I don't want to disappoint my family that is so proud of me for getting into this university.

I am so freaking conflicted. Please help! Any advice helps.

95,"So I don't really have anyone I can talk to irl about what I've been dealing with so I'm hoping an outsiders perspective can help me out. 

 Long story short, I'm 24 and financially speaking I've been taking care of my mom and little sister since I was 18. Growing up, I was constantly moving and went through a couple stepdads when my father passed away so I never had stability at home. I'm afraid that if I were to leave to be on my own, that my sister who is just in high school would rebel and do stupid shit just like I did growing up.She's a great kid but I know the pain of never having stability and I wouldn't want her to go through it. 

Aside from that, my mom has a few health issues and she's a smart woman but she's 50 and working as a caregiver and I know she wouldn't be able to provide for my sister and herself with her salary. Honestly I think she struggles with depression herself because our extended family is always using her as a crutch. She's told me before if I want to leave I'm free to do so, but I know they would struggle a lot and my mom has been struggling her whole life so I feel it's the least I can do but in the meantime I'm still stuck...

 I'm seeing everyone around me making moves and saving money when I'm barely making it and I hate it because of the position I'm in. I know if I was on my own living with some roommates with my current salary I'd be way farther in life than where I am today. I work in IT and only have a HSD, so my prospects aren't great but I don't want to work in an office for the rest of my life. 

If I could I would dedicate myself to music working part time and nothing else but it's literally like I'm supporting a family, and as much as I love them it's become a weight in my life. Best case scenario is my sister leaving for college and my mom going back to her native country to retire but that won't be for at least another 3-4 years. I'd barely be starting my life at 28 and I'll admit, I do harbor a lot of resentment because of it. I honestly don't know what to do. I've just been going through the motions day in and day out, going to a job I don't care about, paying the bills to keep a roof over our head, constantly feeling like I missed out. I haven't had a serious relationship in 5 years because of it. I've missed opportunities to pursue music because it was either that or losing a steady paycheck to take care of our needs. I'm going through shit at work for no reason other than them. 

I just need to hear some advice on what you think I should do. Sorry for all the rambling. 

 tl;dr: 24 taking care of single mom and sister. Needing advice on how to leave home without causing financial ruin for them since I'm their main source of income.

And my mom came in my room later and told me that his mom told her that he hung himself. I did not talk to or see him that day. But earlier that day he uploaded a Snapchat video of him watching Lord of The Rings on a Macbook Pro. And the regret I already have is why did I not talk to him on that day? That's what is bothering me about my friends death the most. Is that I wish I asked him if he wants to hang out with me on that day. But I had no idea that he was gonna do this because there were no warning signs or I did not get any feelings that he was gonna do this. But he smoked weed alot and I heard later that he took XANAX(anti-anxiety pill) and mixed it with weed and painkillers. But I am not sure if that was the cause of his death.

I'm afraid they won't get much help from my parents considering my own personal experience with school growing up.

I’ll be honest, I’m freaking out.  I don’t like my internship in the sense that I don’t fit in and it’s not the field I want to be working in (not the major, but the industry).  I also feel like I was mislead in that the internship would be applicable to my major, so far it really isn’t and I’m worried that won’t change.  I also don’t like the internship because the hours go late at night and do weekends (which makes it hard to balance school with the internship), the employees pretty much work 24/7 and I want a more 9-5 job.  Their coworkers are their family, they do everything together, and I think that’s wonderful if that’s what you want, but that’s not for me. I like working regular hours because I like my life with my friends and family. I have a boyfriend (will be fiancé in the next year or so depending when he pops the question).  And it’s just not an environment I’m comfortable in. They are all heavy drinkers and because it’s the restaurant industry we are constantly offered alcohol, which I can’t drink for medical reasons. When I politely say no thanks, I’m made fun of and constantly told that they will “corrupt me” before I leave.  The internship is causing me emotional stress and is exhausting. I come home from my internship and cry and dread going in again (it’s only 12 hours a week but it feels so much longer) and it’s late when I get home so I’m tired physically and emotionally, which is making it extremely hard to study and focus on my assignments.

SO. How do you guys get focused and get to work with assignments for school when you feel overwhelmed? With the pressure of this last semester I spend so much time worrying that I get nothing done.

I really don't know if she might be interested or not, a small part of me thinks that she is though. Here's why, so a couple of days ago we were hanging out, she was telling me about how all the male friends we have in common have hit on her in the past. She told me how much she really dislikes being hit on or flirted with, I haven't ever really hit on her (or at least I don't think so). She says that when she likes someone she comes too them and tries to spend a lot of time around them.She is the one that always seems to find me on campus, asks me if I wanna hang out, and when we do it's usually for a good number of hours. She also acts a bit differently around me than the rest of our male friends, almost in a way which would be considered flirty but I think that might just be part of her personality. In a couple of occasions she has also played around/petted my hair, I'm a black Hispanic dude so there isn't anything really special about my hair and the first time she did it, it kinda caught me off guard. 

I really don't know what too do, some people have told me to play it cool and see where things go. I don't want hit on her or flirt since she's already mentioned not liking that. I also feel like asking her out on a date but don't know how to.

I have a prescription for adderall that i take for college, and i’ve given a few to her every so often for school as well, but I haven’t done so in nearly 3 or 4 months. Besides that, I have no knowledge of having any relation to selling narcotics, or even having them for that matter, and neither does she. Also, she never actually went to jail, but had to appear in court to pay a fine. I was literally with her earlier today too. 

My question is, what is happening? The more I read the text, the more it sounds fake, but how would they know all of this personal information about me? I’ve looked up warrant databases and have found nothing regarding myself, as well as looked up the “agent” to see if there is actually an Agent Williams in my area, but i couldn’t find anything. Having been in my dorm room at the time, reading the text spooked me so much that i took off and drove all the way home. Hopefully you guys can help me out

120,"Hi guys. I've been in alot of pain from some teeth that have basically fallen apart no matter how I try to take care of them. I've been using anbesol, ground cloves, and Tylenol to help with the pain, but it's gotten so bad I can't sleep and I find no enjoyment in anything. My job offers dental insurance, but I couldn't afford it due to having to support my mother and brother (who both don't work) on $10/hr. I have no idea where to start in trying to make the pain stop and how to get it taken care of. I have had dental insurance for years up until 6 months ago. Right before everything happened of course.

Any advice would be appreciated. I'm desperate at this point.",29Jan2018,2

122,"First time posting here, so I'm not sure what to expect. I am seeking some advice regarding whether I should quit my job or quit school.

I am 30, single, and living alone in a major city. I've been working full time in telecom for almost 10 years. I make enough money to sustain my minimal life style. No debt, 6 month emergency fund, 401k. I'm currently doing project management, but I am not in love with my job. In fact, I hate my employer because I disagree with their business practices on philosophical levels. I spend anywhere from 45-55 hours at work every week. It's also probably worth mentioning that my employer offers excellent benefits, including tuition reimbursement (which I have been taking advantage of). 

I am a storm chaser, weather enthusiast, and avid environmentalist. I went back to school in 2015 to complete my BS in Atmospheric Sciences, and my goal is to study the relationship between global warming and severe weather. I have been attending class at night after work and online as a part time student ever since. As a result, my days are typically 18 hours long and I am absolutely exhausted from non-stop work. I have no time for anything. I see my (maybe?) 6 friends a few times a year. 

I've come to a point where I don't think I can continue to work like this and still retain my sanity. Additionally, if I am to complete my degree, the remaining classes will only be offered during the day as they require labs. At this point, it seems like I have to choose between work and school:

If I quit school, my life will essentially stagnate, and I will feel unfulfilled working a 9-5 dead end desk job for a company I loathe. But, I will have a stable and reliable flow of income and benefits that will ultimately result in a low-stress, simple, and probably peaceful life. I can still storm chase, and who knows, maybe even put some roots down in this city. 

If I quit my job and become a full time student, I will graduate by 2020 and start working for NOAA through the university internship program. While this has been my dream since I was little, it also means I will go into massive student loan debt. The cost of living (with room mates) + tuition is around $40k/year USD. I would get scholarship money and a part time job to cover some of that, but student loans are inevitable. 

This might seem like a post better suited for some of the personal finance subs, but they typically don't offer objective advice about *life*, and instead focus on the best decisions to make with *money*. I appreciate this, and financial matters can absolutely play a critical role in ones overall happiness, but there are so many other things to consider. 

tl;dr: I am seeking some advice regarding whether I should quit my job or quit school. My job sucks, but it pays the bills. Finishing my degree and moving on to my dream career would be fulfilling, but I will go into student loan debt in the process. ",29Jan2018,2
123,"So I started a paid internship straight after I graduated from college this past December. I was thrown into the midst of my job’s big three days event that they’d been preparing months for. Despite doing numerous part-time jobs and internships while in college, none were on the same stress level as my new internship has proven to be. I tend to empathize too much with people because of my teaching background, and unfortunately, allowed the negative energy from the temps and interns fighting to cause me to send pretty much my whole department an angry email demanding for an immediate action to resolve the issue. The tension has been weird at my work since they’re hiring rapidly because they got more funding, so all of the temps and interns are naturally anxious about it.

While I care about my career, I also know personally that I don’t have enough real work experience to be particularly picky about my job choices just yet. After getting yelled at justifiably by my family and sending an apology email to my boss, I’m curious about what my next steps should be. My mom already advised me that I should just do a short response without excuses if the rest of the staff ask me. But considering that I’ll still need to work with the interns and temps, how do I deal with their toxicity without being as close as before? I want to distance myself but not to the degree where I’m not doing my work at all just because I don’t like them.",29Jan2018,2

129,"I have issues I am sorting through professionally, although it all seems to go in one ear and out the other.

I broke up with someone about a year ago because I am not the person today who i was when we first met. I have seemingly devolved or evolved into a fairly selfish and narcissistic character.

We weren't jiving and i started watching porn again. It became more convenient to jerk off than it was to spend intimate quality time together.

When the relationship ended due to a disagreement on children. I found that the fundamental difference was a hard one for either party to compromise on.

Since then, I have been handling things in a fairly, unhealthy manner.
See, i want companionship but on my terms. This isn't a good thing i know, so please keep your pitch forks at bay. I am seeking professional help for it. So, i've been dating, constantly, and for the first time in my life I am balancing a nightmare of about 7 different women all unaware of the other 6. It's exhausting and because I can be fairly charming, they are all developing a lot of emotions for me even though, i have been clear that i am not looking for anything serious. We all meet maybe once a week each, sometimes ill double duty 2 in one day. lunch/dinner.

I am mostly just hoping i can find someone who can give me their similar situation and advice.

i am also very hobby oriented. Language learning, Travel, Reading, Instrument playing. But lately, all i can seem to do is miss my ex. I come across our pictures.To this day, i still find myself getting teary eyed because I dont see anyone matching up to the bar she set. 

Here I am coping in an extremely reckless manner, and there she is probably missing me as much as i miss her but not being aware of how far gone i am. 

Even if i tried to get her back, i couldn't admit to how i have been acting, and there starts a new attempt based on lies.
So, i sit at home when i have time to myself and wonder how i got to where i am. Was this life i am living now, really worth losing a strong foundation and loving feelings for?

i feel like i am just walking along this dark and lonely path, further and farther from the warm glow of whats behind me.

Have you ever been there before? how did you move past it?",29Jan2018,2
130,"Hello everyone I am in a bit of a pickle and searching for some advice. 

Just a bit of insight, I am in my 20s and live with my girlfriend of 7 years. We moved across the country from all of our family 4 years ago so we could pursue more opportunity and gain real life experiences. Our plan was for me to work full time while she became a licensed massage therapist, then I would go back to school and finish my degree. 

During the time she was in school I opened a business doing direct sales with a small team of 3 employees. After more than a year the business I ended up deciding to close up shop for a variety of reasons. (Mostly because I was so sick of 1 hour each way commutes from WA to ID every day and not seeing my girlfriend) 

Well fast forward to now she is licensed and I have a good job making around 45k a year working full time. She makes about 25k a year so financially it would be detrimental to us for me to quit this job in search of continued education. At the same time I know I don’t want to work in corporate America forever. Not to mention how badly I want to work for myself again... lol 

Through this time I have developed a genuine passion for business and I want to open up my own business again. At the same time I have been contemplating going back to university to get a degree in CS and eventually work towards a career in machine learning technologies. I am just unsure of what may be the best route to take considering I am young enough to take the risks. I know I have plenty of time ahead of me but I want to make sure that I use my time and resources effectively. 

Any and all feedback is much appreciated!

132,"Some background: I am 26, and my boyfriend is 19. We have been dating for a little under 5 months. He still lives at home with his father and sister. His mother left them when he was young, and chose a drug habit over her family. He is finishing high-school because he got kicked out of the house when he came out to his father about a year ago, and he didn’t get to finish his last year of high school. So once things between him and his father cooled down he was able to move back home, but his dad still doesn’t approve of him being gay. He only generally knows that his son is in a relationship, but I’ve never met his dad. This makes having a normal relationship difficult because there are many times where I want to be with him, but am unable to because his dad wants him to be home most nights and I’m not allowed over there with him. So that leaves me alone wishing I could be with him. It’s been two weeks since we’ve been able to fall asleep and wake up beside one another.

There are other factors that make our relationship difficult that just come from who he is as a person. He tends to be more of a reserved person in many aspects of our relationship. He’s not very affectionate when we’re out together. He doesn’t really open up about how he’s feeling often because he’s been hurt in the past by being vulnerable with people. Even in little things like texting I am way more active, and there are nights where it makes me feel incredibly lonely because not only can I not be with him, but I also don’t talk to him very much. 

I’ve tried to communicate how hard this situation is for me and even how I need him to be better at communicating with me in light of our difficult situation, but he also seems to not know how to make our situation better. He feels trapped and overwhelmed. It’s beginning to feel like I’m getting more disappointment out of our relationship than I am joy or happiness. And I don’t necessarily blame him for any of this because we’re in such a hard situation and I know that so much is out of his control. But I also feel like I give so much effort to make this relationship work, and it’s often not reciprocated. I’m beginning to feel like our relationship just isn’t meant to work out right now. I’m tired of being disappointed, and I’m tired of causing him to feel like he “can’t do anything right.” 

He says that things will change when he goes to college in a few months and he can finally get out of the house, but it has been so draining for me in every way that I’m not sure I can make it that far. I love him so so so much, but am I being foolish in not being honest about the reality of our situation? I’m looking to you guys for any advice. Breaking up is my last resort, and neither of us want that. What can I do to save my relationship? ",29Jan2018,2
133,"So I am sort of stuck between a major problem between my parents, siblings and my sister. So my family is really religious and my sister is a transgender. My family had been extremely unsupportive. My sister fell in depression and even requested that our family go and talk to her psychologist.. Something they denied to do. My father went but he just disagreed with her and said retarded stuff and later on came back home and my whole family talked about how stupid she is being and all.. It got really worse later on to the point where she begged me to find a way to call her to another country for work n stuff so I came up with an excuse and she came and decided to just settle here. She had her sex change, got into a relationship and HE is now married. my family don't know about it and he tried reasoning with them a lot but they r extremely stubborn. even when he goes back from time to time they keep arguing with him about stuff and whenever he has arguments with our siblings, they straight up tell my parents. My family plays the victim card all the fucking time. My mom calls me and cries abt how my ""sister"" is being satanic and is disobedient to parents and stuff and that they are the poor victims even though my brother has barely ever raised his voice at them. the worse he has done now is that he hasn't spoken to them for weeks and now they call me and cry about how they are oppressed..

135,"Hello,

Appologies cos this is my first post, please let me know if my post is not suitable for yhis subreddit and please advice me which subreddit i should post this to.

I grew up with Ndad, who was mostly verbally abusive and occasionally physically abusive but mostly with my mother. He would always tell family and friends and even strangers that he’s smarter, wiser, more experienced than most ppl (especially to younger ppl) so they should just do what he says. Growing up, he expects his family to do everything that he says and we comply because he always threatned ro cut the financial support if we dont and my mom is not working.

He’s doing very well financially and career wise, so the whole family are very dependant on him financially which i fidint like but my mom was ok with it (she acknowledge that theres something wrong abt him but have “accepeted” her fate that she chose him and everytime i tried to point out while yes i’m grateful for the financial supporty that hes given us and the opportunities that comes with it but that doesnt mean that i wanna stay under his “rule” forever, she’d get really mad at me and say something like i’m nothing if it wasnt for his money)

The complicated thing is that i am from a country that has zero social support from the government and the law and culture allow it as such to make parents as wiser beings that can do no wrong and adult children are still treated as possesion of the parents that need to be provided with “guidance regarding direction in life”. i am currently a recently graduated student who studied and living overseas.

Now that ive graduated, my parents want me to go back to take care of the family business and start a career in my dad’s company. They keep pestering me telling me to go home and everytime we have a discussion about how i still want to stay here ( my visa allow me to stay for a few years after i graduated),it always end up woth them yelling at me telling me 
1.how i’m an ungrateful child ( cos i dont feel the need to go back and be close and take care of my aging prents which is common in our culture)
2. who will not take responsibility ( start learning and manage the family business)
3.but only want money from the family ( cos as much as i try to be financially independent mysef here, i still need some money to support my life here cos i’m still looking for a job)
4. And just wasting my life here after spending so much money for my overseas degree (cos i could just go back and start a great career in my dad’s company)

I’m really confused and depressed at the moment thinking what i should do. On one side i dont want to go back cos going back means living back with them ( itd be expected in the culture for unmarried individual to live with the parents, and i dont have money yet to afford my own place even if i want to) and live with the constant anxiety of always having to find reason if i wanna go out, if i want to go home after 8 pm, if i want to communicate with my friends, cos they want to know everything and they watch me like a hawk. Additionally i’d have to live with a culture that is very different withmy personal values and everytime i tried to fight back they always told me i’ve been brainwashed and need to go back to my root culture. Furthermore, i have friends who i care very much here which i didnt get to have back cos i just have a very different values with the general culture.

On the other hand, 
1. Eventhough i’m in the process of applying for a PR, if i stay here theres no guarantee that i’d get a permanent resident visa 
2. In my home country theres an age limit if you want to apply for a job, unless you have several years experience, and i’m just one year shy of most companies’ age limit, so if imy visa application that might take 2 years to be finalised got rejected, if i have to come back to my home country, most career promising jobs would be close to me
3.finding a job thats not retail or in food industry is really hard for international student at the moment in the country im currntly living. ( not that theres anything wrong with being a sales assistant or waitress, but i Did like the field that i studied and wish to have a career thats related to ky degree)

Please advise me what  do you think about my situation and what would you do if you were in mine?

136,"Hello. I am an 18 year old college student who has never had any mental health issues or medication in his life. I do, however, get disproportionately angry at things sometimes and I would get aggressive, but never physical. I would say abusive things to people I really cared about out of anger, or do regrettable and impulsive things out of explosive rage.
Yesterday, I was arguing with my girlfriend and I got very angry. I pushed her pretty hard and she fell back in her chair. My first instinct was, rather than apologize or rush over to see if she was okay, to justify myself.
After talking to her (she was okay, thankfully) and thinking about what I had done, I am very scared of myself. I am so extremely guilty and regretful that I not only got physical with her, but also thought I was in the right for doing so. I am afraid because now I know I am capable, or even willing, of physically hurting people I love, without even initially feeling guilty.

138,"My parents were each the conception of extremely rich, but severely abusive people and as such my mother became extremely entitled, delusional, and unbearable (she never takes another point of view, never learns from her mistakes and believes in crazy shit like the universe being conscious or something. Or horoscopes.) My father ended up with no ambitions and severe depression, as well as no social skills (probably why he ended up with my mum.) You wouldn't know it of them as they put on a pretty good mask of a normal person (except my mother who seems to be slipping mentally.) My brother is a borderline paranoid, depressed schizophrenic (as in he used to seriously consider reptilians being real) but anyway he's in another country and I have no contact with him anymore. I grew up with my mother alone after the divorce when I was 4, and have not had an easy childhood, however we were not poor and I grew up in a good neighbourhood with good education. I used to see my dad and brother 1-4 times a year over the holidays. They all have good hearts, but have such extreme flaws that I feel I have no choice but to totally ignore them. They have taught me zilch about anything. As mentioned in the title I have my owns flaws, and I'm just a tiny bit concerned at my current lack of money, lack of support and lack of empathy (I've always had issues relating to people, in fact I remember when I was a young kid after getting annoyed at someone or something, a teacher suggested that I consider the other person's feelings. To which I thought to myself, ""why would I care about other people? Doesn't make sense to me."") And people wonder why I'm so fucking depressed all the time. How does this happen? How are these people allowed to be this way, how am I alive? See: conceived from extremely rich people. There ain't anything left for them boys and girls, and neither is there anything for me. My daddy picks tomatoes and makes enough to support my Asian step mum and himself, and my mums in a bit of debt and honestly if she loses her job (which she hates because its quite dishonest and filled with shitty, psycho, also dishonest people) I don't think she's getting another decent one again. Her CV looks like it's written by a 5 year old but she thinks it's brilliant, and that her not being able to find a job after literally LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF APPLICATIONS has nothing to do with it - it's because she's over qualified. I dont know how she landed the one she's at now - they were probably looking for someone who seemed a bit brainless (she's not, she just never grew used to using it) and yet still somehow qualified.

Look, I don't care about their shit anymore. Actually I never cared. Moving on. They can manage for themselves and as long as my grandma's rich old pension keeps coming through and my mum doesn't lose her job I'll have a decent bit of financial support (but now when I think about it it's peanuts compared to a lot of people I know here anyway) but my real, main concern is that I don't know what the fuck I should be doing with my life. Whats good for me, healthy for me mentally and financially, anyone who's been in the shit tell me how you coped, what truly got you through and how do I ground myself, secure myself, make myself happy. I'll deal with making minimum wage and schooling, but beyond that I'm clueless. I'm going to research for myself, but if anyone's reading, tell me things my parents should have told me. Treat me as an alien who does not know the very basics of human  psychology in terms of what a human being needs to be fulfilled, happy, etc. My perceptions have been skewed and my emotional responses have been stamped out and warped into nonsensical noise.

140,"I just moved into a new place closer to downtown with someone I've known through mutual friends. Before moving in I asked the roomie if he was planning on staying or leaving in April when the lease is up. He said he would either stay or move to the downstairs unit which is better. Though he gave no absolute answer on what he intended to do. I paid him February rent and a security deposit.

Then today one of his friends mentioned to me that they thought he was moving.

And today he tells me  he's 75% sure he's going to leave in April to live with friends. He casually throws in that the landlord needs a 60 day notice on if I'm staying or not and asks me to think about it. I'm not currently on the lease at all.

I'm pretty sure he knew he was moving in april all along and is just using me to help pay rent after his last roommates moved out. Am I right to feel kind of bamboozled?

I asked him what was wrong and he said that he keeps having nightmares about something that happened to him a year ago, he told me and my other friend that when he was in class that someone on his football team sexually harassed him. Apparently the guy that did it to him got of free, the police didn't do nothing, and school didn't do anything either. He didn't even get kicked off the football team, so anytime my friend played football he had to stand right next to the guy, the guy that successfully sexually harassed him and got away with it. He said he was really depressed and thinking about committing suicide, and that he tried twice before. Later about 4 days ago my other friend was playing with him and apparently he sounded very depressed again and he said he was going to kill himself and then left the game and the discord chat. That was 4 days ago, his Xbox profile says ""last seen 4 days ago"" meaning he hasn't logged in in 4 days. I'm worried h we might have committed suicide and I'm not sure what to do.

148,"My husband is vegetarian for various reasons. Mostly it's because today's meat farming methods are inhumane and he says he wants to save as many lives as possible. I thought this was really sweet and tried going vegetarian, too.. but my willpower isn't as great as his and I failed many times. I also come from a culture where eating together is a social thing and sharing food is important when it comes to bonding. I really love meat and there are some food that my husband can never have that I really wanted to share with him. The alternative vegetarian versions of them are terrible and not worth it. I thought it didn't matter at all that he was vegetarian and I wasn't. He doesn't mind at all and I didn't either. When we go out, we have to ask the waiter for ingredients that we're not sure if it has meat products in it... and if they do we have to ask for the dish to be made without it. Even things like fish sauce.  
Sometime last year, I kind of lost it one time when I bought a takeout that I was really craving that I thought didn't have meat in it but it came with bits of fish product. It doesn't really taste like meat but it is still made from fish. It was really expensive and it was the only thing I bought. I was hoping he can just pick it out and just eat the non-meat portions of the dish but he refused to eat anything. It made me feel terrible... and I didn't want to be a terrible person about it but I told him I'll just throw the food away because I didn't want to eat it without him. He didn't mind. I threw it away. It's kind of unrealistic of me to think that just picking out the meat portions would be okay. However, that day, it really hurt me for some reason and I didn't talk to him for the rest of the night. He realized something was wrong and he asked me what was the matter and I told him that he could have just picked out the meat parts and just had at least a few pieces just to show appreciation for what I bought. He told me that he was sorry. I didn't really want him to be sorry but at the same time, I wished I was married to someone that wasn't vegetarian. I know it's really terrible to think this.... 
He doesn't force me to become vegetarian. He doesn't mind that I eat meat. He'd be happy if I became vegetarian but he doesn't bother me at all about it... so I feel like I shouldn't make him eat meat. I feel like a terrible person every single time that I secretly wish he could eat meat.....
I hate preparing two separate versions of food....
I just feel terrible.

How are other vegetarian/meat eating couples handling this? What can I do about it...?
I really love my husband and I want to make this work... I can't believe ""food"" is making me feel this guilty and split... but it is.

151,"My dad killed himself. I was living with him when he did this. I thought I'd be feeling more trauma than this because the way he decided to do it was pretty disturbing. I've been telling people my dad passed away without feeling sad at all. When I see people talk about families that passed away.. they get emotional. I have yet to experience that. I can talk about it without getting emotional at all. Months passed and I'm going through my life as usual. I'm usually fine.

Time to time.... maybe once every few months or so... I can't fall asleep. I suddenly start crying but only when no one's there. Usually when I'm all alone, I think about my dad. I'm not fine when this happens. It's very rare but I am not fine when this happens.

But other than that I have not shed a tear. I feel fine usually. I am fine right now.

My husband suggests that I see a therapist. But.. I feel fine. I'm not sure what a therapist can do for me. 

The only thing is... I don't want this to turn into something that I have to see a therapist for years and years later.

152,"As the title suggests, I need advice. Alright, so a girl in my class and I talk a lot. Pretty much daily. And I’ve noticed casual flirting, and I can’t really tell if there’s more meaning to it than just simple flirting. 
An example of when she got blunt with it was when she figured out what I sounded like. She said something along the lines of “your voice is hot” once I got her to say something.
We don’t get tired of each other, even if we talk all day. So I want to know, is she trying to tell me something? Am I being oblivious to this? 
Another thing is, we go to online school, and we live in different cities in the same state. So the majority of our conversations are over text.

153,"I know this is kinda long, but please take a second to read it. I am in need of advice. I have been feeling pretty lost and I just don’t know what to do or what route to take.


Here is some backstory. My husband is in the military, so we have basically moved every 4.5 years. Between the ages of 18 and 21 we had moved twice so I just had basic jobs. (Waitressing and customer service) Then I had my daughter and was a stay at home mom from 2010 to 2013. In 2013 I started medical assisting school. I did great all through school, I made dean’s list, and graduated with honors. To graduate, you have to go to an extern site for the last month. I ended up getting hired on part time. I really liked it, but I really needed more hours and this office was not near my house. Fast forward 3 months and I found a new job that paid more and was by my house. When I interviewed with them, they said that they were going to train me. Well, then ended up not training me and just sat me at my desk and said ""get to it"". So after 3 months they said I didn't have enough experience and fired me. Honestly,  they never should have interviewed me since they needed someone with more experience. So now, here I am with only 7 months of experience in my field and a “fired” on my employment record. After I got fired, I look for a job for 5 months and then I decided to go back to school and get my phlebotomy license to try and make my resume look better. They did not do an extern site nor did the school help you at all in trying to get hired, so I was back at square 1. I tried getting another medical job for 2 years, but no one would hire someone with so little experience. After 2 years of not being able to get a medical job, I started applying to anything and everything. I got hired on at home depot and worked there for almost a year. Then we got transferred again. So, now we are in a new state and I need to find a job.

Here is where I really need advice.


1.My husband thinks I should go back to school for nursing, but I am not sure that is what I really want. Also, I would basically graduate school when we would be transferring, so any relationships I make here will basically be cut and I will be starting all over again.


2.I have pretty bad anxiety when it comes to the interview process and I feel like I am constantly second guessing myself. I feel like I am giving them the right answers but at the same time I am having a hard time finding a job, so I feel like I must be doing something wrong.


3.Whenever anywhere asks for references I can only give them one. Out of the 7 places I have worked at 3 have closed, 2 my boss doesn’t work there anymore, and I don’t feel comfortable putting the place that fired me as a reference.


4.All of my medical certificates have expired because you have to have working hours to keep them active. So I basically have to start all over. And if I do start all over it is going to cost me around $700 to renew everything.


5.I haven’t had a medical job since 2014, and if I couldn’t get a job right after, I feel like no one will hire me because they aren’t going to like that I haven’t worked in the field in almost 4 years. Also when I look online there is not 1 medical assistant job within 20 miles of me.


6.Since we transfer every 4.5 years, I am constantly starting all over.


7.I just don’t know what I want to do. I have done a little bit of photography and I love it, but you can’t make a living taking pictures unless you are some major photographer. Whenever anyone asks me what I want to do, if I could have my dream job, I have no answer. I want to do everything.


I am just so lost. I don’t know what to do or where to go. I don’t want to work at places like home depot or cashier jobs here and there. I am almost 30 years old and I want to find a career. I need to be able to support my family.",29Jan2018,1

I am a black male so I believe he just didn’t want to serve me believing I was a crook, but I have went there multiple times with there being no problems before so this is a first this had ever happened. I recorded this as well as proof. Who do I contact this about the manager, head office etc.",29Jan2018,0
157,"So, I have a conundrum. 

I’m 28. I live at home with my mom and brother. I’m still attending university and I’ll hopefully graduate by December.

I was unemployed for most of 2016, after I was let go of a job that I hated, but paid incredibly well. I spent that year searching for another job and I ended up finding one in August of 2017. It was in the same field as my previous one, so i knew I wasn’t going to like it. Mainly because they were both call center jobs. 

After that, I ended up being called to interview for an internship I applied to months before, for a professional sports team. A major team. I was offered the internship and started working there. Only bad part is that it only paid minimum wage. 

The first few months were ok financially. But as of late, I’ve been feeling a bit more anxious and concerned about money. Mainly because I have bills to pay and I feel like I can’t cover them. 

It’s all essential stuff. Car, phone, tuition.

But my issue is this. Should I keep going with the internship, that pays horribly and potentially get a job offer? Or look for another job that will pay more? I have maybe 2-3 months left in the internship(playoffs are a lock which will extend my time). But after that, I have nothing. 

I know it sounds like a stupid question, but the financial aspect of things is starting to affect me a lot more than I want it to. 

I’m doing a great job at the internship and I feel like a job offer can potentially happen, but it’s not guaranteed. I’m just unsure about the future and whether or not I’ll land on my feet.

163,"Hi, I hate Reddit but figured it's worth asking for the hell of it. I think I need mental help of some sort. I have horrible anxiety, lack social skills, and from the research I've done, it's possible I have Aspergers, OCD, depression, etc. I know it makes me sound like one of those teenage Tumblr girls but it's true. I doubt I actually have all of those but I check enough boxes to have at least a few. For example, I fantasize about death, lack social skills and can't interact socially, etc. I lie constantly, manipulate people for my own benefit, etc. And I'm good at it. However, I go out of my way to appear innocent and kind. I don't think I've ever managed to keep a relationship with someone for more than a few months before they get sick of me, for good reason most of the time.  Also, I'm insanely sociopathic and check all the boxes for traits found in serial killers. By that I mean psychologically abused as a kid, incredibly sadistic (I used to ""torture"" my toys as a kid and rip apart pop up books with cute animal pictures), never had any friends, avoided social events, etc. Basically what I'm getting at is that there's most likely something seriously wrong with my brain. Thankfully, I pose 0 physical risk to others because I can't even bring myself to kill insects. I had to kill some insects last summer and can easily make myself cry if I think about it. Hurting another human is totally out of the question, I'd kill myself before doing so much as slap someone. But I'm basically that whole ""looks and sounds smart but is actually insane"" thing perfectly. I'm rambling but I believe it'd be in good reason to seek help, I've just been suffering my entire life and haven't actually been able to work up the courage to ask. I've been asked multiple times by teachers and stuff, ""Is something wrong?"" And I always scream deep down to say yes but I always smile and say, ""Of course not"". I'm really good at lying my way out of situations so I've been able to avoid detection for over 20 years. I got put in a group in class and literally can't work with anyone so it's the last straw, I've had it",29Jan2018,2
165,"I’m sitting here reflecting on what happened to me when I was 10 years old. My mother had some friends who were a Vietnamese-English couple who had been together for years. They run a nail salon together. My mother trusted them a lot, especially through hard times of divorce. She would leave me and my brother alone with them as she went out for hours or even the entire night. 

I trusted Daniel a lot because he would always tell me I’m pretty and would listen to me when I talked about the emotional abuse I went through with mother. 

He sat me down at the sandpit and asked me if I would throw sand in my face for him and I immediately did. 

He would send me strange messages over Facebook which my father intercepted.

He would force me to watch extreme videos such as female genital mutilation.

He grabbed my face, told me I was beautiful and kissed me passionately. I froze.

I see him again when I’m 13, he gives me a lift home in his car and gives me £20.

I stopped talking to my mother for six years when I was 11. Now we’re on speaking terms, nobody can understand why I can’t talk about him or look at him.

Rumours spread about him running a brothel above the nail shop. I think he knows how to groom children. He makes a lot of money out of nowhere, should I call the police and tip him off?






I have been a victim of online grooming around that time also, I think I was looking for support in a broken family.",29Jan2018,1
166,"So I hate my job and they treat me like shit.  It wasn't always that way.  I've worked at my company for 8 years, but slowly it got worse.  


I work around mostly guys and therefore colorful language is around me 40 hours a week.  Mind you, I'm no saint, but I didn't start swearing like I do now until after working there a few years.  I cuss with the best of them now.  However, when I get angry I tend to swear more.


My job treats people unfairly, and plays favorites.  Like blatant favorites.   They force overtime, reward their friends and shun hard workers, so on and so forth.  I once called a supervisor out on his favoritism because it was affecting me personally, and that year he gave me one of the worst evals on the shift... and those evals determine our raises.  I'm one of the longest people in that department, I'm quick and efficient at my job, I'm friendly with patrons; his eval was full of contradictions!  Coworkers leave the door to my office open in 10-20 degree (F) weather (to the outside), if I asked for them to shut it they complain I'm a child.  If I just up and shut it they call me a bitch or need help or I'm being ridiculous and they will reopen it.  I was recovering from the flu and asked for them to shut the door because it was rainy 33 degress outside.  Nope.  I have to suffer.  Being we are in uniforms you can only add so much under your clothes. I'm harassed when I eat bananas.  I'm insulted for no reason sometimes--like a guy asked to pour scalding coffee on me for fun.  And it's not just me, it's anyone in the department.  But guys there like to push buttons, especially when it elicits a response.  Supervisors/managers/HR don't do anything!  Granted not everyone is an asshole like this.  There are nice people there too, but it doesn't outweigh everything else. 


So I really want to leave. Really, really, really want to leave. I'm stressed and angry all the time.  I've been given medical for depression and anxiety brought on by this job.  I keep having emotional breakdowns at work, which never use to happen, but I'm at my wits end.  What I'm worried about is all the anger, hostility, swearing, untrusting, anxious, and stand-offishness I am, because of this job, will carry over into my next job.  I will retort using the same (inappropriate) language ,  I will not trust anyone's words.  If someone does something wrong, I may consider it a personal attack towards me like it is now. 


It is one of the reasons I don't leave.  I don't want to bring this bad reputation to another company because this place has put me in that mind set.  A mind set I don't know how to get out of.  I am wondering if I should try to save up to take some time off between jobs to reset--to get away from that environment.  I just don't know if I can afford to do that very long. ",29Jan2018,0

I'm a US expat who is living in Seoul.
I've been grown up with extremely paranoid parents, and I can't function well in society. I get talked down people a lot due to this.
My parents are control freaks. I have to obey and believe every delusional lies or else I get reprimanded. I was forced to be afraid of other people's judgements towards me excessively, or I'd fail severely in society. I was pressured to give up my life to please the demanding people. My parents were immigrants, so they had to believe like that to survive.
I couldn't handle my father being such a demanding prick, so I moved out of his house. Shortly after, I moved in with my mother and she wasn't any better.
My mother forced me to confess my sins of plotting something against her in the past (I didn't do anything) and we got into many arguments. I told her to stop drinking and she won't stop. She angrily made fanciful excuses why she should keep drinking, that how healthy some alcoholic beverages were. She also made unwise financial decisions, we had many screaming matches. I tried hard to calmly talk this out, but she is stubborn. It's her way or the highway. Look, I don't believe in any of this, but years of manipulation can drive a paranoid schizophrenic person like me mad.
Thanks to this, I had multiple mental breakdowns. Couple of times, I threw tantrums because of futility. Why was I so hopeless? I could not escape my mother's house. I had no money to live alone, and my family were too poor to give me a place to stay. And if I find one, my mother demands me back and I get forced to leave. I'm trapped.
Again, I want to leave my family and live alone, but I can't get a job in this competitive environment in Seoul. Again, I can't go back to US, for there's no family support. I'm paranoid schizophrenic and can't juggle between jobs and school. Besides, I'm 26, so I have to finish college FAST. I am taking medications, but I need counseling. However, the there's no insurance cover for counseling, and I have no money. By the way, I can't afford any dorms...
How do I keep calm in this kind of situation?",29Jan2018,5

So I have a friend, my best friend really, and she is going through a really rough patch in her life, the past 3 weeks have been enough to tip her over the edge. She suffers from what we think are epileptic fits and 3 weeks ago she had a bad one, real bad. Her brain was deprived of oxygen and she lost 25% of her memory, she also has developed liver failure because of all the medication she is one. She has been kicked out of her house by her family and her girlfriend of 7 months has just decided she has had enough and has left her. I'm  literally the only person in her life rite now that can and last night she confessed to me she has no strength left and she just wants it to end and she is done fighting, nothing I say or do seems to help in any way and I feel helpless I don't know what to do or how to help her. I'm hoping someone can give me some direction of where to go with this as I don't want to lose my best friend. Thank you for your time

189,"My mother has a pug. Small breeds like this are prone to becoming overweight and developing all kinds of issues like joint pain, spine damage, and trouble breathing. She buys the dog really expensive diet food for small breeds, but then feeds her tons of people food! The dog is overweight and looks about ready to burst out of her seams. I was able to convince my mother to stop giving the dog whipped cream every day by explaining that what seems like a small amount of fat/calories/sugar to us is a much bigger amount to her. This seemingly did not translate to any other kinds of food. She rationalizes by giving the dog ""just a little,"" but those little bits add up!

I recognize that feeding the dog is a coping mechanism for my mother. It makes HER feel good to give the dog people food. I have talked to her about this many times but it does not change her mind. I am infuriated every time I see her give the dog food because she clearly does not care for its well-being. She takes offense when the vet says the dog is fat. I don't understand it.

How do I convince my mother that her behavior is going to kill the dog? If nothing else, how do I convince her to stop wasting money on the diet dog food if she is going to continue feeding the dog people food? ",29Jan2018,4
190,"It’s just like the subject says but let me elaborate. 

My friend Tina and I have been friends for over a decade. Her husband Jerry is a lazy POS but he loves her. Tina hasn’t been the same since she married Jerry 7 years ago. They have three gorgeous little triplet girls who were preemies but are now almost in the clear. Tina found out over Labor Day that she’s pregnant again! But now, Jerry says that Tina needs to be barefoot and pregnant and stay home to be “precautious” for baby #4.

When Tina told me this a month ago, I questioned why Tina can’t go to prenatal yoga or run errands especially since she’s not due for a few months. Her doctor’s haven’t told her she can’t be out running errands; it’s her husband controlling her life like always. He doesn’t help with anything and probably doesn’t know left from right without Tina. Jerry doesn’t help with any of the household chores or the kids for that matter. He’s a lazy sack of garbage.

Since I asked Tina why her husband won’t help more... all hell broke loose. She’s been sending nasty text messages and leaving me voicemails about how awful I am as a friend.

So, Reddit world - what do I do?? Do I let this friendship go knowing that Tina is pregnant and hormonal and flat out crazy or do I fight for this friendship and hope she is normal again soon?

192,"My boyfriend (25M) and me (20F) have been in a long distance relationship for 2 years, he lives in England and I live in the Netherlands. We meet up every 3 months, for about a week. The tickets aren't super expensive, which is really convenient. He lives with his parents, who are going away on vacation next week. Since we don't get much time alone together, I suggested I come over for like 3-4 days. I dont usually do this, but I kind of saw this as an opportunity to spend some alone time together, cook together, and just chill. He said no, since he doesn't feel comfortable driving (He and his parents usually pick me up, he hasn't driven in a long time). I understand he doesn't want to drive, so I kind of forgot about it for a little bit. I looked up the bus prices, and it is only £7 from the airport to his house. I don't know if I should tell him this, cause I don't want to push him or make him feel obligated to see me.

194,"Sorry for my bad English in advance

A bit of backstory So my GF lives still at here mothers place where the Mother doesn't work for about 20 Years.

The Father works at a Privat Bank and makes good money but needs to give a hole bunch of money the mother, which is weird because the mother puts her self always in the victim role (side note she has 3 Kids and one of them is in the hospital because of mental issues and lives somewhere els the other brother is a little brat and plays a lot of Computer and then my GF) I know it's not wrong to give the children the money for school, food, and other things but not the Mother it's not Fair.

The mother doesn't do really that much yeah of course she does do the mother things like when she is sick she cares about here cooks for here BUT minimal, at the end she seems really hypocritical about everything.

Sometimes when I talk to here and ask here why don't you get a job (as a joke because I know she gets easily offended) she always says the same thing a got a lot of things to do, but the thing is she gets up late really late and in the past she didn't even waked up my GF when she was in school and that's one of the problem of her. I mean I have two Jobs one because I need to finance myself and two because I go still to school because of my past (btw I'm 26 right now and I'm doing my Abitur or High School to but it)

But you can see the problem her is Discipline!

Also My GF got a confusing childhood, in the past where her Father and Mother were still together they got a lot of Money and back then she got nearly everything which is not that good for a developing child, also i get sometimes the felling that she never learnt the lesson of consequences wich is also not that good, every time when shits got real she blames others for that (Father or Mother especially Father) same with me. Every time when she got upset with something she got something for that like what do you want to shut up (you see the problem)

Also at the beginning I paid a lot of times the food when we were going out but that's being me but then I saw a pattern, always when we're out she got nearly no Money like 20 or 30 euros at best but that's because she doesn't want to go to work and also there you can see a pattern, Because of the Mother I think she doesn't feel like to work because everything ""is under my dignity"" because she doesn't want to actually work for her money.

Here recent way to earning money (idea 2 days ago) she wants to send nudes to other people because she herd that from a friend that she earns 200 euros in 2 days. My opinion about that are mixed, I said I would do that but only because I'm curious about it i always was but she is talking about it to do that in long term and it would ok when she got a real job but not like that i think.

Also she complains a lot of time that she is always at home doing nothing except for Instagram, every 2/3 days were meet up to take some Photos that's all good and she is pretty successful with that I give here that but that's the only way she leaves her house no other ways of socializing with people. She got friends but there are weird one of them also never leaves the House and is talking all of the time about other people without information. You may see that is a pretty Toxic environment.

In the past when my GF doesn't wanted to go to school she just sad that (and of course everybody dose that me included but the thing is she did that really often and not like one or two days 1/2/3 weeks simply by saying no I don't want to go to school. Side Note: she still goes to School but private like me, I meant by that when she was in a State School.

You can see she has some problem in that area I know that.

Lately she seems really distance, because last weekend we were going out because she got invited by some company because Instagram and we met a friend of mine and he got some female company, it was a fun night having drinks and all but at the end we were really tired she included but the girl insisted to go with here to party I wasn't really into it but in the end we did go with here, they got some drinks and me got some drinks and then I saw the two girls are kissing each other (My GF and the new Girl) no biggie I was just surprised BUT at the end I was a bit Defensive when I took her to the metro and she got upset, we did talk about it why I was defensiv at the end and it could be my mistake that I said if I were you I would do it differently. I sad If i were you after I kissed the girl I would go after that to and gave you a big kiss (i don't know if that was my ego or not the only thing is I can't control my reaction) and after that not even I already knew it it wasn't that of a big deal it was all fine with me, but I wanted to talk about it but here reaction was ""what was the problem"" I got the sensation that she didn't wanted at least understand the situation but she putti like that ""that I can't say what she can do and what not"" after that our relation is a bit weird. Everything what I say is offending for example „why don't you go to work at a bar"" because it's to fare away and i sad your Lazy but as a joke and she got upset.

Anyways

Could you guys help me out?

Appreciated!

I struggle with wanting to go and do things by myself, and it's all just really taking a toll on my mental health.  I go to work for 10 hours a day and don't really talk to anyone, I go to the gym after and that's the only time I get to talk to anyone, if my workout partners show up that is.

198,"I work a desk job, 6 people in 1 room. I don't have a problem with any of them, except 1. She is always loud. She can't just talk but always has to shout. She eats behind her desk, some sort of soup, I haven't asked yet, but the smell is absolutely disgusting. To top this she always chews with her mouth open and makes VERY loud noises during it.

I'm able to put up with all of this and don't have the social skills to politely make clear I dislike it alot. But today, I noticed something new. Something I can't just let go.

She currently has a cold (yet decided to come to work anyway even though we work at a place where it's no problem at all to call in sick). What do people do when they have a cold? They blow their noses. She does this in a tissue. The big benefit of a tissue is that you can dispose of it immediatly after using it. But she doesn't, she puts them on her desk and leaves them there for the entire day or longer. It's like she's collecting them. Right now as I'm typing this there are about 7 on her desk. All of them used. Also, we have a 'clean desk' policy, meaning that every desk can be used by anyone. So sometimes other people have to go sit at this disgusting desk filled with tissues.

I'm a bit of a germophobe and I HATE this. I don't have the guts to just say 'you are disgusting, stop doing that!' or to even ask politely. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this?",29Jan2018,2
199,"I am a CNA at a specialty doctors office. Three other women and myself are responsible for getting patient vitals, rooming, going over medical history and medications with the patient. We're the people you first see at the doctors office that bring you back to your room. This job is fast paced and can sometimes be overwhelming but is by no means difficult.  
  

We hired two new full time girls (we'll call them Hillary and Cindy) after our other two quit at the same time. It has been up to myself and my other part time coworker to train the new full time employees. Cindy is picking up remarkably well. Hillary, however, is not catching on at all. I am her primary preceptor and I feel like I've done everything to help her learn.  
  

She struggles with the most basic tasks like looking at her email, double clicking to open a patient chart, putting information into a patient chart, etc. Her interactions with patients are painfully awkward to the point where patients are sometimes visibly uncomfortable. She's been hired for three weeks and still doesn't know the very basics of the job and she refuses to do anything without help. This is a problem because myself and my other co-worker are part time and cannot be by her said every minute of every day to help with everything anymore. I didn't mind a few weeks ago because I didn't have school, but since the semester has started I can't work full time anymore.  
  
I sat down with her and asked how she learns best. She is adamant she needs to physically do everything on her own to learn so I let her do everything by herself. However, occasionally time does not permit me to let her take 20 minutes to do a task that should take 5 and she gets upset. I will take time to explain something to her and then in a half hour she will forget everything I said like we didn't even talk. I ended up making her a training packet the week she was hired that has step-by-step instructions on how to do EVERYTHING we do in the office. I don't think she's looked at it once. She has little to no problem solving skills and doesn't use her resources for help.  
  
I've had her train with other people to see if it's just the way I teach that is making the transition difficult for her but others are expressing they've had similar issues. I tried to talk to my supervisor about it and she basically nicely said ""you're rushing her and you need to be a better trainer.""  
  
I get that everyone learns differently and I'm trying to be really patient but I don't know what else I can do. I feel like every time I try to help her with something she doesn't listen. I made her a training guide (that she doesn't use) and I let her do things on her own as much as I can since that's the way she said she learns. I try to correct her when I see her doing something wrong and it's like she's not even listening.  
  
If you were in Hillarys situation and having a hard time catching on what would you want from me? What can I do to help a person that is completely lost all the time?

I didn't even touch my assignments this year, and my journals (compulsory to be kept for the courses I have undertaken) are barely half finished.

Financial Economics.

Numbers are not my strong suit, logical and creative thinking yes.
I’m good at pattern recognition, seeing a different perspective and general problem solving, but not numbers.
Basic maths, no problem but the more abstract stuff is not for me.

I’m great in an argument but terrible in a maths exam, yet I’m interested in subjects like machine learning, AI, programming, fintech, securities, trading, financial markets, forex etc.

For example, today, my husband came home early unexpectedly, and I wrote to a different friend on how I'd nearly had a heart attack as I was sat in the kitchen at the time, and he made me jump.  

The suspected 'hacker' then messages me to ask how I am....I say, 'I've just had a heart failure', and he replied 'yeah, that'll happen sometimes - especially when something happens out of the ordinary, like someone coming home early'....

Now - this could be a co-incidence (he knows I am at home by myself most days).

But....this isn't the first time.  Another example, would be that I was complaining about someone who cut me up in the traffic to a female friend, and I said 'yeah, I suppose he was an arse'....and laughed it off.

'hacker' messaged me a few hours later, asked how I was....then says 'I suppose it's one of those days when everyone is an arse'.....

Again - could be coincidence.

There have been a few of these occurrences - and only with this one friend.  However, I just can't see how it would be possible.  My phone is pin-locked, and never very far away from me....unless he could do it remotely?  I don't even know if that's possible.

220,"

So last night, my father (47) exploded at my mother and I (47, 19m) for talking to loud.

To give some context, my dad owns his own business, and spends 14 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year at work. I do not know him, despite my family’s efforts to get him to spend time with us, he never does. My 15 year old brother and I fed so awkward talking to him, it makes us uncomfortable.

Him and our mother have never got on, mainly because my dad is sexually repressed. In fact it is very weird, he loves 18 year old girls and people that look young, and it’s very creepy. He makes 3D renders of naked girls, and has even (kinda) emotionally cheated on my mother on an online sex game called rlc. No matter what, he always defends his actions, never apologizes or addresses the issues. He constantly belittles my mom, and has always joked and told my brother and I that we are gay (to the extent where I have developed a form of obsessive compulsive disorder because of it. The family dynamic, is as if my mom is another child and my dad is the boss, and we all hate it.

Last night, he came out his room screaming as loud as he can at my mother and I, swearing loud and hitting and smashing stuff. This was in front of my girlfriend. He went close to my mom and kicked all the bins and kitchen stuff around her, so I jumped in front of him to protect my mom. He then grabbed me by the collar, and pulled me close to his face, he was crying with anger, and he was so close to hitting me.

My main concern, is that I will end up like my dad, it is my biggest fear. I don’t want to raise my kids like he has, and I don’t want to ever treat my girlfriend like he does. Although our personalities are very different, I am still scared. He tends to bottle up his emotions, and I think I have learnt to do that from him. I am a much more caring and compassionate person, but I’m still scared.

He has also affected my relationship with other guys. Because he is so awkward and weird, it has also made me feel uncomfortable around guys. How can I change this? 

Also, how can I encourage my mom to divorce him. We live in a different country than the one she came from, so she has no family or friends.

I suppose I’d better add some context: I am not a pushover in anyway and am a fairly confident person who is very chatty and always genuinely friendly (I could smile more). It just seems like even things like WhatsApp chats I’m always the one replying and people read and don’t reply, I’ll always be there to help a friend but I never have the same help offered.

I know I’m ranting and it sounds like I can do no wrong but even just typing this out seems better. I love my group of friends and know they don’t intentionally do stuff but sometimes it’d be nice for them to realise how much I do for them sometimes. ",29Jan2018,2

227,"I'll try to summarize this quick, since I have class in a few minutes.

Basically, I've felt really burnt out on everything. I recently moved into a dorm for the first time, and my life feels completely changed around. I'm still adjusting to class, and that's going well, but I'm really stressed out and put out of my element. 

Yet at the same time, I'm so incredibly...bored.
I don't enjoy games like I used to, I haven't been enjoying the discord calls with my friends, and I've even felt the desire to avoid my girlfriend lately. It's starting to really scare me. I love her dearly, and I don't want to feel like I'm losing that.

I've had a really low opinion of myself lately because I've been making rather offensive jokes around my friends, and generally just being a little more of an ass to them than usual. Granted they dish it right back, but I've felt like I just...I'm a huge jackass. I don't really want a relationship like that with my friends anymore. 

I want it to be more serious and affectionate, and not feel like every time I talk to them, I'm going to be told I'm a terrible person, even though I really am.

I want to be a better person and I want to start having better relationships with everybody. I feel like I'm losing my sense of care for everyone I used to hold so dearly.

I recently announced to all of them that I'm going to be taking a few days of pure alone time, cutting all contact off. That goes into effect as of today, so I have time to think and maybe try to make some sort of internal change.

Is there anybody who can give me some insight or advice on this? I've been on the verge of tears for days now.",29Jan2018,1

230,"Hi Reddit, I'm having a bit of a professional dilemma.

2 years ago, a family member of mine saw potential in me to work for a contracting firm he worked for as a software developer. I was a junior in high school at the time, and performed very well over the summer, earning a wage of ~17$ an hour for software development work. I worked in a team with two other interns who were entering their last year in University as Computer Science majors, and later learned they were earning a decent amount more than me. No biggie, I was younger, I understood.

Year 2 in working for the firm. I work alongside a new intern group, all incoming college seniors or grad students. Again, 17$ an hour. Find out they're making $25+. Fine. I'm younger, I get it.

Continue to this year, I continue working but on a client contract doing work alongside developers making 80k a year. Getting paid what, you ask? 17$ an hour, even after asking about pay changes due to my new responsibilities. Fine, I'm young, whatever.

I find out that my skillset makes me marketable to work freelance for ~$50 an hour. I've just signed my first contract to start working on a private contract freelance for nearly triple what I was earning. How do I quit my professional internship to work freelance without upsetting the family member? Can I tell the company I'm just too busy with school, or should I be honest?

I apologize for the long and slightly irrelevant pre-story, I'm just very very very excited about this new opportunity and haven't had many people to tell so far. What should I do here, reddit?",29Jan2018,2

Even when I really need it for school works especially for my ""course""-like programming course and will be turning to college with an IT course later this year.

The thing is, they only said that I should borrow my Sister's laptop from time to time, which isn't a really good idea as my Sister tends to have mood swings and a bit strict with how I use her pc. It is also hard to do my computer related subject, when I have to install multiple things that I have to make an approval from my sister but might even delete it. It is really hard to be productive when you have strict things to follow on, especially how you use it(I do my works in a way that isn't just one sit down and I sometimes takes random naps from time to time). Half of the time, I have to bring a laptop in my school... but my sister also brings her laptop in her school(She is in college so high likely that she will bring it and have a very ""unstable"" schedule.)

Now this is where a bit too much thing, I also game in my laptop to keep me in check. I might go into depression if I don't do my hobby from time to time. I use it as a a way of relaxing after doing works. They don't really get the concept. I am always a top student in my strand/class. I never really asked for anything that expensive. The laptop they gave me was really old, but they could replace my sister's laptop fast if it broke but she don't even take school seriously. And lastly, I really need a ""workstation""(not literally high-spec one, I am only asking my parents for something entry type) because most of the stuff I do now a days needs a pc/laptop. Even the most productive one.

I know someone will say ""Man, just wait or something"" but it is really hard to keep it into myself when I can see that a family member of mine gets those same kind of things.

235,"To the good people of reddit:

First off, here is some context: I didnt do great in the examinations leading up to University entry, but had a major recovery upon sitting for the SATs (grinded away for weeks and got into the uni of my choice). Now my parents view me as a bit of a loose cannon (mediocre grades to pretty good grades for the SATs) and have planned a regiment to keep me consistent before flying off to university. As an international student I am paying significantly more, so there is 0 tolerance for failure (no money for a repeat)

So heres the deal:
Im heading off to a university overseas soon. My parents and I have an agreement where the months leading up to it, the agreement is that I wake up on time (8am) and have a productive day of reading up on my courses. I have been able to keep up 70% of the time but will sometimes slip up (causing my parents to lose confidence in me). The goal is to excel at university and wake up consistently in order to perform to my best. I know it sounds a little extreme, but these were the agreed terms when my parents decided to fund me. 

Any advice on how to keep on the right track? And if there were to be a deviation, how does one recover quickly? Thanks",29Jan2018,1

There are also other people living in the apartment, we are all 20-30 and in college, so you can imagine the state of the apartment. I was supposed to take the room of one girl, we'll call her Ruby, who Sue was kicking out because she is a terrible roommate. (I can now agree with this- she isn't nice, she never cleans, she doesn't pay on time, etc.) I moved in January 8 and Ruby was supposed to be gone by this time. But she's still here, causing me to stay in the living room and not be able to unpack my things so they are all in my car.

Sue has good intentions but is bad at confrontation. Normally, I would be able to help her be more stern with Ruby, except there's one issue: Sue is the only one on the lease. If we kick Ruby out she could go the leasing office and rat us all out, leaving everyone else with no where to stay. Ruby keeps saying she is looking for somewhere else to move, but I don't believe she is really trying. Also, every time she talks about it, her length of stay gets longer. ""Oh I just need until the end of February."" 
""Oh just til March maybe.""
""Oh I'll move out by March, maybe April.""

244,"I met this girl in a group of friends that have similar interest in hobby and stuff. She was with this a guy for a while but everyone didn't know if they were official. I did not know during that time either. I started to have interest in her that I confronted her if she was dating this guy. She confirmed they are.

Months later I was still interested in her as I talk to her more and share more personal stuff. She complains her boyfriend is frustrating her and always makes her mad. He is a lot younger and still immature in my opinion too. She is pretty young too compared to my age.

As I developed more feeling, I started to have issues as I suffer from loneliness. I started to get mixed signals from her but she would flirt back a lot too. I want to be with her more. I did things for her only because of a different motive than just being a friend. I was called a ""bitch boy"" few times by some friends. I eventually confessed and thought it was the creepiest way as I always ask her to come see me or can I  come see her. All I told her was my feelings and I knew nothing is going to happen. If I suddenly back off or stop talking to her, it is because I want to move on. 

When all of that happening, my friends still keep encouraging me to go after her. One friend particularly encourage me not in a positive way. He would say ""Just go ask her to fuck, shes from XX, girls there more likely to say 'Yes'..."" That is the type of advice I get from him. There was bad moments that I had to calm myself from the anxiety with some meds. One day he pushed me to just go ahead and ask the girl. Long story short, I came as too aggressive and came out downright creepy. She laid it down on my and told me she only see me as her friend, shes not interested on any sexual things, and she is loyal to her current boyfriend. All I said was ""Oh Okay"". There on, I stopped talking to her. I thought it was the best feeling to be ever rejected, it lifted me from the haziness of my mind.

Few months later, I still struggled to move on. It didn't help that this particular friend keeps bring those two couple up. I know he wants to fuck her too as she showed some interest in him.

Yesterday, I was hanging out with this friend and his laptop starting ringing because his fiance was calling him. I saw his chat with the girl mentioned above and something in me decided to read their conversation. I know it was invading their privacy but this friend told me things what her and him talked about. I searched my name and a particular topic came up. 

This friend talked to this girl about me. He said that she need to reject me already. This was 3 months exactly from when I came out to her aggressively.
I feel betrayed that my friend pushed me to do something messed up and to only find out he had something to do with it. I am honestly not mad at him as I do see the part that he is trying to help but meddling on my own business was the part I did not like. I know what I did to this girl is messed up. I know what I went through was messed up. I know that i should've just moved on and not read that conversation. But somehow I don't know why I feel like this...

I confront my friend and told him what he did was a ""dick"" move. He said he only care for me as a friend. He argued that he started to sound like he is defending himself. I let it go (or maybe I didnt) just so I don't ruing a friendship. We hung out still after.
However, deep down, I do not feel I can trust him anymore. He's been a close friend and I know that sometimes he can be a dick and his advises are pretty fucked up.  My group of friends are like that. They are bunch of dicks and assholes but I dont mind it.

I am just confused now as I dont know if I would still be normal to him. Knowing a piece of information that I wish I didnt know change a lot of things and how I perceive my friend.

Do I just let it die and move on? 
Any advice or words of encouragement can help.]

EDIT: I am confused on what I am feeling now. I feel like my friend owes me an apology for meddling but he still doenst think what he did is bad. 
The more I read my story, I did miss out a lot of details that might not complete my point and feelings. 
I am just a mess sometimes.

TLDR: I fucked it up with a girl cause of my friends encouragement, found out 3 months later he told her to just reject me as my condition was getting worse...

I smoke because i enjoy being high, it makes me less anxious, it makes me less likely to snap at neurotypicals and their stupid ways of thinking (lol sorry normal people). It gives me something to look forward too - if i'm stressed or too much is going on, I just think about being able to relax at the end of the day. In a way I feel it makes me less autistic.

I also have depression and anxiety, but they've hardly been a problem whilst I've been smoking weed (for approximately 2 years). Indica strains don't tend to give me the desired a
effect, only really sativas.

My problem is that I feel i'm spending too much money on it. It's usually around £50-£60 (a bit less than a Q which is £60), that's over £3k a year, my annual income is approximately £16k a year at the moment. I'm 21 and still trying to work out what I want to do, I don't expect to be earning this little later on in life.

Overall I feel weed really helps me day to day. I've taken antidepressants, been to a couple of therapists and tried meditation, all of them have worked in their own way, but i still feel like weed is the best at helping me.

I'm only 21 so I don't have much life experience and I don't know anyone else who is like me, so i'm struggling to know whether smoking and spending this much on weed is stupid compared to how much it helps me?

But now that I'll have to sign the contract in a few weeks, I'm really starting to feel the downsides heavily. Using public transport, I'll have to travel for 6 hours single trip at the cost of 120$ for the round trip. Now, everytime I think about moving away this far, I can only think about my friends I got here: They are the most awesome people I could ever hope for having as friends, I love being out with them and feel 100% comfortable around them. Then I'm kinda starting to have a thing with this dream girl, which really kicked the existential crisis off. Like, I'd have to travel 12 hours for 120$ to be able to see them for 40h before I'll have to depart again to be on time on monday. And then there is my family of course. I don't have that strong of a bond with my family for several reasons, which is why I have an even stronger bond with my friends I guess, but still, I'll miss them big time. I'm literally crying right now cause can't live with the thought that all of my relationships here will fade after a year of being away. Also there is the culture differnce. I'm from bavaria and have a strong accent, which caused some trouble when I was at my job interview. Also I don't want to miss out on the bavarian way of life that I love so much.





tl;dr: To be able to work at my dream job I'll have to move 6 hours and 60$ single trip away from home, which is culturally completely different and where I'll be leaving all my friends and family behind, which really hits me hard right now and puts me through an existential crisis.

So I've tried making friends but every time I do, the people I try to talk to act like it's so weird or so awkward just to say hi.

But she requested that she get a new lab partner this semester and she told her friend right in front of me that ""she had to switch because she doesn't want to deal with that thing anymore"".

273,"So, not sure if this is the correct sub for this, but I am looking for some feedback regarding a friend’s behavior. 

The friend in question behaves oddly intimately with a friend of the opposite gender, despite both of them being happily married to other people. Let’s call the friend “Mitch” for clarity’s sake. Mitch and I grew up together, but I lived in another state for a few years during and after college, so we lost touch for a while. We eventually both moved back to the same area. We got back in touch and became good friends again. My wife and his have also became friends, and we do a lot of stuff together. 

Now, Mitch and his wife are close friends with another couple our age, and soon we all started hanging out as a group. None of us have kids, so we have the freedom to do stuff almost every weekend, and some weeknights, too. These new friends - let’s call them “Chuck” and “Jamey”- are great people, and my wife and I do quite like them, though we never really do anything with just them, if Mitch and his wife can’t be part of it. 

The thing that startled me though when we first met them, is how weirdly intimate my buddy Mitch and Jamey, the other girl, are with each other. Not only do they hug uncomfortably long for “hello” and “good bye” every single time they get together, but they also kiss each other ON THE MOUTH, while in their pseudo-lovers embrace! And that’s not even all: When we all get together, those two usually choose to sit way close to each other, often even cuddling with arms around each other! They will sometimes stroke each other’s hair, continually rub the others arm or shoulder, or just generally engage in greatly unnecessary amounts of touching. It gets borderline inappropriate, like when she will sit on his lap for extended periods. While all of this goes on, their respective partners are right there and don’t seem to mind in the least bit. Both of their spouses pretty much act like they don’t even notice, or if it’s the most natural behavior in the world. Don’t get me wrong, Mitch and Jamey both are still very affectionate towards their respective spouses, too. However, whenever all four of them are in the same place, most of their affections seems to be between my buddy and his “Bestie”. Their spouses, while obviously friendly and comfortable with each other, don’t do anything even remotely similar to this with each other. My wife and I usually just sit there, awkwardly trying to keep the conversation going as if it doesn’t really bother us either. According to Mitch there is no sex involved and this is just a how they show their affection. My wife and I still think it is really odd and weirdly inappropriate.

Are we being judgmental assholes or backward squares for not getting it? Is this type of intimate relationship between friends acceptable, even if they are married to other people? I do wonder if this is more common than I am aware of, and how it can possibly work out without the risk of a more romantic or sexual relationship developing between them. 

TL;DR: Have a male friend (married), who has a very intimate relationship with his female friend (also married). Is this weird or not?

274,"TL;DR: I'm unhappy at my full time government education job that pays ok and has good benefits but no upward movement for 2 years. Possible offer for a part time job that would look great on resume, but still isn't what I want to do, also no guarantee on benefits. 

Long wall of text, I apologize in advance:

Bit of a long read so I apologize in advance.

 I currently work for a city run community college in a paramedic program. I have been a paramedic for 12 years and I decided I need to transfer to a job that will not kill my back or worsen my health. The paramedic program I work for is a degree program, so they follow the college hierarchy. The positions are as follows: Professors, lecturers, and College Lab Technicians (CLT). Due to my initial credentials, I was unable to secure a professor or lecturer spot. I accepted the college lab technician spot in hopes of gathering the rest of my credentials, and moving into a teaching spot. A CLT has to work 40 hours a week, 8 hour days. It's considered a white collar professional position, so we do get some perks in the role. The room for advancement in that line are Senior CLT and Chief CLT (you need a PhD for this position for some reason). I am currently a Senior CLT. I have also reached top pay for this line ($68,000). 

Due to my past debt and to maintain experience, I still work on the ambulance twice a week minimum, usually overnights. This is a part time position, and I do receive benefits through this position. The yearly for this job is approx. $26,000 before taxes. They are rotating shifts so I work every other weekend also. 

What's burning me out currently is there are days where I'm working 9a-5p at the school, i go home and sleep for 3 hours, then I work on the ambulance till 7A in the morning, and then drive over to the school to work another full day. I'm also unsatisfied at the school position because I saw myself as an educator, not a logistics manager. The school is very strict about people adhering to their roles, so I am absolutely not allowed to teach students currently. I spoke with the director of the program, and he states that there may not be another open education position for 2 years. He thinks i would be crazy to leave though because he claims that once one opens up, I would be first in line to get it. 

So here are the pros to the full time job currently: 

it's a government position, so I do receive government benefits and will receive a government pension.

I have currently enrolled into a masters program, and the school will pay 6 credits a semester for me to take the program. At this rate, i will probably finish the program 2 years later. 

It's guaranteed income, and the job itself is low stress. It's honestly just dealing with inventory, a bunch of shipping orders, and managing the simulations. 

The program itself as a great reputation, and some of the best instructors in the area teach here. They are all rooting for me to get a position with them also. 

The cons of this positions:
I cannot advance any further without getting a PhD. 

I am at top pay, so I won't be able to increase my salary further

The teaching credentials I obtained may end up expiring because I am unable to teach a course here. 

I feel underutilized and frustrated because I am nto allowed to teach

I would be earning a lot mroe working as a full time paramedic. but then there's the risk of injury and disability in my field is pretty crappy. 

Recently I was offered to interview for a part time position at a private university. Again it's a non-teaching position, but it's in a different role. The job entails dealing with clinical sites directly and monitoring students as they perform their field internship. There would be a lot of traveling during the work hours and i would be in contact with the higher ups and help make decisions on whether new clinical sites are needed and what student performances are. The job is going to be only 20 hours a week, and the pay is substantially less, but I'm willing to negotiate. They have not relayed if there are any benefits to the job itself.

Would i be crazy if I considered leaving the government education job for this part time position? I was planning on supplementing the difference in income by working more shifts on the ambulance. But this puts me back to the higher risk of injury. I'm really torn as to what to do.

276,"After going through the 9 grades A.K.A elementary school here. I had to choose what profession i want to go study. Couldn't pick anything, and classmates asking ""what school you going to"" daily, really didn't help. Mid-summer I picked a college where I would study as a  Computer Technician. I picked that because I ""was good with computers"" but that's just what everyone around me told me and for a while I thought that too. So September rolls around, I'm was hyped about this, I thought - 'I'll get new friends'
But a fact that I should have considered was that I'm an introvert and I'm anti-social. But odd enough I need someone to interact with me for me to now die inside. Which eventually happened.
Half of the class already knew each other, so I was just alone, of course there were the short conversations but those were basically bullshit anyways.
Ok, that was the back story for this part.
I started skipping school. And I don't know why I did it.
At the start of the school skipping I'd get busted the same day. From September till mid October I skipped one or two days of school every two weeks. But as the first half of the semester went on I started to skip more and more days. It got to the point where I had missed a month. And everytime I skipped school, I told myself ""Tommorow, you go"" 
But as you can tell, that didn't happen.
I've basically dug myself a hole because I've been lying about going to school to my parents and relatives and my old friends, who got a hold of this information from a college classmate who also went to the same school I went to but he was in the other class.
So I basically have no friends, and I think I've fucked my future up with making shit decisions.
I can re-apply to a different college next year, but I don't think I want to sit there for four years probably being the same anti-social fuck I've always been.
I fucking hate myself. Thank God I am not thinking about suicide...or atleast I don't think I am, like I've thought about how me dying probably wouldn't change anything in the world, and actually what it's like to die, but actually Manning up and doing it ? No.
In my eyes, I'm worthless

My family are transphobic and basically live in a small rural community where it's pretty much the same with about everyone. I go to an all boys Catholic school. I've been struggling with the fact that I am transgender for about 3 years, I'm as certain as I can be about this, I've looked at it objectively I know how I feel and I know that not being able to transition has had a very bad effect on me.

I recognize the importance but realistically I don't expect to have much contact with my family later in life.

Roughly a year ago, my mom died of cancer. It was completely unexpected and fast. She had all of the brain tumors removed
and all seemed to be going well. I had moved out and had my own place in a different city so I didn't see her as much as I wanted.
One day, I called to check up on her and was informed that she had been put in hospice which is pretty much a death sentence.
I made plans to go spend the next day with her but before I got there, she had passed. No closure, no saying goodbye. 
I should mention this was my first time ever experiencing death so I had no idea what to do. 
I was too upset to drive, plus I was scared of seeing her dead body so I just went back home. I went to the funeral but not the burial.
My famly never called to check up on me so for months I was isolated and distraught with no help.
I realize, they were fighting their own battles but I thought they would at least care enough to call.
Now, a year later, I rarely talk to them.
I was, and still am very depressed.

I did also express my concern to my mom about going to Vegas after I texted my sister to pass the idea around and she said ""we will see"" and if I'm completely honest I'm almost certain is a no. My sister has been really caught up in her own bubble lately with her boyfriend and work which is great but I've tried to make plans with her the last year and a bit with her and they always fall through last minute and I'm just not interested in that being the case rn. If she dosn't come then she dosn't come and I'll go anyway. Also my mom has been sober for the last 6 years and I don't have very meny friends and I know for sure they would not be able to come with me right now anyway. So as you can see this doesn't sound that appealing to me rn. Maybe one day in the future when I can go away to Vegas with some girlfriends, but not now.

I haven't been on a vacation in so long! Where do you think would be a great great away for my mom and I? ",29Jan2018,1

315,My boyfriend and I took a break from our relationship because of some issues we were having. Midway through our break I could feel that things weren’t right. We weren’t talking but it was just an intuition. I called him and I asked him how he was feeling and he left like it was time to let go. But something doesn’t feel right. I don’t think I can give up on the person I’ve been in love with for the past two years. I’m thinking about driving to see him (he’s an hour away) and just telling him everything I feel. We’re supposed to see each other on the 7th. Should I wait? Or should I just go on a whim? ,29Jan2018,0
316,"My boyfriend and I have been together for the last 3 years now. The first year of our relationship was great. It’s always been a little hard since we’re long distance but we’d always manage to see each other once a week. 2 years later and a lot has changed, he told me last year that he’d been cheating on me and we broke up but I ended up forgiving him and we got back together. 

For the whole of our relationship our sex life was good but he’d never eat me out because he’s gross out by vaginas, hes told me “I don’t want it near my mouth” and since he’s my first boyfriend and I’ve never experienced it I didn’t care, but inbetween our break up I found out I liked it a lot and wanted it done and he had agreed  but it’s been six months and still nothing. 

This weekend was the first time I’d seen him in more then a month and he barely touched me. I wanted him so bad but, at this point he’s hardly touching my vagina and Likes when I keep my underwear on during sex. I’ve asked him many times is there a problem with me? Do I smell bad? He’s always said no it’s not me it’s all girls and he’s only done it once. I always make sure I shave before I see him and he still refuses once we’re in person. At this point I don’t know what to do and I feel like my sex life isn’t good, but I’m still in love with him.  What should I do ? ",29Jan2018,1

Basically, I keep two IKEA drawers under my bed that have things in them like paperwork, posters, etc... essentially things one cannot clean.

323,"I've had depression for 6 years now and i've also been in physical pain nearly every day. It's always something, one day might be my neck or my knee or something else but there's always a ""reason"" - Slept awkwardly, sick, dehydration, ect.  For the past month i've had rib cage pain come and go, from left side to right side then felt it in my back, some days I felt it all day, other days just at night.

Thing is people are telling me its just my depression now causing these pains. It's pretty irritating to hear that my ""pain"" is all from a mental disorder but I think it might be true because like i said, the pain comes and goes - I'd hate to go to the doctors for nothing to even be wrong.

329,"Super simple, I babysat for my coworker and watched her 8yo son at her house for the very first time. I’ve known the coworker for a month and met her kid that night. I was putting some dishes away to be helpful, and saw she had some weed, along with some other non-kid-friendly items (cough medicine, insulin, nothing else bad or illicit). 

The kid was looking for paint and climbed on the counter, he didn’t check it while I was there but could definitely access the top shelf in that cabinet.

332,"I met a girl about a year ago during a course. We became good friends, but I knew the second I saw her I'd gotten a crush on her. With that very quick and teenage angst-y description of the situation, here's the deal.

Since the course ended, we continued talking *a bit*, but not for long. I never asked her out because she had a boyfriend (no idea what her situation is now, so I assume they're still together), but we remained friends.

I remember vaguely that we had a conversation that ended with her never reading the message I sent (or she did and I couldn't see it, I don't know) on Facebook. We had talked about grabbing lunch a lot earlier (that never actually became a reality), but I don't think that was the last message I sent her. We're still friends on Facebook, and I wished her a happy new year, but I never continued the conversation.

Now, it seems like we won't be talking again, and I don't want to be creepy and message her. I have been having some serious anxiety that I'll come off as creepy when I do something, so I rarely talk to old friends.

For some reason, she came up in my mind not too long ago. I've been having some love trouble, and I think this has caused her to come up again.

She was more friendly with a second girl, and I was just the late, third guy to the ""gang"". I haven't been talking much to that other girl either, less in fact (mainly because I've been interested in this first girl...). So I can't message her either, and I worry that I'll come off as extremely creepy if I do that as well.

Thing is, I have this urge to ask her out, which is obviously not all right, so I suppress it (and honestly, considering the social faux pas and the fact that it'll just end with a weird stamp on my forehead, I'm not *that* into it). But I can't for some reason get her out of my mind.

What do you suggest I do? Just leave it?

I had a traumatic experience with my parents growing up where my dad physically hurt me because of my mom's control over him and every time she threatens me with my dad I am reminded of it and want to cry and feel very afraid. I think it's absolutely sickening what she does. I hate getting sick because any time I do, my mom pretends on the day that I get better that she has caught whatever I had and some how drags that out for over a month at times. She makes this ridiculous face when she is pretending to be sick as well, where she squints and holds her chest. I know there is nothing wrong though. She does this too consistently and too often for her to really be sick all of the time. If she were really sick she would be going to the hospital all the time.

Now I have been accepted into a 5-year law programme. It would have been 3 years but my undergraduate grades were not good enough and so I was put in an extended programme. I’ll be 25 by the time I complete it. The problem is that my parents are deeply disappointed in this, they have not said one positive thing, they are arguing with each other about who is to blame for the complete mess that I am. When I try to defend myself they just look at each in disappointment and make remarks about what an idiot I am. Funding is not really the issue, they are just unhappy that I’ll be entering the working world rather late in life (around 25). At the moment, I barely ask my parents for money as I have a part-time job. I am wondering if I should just start working in an office somewhere and study something else on the side in the meantime, even though I don’t really want to do that. I feel that this 5-year law programme is something that I could take on, but my parents’ reaction has left me feeling a bit lost and hopeless. I’m trying not to break down.

I have no idea what to do with my life and im already 23.
I started working with 15 as a Furniture Salesman and did that till 20. I always wanted to attend school instead but i was not allowed to by my family and accepted it, what else should you do with 15. I hated the Job to the point that i felt suicidal and quitted it and started trying to get a school degree. (i think thats high school for you, the degree is called abitur in germany). So yeah i did that for 2 years but had to stop due to financial reasons because i just couldnt make enough money with jobs like pizza delivery and such to afford going to school and working more hours made me drop out because i couldnt keep up in class. So right now im trying to take an entrance exam for my University here but it seems like sooner or later i wont be able to afford that aswell.

All i want would be a good job far from customer service or hard physical work but it seems like i wont go anywhere. Because i have no degrees and the only job experience i have is in a field i would rather die than do that again.

339,"I wanted to ask this serious question, but there is literally nobody i know to ask. 

I want to start of the fact that I live in very LGBT intolerant country. I'm a male who was raised by women (mostly grandmother), because my father abandoned our family. Even more so, i was raised as a very soft and dependant person, and this influenced me later through life. 

Now i really feel myself in the wrong body, and don't feel any manliness in me. 
I often feel very restrained by the ""man"" rules and really wish i would not be one. I always was interested in things in girl's perspective. And as a child i did not liked boy things, like cars, football and such things. I was always a shy and not very talkative person, only really making contact with other girls in class. 

I have literally no friends, and have very poor contact with familly, which consists of mother and a grandmother. Even though we live together, as i'm only entering my twenties. 
And as i stated, i live in a very intolerant country. I'm afraid of coming out to my mother and telling that i want to change my gender, that i feel really restrained and, because of it, i often feel extremely depressed. 

I'm afraid to tell, because such things are really considered stupidity at best in my country. Afraid of the fact that i may be considered ""wrong"" and will fall down in my mother's eyes. 
That i won't be able to live a good life, a life that i want because this country would not accept me. 

But i also do not feel in the right body, and do not want to live with this constant feeling through my whole life. 

I need an advice, what should i do? How can i approach this?

344,"I am the second-to-last house on a crowded street. The corner house has no driveway. Driveway A, the first driveway (right side of the house) is mine.

My problem is that everyone thinks that Driveway B is mine, and people end up parking there/pulling up in front of it all the time. It's all different people (contractors, delivery drivers, Uber drivers, etc.) so it's not like people can just learn which is mine. I also find that telling people in advance which driveway to use doesn't help.

I put up a little sign that has my address next to the driveway, but most people ignore it. Short of a giant sign that says, ""Nope, this is it,"" how can I make it more obvious which driveway is mine?

352,"My grandma is fairly high functioning for an 80-year-old woman. She has been living alone, is vocally lonely, but is resistant to any changes we suggest for her. 
So I went down to my grandma’s for lunch. When I got there she was checking her Facebook messages on her iPad and I realized it was from someone named “Kenny Rogers”. My grandma is obsessed with Kenny Rogers since over a year ago. She’s nearly fallen for a scammer on Facebook before asking her to donate 500 dollars to his charity and then he would have a 1 on 1 meet with her. She asked me if I could keep a secret (by this time I had already figured everything out mostly) and I told her it depends. She then tells me she and “Kenny Rogers” have been chatting on Facebook since October. She says that they are in love, he wants to leave his wife (who is really young) for her, buy her a house in Florida in her name so his wife can’t get it and they can live in it together. Ludicrous. She says she hasn’t been asked for money or anything, yet she’s given the guy her address and apparently he is coming down sometime this week and she’s supposed to meet/pick him up at the airport. She says she’s talked to him on the phone and on video chat, she still somehow believes he is the real deal. She is convinced this is real. 
I talked to her for over an hour about how scammers are everywhere, and how she’s been scammed before and is generally gullible. I told her that there’s a .001 percent chance this is Kenny Rogers, and if it is, great. But if it isn’t, the fact that they want to meet up with her is frightening. She says she can take care of herself. An 80-year-old woman. Yeah right. She is going off her rocker and lords her “taking a chance” as some kind of righteous trait to demonstrate that she believes in happy endings and blah blah blah. 

I told her that she is selfish to not consider that she could be putting herself in danger and putting her family in a tight spot by potentially getting herself abducted for ransom, her car stole, or her house ransacked. It’s fucking bizarre. I feel like I’m living in a cartoon.

She put me in the position to keep her secret and bear her burden, which I resent because she knows if I tell my Aunt about it that things may go poorly for her. I never promised her that I wouldn’t say anything. I betrayed my grandma’s trust and talked to my Aunt who is an ex-cop about it. She told me to find out when she is going and let her know so she can tail her to the airport. I think by not allowing her to see for herself that it’s not Kenny fucking rogers, the spell will never be broken. But letting her do what she wishes is going to put her in danger and drag our whole family through the mud. She is becoming a nuisance. It’s going to end in her losing her freedom.

I am sad that I have to be in the position of crushing my grandmother’s dillusion which will probably end up in her losing her freedom and perhaps resenting to me. I resent being put in that position and feel overall just down. I already know what to do about the situation, I’m just looking to discuss it and get it off my chest. I just feel pretty stressed about it all, I don’t want this person to show up at my grandma’s doorstep, or her to invite danger into her and our lives.",29Jan2018,2

My wife put a candle on the stove top, because the wick had sank into the candle and so we were not able to light it.

We used the burners on top and absolutely nothing was wrong. But yesterday, I made a pie, I put it in the oven, and I went and sat down to watch TV until the pie was done. She says ""Your pie smells good, but it kinda smells like burning candle."" We both looked at each other and ran into the kitchen to find that the kitchen had been filled with smoke from the oven. I opened the door, the pie was okay, so it was not coming from anything dripping off. Apparently, since I have a gas range, the wax melted down through the burners, and somewhere into the oven itself. I am not an oven technician, so I am not sure of all of the fancy terminology. I lifted the stove top, because I had just recently learned I could do that. There was some wax in there, but it was only a little, and it wasn't burning, it was only melted. There is a hole off to the left side, before the insulation, where smoke was coming from, so I am assuming it is coming from somewhere inside of the side of the oven. It has self-cleaning.

365,"I'm stuck in a small town with my disabled grandmother waiting for her car to get fixed so I can drive it to my parents' home to sell it.

She's not very nice, and she's very religious and conservative. Every serious conversation turns into her insulting me until I leave for a while. I'm not allowed to stay in her home, so I'm walking around town carrying 20lb of luggage all over and then staying in motels when I find good deals.

There is no data connection here for my phone, and everywhere I go for WiFi other than McDonalds is a terrible connection. I have a 3DS but I've beaten all my games and it doesn't interest me anymore. I haven't seen a single person here who is my age. I asked a girl who was around 16 what there is to do around here and she was like "" idk nothing, get the hell out of here if you can.""

366,"My grandmother has owned a triple-decker (3 family) building in Boston for the last few decades. My mom lives on the first floor, my grandmother and uncle on the second floor, and my boyfriend and I on the third floor that had been [unoccupied for several years and filled with garbage] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7el1bv/boyfriend_and_i_2223_are_stuck_living_in_my/) before we moved in over the summer.

Over the years, the house has becoming increasingly expensive. My grandparents used to have a tenant paying cheap rent on the first floor, but he moved out and the home became just family-occupied. My family has never done well financially--my mom is disabled and receives a measly $1000/month, my uncle works retail and drives Lyft, and I'm a recent college graduate who is getting paid an entry-level wage and paying several hundred a month for student loan repayments.

Without any significant source of income, especially rental, it has become difficult for my family to keep the house. My mom and uncle have been arguing about selling it for years--my uncle has wanted to get the hell out and buy his own place for the longest time (which he already did, and fucked up--as seen below) and my mom has tried holding on the house. The property is still legally my grandmother's, but will be split between my mom and uncle once my grandmother passes. Now, they're thinking about selling it and splitting the profit to buy their own homes out of state.

This is frustrating me for several reasons.

* My grandmother is still alive. As immigrants, she and my grandfather worked incredibly hard to purchase their own home. They have lived here since the 60s and put so much blood, sweat, and tears into this house. My grandfather even died here. My grandmother is so attached to this house and has refused to even consider leaving for years, but at this point, she is willing to part with it just so she quell the drama between my mom and uncle. It makes me so angry that my mom and uncle would be the ones quite literally cashing in on their inheritance early, while my grandmother is still alive. My uncle was even boasting about his plans to get a second car--a fancy SUV. They don't even care that they're profiting from my grandparents' hard work--while my grandmother is still ALIVE.

* My uncle has fucked up his finances so many times, yet he always gets bailed out by my grandparents. When he was younger, he racked up a ridiculous amount of gambling debt that they paid off. A few years back, my grandparents gave my mom and uncle $40,000 for a down payment on a house that they were supposed to own together. My mom and I were supposed to move into the in-law portion of the home while my uncle lived upstairs, but he ended up throwing a fit because he didn't want us living with him. The house (which he bought to impress his girlfriend) ended up becoming too expensive for him, so he had to move back to our family home while renting it out. Eventually, after a series of bad tenants, my uncle had to declare bankruptcy. He ended up selling the home. My mom and uncle are currently still arguing about who the money belongs to; my mom insists that my grandparents told them to split it, but my uncle claims that he put more money into the house and should get most of it. Of course, nothing is in writing because these people are dense and don't know how to not screw themselves over financially.

I'm just so incredibly angry because as the 4th member of our tiny family, I am the only one who is getting screwed over the most. My mom and uncle made shit financial decisions and had their chance to own their own house, courtesy of my grandparents, yet they messed up. Now, they're going to cash in on their inheritance early and outright buy their own homes while I, a recent college graduate who is struggling in a mountain of student debt, am getting left in the dust. They always had this home to fall back on. They always had my grandparents financially supporting them when times got tough. Now, last minute, they're pulling this shit after my boyfriend and I just moved upstairs and started to get settled. It's not even like we were freeloading; we were paying cheap rent (in terms of Boston prices) and handling our own utilities. 

I might be able to scrape enough money together to rent a room with several roommates, but my boyfriend of 3 years is being extremely stubborn about our living situation. He spent so much time and money moving all of his stuff to Boston, and he's bitter towards my family for putting this on us last-minute. They're being extremely wishy washy and not even giving us a conclusive sell date--or even a damn season. My boyfriend is a teacher, which is a VERY time-essential profession, so he needs to know exactly when we need to move. He just finished a long-term substitute position and feels shaky about applying to jobs (Feb-Aug, before the new school year) because my family isn't attempting to figure out or convey their plans.

Because of all this stress, my boyfriend has developed this incredibly pessimistic attitude about the future. He can't move back home because his mom is an alcoholic (understandable). He says that he doesn't want to get roommates. He can't afford a one bedroom apartment with me. He claims that he'll have to ""join the military"" because he feels so lost with everything up in the air. He insists that we're going to break up if we end up living apart from each other.

It's been a huge emotional strain on me because I'm losing my house, any sense of stability, and potentially my boyfriend as well. I don't even know what to do.",29Jan2018,2

369,"First of all, I didn’t lose this friend to death but we just drifted apart. 

This girl and I used to be good friends at the start of the school year and I was very fond of her, even though I wouldn’t consider her close to me I did enjoy seeing her everyday and at least saying hi. She even invited me to her house for her birthday back on October.

But then she stopped talking to me, started ignoring me and she even stopped saying hi. 
Finally today I talked to her about it via text (which I admit wasn’t the best way to do it), but she basically blamed me for everything, saying I hugged her too much, that she needed space and that kind of stuff. I understand her, yes I do tend to care a lot, and hug and everything but I didn’t realize that’s what made her so upset. At the end she finally replied Ok and I left it al that, I hope we can be friends again even If it takes time, because I did really care about her and I don’t want to be mean or anything.

373,"Sorry this might be a lot, been meaning to vent it out somehow. To start out, we go to the same college and we got close through a class 2 years ago and would hangout a lot and surf together. Nowadays, she just constantly works and we hardly hangout. She’s one of those flakey friends who only hangs out when it works for her. She will never go out of her way for you but expects you to for her. It’s very one sided. The day our friendship started getting rocky was she invited me to a concert with an artist I very much enjoy but I was supposed to work that day. She hyped it up and kept telling me to get it off so I did. I work full time night shifts as an EMT, part time ocean lifeguard, and go to school full time so I value my time since I rarely get weekends off! I was going to sacrifice working the weekend to go to the weekday concert and went out of my way and scrambled to find people to switch my shift. Anyways, I tell her I finally found someone and switched with them. She said she’d buy the tickets and I’d be able to pay her back. Not even 10 minutes later she calls me saying she didn’t want to go anymore. I was pretty peeved because I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to get my original shift back (fortunately I did and was able to have my weekend) so it was whatever at that point. Comes the day of the concert while I’m at work I check her Instagram story and she’s AT THE CONCERT. I confronted her and her excuse was “my friend was in town and it was the only thing that we could think of. She paid for my ticket and don’t tell me you wouldn’t take that chance.” I told her no I wouldn’t have gone because if I pissed my friend off, I wouldn’t do something to piss them off even more. So I didn’t talk to her for awhile. Eventually I forgave her and we started talking and somewhat hanging out again. Her birthday came up a few weeks ago and I did another shift switch so I could make it. At that point I realized on my birthday over summer I was dealing with some heavy stuff and lousy friends and she didn’t make any effort to come whatsoever (had work, was too far, typical excuses). On her birthday with our group of friends I told her I’d pay for her dinner and she ends up getting an appetizer, 2 entrees, and 2 glasses of wine and totally takes advantage of my gesture while knowing I was going to pay for her, my girlfriend, and myself. I know it’s my fault for offering to her but I absolutely know deep down if she were paying for herself, she wouldn’t have spent or ordered that much (I’m an EMT I don’t make that much!!).

375,"Sorry the title sounds kinda click-baity. I just don’t know how to properly express what I’m trying to say, but anyways here goes. Here’s some backstory, I recently transitioned into a different friend group. I knew most of the people from being loosely friends with them before, except this one kid. To be completely honest, I originally thought this one kid was a complete ass at first with the rumors and the stigma around him (they were kinda bad).

Miraculously, we become closer friends and talk a lot. Texts, snaps, and whatever other millennial lingo shit you can think of. He’s really nice and sweet yeah and I had the feeling he sort of liked me and I tried to look past that and sort of brushed it off. At the time, I was in the process of getting over someone else (maybe I still am?). This previous dude kind of didn’t seem interested in me as a person at most times I knew him, yet I found that really attractive. I do not know why to this day, though. Anyway, at this point I’m still actively talking to the first kid mentioned, #1 BFFs on snap and all that. 

Eventually, as most good things do, the whole being super close and talking every waking second thing wore off and came to an end. Now suddenly I just find this kid irresistible and I just don’t know why? Help.

Also side note, am I just specifically sending out a message for people to cease and desist interest in me or what?

Let me know if you need more detail, I know this sort of doesn’t make sense but I’m just so scrambled right now. Thanks in advance.",29Jan2018,3
376,"Since I was like 15 nothing really made sense. Just because my parents (and their ancestors) decided to play sex is the only reason I am here? If he jizzed inside my mother like 1 minute later I would not even exist. Why do I have to do stuff just because my parents decided to play sex?

I just do shit because it's excepted of me, because I exist. How ridiculous is that. I fucking hate that I have this attitude. I want to feel normal, like people around me. Travel, engage in relationships, have fun. I can't do any of it, because my stupid attitude is killing all the fun.

380,"So I started a new paid internship immediately after graduating college this past December. I was used to not having to really doubt what the other temps and interns were telling me to do. Particularly, I got made into their goofer unfortunately and let them get under my skin. It led to a really bad angry mass email which I already apologized and talked it out with my supervisor and managers. 

I did emphasize that I’m not adverse to still working with the temps and interns, but I also requested that one of the staff be a mediator between the temps, interns and I at a later date. Just because I don’t trust there to not be a fight between all of us, given how close in age we all are (e.g., recent college grads or young adults in their 20s to 30s). My supervisor was fine with me also just asking to be allowed to be given more space away from the interns and temps, and advised me that the only ones I should be listening to for directions and checking for stuff like meetings are the staff only - not other temps and interns.

One thing I did try that seemed to work, way before I got to speak with my supervisor and managers, was to already tell one of the temps that I was busy. Their intent to ask if I was busy is what I’ve learned is instead a codeword for them to give me a task that they think I should be doing instead of what I appeared to be doing - which was sitting at a desk supposedly doing nothing (which the admin assist in charge of all the interns and temps already said was fine for me to do). I was actually checking emails and reorganizing the supply cabinet, which was cleared for me to do instead of the data entry that all the other temps and interns were doing. Since I only had three hours that day, from 9am to 12pm, it didn’t seem logical to ask to do data entry when it takes an hour to already to get into, with the practice and brief training, if I’ve never done it before.

Sorry if this ended up being too much of a rant. In this kind of situation, what would the best way to deflect the temps and interns who give me tasks but don’t actually specify in their language that they were told to do so by another staff? It’d be different if they had said instead something like, “hey, Joe said to do this task next when you’re done with that.” Instead of looking at me and assuming that just because I look free, I need to be told what to do next.",29Jan2018,2

383,"tl;dr I'm a cog in the machine and I want a purpose.

So for a little background, I live with my fiance (together almost 6 years, engaged for 2). We have no kids, and don't plan on having any (gonna be a couple of DINKS). We decided that between the health conditions that run rampant in our family, and the expected condition of society/the world on the path it is now we don't want to bring children into the world. We may adopt a few years down the road when we have our own place and are more financially stable, but for now and the next, I'd say, 5-7 years, there are definitely no plans for children. 

I went to school for art. I originally wanted to be an elementary art teacher, but we all know the way that job is going. I love art and it is my passion, but there's not really much I can do with an art degree besides teach. I do dabble in commission pieces, but I work full-time, and the commissions are not my breadwinners, just side projects.

I've been pretty depressed lately. I feel like all we do is wake up, go to work to pay bills, come home, chill for a couple hours and then go to sleep. Wake up the next day and repeat the process day in and day out. And I know that that is how everyone lives...that's how society works unless your a hedge fund baby or your daddy's a lawyer or doctor or something and you have family money. But I just feel like I need more. I need more of a purpose in my life. Right now the only thing I wake up for is my dude (and my furbabies, of course). He's my life force. The only reason I want to live.
 
I love my job. I work in a call center and we have enough downtime between calls to be able to bring my sketchbook and draw or something, hell, I've even taken my watercolors to work a few times. I appreciate that I have a stable job that I'm really good at (I constantly am praised by the supervisors on how well I'm doing. Better than people who have been here for years). And I plan on going far in the company. But while it pays well enough for us to pay our bills, live comfortably and get to enjoy some extras, it doesn't give me a purpose.

I'm not religious at all. I grew up southern baptist and was actually a children's minister for 2 years before I moved for college. Between what I saw behind the scenes in that tiny church, and how I saw people (including my family) treated at the larger churches we had previously tried in town...I just can't give religion the time of day. It is so corrupt and misled. And I'm a big fan of science, so that really conflicts with religion. There's just so much that we as humans don't know, that we cannot say for certain what does and does not exist, let alone be certain enough to worship it. But, that's a rant for another day. There's not enough room on reddit's servers for my thoughts on religion.

I have no kids, I have no career that sings to my soul. I feel lost. I want a purpose. I want something that I can all mine. That I can tell my possible future grandkids I did, that I accomplished.

I had a lady inspire me a while back to delve into a new branch of art. I am a 2D artist by trade. I can draw, paint, do digital art. But I saw this lady's wire jewelry and fell in love. She inspired me to take it up. I plan on taking some of the bonus I receive from work in the next month to buy some more supplies and get the chance to make higher quality purchases than I am able to now, and get a good inventory made up and *hopefully* get a little side business up and going. I know that my city would eat something like this up. I want to get some inventory together so that I can get a table at some of the art/craft fairs we have here in town when the weather warms up. That's my plan. I'm hoping that maybe if I have a business (even if it's super small) I can have something to give me a purpose. I won't be just a cog in the machine. I want to contribute something to society besides income taxes.

396,"Hello everyone. We're having an issue within our family and need some advice. Please let me know if there's a better suited subreddit for this. 

Background info-
My husband and I have a 3 year old daughter and a new baby. 
My husband's sister has a 17 year old and a 5 year old son. 
Our 3yo and their 5yo have always been very close. 

I will use the name Ashley for my daughter and Noah for her cousin. 

The situation-

A few weeks ago my husband and our 2 kids went over to his sister's house. I was going out to dinner with my girlfriends and his sister and their older child went to a movie so it was my husband, our kids, his brother in law, and our nephew at their house. My husband, our baby, and his BIL were watching a movie downstairs so Ashley and Noah were upstairs watching a kids movie together in Noah's room. My husband went upstairs to check on them and after a couple of minutes Noah said ""can you leave? You're making me uncomfortable."" My husband said no and stood up there watching the movie with them pretty much the whole time. On our way home Ashley was acting a little off and I was really scared that something inappropriate had happened. I asked her some questions and was very careful not to lead them in any way. Based off of her answers we are confident that nothing happened. We told her that she could always talk to us and not to keep secrets even if someone tells her she has to. She fell asleep so the next day we had a talk with her again about not keeping secrets, what to do if she's uncomfortable, and what kind of touching isn't allowed. Based off of what Noah said to my husband and the overall feeling he had we decided that we would watch them carefully the next time they were together. 

Yesterday we were all at my husband's brother's house to celebrate his birthday. His sister and her family were there as well. An hour or so into the party I walk into the kitchen and see Ashley and Noah hugging in the laundry room and Noah has his hands on Ashley's butt. He's quite a bit taller than her and even bending down to give her a hug his hands wouldn't be near her butt. I said ""don't touch her bottom"" and he said ""okay"" quietly then I made them come out into the family room with everyone else and told them not to go into other rooms. Hawk mode activated. I started talking to my other SIL and fill her in on what happened a few weeks ago and today. She agrees that he makes her uncomfortable as well and says she'll help keep an eye on them. A little while later they were running around and then went down the back hall. I get up and follow them and they're sitting on the futon set up in the office and Noah is kind of on top of Ashley. I told them ""no. Get up. No coming into the rooms."" After a bit I ask SIL2 to watch them so I can go feed my baby in the other room. My husband came in to check on me and I told him what had been going on. He said he would keep a close eye on them and we would discuss what to do when we got home. I finish feeding the baby and give it to SIL. I go into the kitchen and Ashley is sitting at the table and Noah is standing behind her chair- nothing particularly alarming but as soon as I walk in the room and Noah sees me he instantly says ""we're just in here"" which I find very odd. 

My husband and I have talked a little bit and we agree that we don't want Noah around Ashley anymore. We need some advice on how we should go about talking to his sister. She's nice for the most part but she's one of those people who lies and exaggerates for attention and can be difficult to have a conversation with. Also her husband is bipolar and they're currently having issues right now so I already know this will be a complete shit show. I really hate to rock the boat for the older child because they're a fantastic kid and on such a great path in their life and I'd hate to add more stress for them with everything else that they have to live with but this needs to be addressed. We refuse to ignore these clear signs and allow our child to be victimized. I never in a million years thought I'd have to deal with something like this in my life but I'll be damned if I'm not going to protect my kids. 

So how should we go about having this conversation? What are some prompts for what we should say? 


TL;DR my husband's 5yo nephew has behaved innappropriately with our 3yo daughter and we don't want him around her. How do we tell his family we're concerned and don't want their kid around ours anymore?
