0,"my dad would kiss my neck for years and i didn't really want him to but he always explained it away. he had a game called the palate game where he'd tickle the roof of my mouth with his finger. i asked him about this game and he said ""what? you don't do that with your girlfriends?"" for years he'd wrap his legs around me when we were watching tv in bed together and stuff. he once had me drink a cup of vinegar water once when i had a stomach ache. he'd pressure me to eat a lot, he doesn't really eat and it's like i was eating for him. he's been a victim of a lot of abuse so i feel so awful having these feelings but sometimes this bad feeling just hits me and i feel really fucked up. he loves me so much, but sometimes it almost feels like too much, why the fuck am i complaining about that thats not a problem lmao! my grandma says he treats me more like his wife than his daughter but she doesn't think he'd ever hurt me. he conflates our identities a lot and acts like we're the same person. just, shit feels... off. i don't see him too much these days, i'm 17 and have kinda distanced myself \(my parents are separated\), not for any express reasons, but there is something that just sits at the back of my mind and comes up once in a while and i can't seem to disappear the thoughts this time, were the things i described appropriate? i know they're really small so it's stupid to fixate, i wasn't even thinking so much about these specific things at first, there's just this feeling of doom and OH SHIT SOMETHING HAPPENED that hits me sometimes and those are the only things i can really think of",31May2018,0
1,"I have a serious medical condition that has been ongoing for over a year now, and I smoke marijuana because it helps tremendously with the pain. My doctor just told me I should consider medical marijuana now that it's legal in my state but I was looking over the paper work and it states that they take a urine drug test. I dont do ANY other types of drugs or anything so I'm wondering if the fact that I currently smoke will prevent me from getting approved for medical marijuana.

2,"I chew 15 sticks of Extra Polar Ice everyday at work, but i feel like I need something tougher to chew.  I feel like I chew with so much force that my teeth making contact could lead to wear.  I've been trying to monitor my chewing and chew with less force, but that's not something I can continuously focus on.  I know that some gums are softer than polar ice, such as the Orbit flavors I've tried, so I figure there must be a gum that's tougher to chew than polar ice.  Also, sugar free is preferred.",31May2018,1
3,"Hi there,

A few months ago, I moved out of my house and in with a friend because of a really, really nasty situation going on with my family. Now we’ve all reconciled and my family is welcoming me to come back, but I’m worried that makes me kind of like a loser. 

I’m 19, I have a job, and I’ve been attending community college and will continue in the fall, have a dog and my own car. I want to move back because being gone made me realize how much I took my family for granted and how much I missed them. I’m having a hard time on my own. I have no savings. If I were to move back home, I’d be more financially stable, have the support of my family, and not be so stressed all the time. I’ll be moving out again in another year or two to attend university. 

Am I a loser if I move back home? Like, am I going to seem like a mooch or some fool living in the basement? How do I get over feeling like I’m a failure for moving back?",31May2018,2
4,"Should I quit, I'd rather be fired so unemployment could hold me over a bit, but I'd rather just not go in tomorrow and say it wasn't a good fit. 
Basically it's a 9-6, i get home at 7:40PM if i leave not working overtime - there is no overtime, salaried (which is fine, just thought i'd mention). I feel like I'm on call 24/7 and that the work I do after hours is for nothing, because it's either changed or rejected or resolved some other way. Also, I don't think the work the company does is important. It's events for rich people and influencers so rich people can get richer. Today the feed back I got was, I don't get it, I don't get how you work, you need to present your work with research, do you research. So what am I supposed to create?

6,"So I have \(well, had\) this friend who happens to be a female. We’re closer than most people would be, but we don’t have nor want a romantic relationship. Unfortunately, our close friendship has brought a lot of rumors about and, I mean, I can’t blame people for a first hand assumption of us dating. However, what did upset me is after we tell people that nothing is going on, they persist at the idea that we’re dating. It got bad enough where being around each other was sort of uncomfortable for me. I wanted to vent to my mom about how much it’s been bugging me \(because that’s what moms are there for, right?\) and I did... a lot.   One day, I had this person over because she wanted me to see a movie or something but we just sort of hung out and nothing happened. My mom, oddly enough, had a work thing to go to or something and I didn’t know about it until she told me she was leaving and she left.  Then she continued to return home and come down to the lower floor and kept telling me “I forgot this” or “I forgot that.” This wasn’t just a one time thing and she came and left about three or so times. Then the last time she came down, I went up with her and asked her what was up because it was awfully strange of her to do this. She then made the implication that my friend and I were dating. I was not okay after that because she’s my mom and what she says is incredibly important to me.  


A few days later, I had to go on a trip across the country for a school thing and my mom of course wanted me to text her everything that happened. Quite frankly, I was too upset with her to text her. Now that I think about it, I should’ve been a bit more considerate, but I was still too upset to want to talk to her. The trip was a good time, but I didn’t talk to my friend for most of it and I didn’t talk to my mom either. The thought of everything that had occurred was lingering in the back of my head for most of it. Anyway, I finally return home after about a week and things with my mom seem okay and I start to let it go. I get from school a few days later incredibly exhausted because I had a very busy day. I’m visibly tired. My mom then says, “You know I think your phone is the reason that you’re so tired all the time.” I’m confused at first and I snap back, “I’m sorry what?” She goes on to say, “Well are you texting people really late at night?” Now I’m even more confused because, yes, I sometimes stay up late on my phone, but not usually past 11 or so. I work hard in school and my grades show that and I’m not really a trouble\-child at home. I said, “I mean, not usually. Sometimes I guess.” She proceeds to give me a look of both anger and frustration. “Well you better think about it, hand me my computer.” In my head, I have a thousands thoughts swirling around at once: “What is she gonna do?” “I don’t think I stay up late?” The list goes on. Next thing I know she’s on our phone carriers website and she goes to a tab that shows the time stamps of all of the texts I’ve ever sent and received. “What about this? You see this? 12:53 AM are you kidding me?!” She’s pretty heated about it. I look at the date and it’s a Saturday night and I tried to explain it to her but she stopped me mid sentence. “I don’t care what day it is, texts that late are unacceptable!” Then she looks at the phone numbers. They’re all from the same number. I think to myself, “This is probably my friend and she’s gonna try to bust me.” I did text that person a lot, but not extremely excessively or anything. So I put the number into my phone and it’s actually one of my close guy friends. I show my mom and, let me tell you, I have never seen such pure fury flush away from someone’s face. “Oh, well, make sure he doesn’t do it anymore, okay?” I got troubled that she totally invaded my privacy, but she’s my mom and she sacrifices everything to put me through school, so I can’t call her out for it. Some time passes and I she brings it up every so often and says: “I don’t get why you become so upset about that.” I don’t know why I did, but I did. I was just so sick and fed up with the constant rumors. I stopped talking to that person because I just couldn’t handle it anymore. After a while I snapped and said, “You know, I don’t mind when people make the first hand assumption because I can see why they might guess that. What upsets me is when people say we are after I said that we aren’t.”  


About a month after that, I try to talk to her about my problems again. This time it’s about my psycho teacher who bases our grades off of art projects rather than our comprehension of the subject. I’m pretty bothered by her teaching method, but I only had one more quarter with her. I came home a lot of days and told her about that days project, but I just had to let off some steam. Her first bit of advice: “Talk to a counselor about it.” So I go to the school counselor and he says that I won’t have that teacher the next year and I’m pretty excited to hear that. I go home and I tell my mom and everything seems alright. I still vented about that teacher a lot, but I was alright. Then one day she stops me mid\-sentence again and says, “I’m just gonna write a letter to the principal about her and have her fired.” \(Keep in mind, my mom is the “Can I speak to your manager” type.\) I told her that there is no chance that I’m gonna let her do that because it’s one lousy teacher and life will move on. She doesn’t care and keeps the idea in mind while using the argument: “I don’t see why you won’t just talk to someone above her!” I had to ask my dad to calm her down and, luckily, she did, but she didn’t drop it.  


The “I don’t see why you don’t...” argument was common for the next few weeks, so I just told her that she probably won’t see it then because I’ve tried explaining it to her quite a bit.   Recently, I’ve been trying to talk to her about things again, and she seems to be breathing down my neck a lot less. But when I do try to talk to her, she’s glued to her computer/phone screen and doesn’t make any effort to even act like she’s listening. Yes, I use my phone a lot, but I don’t totally ignore her. She keeps saying I need to do stuff around the house without being asked to do it, but I’m not a mind reader and I don’t know what she wants done.   

Today, my sister calls her in the car and since she’s driving, I take the phone off the dash and put it on speaker. My sister needs to vent about her job or something and my mom just listens and gives her advice and I can tell that she truly cares, and that hit home. All I want from my mom is advice. I don’t want her to try to solve all of my problems. I just want someone who I can talk to and trust to have my side. That’s it. I don’t ask her to buy much for me. I don’t drink or do drugs. I’m just trying to stay in school and go to college. But she still doesn’t trust me to give me privacy. I don’t have anything to hide. I tell her when I’m in a relationship or whenever I stay out late. Risk and Monopoly are long games and they take several hours, okay?  

I know she does a lot for me and I love and appreciate her very much for everything that she does, but things are just getting tough.",31May2018,1
7,"Okay so I dunno I guess I just want to see what other people's thoughts are on this? Is it normal? What can I do to stop? But kinda don't want to stop?


I rub my feet on my duvet sheets. I always have done since I can remember. I like when the fabric gets bobbly (?) and I rub my feet on those bobble bits and the foot rubbing causes more bobbly bits. I have one single duvet sheet that I don't even put over a duvet. I just lay it under my current duvets. I've had this sheet since I was like... 12 years old, (26 now) and it's totally bobbly and worn and it feels great rubbing my feet on it. 


Now I know people rub their feet together to fall asleep etc but I can't stop doing it. I don't really want to because it gives me such satisfaction. But it's kinda interruptive too. Like... I won't sleep for literal hours because I'm too busy rubbing my feet on the sheet. I won't get out of bed for hours or ill go back to bed to lay on my phone and rub my feet. And now I've noticed like... raw bits on my toes which I assume is from rubbing since its exactly where I rub. It now hurts to rub my feet and yet still I do it cause it still feels good. Just raw pain too. Which has lead me to think maybe I shouldn't be doing it? Why do I do it? I don't know... if I get new sheets with no bobbles I end up falling asleep a lot quicker because I'm not faffing with my feet but that's rare because I will usually bring out my old sheet so I have something to rub my feet against even though it's disruptive and now painful. 


It's like I HAVE to do it? I dunno I'm kinda rambling but I just wanted to get some thoughts on it? Does anyone else do this? How do I stop? Should I stop? I probably should but I don't want to? Any advice is great!",31May2018,3
9,"Hey everyone. I was hoping to get some advice on my current situation and a situation I am going to find myself in in approximately 4\-6 months from now.

So I am a 25 year old guy living in a suburb of Orlando, Florida. I live in an apartment with 4 other people, live in a room that isn't even a bedroom, and work part\-time from home as a graphic designer. I have a bachelor's degree in graphic design and do not have \(and can't afford\) a car.

In approximately 4 months I will no longer have health insurance, and in December my lease on this apartment ends. Also, of course, I have student loans that I will eventually need to start paying off.

For reasons that are far too complex to delve into here, I can't really leave this apartment until my lease ends in December \(unless an absolutely *amazing* opportunity presented itself.\)

So anyway, I need serious advice. In December, when this lease ends, I need to be living somewhere else \(open to anywhere in the US except the Northeast\), have a full\-time job &amp; health insurance, and be living in a place that allows me to get to my work without having a car. \(The job does *not* have to be related to by graphic design degree.\)

Oh, and in addition to this, the *absolute minimum* amount of money I would need to be making in this new job is $20,000 yearly \(obviously I'd love more, but that's the minimum\).

Can anyone offer me any sort of advice? Where should I look? How can I find a job before moving to a new location? As the title suggests, I'm very close to being screwed, and I'd really prefer that didn't happen. I'm open to any and all suggestions.  Thanks.",31May2018,0
10,"I cannot bear seeing myself in pictures. I always nitpick and pay attention to all of my 'flaws', and I'm well aware that the flaws I pick out are probably \(1\) minuscule things that no one else notices, and \(2\) things that aren't really flaws at all that I'm just looking down upon myself for for no reason, but I still do it and I feel like it's impeding on my life.

So many friends and people I know have an abundance of pictures of themselves on social media \- Instagram, Facebook, etc. \- but I don't and I feel like I'm missing out. I'd love to be able to have a nice Instagram feed or at least feel comfortable enough with a picture of myself to post it, but I honestly can't think of a single picture of myself that either I or someone else took that I like. 

Generally, I'm fine with someone else taking a picture that includes me and posting it, but over time I grow more anxious about it. For instance, I went to a small pool party several weeks ago and almost everyone there posted the group photo. I took a single glance at it and I was happy with it, I even thought I looked pretty good in it! But after seeing it three or four times in my feed I began to think, ""God, I look so strange from the shoulders up!"" and just ignored the picture any time I've seen it since.

I hate that I feel this way about pictures of myself because in every other aspect of my life... I'm not self\-conscious. I've been told by friends that they wish they could feel as confident about themselves as I always seem to be around others. I often get compliments on my hair, my makeup, my smile and outfits... but I feel like a completely different person when it comes to being photographed. 

I just want to be able to feel proud and content with pictures of myself, but it's something I've struggled with my entire life. Any advice? Thank you!",31May2018,1

14,"26 still in school. Tried it on and off and now finished my first academic year full time finally.  All my friend are done and have stable jobs meanwhile I was battling myself (depression and anxiety)  for a good 8-10 years on and off , and still am. 

-Have a part time job at Walmart 2/ weekly. -

-Learning to drive 10 years later.  

*My life is basically going in slow motion and my parents and brothers keep nagging me.* 

Things I get asked daily that literally make me want to strangle myself: 

-Why aren't I cooking and doing all the house work If I'm home basically all the time aka the chores I do EVERY SINGLE day get no recognition 
meanwhile my (twins) brothers do nothing and everything is fine 
my parents said: it's a shame I can't cook full meals and am fooling myself with only washing dishes, vacuuming, mopping, windex-ing, and empty/filling the dishwasher if that's all I do. (Me mentally: thanks )  

- why don't I have a job sleeping till afternoon doesn't help them or me (no fucking shit Sherlock ) and Walmart twice a week /part time doesn't count 

- my brother tried to get me a full time job but I didn't want it  because it involved me pausing school for a full two years and it took me SO SO long do get used to school and finish a full time year with a 3.5 gpa that I couldn't just give it all up 
So I decided to email the manager and say thanks but no thanks 
Side note: WHY WOULD I WANT TO WORK 10 M Away from him in a small office when we barely talk and he's so controlling of ALL aspects of my life (where I am, who I talk, what I am doing and with who ) 
Fast forward two months and Now EVERY 3 days I am reminded that I could've gotten the job but clearly I screwed up somewhere because all the positions got filled up (he doesn't know I emailed the manager and said no thank you ) 

- why am I not practising my driving and taking it more seriously  (because I get such bad anxiety 

I used to wonder why I sleep so much but now I realize sleeping is the ONLY thing that I can control that involves me and when I wake up all I hear is constant nagging so why would any sane person want to escape in their own sleep. 

What do I do for the next 3 months to save myself 
Moving out is not an option if this was an option I would've 8 years ago but getting disowned without a full post education and stable job (income ) isn't ideal. 

Disclaimer.... I understand I am not an ideal child to my parents either I am 26 still at home who sleeps all day if given the choice,  helps with all chores but never cooks, can barely drive and isn't even done school. I am a loser I feel it and I know it but I'm actually trying which is the sad thing. 
(twin 28 year old brothers  still at home but they have jobs and never help out willingly  they also have their own cars and don't have an overprotective investigator sister aka what they are to me) 

In summary
How do I stay sane if everything is slow motion and I am constantly being nagged with what's written above it billets  every 2-3 days. 

What do I do I feel like running away but I have no money and have school in September and the same part time job for 10 years and don't want to get disowned but getting nagged at every 2-3 with heavy stuff is slowly breaking me.

One sabbath Jesus and his disciples were going through the grainfields; and as they made their way his disciples began to pluck heads of grain. The Pharisees said to him, “Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath?” And he said to them, “Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need of food? He entered the house of God, when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and he gave some to his companions.” Then he said to them, “The sabbath was made for humankind, and not humankind for the sabbath; so the Son of Man is lord even of the sabbath.”

Again he entered the synagogue, and a man was there who had a withered hand. They watched him to see whether he would cure him on the sabbath, so that they might accuse him. And he said to the man who had the withered hand, “Come forward.” Then he said to them, “Is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the sabbath, to save life or to kill?” But they were silent. He looked around at them with anger; he was grieved at their hardness of heart and said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was restored.

This being said, she supposedly has no other valid forms of income that I am aware of, but I figure I would know if she did because both of my roommates are very close friends of mine, and we go back many years. I know a lot about them, or so I think I do. Recently, this particular roommate of mine has been purchasing expensive handbags, jewelry, clothing, and accessories, FAR beyond the means that her supposed income could ever hope to provide. I know this to he true because I, too, spend frivolously on such things (not handbags though); however, my income situation is quite a bit different from her's. To give you an example, she just got back from a luxurious trip with a brand new $5,000 handbag and $400 belt. Since I know her, I know there is no way she can support this lifestyle, but this is anything but the first major purchase she has made in recent months. Should I be concerned that she is selling illegal drugs or may be prostituting?

tl;dr: My roommate, and very good friend, has spent her entire annual salary (as a nail salon tech) or more on luxury items and trips in the past few months without providing any clue as to how she has acquired the funds for this. Should I be concerned for suspicious activity

Sidenote: before you jump to conclusions, again, I have known this girl for about 10 years. I know she does not hail from money.

Right now I'm thinking about going into a machinist course as a way to start a career young and save up money to go to a 4 year uni, though I'm scared of the risks involved, (ex. missing fingers). What are some other trades that I can learn that'll translate into a good career to fall back on in-case college doesn't work out?",31May2018,2
27,"I cheated on my father of my child for a year and a half I didn’t consider it cheating due to the fact we weren’t together. But I had moved on and never told him. You can say I did leave him on the back burner.  I cheated and yes I want to do everything to be a better person and work things out for our family. 

Quick background, we had our child at me 16F &amp; him 18. The relationship was always on and off, it took him a while to mature and be there for our child. Until the age about two he finally showed he changed for his family. Change as in mature and be there and help. We were fine for three years until we came up on year 5 and I felt as if he didn’t want to get married or have more children. I nagged/begged for the engagement for all those things I wanted. I didn’t get it and I just left. Left as in ended the relationship. Hence we never lived together because he never took the initiative of having us live with him.

I ended things and met someone else but I never told him scared I’d be called every name in the book. And I also had a feeling the time apart he’d change and he’d stop being lazy, or just finally want the same things. 

More than two months ago he found out about my infidelity. I came clean about everything and was begging for forgiveness and another chance. I played with fire and I got burned. I started to go to counseling immediately after even tho he didn’t want to. And made it clear he didn’t want to work things out. 

Two months went by and I had moments where I cried and begged for another chance to make things right. And prove I can change and I would never do such a thing again. Two weeks ago he agreed to go to counseling I thought it went well but he said he didn’t want to go again. I accepted it and I did what he asked of me which was to leave him alone and just accept the fact the relationship was over.

An incident at school with my child happened and I cracked, I cracked and continued to beg but not as bad after a week of no contact. I then asked him if my child and I could stay with him. And that led to us spending all of the Memorial Day weekend together. It went well, he agreed to work things out. We both agreed it’d take time to fix our relationship and a lot of communication. What even struct me was that he even said “if you ever feel the urge to cheat on me again tell me so we can work on it”.. 

It went well, it was made very clear to his family that we were working things out. And at the end of the weekend he suggested to move in with him and finally start that family home I always wanted.

Fast forward to today, I saw him this morning because he had an interview at the feds agency I intern at. Things were fine I wished him luck and gave him a a hug and kiss goodbye. He never ended up texting me later that afternoon.

I get a message from someone who I thought was my friend but I cut ties with due to the fact they were telling his sister all the details on my infidelity. When I apologized to his mother for my behavior and my actions towards her son in order to mend our relationship she advised to not trust that friend and to cut them off. Which I did. 

Again fast forward to today they messaged me really horrible things calling me a liar all the curse words you can think of. Because she once told me about his sisters husbands doubts about her husbands infidelity. Which I mentioned to my childs father two months ago when my infidelity came to light to get him to at-least understand that everyone has heir doubts and issues in a relationship and get passed it or just keep it behind closed doors.

Low and behold my child’s father told his mom about what that friend told me and I told him. And this is why he never responded and hasn’t even mentioned anything. Ignored my calls and such today. So basically I’m painted as a liar and all those things once again and my child’s father has made it clear with his lack of wanting to speak about it that he no longer wants to work things out. Taking back the steps we took to try and work things out.

I let him know that I didn’t appreciate the fact I told him something very private and he went and ratted me out. He said he was sorry that he didn’t know his mother would tell his sister. Which she proceeded to call out the so called friend. 

I not only got cursed out by the person I thought was my friend at one point but all the hope I had on working things out is out the window. Since she has already painted me lair to his sister and mother but also is threatening me to tell them the whole truth about my infidelity. I say this because it’s pretty obvious they were talking bad about me and all the things I trusted them with to my child’s fathers family. 

I have this knot in my throat again. And I can’t even focus on my school work. I want to so bad see it as a sign that it just was never going to work out and run. But Idk I just feel horrible because we had started packing and my child was so happy to finally live together as a family hence their six now. 


I asked him after he apologized to please have that heartbreaking conversation with out child on how that is not going to happen anymore. I’ve gotten nothing but ok and alright answers from him. Idk what to do. I know my life is insane you don’t have to remind me.

I’m just a young mom trying to finish my last semester in college and be the best I can for my child.

30,"So I'm in high school and my best friend has been missing a lot of school for various reasons. She says that her stomach hurts or that she's in a funk. When she tells her mom though, she gets upset and they start fighting which usually results in the mom saying, ""Whatever. Do what you want,"" and my friend responding,""Fine,"" and staying home stewing. The two have been fighting for months about issues in the mornings. Anyway, my friend has gotten letters from truancy officers so it is getting serious. I don't know how to respond because on one hand, I want to be a good friend and listen but also, I feel a bigger obligation to help her fix this. This won't work past high school. She would get dropped from a class or fired for all of the absences. I just feel like she needs to at some point suck it up and get her shit done. She's giving up far too quickly. So do I try to tell her this and hopefully get her to change her behavior or do I not say anything? I just can see how this will play out later in her life and want to help her push past this.

36,"Hello all, I need advice.

I work EMS. I’ve been a paramedic for 3 years and it’s been an experience. The short story is I hate it. I went to school and paid all that money to become a paramedic and after doing it for 3 years, I’ve learned that I hate it. So, I’ve decided to make a career move and I’m moving to a job completely different. 

The big issue is that I struggle with professional censorship of myself. I speak my mind. I give the blunt truth to my co workers, my supervisors, my managers and I don’t filter what I say. I’m not talking about cursing or anything like that, I’m talking about saying exactly what I’m thinking when I shouldn’t say it.

For example, I’ve been in the exodus phase at my current job. My manager called me into his office today to talk to me about what’s been going on with me and why I’ve been “quieter or different”. Instead of just expressing that I want to move onto different career paths and better myself in other ways, I looked him in the face and said “I hate this place.” 

The truth is, I do hate this job...but there’s no reason as to why I should have responded like that. I have a habit of burning bridges because I don’t censor myself and i don’t know how to stop. 

It’s affected friendships, professional opportunities and more. I hate the idea of kissing ass but I know that I need to learn how to play the game if I want to move up in my professional life. 

Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.",31May2018,1

Back ground .....

25 year old guy still living with his parents. Currently got this new job as a pool technician seasonal with the best pool company on the Eastern seaboard. Plan is to hold the job until October when the season ends and move from New Hampshire to Dallas Texas and do this year round. After I've saved up a bunch of money. move out of my parents place and go for it. Finding a job that pays at least 18 an hour



 I've been working there a month and 21 working days. My problem is I talk too much and no matter how many times I fuc up no matter how many times I know I'm f****** up. I still talk too much and I get paranoid about what people are saying about me and I looked upset all the time and even though I'm working really really hard I still end up managing the sale every single job I've had. I've had 14 different jobs doing the same thing and not doing the same thing since I was 16. I think it's happening again where I'm f****** up so much and the job is getting worse and stressful because I keep on talking too much. To the point where it adds where don't want to do anything cuz I'm just not doing anything and obsessing about over speaking. Smoking pot and ripping on my vape every single day. If I'm not at work I'm not leaving my house.

Not including the isolation and having no friends. But all that is just because I don't know how to and have no friends  to go out with and I don't know what to do to go out to socialize when I'm alone and I feel awkward so I just stay inside.

When I try and make new friends, I feel like I can't because I don't know what to talk about and I just overthink about how I appear to be in stir crazy night can't hold a friendship or I sometimes talk to quietly where someone will say I can't hear you when it makes me upset and I can't go to strangers cold and meet them and get to know them. I feel so stupid and it's scary because I don't want to take a chance when I just feel already in a mood to meet new people. 😥😥😥


No social life in isolation, I don't know what to do.  and freaking out over everything I say at work. I've been on these new medications for the past few months and they're not helping or I'm not going to situations where they could help





If anyone can understand what I just said and relay some cognitive reply to help me with this problem I'm forcing myself to speak of cuz maybe it helps me and maybe I keep this job and go for my dream. Or at least try it. I want to at least try to venture out in October. But if I can't hold this job and I can't learn as much as I can I don't know what I want to do. I feel likeit's over because I don't know what else to do.

40,"To begin, I love my boyfriend dearly, and I know it is reciprocated. Our relationship is honest, and we don’t have many issues. Dating over a year. 

Yet I’ve always had a problem with knowing that my boyfriend finds other girls attractive. I know it’s a natural, human thing to do. It’s the after thought that worries me: is he thinking of her sexually? Is he comparing her to me? Does he wish I looked like that? 
I don’t bother him with this and it’s not overwhelming or causing issues in our relationship. it’s just sad knowing that there is better, and I’m not it. At least from a physical standpoint. 
I’m curious as to how far the after thought should go, and how I can put these crazy feelings to rest and just accept human nature. 
Part of what bothers me is in order for me to be attracted to someone physically, I have to know them personally. It’s hard for me to just see strangers and go “wow that person is super attractive.” I can, however, recognize that someone might be conventionally attractive to others, if that makes sense. Like i am aware that people would find this person attractive, i just don’t. I just have eyes for my boyfriend, it feels like. And I’m starting to realize that it isn’t as common as I thought for people to feel the same way.

43,"Hi. So I'm currently an undergrad in college and I'm beginning to burn out. This burn out started earlier this year when I bit off a little too much to do during my year. I was a full time student and worked 2 internships for the last semester and it truly did kill me. My mood suffered heavily but I toughed it out while telling myself it was simply a semester, that I'd have summer to relax in, and that it'd all benefit me in the end. As the semester began to end, I made a list of things I've been wanting to do. I had nearly abandoned my hobbies and a lot of things that would be considered ""me time"". I got excited.

During that time, I ended up signing up for a community college course for the summer. I imagined it would be easy and gave it no thoughts. Then, after the semester ended, one of my internships begged me to work full time for a couple weeks. I was reluctant but I saw that my summer classes started soon so I, again, obliged. The work was terrible and I hated it but I kept telling myself relaxation was in store. 

My work finally ended and I began my summer class. The class is moving incredibly fast, I'm in school four days a week, and almost all of my down time is spent stressing and studying for the class. I still have yet to break into my list of things I've been wanting to do. 

I looked in the mirror today and a lot of my hair was falling out. I've been procrastinating and have been an inefficient worker. I've been in a bad mood and just generally angry a lot. I've thought about dropping the class but I lose too much money that I don't have and I'm already a little less than a 4th through the class. I also need to get this credit.

How do I stop stressing so much and get my daily life together? I've been wanting to work out this summer and the like but I just laze around and then rush to get my work done. It's terrible and I hate it.

So a little background I'm an 18 year old guy who's mom is difficult to say the least. If I had to pin it down the main issue's would be religion and her.

It's been this way for a while all throughout highschool and it sucked. All throughout highschool i had to fake being a muslim to my mom and step-dad and deal with lying so I could go out with friends which I hate doing.Anyways I thought that I just had a bad luck of the draw when it came to parents and that  once I graduate I'll enlist in the Army and just leave it all behind.

So I need a second opinion on this. Or a lot more than that. 

I’m a girl and the guy I’ve been talking to for ~8 months (I’ve known him longer but we weren’t interested in each other before the 8 months but now we both agreed we are exclusive) just got hit up by one of the girls he used to talk to before me. I believe they were not seriously involved with each other. He has this girl on facebook/instagram/snapchat. They stopped “talking” a while back but she contacted him today on snapchat sounding interested in him again. He told me about it. (Also just found out today this girl would ask him for advice/tips to help her with work every now and then and how to fill out FAFSA.....) I asked for him to delete her off his social media. He said he would for snapchat, but not fb and instagram. It’s all the same to me. I’m not active on social media like he is and he says she wouldn’t message him on fb or ig. This guy is friends with mainly females. I don’t get controlling over that. They’re his friends. But he was involved with this certain female and him still having her on his accounts seems like he is paving the way for her to talk to her. As if he’s welcoming it. 

Now am I a crazy, controlling person for not wanting him to have this person on his social media? I think it’s nosy for that person and still shows he wouldn’t mind talking to her if she wanted to.

49,"I'm 16F and he is 18M. He is not my boyfriend, we are hooking up and have established that we have feelings for each other but I'm not ready for a boyfriend because I just got out of a relationship I've been in since I was 13 a few months ago, right before I met him. We've been hooking up since February.

It started two weeks ago when I had a party at my house. I have really *really* bad depression and anxiety and I cancelled the party that was due Saturday on the Wednesday because I knew I wouldn't be ok to host it. He knew this but decided that I should host it anyways at my house but he would handle everything so it wouldn't be stressful for me. The day of I was texting the group chat to try to find out what everyone wanted for food and they kept ignoring me and making jokes and not answering me, even though I was saying things like ""I need to know right now what I need for food"", ""I'm getting stressed out"", etc. Then only 3 people showed up to the party, including him, all an hour late. Then they spent the night ignoring me when I kept telling them that I needed to go home and that I wasn't feeling okay.

On Sunday, the day after, I called him to try to talk about it and he said he wanted to talk about it in person. I said fine, and we hung up, but the following week he never made any effort to talk to me in person, and he was ignoring my texts. 

The friday (6 days after the party) I confronted him and he said he was ignoring my texts because he isn't good at texting and always comes off the wrong way and upsets me and when I get upset I tell my best friends what happened. So, to clarify, he wasn't not texting back because he didn't want to upset me, he was not texting back because he doesn't think I should be allowed to tell other people when I'm upset with him. 

This pushed me over the edge and made me decide that, fuck him, and fuck the way he's treating me. I texted him that he isn't acting like himself and that if he's going through something or whatever and it's not reflective of him then he needs to let me know and cut his shit, otherwise I'd move on. He never responded to that so I started moving on and decided that I was just going to act civil when I see him in class. 

Yesterday he messaged me, asking when I'd be home alone next. I asked him why he wanted to know, to which he replied ""The heck do you think?"", and I wrote back that I wasn't sure if he was trying to bang or make me host a shitty party but that either way I wasn't happy with the way he's been treating me and I'm not interested in having him over, and that it's stupid that when I stop making the effort he starts acting like nothing's wrong. He read that last night and replied today that he's been busy keeping his grades up and hasn't been dodging me any more than he's been dodging [female friend who doesn't like me and he knows i don't like and who, just after the fight at the party, texted me out of nowhere asking if I ever wanted to talk to her about my mental health issues, which, is shady]. He's like, I'll talk to you about it tomorrow at lunch. I replied that I don't care if we talk about it or not, I'm not going to let him be mean to me. He replies to that ""You show off my texts to people, I don't want to text you. Is that the behaviour you're taking issue with?"" and I wrote back that I had texted him a whole list of behaviours of his that were hurting me on Sunday when he asked why I was upset, and I was ignored, and that if I was hurt and wanted to vent to my best friend then I should be allowed to. Then I sent him that I didn't want to talk anymore and goodnight.

I don't know what to do about this because he never used to act like this and now it's like he's mad at me for being hurt by the shit he's doing. I have to see him every day because we share classes at school and a friend group. 

TLDR : Boy has been being shitty for almost two weeks and has now texted me like nothing happened, and when I reminded him that shit did happen and that I'm still not okay with it, he was acting like I had offended him. I have to see him every day because we share classes and I won't know how to deal with it if he starts acting like this in person.",31May2018,0
50,"Hi Reddit. I want to apologize in advance for the long post and poor grammar, I am a little frantic and just sort of went into rant mode.


TL;DR: Recently left university, moved north to work while I figured shit out, things turned sideways. I am looking for advice on possible paths to take from where I am.


 I am in desperate need of an outside opinion. I am 19 yrs old and I recently withdrew from university in Oregon back in March for personal reasons that specifically had to do with that uni. I am unsure what course of action I want to take next in life and would love to hear what others have to think.

A little about me:
My current academic goal is acquiring my bachelor of science in computer science. I have been told by professors that I am a natural in the field and have always been decent in mathematics, however do not possess the marks to show this due to reasons I will explain below. I was enrolled at my previous college for 2 years but was just barely at sophomore standing when I left due to illness related absences and problems with depression (if not for transferred credits from time spent in the IB program then I would have been at freshman standing). I am worried that I am rushing back into my education and am going to wind up stuck in a place for the next 4 years that is the best interest of my growth or happiness, or just straight up burn out and waste my opportunites and effort already invested. 

When I withdrew from uni my goal was to work for a while so I could take a break and reflect and look into possible options to further my education, so that I would not wind up repeating these last two years at university. I had heard about two of my friends who needed a new roommate in Olympia and, fast forward a couple months, am currently couch surfing at their place until their old roommate moves out. Originally I wanted to work for a while and support myself while paying rent and living with friends, but due to some unfortunate cirumstances was not able to find a job in time. I am fortunate enough to have parents who agree to support me as long as I am in university, and so I applied to Evergreen State College and was recently admitted. Ok great! Now I have a means to support rent...- wait a minute! This totally defeats the main purpose of my moving up to Olympia. I feel like I was somehow tricked by myself to fall into a trap of my own creation.

I'm not sure if I'm ready to go back to college and I feel as if I am rushing into things to quickly.  Evergreen doesn't work on a grade system it releases written evaluations, which makes it very difficult to transfer out of. I am really concerned Evergreen will not be a right fit for me due to some things I've heard from friends and others who have spent time there, as well as some experiences I have had in the area and at the campus, and if this ends up being true I will end up being stuck here for the remainder of my undergraduate studies (which will probably be at least another 4 years since I am not considered to be at sophomore standing at Evergreen). On top of these concerns I was told today by one of my roomates that they want to move out due to petty issues that they have been having for the past few months, unbeknownst to me, even before I put in the effort to coordinate moving all of my belongings up here. Their partner, my other friend living up here, would be moving as well as they would not want to pay for their rent all alone. This nullifies one of my reasons for having moved up here (having friends and not having to totally start over) and fortifies my feeling of beeing tricked somehow.

I feel like I am back at that first square after having withdrawn from university. I want to travel and see the world and explore and learn more, if possible before coming back to finishing my degree. It would be ideal for me to somehow pursue my degree while traveling but I am not sure how feasable this is, if at all, especially for my field of interest and current academic standing (I left on academic probation with a gpa of 2.04 as a result of a gradual decline in my mental health before I was able to seek professional help and a diagnosis, along with an entire plethora of dumb luck and less than ideal circumstances). I am thinking the Pacific Northwest is not the best place for me to be because of the weather and how it affects my mood on top of my depression, and because I was not orignally planning to stay up here for an extended time period anyways. My ties in the area have grown unstable and moving back to the same location in Oregon is not something I am willing to do anytime soon. 

I have brainstormed some possible options but am open to any advice or input about options not listed here. I have considered:
Moving home and either working or attending community college to improve academic standing to transfer to better universities. I am reluctant to move back in with my parents and have had a falling out with most of my high school friends and am concerned about how my social life would progress. Nonetheless it would be a safe option for me to decide what to do next.
Moving to Southern California to attend college or to work. I do have ideas for a business that would be appropriate for the area but currently lack the experience and know-how, though it would likely be great for networking plus the weather is nicer than the pacific northwest. Plus I have some friends that live in the bay area.
Traveling and lining up gigs/odd jobs as a means to support myself. This option would appease my desire to see new places and give me time to reflect and meet new people before jumping back into a college education. Maybe I'll discover something along the way that I had no idea I was so interested in. (I recently discovered a talent and passion for drawing and have been using that as my creative outlet).

I would appreciate an input on these or any other options/recommendations, or references to places where I could further my discussion or talk to others who have gone through similar situations and what they chose to do.

54,"Ok, so I recently joined a friend's group from a rival school via a close friend of mine, and it'd been two years since my last GF/ date and one year since I'd talked to anyone. Being the person this friend is, he decided to find someone for me, so he tried to set me up with someone from the group. I thought she was cool, but we never we're officially talking or went on a date.
Time passes, I become good friends with a guy from the group, then those two start dating. Time passes, prom is approaching. 
My family's on my ass about getting a girl for prom(I'm the last male on my dad's side), it's my senior year, so my mom wants pictures since I didn't go last year, there's just a lot of pressure. 
I give it a lot of thought(the first and last school dance I went to I ended up dating the girl and I figured out we didn't like each other early on) 
I didn't want that to happen again so I wanted to ask a friend to go explicitly as friends. 
Then, as if god had been listening and gave me a break I had to keep a promise to a friend who had switched schools the year before, and we started talking. She mentioned how she wanted to go to prom at my school and that she's murder me if I didn't have a date. 
I asked her to hang out the day afterward and this same-ish conversation cycled it's way around three or four times.
The very next time we saw each other I asked her to prom, she said yes, yadayadayada
The next Monday I was turning in her outside date forms when her mom called and told me there was a problem with her dad and she wasn't allowed to go.
Then I got real depressed, going home and having to convey the news to my parents got me yelled at, they'd pinned the dad as a racist and I should've asked a black girl.
I spoke to her over the phone that night after a concert I preformed at and she asked me to tell everyone since she was a little broken up about it and didn't want to lose her composure so I told everyone, including the close friend who tried to set me up on a date once joining the friend group.
I ended up not going to prom and just felt depressed about the whole thing, and the good friends I have decided to do something about it. The girl I was being set up with told me I had two 'parent approved' girls(black girls), who were friends of hers and great. Why not?
I asked one of them out, and everything was dry. I'm not very social due to anxiety but it was literally like talking to a brick wall. Not that I didn't like her, she seemed fine, but there was just nothing going on.

A few days later(yesterday, actually) I hung out with my close friend that tried to set me up with the girl who set me up with the brick wall girl and my would-be prom date. Before the close friend got to the meet up place, I got in her car and we talked for a bit.
We'd snap chatted since we talked over the phone but in two months we'd not had a face to face conversation, one on one. There was obvious tension but within the first minute it'd all cleared up. Jokes were had, then close friend arrived, we got in his car, gossip started, and that's when I got the news that this girl id went on a date with a few days prior had a crush on me, and she'd liked the date A LOT.
At first I was flattered until I thought about it, I have to be nice to her, don't want to break her heart by being a dick, but the way the last date went I think we'd be better off as friends. 
As I was typing this I got a Snapchat from her, after work tomorrow I'm going to try and take her to b&amp;n or something, so I think I might tell her then but I just don't know what to do.

People told me I they'd thought prom girl and I had feelings for each other but I think id feel the same way. In my mind and our interactions, were just friends and good ones at that. In the two month period after prom that we didn't talk much I didn't realise how much I appreciated that until we were in the car after the date.

IDK, there's a good reason I want to be an authentic considering this book I wrote but the advice I'm asking for is should I give this girl a chance until a third date or tell her now it's not working. Also how the hell do I tell her that if it does come to it?

I have a full-time job in my field of study now but I've realized my life is not at all what I want and it's causing me to have serious anxiety. Anxiety so bad that I don't eat or sleep as much as I used to. First thing I know I need to do is move out of my parents house but money is TIGHT. My parents guilt me into staying with them because they don't have any money either and they rely too much on me but I just can't keep doing this. They can be very toxic people. I think I'm going to move out anyway but I'm kind of nervous about it. Secondly, I'm lonely as hell and I want a girlfriend. Every time I meet a girl I like she's not available (moves or already has a BF). It's pretty disheartening especially when you see others in healthy relationships. I thought about online dating but that usually just makes me feel even worse because as a male, I get ignored a lot. Plus, I don't want to admit I live with my parents. Anyway, I felt the need to get this off my chest because I'm disappointed in myself and the anxiety that causes feels like it's crushing me.

I used to be interested in a lot of things. Now I'm just interested in having fun and being entertained. I'm more into movies, shows, funny YouTube videos, basically anything entertainment related. 

Some similar examples could be like when a religious person suddenly becomes atheist, and some are like wow so I don't have to be nice and moral and follow all these rules, they suddenly experience a huge shift a change in their life philosophy and mentality. Or when someone realizes they have cancer and will die soon, a lot of times they just focus on enjoying life and nothing else matters.

I think I liked how I changed but I don't know why honestly. I think I just realized that life is short and to just enjoy it, learning about stuff is not as important as it used to be. I don't understand how I just changed, it's like a switch flipped in my head.",31May2018,2

63,"Ever since trying to join the military it’s been disappointment after disappointment without ever ending it. Now it to the point of it giving me seriously bad anxiety. 

I have lived in an abusive house for all of my life and I live in California so I can’t move out considering I need to pay for college, insurance, housing, food, etc. it’s just impossible to move out without my parents help. 

Last Wednesday I went in and spoke to a recruiter and I had to leave early because I had something else going on so we were going to start the paperwork that Thursday. Wednesday at around 6 I remembered I forgot to tell my recruiter about a medical condition I have so I texted the “station commander “ and he never answered. (This left me not even being able to sleep due to the anxiety of getting disqualified) the next day (Thursday) I went in and I talked to my recruiter he said I had to be off of the medication for 8months  then he said 6months and I was like “is it 8 or 6?” And he was like “let’s go with 6first” and at that point I was already kinda irritated that they didn’t know and they were just playing around. Later the station commander texted me and he said it was 3 months. Again, I was irritated so I went in on Tuesday and I asked “hey so he told me 8-6months you told me 3months, can I get a more accurate number?” And he was like 3 months and then asked another recruiter and he was like “it’s 6weeks” I’m just done at this point. So that same day I texted him at 6 because at 5 I had my appointment with my doctor to cancel my treatment and I was told I would be getting a call to tell them what time I needed it so I texted him and said “just to confirm it’s 6 weeks, correct?” And explained why I was asking again and HE NEVER ANSWERED. 

This is so important to me because 1. I love H.E. United States 2. Getting out of here 3. Again, I love the US. And the timeframe is very important because I’m a college student. It will determine if I will be able to make another semester or not and they just don’t seem to understand that. 

Yesterday Tuesday 29th I got a call from another recruiter from another place and I said “oh I’m already going to (name of recruit office) and he was like okay well can I ask a few q?” And I was like sure ahead. And he asked the basic questions to qualify and told me “If the process isn’t going smoothly give me a call” 

If I’m being honest I’m considering calling him tomorrow and asking if I can meet with him. I am sick and tired of these recruiters from this recruit office not knowing. I have explained countless times how important this is to me and they can’t even bother themselves to even look into the time it would take??? Sigh. 

Anyway, today I started getting a bunch of anxiety out of no where. I keep analyzing my body in every way possible looking for possible reasons I might be disqualified and it’s eating me up. I’m constantly thinking about reason I could be disqualified for and thinking “what if’s”. What if I’m disgusted? What if I’m not able to join at all? What if it takes years? Sigh. I don’t know what to do anymore ",31May2018,1

66,"I think my grandmother [70] has a drinking problem. She had gastric bypass surgery about 10 years ago. She's had it long enough to know her limits. But despite that, she still manages to exceed her drinking limits and get plastered at inappropriate times, and my mom and I have to stop what we're doing to take care of her. She's admitted that she feels awkward in social situations and alcohol helps her feel less awkward. She once threw a remote at me and called me a ""shit head"" because I wouldn't talk to her (because I was uncomfortable around her while she was drunk). Just last weekend, she had to be picked up off the floor and put into a cab at a family gathering, all before 5pm. A week or so before that, I caught her driving home buzzed.

Tonight at dinner, I was debating on getting a second beer, and then she told me I was driving us home, even though she drove us there. I told her that wasn't cool to just assume that I would drive us home and her response was ""It doesn't matter, you always take care of me.""

I'm financially dependent on her at the moment, so I have a hard time bringing it up to her how much it bothers me. I feel like I don't have the right. She just assumes that other people will take care of her when she's wasted. I'm already in a stressful place in my life; I work at a sober living, I intern as a research assistant at a local university, I'm preparing to take the GRE and apply to grad schools, and I'm trying to maintain a healthy social life. Part of me feels like an asshole for not wanting to take care of her, but she only needs care when she's drunk. Other than that, she's pretty self-sufficient. She's also admitted to being depressed and prescribed anti-depressants. I don't think she's been taking them. And she refuses to see a therapist. I've tried talking to her calmly about all of it, and I get nowhere. All of this has taken a toll on my own mental health and I'm in the process of getting my own therapist.

68,"My sister got a puppy pitbull and named him Apollo last fall. She got him one hour after my mom said she liked the idea of a dog since she was working at home now.  She cried and we’ll my mom caved, I had to leave to work and didn’t know if we were going to bring him home. 

I love this dog... but at the beginning I could already see the problems that would come up later. For one we got him without knowing all the negativity toward pit bulls. 

Apollo is super sweet albeit extremely energetic. He is 55 pounds and about medium size. We can’t cut his claws cause he’s so energetic and too strong for the vets. He never barks but will whine if he’s ignored and left alone. He hasn’t gotten any formal training except sitting down. 

I spend most of my time with the dog when I get home from school. Up until 10pm when I put him to bed. I also run with him 30 minutes everyday. No one else in my family can walk with him because he’s too strong for them. It has been very hard to study and do homework this school year and it has hurt my grades.

The main problem is my sister.

She has two other cats that are the families but she owns them and will take them and the dog when she eventually moves out. The thing is she spends all her time in her room with her cats and doesn’t give Apollo the attention he needs. Leaving me and my mom to take care of him. She LOVES this dog and cries her heart out when we have talked about not keeping him 3 separate times. 

I sat my mom down about a week after we’ve had him and had a real talk with her about Apollo. I stated the facts and stated that she can’t spend all her time with him while she does her real estate job and that I’m in school and go to practice until 4:30pm Monday through Friday. My sister goes to community college and spends most of her time in her room studying and leaving the dog alone in the living room. The living room isn’t small but my mom doesn’t want him walking through the whole house or he’ll chew everything and because we have wood floors. So the dog mainly spends his time in the living room and backyard which is connected to the living room. 

Sorry for getting sidetracked but I needed to provide some context. But I sat my mom down and told her what I thought about the long term. I told her I’m going to college after I graduate in 2019. And my sister is applying to nursing school this fall and getting in the spring semester. One week she gets in she won’t be around at all leaving me the burden of the dog for a few months in the spring before I leave for college. Also I told my mom the dog will be too big for her to handle. And most importantly it won’t be fair too Apollo if know one spends time with him and he is locked in the living room or outside all the time. 

My mom and I have tried talking too my sister about this 3 SEPERATE times but she won’t listen. She cries and screams at us that she lives this dog and won’t give him up. She says we hate her and that she spent so much money on the dog and his medical and food. She just won’t listen to reason and I know that this dog won’t be with us past the summer of 2019. HELL I think we should send him off this Fall because I don’t want him to have to be suddenly cast out of our lives. 

I truly love this dog and like spending time with him BUT I just want what’s best for him and my family. 

Me and my mom worry that if he put him back in the pound he could be put in a abusive home or a Dog Fighting Ring. I don’t want him to even if it’s a slight chance to be out in a ring.

I feel like it is a chore to be his friend, but I don't know how to tell him to give me a break without seriously hurting his feelings.

I’ve tried to meet up with her a couple times in order to help distract her from it all, but to no avail (the first time we had to reschedule due to conflicts coming up, and the second time she texted me to meet up so we could just talk, but she ended up going an hour and a half away for the day). 

I will admit I do have a thing for her, as I have had since we briefly met almost 9 years ago (and by that, I mean I wrote her a poem and then we ended up becoming friends after we graduated high school), but I’ve kept it under wraps as best I can. 

Honestly I’ve gotten past the point of forming a relationship with her, and all I want now is for her to be happy. I care about her a tremendous amount, and consider her my best friend and the closest I’ve been with someone in a long time.

So I make the call. The guy is kind of a rude and abrupt with me, but whatever, I don't let small things like that get to me. I decide to write a short message for him to read when he gets there later, simply stating what I noticed happened before it stopped working and to let me know if I can help in any way. I get several angry messages later from him threatening everything but actual violence towards me(if he did, I'd already be talking to the police).

My landlord is also kind of a dick and I have a feeling that he's going to try and pass these fees on to me. I begrudgingly sent him back a brief ""sorry"" message, trying not to entice him any further. I then sent my landlord a long message about how everything happened and that he is trying to extort them for money.

We   were NC after our first breakup for about 5 months. During those   months, I discovered he had gone back to his ex  \(who he was dating when   he &amp; I met...and who he, according to our mutual friends, was   dating as he started to get feelings for me. I ended up confessing my   feelings to him, and he said he felt the same. A couple weeks later they   broke up, so he and I began casually dating until we became official\).   So mind you, when I found out he was back with her, after dating me  for  10 months, I was pissed.

He posted a   picture of them on FB infront of a skating rink. Mind you, he  NEVER   posts on fb \(maybe 2\-3 times a year\), so I had a feeling he knew  I'd   see it, and wanted me to see it.

Literally   just one month later, he reaches out and broke our NC.  I'm pissed   still.

Fast  forward 3   months of us being 'friends' and he admits feelings, and  wants me back.   At first I'm hesitant, I still don't know if I could trust him.

He   agrees to meet up with me in person and fights so hard to have me back   and to give ""us"" another try, he knows what went wrong last time and   knows what to fix this time. In person, I say I'm not sure and he said   that was okay, and that ""he'd wait for me, even if that meant we just   stay friends"". So we keep chatting and messaging and before I know   it...I change my mind and eventually give in.

We date for the second time from August 2017\-January 2018. Guess why I dumped him this time??

I   found out he was talking with his ex again behind my back. Like this   girl literally never disappears! I told him it upset me and he said he   didn't want to hurt me, or lose me, so after about two hours of   disputing over it, he said he would cut the contact ""if it means he   doesn't lose me"". I believed him \(LOL, bad mistake\).

I   find out after Christmas that he went to a birthday party for his  &amp;  his ex's mutual friend, and when I asked him if she went, he said  yes.  And that they still talk. But he SWORE to me that they weren't  wanting  to get back together. I quote him ""Even if you and I broke up,  and I was  single, I still wouldn't go back to her. Then you'd really be  able to  see I'm being honest"". Despite him wanting me to know that he  wasn't  interested in her/wanting to date her again/only wanted me and  to not  hurt me.....I left. I knew I'd be uncomfortable and worrying  constantly  over it, so I decided to breakup with him and leave the  picture ASAP.

It's   been NC since  January. I haven't heard from him except for when he   reached out at  the beginning of February, because my grandfather had   passed away and  he heard about it. Sent me his condolonces/hoped I was  doing ok. \(i  didn't reply\).

I can only  assume that  he's back with his ex again, hence the limited contact from  him. I'm so   pissed, why does he KEEP doing this stupid cycle?? What  does she  honestly have  that I don't have?

What   confuses me most is that yes, she may have been the first GF, but   literally everyone could see he didn't really care for her 100&amp;#37;. They   began dating when she was a junior &amp; he was a senior in HS, and he   didn't even take her to prom \(instead, he spent all of prom night   dancing and hanging w me...\). He even began flirting and wanting to   hangout with me, and eventually got feelings for me, while still with   her. He and her even went on a ""break"" during First year of university  \(for me and him, she's a year younger and was a High school senior\), and  he confessed to a mutual friend that he wanted to ask me out.  But....they got back together after like 3 weeks, and he and I remained  friends.

As one \(of many\) examples: Our   mutual friend was out with him and his sister one night \(when he was   still with his ex the first time\), and also when he and I were getting   really close ""friend""\-wise. I was snapchatting them both and my friend   told me that he'd open the snaps and basically stare at the snaps I'd   send of myself for as long as possible. And he even said ""wow she looks   really cute, maybe I should dump \(current GF\) and date her \(me\)   instead"".

I'm losing my mind trying to   rationalize the past 2 years I've wasted on this guy. Why am I so   preoccupied with this, now 4 months post\-BU? I keep going over and over   in my mind possible scenarios, theories or ideas to explain everything,   and its really really draining. Can anyone offer their input or advice   to help me out and ease my mind here?

Tl;dr:  Ex bf keeps 'cycling' between me and his other ex\-gf; he's been doing  it for the past 3 years. I keep finding myself going over and over in my  heard trying to rationalize this/give myself closure, but I can't keep  my mind settled, I feel so confused about what he's thinking.",31May2018,0
82,"Alright boys I done fucked up real big. So I had myself a nice school project with journal entries and that jazz and part of the creativity component of it could’ve been making it fit with the idea of it being an old journal. So being the rational and intelligent person I am I decided that putting the paper in the microwave was the way to go so I did so.

I left the kitchen for a couple of minutes and returned to see the inside of the microwave look like it was the inner workings of Hell. So initially I thought noting was up after putting out the fire and that I could just try something else but the issue is that my microwave is like 80% broke because it’s no longer turning on.

83,3 of my best friends planned a trip to another country without me. None of them mentioned anything about it. I had to find out they were in another country by their posts on social media. I always considered us to be best friends as we would refer to each other as so. We tell each other everything so when I found out I was hurt because they didn’t invite me. I feel like this trip is going to cause them to be closer and they’re going to have a bond between the three of them that I can’t compete with. Am I just acting selfish and entitled or do I have a right to be upset? ,31May2018,231
84,"I [16 M] don’t feel like I belong anywhere in the world. I feel like if I die tomorrow, nobody will care. From a pragmatic point of view, everyone I know will get over it quite quickly. I moved to a new school in 9th grade (2 yrs ago), and haven’t made many friends, so if I die, no one will care since nobody knows me. My parents will have more money to spend since they don’t need to take care of me, and all of my friends from my old school won’t even know I’m dead since I lost touch with them. Even if they found out, I doubt they would care since it was so long ago. I’ve thought about stuff like this for around 8 years now. I remember “attempting suicide” at age 11 or 12 by hitting my head against the floor. I was fine and didn’t even get hurt. I didn’t have to go to the  doctor or anything: my head just hurt or around 10 minutes. After that, my suicidal thoughts got worse but I just keep it to myself nowadays. I don’t try anything crazy because I feel like I might regret it. Recently, the thoughts have been stronger than ever. I feel more alone now than I have ever felt. There is nobody who I can speak to here. I have immigrant parents who are conservative and religious in their nature, and in our culture, if someone sees a suicidal person, they’ll just say “ oh, if he isn’t fit to live, there is nothing we can do. Just let him die”.  Generally, in my country of origin, depression isn’t considered to be a disease but rather a form of laziness. Because of this, I refuse to talk to my parents about this kind of stuff. I am generally a very reserved person and am not outgoing so I can’t tell anyone at school like a teacher or a counselor since they do not know who I am. It used to be that I would think about death and suicide for short periods of time not longer than 10 minutes per day. Nowadays, I think about how I should kill myself, what I should use, who will care if I die, and other stuff like that for several hours every day. It’s gotten to the point where it interferes with my sleeping schedule. I lay awake for hours at night unable to sleep just thinking about death and wake up at odd hours just thinking about this stuff. Nothing truly makes me exited or happy anymore. Every time it is socially acceptable to smile or laugh, I just chuckle and fake every bit of it. In the past three years, I have gotten so anti-social that I get intimidated when I have to make conversation with my own “friend” group. I can’t speak with people anymore. The best I can do is have a one on one conversation for 5 mins. If I’m placed into a situation of social interaction, I just shut my mouth and stare at my feet. Every day feels like a drag. Eat, go to school, come back, study, and sleep. I am getting so tired with it all. I don’t even eat at the right times anymore. This entire week, I haven’t eaten dinner. Other times I come home from school and eat like a mad man. I don’t know how to deal with life anymore. Suicide feels like my only escape. It hurts no one and allows me to Rest In Peace once and for all.",31May2018,3
87,What do I do if I have to get things done (sometimes multiple things in a month) if I work full-time? First time getting a full-time job and don't know how to cope.,31May2018,1
88,"This is a messy situation. 

Born and raised in America, but my entire family is in Pakistan. I live with my Mother and Father, that's it, the three of us. Three years ago I visited Pakistan for the first time and fell in love. I always feel so useless at home yet Pakistan makes me feel so alive idk it's indescribable. Anyways here's the problem. 

Last year I stayed with my uncle there for a month. Loved him to death, hated his kids (3 guys all my around my age, 18) Anyways the plan was for me to go alone and this was the plan from January to June (I was leaving in July). Come June 15th, out of nowhere my parents book tickets to come along. The plan is I'll be there for 10 days, my parents will come for 2 weeks and leave, then I'll come back home 5 days after they do. Keep in mind we're all staying in my uncle's house. 

Now, we had a lot of problems at their house. All of the problems we had stemmed from my Uncle's wife (Let's call her Aunt Jemima, yes as in the syrup). Aunt Jemima constantly ridiculed my mom in private, ruined custom clothing she had made, and kept taking gifts that were for other people. My mom did not tell Aunt Jemima's husband (My uncle, let's call him Uncle Ben, yes as in the rice) any of this. Though I kept telling her he would make sure she stops, my mom did not listen.

So, the trip is over, my parents are pissed with Aunt Jemima to the max. Me being the man with a plan, specifically told my mom not to tell my father about their financial status (note I did this on purpose to see if I could trust her). She went and told my dad everything as I expected. My dad sent his sister who lives there (Let's call her Auntie Anne, pretzels lol.) to Uncle Ben's house on purpose to ridicule him with said information. It backfired as I expected it to. Instead of everyone thinking Uncle Ben is struggling they all think he's hoarding hundreds of thousands of dollars. 

About a day later Uncle Ben sent a 2 paragraph text message to my mom apologizing but in 1 line claimed she was being materialistic about the clothes and that it was no one fault for them being ruined. That still triggers my mom to this day.  

Remember Uncle Ben's kids? I fell in love with those boys. I can safely say they truly are my best friends, one problem, my parents hate them. The only reason my parents hate them is because I like them. 

I decided that with my love for Pakistan and my new found love for these guys, I'm going back to their house whether my parents like it or not. My dad only wanted to send me back to Pakistan if I agreed not to see them and I was like ""lol what?"" so I got a job and paid for the whole trip by myself. My parents have no idea I'm going. I have everything I need but they don't know I'm going next month. 

My parents have all of a sudden decided to go to Pakistan, but I'll be across town with someone they hate. They expect me to stay with Auntie Anne and not see my best friends while I'm there. In summation here are my reasons for not caring if they tell me not to go:

-Uncle Ben did nothing wrong and still has no idea what his wife was saying/doing. Aunt Jemima knows that, which is why she's so nice to me. She's knows I can expose her at any time.
-My Dad purposely baited Uncle Ben to fight with us.
-Auntie Anne's kids were talking shit about me with my Mom. I have proof. Tons of it. 
-My Mom betrayed my trust. And btw my mom is one my closest friends, we are very tight, still super dissapointed in her.
-I need to spend time with Uncle Ben's kids bc we've been waiting for this all year long. 
-I already have their gifts lol.
-Auntie Anne's kids have verbally, to my face, claimed that they don't like me bc I like Uncle Ben's kids and spend lots of time with them.
-Auntie Anne's kids were going around claiming Uncle Ben's kids hate Uncle Ben. I have proof. entirely false. Again that was partially a set up by me, but I'm getting tired of typing so I won't go into detail. 
-Auntie Anne's kids barely speak to me anymore. We used to be close but the tables have turned drastically. 
-My parents believe choose to believe anyone else over me in almost every situatuon, why, I really don't know. Aunty Anne's kids lie about everything and 99% of the time my parents choose their side over their own child. 

With all this information present, how do I let my parents know that I know all of the shady s**t that's been going on and I'm old enough to go where I want, and see who I want, whenever I want to. I also have to tell them that I bought my plane ticket back home about 4 months ago and that I leave in 26 days. 

I feel as if I don't make this decision and dissapoint them now that they'll feel that they can live my life for me and they'll always be able to make decisions for me. 

(Update: Yes, I leave in 26 days, I've been putting this off so my parent's can't make a huge mess and they'll just have to accept that I'm going whether they like it or not.) ",31May2018,2
89,"I work for a cardiology group (3 doctors). Right now, I do medical records full time because the medical records clerk was recently fired for not being able to keep up with the workload but I am also fully trained at the front desk and check out desk and I frequently cover for them. I also have numerous other responsibilities and I have a damn good work ethic. My manager and supervisor constantly give me recognition for my hard work. My goal isn’t to gloat, I’m just trying to establish that I work my ass off. I work overtime, I file records from home, I change my hours whenever they ask, and I work Saturdays, and I live 30 miles away from them. 

But today, I was thrown under the bus.

I received an email from my supervisor that was also addressed to my coworkers at the front desk AND the supervisor for the medical assistants. In the email, my supervisor said that this morning a patient showed up to have several procedures but the appointments were not on the schedule. She stated (my name specifically) that I was the employee that checked the patient out (and therefore I was responsible for scheduling those appointments.) She also stated that the patient was the father of another physician that is a friend of OUR doctor’s who refers patients to us quite often. She included a lot more details like that to make sure that every one who read the email knew that this was a MAJOR fuck up. 

I panicked. It was my day off and I happened to check my work email and read that. First thing I needed to do was make sure that this was actually my mistake. Even if it WAS my mistake, WHY? WHY didn’t she talk to me in private FIRST before putting me on blast to all my coworkers? 

Anyway, I was at my parent’s house so I used my mom’s computer to log on to the EMR and look at the patients chart. Sure enough, I checked out the patient on that day. BUT on the patient’s superbill, (this is form we use when checking out that the doctor gives us to let us know what procedures to schedule) clear as fucking daylight, I wrote a note that said the patient would call us back to schedule the procedures, meaning the patient told me he wasn’t going to schedule anything at that time and he was going to call us back. BAM. I followed office protocol. I did exactly what I was supposed to do. I made the note. 

My number one problem I have with this is that my supervisor has discredited me and I feel humiliated. Imagine you screwed up at work and instead of your supervisor telling you about it at all, much less giving you a chance to defend yourself, he or she sends out an email to your coworkers about how you screwed up. You’d probably be mortified too.

As a supervisor, if an employee makes a mistake, you DON’T drop names and throw them under the bus. That is unprofessional, it’s low, and in this case, it’s fucked up.

Number two, I was not at work today so I wasn’t even given a chance to defend myself. None of this was discussed with me. 

She singled me out. She threw me under the bus and I wasn’t even there to defend myself and was made to look incompetent. I’m hurt and humiliated. I’m going to lose sleep over this. My supervisor needs to make this right. She discredited me after everything I’ve done for her and that office.

I don’t even care if it HAD been my fault. You send a freaking email to my coworkers, dropping MY NAME and telling them how I fucked up. You hurt me and humiliated me. I look incompetent to my peers now. 

I’ve printed a copy of the email and I’ve printed a copy of the superbill that has my note written on it stating the patient was going to call us back to schedule his procedures. But I’m so damn nervous. 

TL;DR I’m being accused by my supervisor of forgetting to schedule a patient’s procedures. Patient name dropped me and said it was my fault. The superbill says the patient didn’t want to schedule anything on that day and that the patient was going to call us back to schedule them. Supervisor tells the staff it was my fault anyway.

93,"I'm 22. I've only been drinking for around a year, but I drink daily, and probably drink more than I should. I'm not sure. Obviously it became more and more over time... It's caused a lot of house fights. My mom doesn't like it and I come from a family of alcoholics and junkies. Never touched anything else except for cigarettes and weed. 

I always told myself there was no way this would happen to me, because I would know when to quit. And if it did or does, I wouldn't be the first member of my family to fight addiction and win.

I drink more than I'm willing to admit to people I know IRL. I'm afraid of telling the truth now, because the lie has gone on for so long at this point.

96,"Hi I’ve never used or posted on reddit but my best friend uses it and she says it helps. I’m just going to vent part of my story and you don’t need to stay and read and i don’t expect you to. I watched my mother die from a heart attack when i was 9 years old and ever since then I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety. I’m not using it as an excuse I’m trying to get better but like I said, I’m struggling and trying to get better. Art and writing help sometimes and i thought maybe sharing would too. I’m not going to say by who, but I was molested for 2 1/2 years by someone my family trusted and considered one of ours. It started when i was 12 and continued until i was 14. When i tried to tell my family, nobody believed me, so i said that i lied because i was tired of people screaming in my face telling me to tell the truth. Me and this man were very close when i was younger until he started to force me to do things. At times when we were around other people he would act as if nothing was wrong and he would try to make me feel like i never said no or tried to stop him. After about a year i stopped trying to bite and kick and scratch and punch because i realized it did nothing. He was still so much bigger and stronger than me. Eventually, it led to not just touching me anymore, but rape. The day after I lost my virginity to a friend because i didn’t want to lose it to him. The only person i told was my best friend. After a few months she convinced me to tell my dad that i never lied and it was really happening and only got worse. We couldn’t take legal action because i would be taken away from my father because he would be declared legally unfit to raise me due to the fact that other people in my family have had similar issues. My dad is the only family i have that really cares and is close to me and i can’t lose him. It’s officially been more than a year since i told my dad and he told my siblings, but I’m still fucked up. I can’t kiss someone without feeling his breath. I get uncomfortable when my male best friend hugs me for too long. I get anxiety when i even think of having to be intimate with someone else ever. I hate being stared at and I hate the way my body feels now. Like I don’t own it. Like it’s not mine to control. I know i shouldn’t let my past define me but it’s not something easy to get over. I don’t have any friends who would relate to me and i don’t know who to talk to because my dad blames himself and says he didn’t protect me enough. I want to be able to feel affectionate with another man someday and not feel completely hollow inside. I want to be able to enjoy physical contact with them and not have flashbacks or anxiety attacks. I’m not looking for pity. I’m sorry if this came off that way.

99,"Anyways still waiting on my required to withdraw letter but sure to get it within the next 3 days. I was hiding my academic struggles from my parents because I was ashamed and embarrassed that i wasn't doing well in school. I was also trying to just convince myself that every next day was going to be the day I would change my habits and motivation and become a good student who went to class consistently and understood what the fuck was going on but it just never happened. It felt like I was just waiting for this sudden epiphany of motivation to hit me but nothing ever came. So since it's pretty noticeable if I don't graduate next year since I'll be suspended from taking classes at the uni for 12 months I told them. They had their suspicions and were less angry and upset than I expected which probably could of been expected.

So let's take a look at my options, there's taking a year off and maybe taking classes online at university of athabasca or at the tech school down the street (SAIT if you want to look it up) OR my other option is to appeal the rtw and go before a council to decide whether I had extenuating circumstances (whatever the fuck that means) within the year to consider a redo/ keep me in engineering for the fall. My parents feel like I have anxiety and although I don't know if this is true or not, I feel like because I don't have documentation throughout the year with going to a Councillor my appeal will be very thin with just a self diagnosis. During the summer last year when I was put on probation I had to come up with a plan to make myself succeed academically for the coming year, unfortunately my plan was pretty shitty since it eased my worries for things outside of school (money with a part time job at sbux, extracurricular activities to get me to go to school for class) it ended up eating more time than motivating me to be more studious. So if I do go for this appeal I would probably go with the honesty route of I fucked up, obviously, I waited way too long to ask for help from the university but I would like one final shot at turning my degree around and working on a plan with a academic planner and also see someone about my sleep patterns since I feel so fucking tired all the time even with 10 hours of lying in bed. obviously this is a route less traveled since I assume this sub is for turning things around before this point but if any of you have experience or someone that went through something similar I would love to hear it.

The third kinda not an official option but is an option is to meet with the dean and ask for his permission/convince him to let me stay. To be honest I feel quite guilty of my shitty work ethic for studying engineering and feel this year away from uofc would act as a sort of penance for my ""sins"" of procrastination. Either way since i'm so damn close to finishing this degree I want to just get it done and move on with my life so winning the appeal would satisfy that desire as well. I feel my negative attitude mostly stems from being late all the time and procrastinating on everything, my lateness really effects my gf when I see her and I don't mean to hurt her it just when I act kick my ass into gear to get ready to go see her it becomes also apparent all the other shit i've been holding off in doing around the house like laundry, dishes etc. Combine that with my crappy sleep i've been getting and i'm just always late for fucking class. now in high school I couldn't give two fucks about being late since you could walk in from behind and everyone was on their phone but for some reason with the 200 plus kids and the door being at the front of the lecture hall it just fucking gets to me and made me not want to go to class. This along with the profs just rambling on over their power point notes for 50 minutes while maybe writing one limit on the board and then having to go home and spend the same amount of time learning the material as I would if I didn't go just make the lectures seem useless. so yeah my lateness which stems from procrastinating which could possibly be from lack of motivation which might stem from anxiety or depression is fucking up my life atm. I guess it can be noted that if the dean and council both turn down my appeals to stay I'm in the same boat as if I didn't appeal hopefully.

Obviously I'm rationalizing my laziness which isn't a great excuse and feel quite divided since the responses I've read on these kinds of posts for advice at this stage in my academic situation are ""get fucked take the year off and take some time to consider if uni is right for you and next time study harder/earlier"" OR ""I was in the same boat and this is what I did or happened"". I agree with both sides which is quite polarizing but the more helpful posts would be the latter in this case, I guess the only reason I'm apprehensive about appealing the rtw other than feeling like I didn't learn my lesson if it gets approved, is if it effects my chances of getting readmitted if the appeal is denied and if my suspension could be worsened by talking to the dean by magnifying his attention on specifically on my academic grades since usually he couldn't give two shits about a lowly mech engg student but he could decide I might need even more time than a year to figure out my studying habits which would suck. My sister says going through with the appeal and talking to the dean even if I didn't have some catastrophic life even this past year shows initiative that I still want to stay at uofc/ in the mech engg program which I agree but who knows if the council or dean would agree. I guess to wrap up this wall of text update is just to get some extra non related/biased opinions on what you would think of this situation as say the dean or council? does it sound at all like I have mental health issues?",31May2018,1
100,"So about a month ago i met this girl at a event relating to video games. from the moment i saw her she was all smiles, I felt the need to go talk to her and so i did... and everything went well, ice was broken, conversations were had. by the end of the day we exchanged discords \(not numbers\) and shook hands. It was overwhelmingly positive and she seemed interested in what i had to say and vis versa

After the weekend we play some video games over the internet and good times is had, and there was still same positive happy atmosphere. We're both university students so during this time its finals, so i ask if she wants to grab some pizza with me after finals, she says yes without hesitation.

The pizza day was planned for a week later, and honestly the week leading up to it was hell for me. I was so worried that it was gonna get canceled or she wouldn't show up. I had a hard time sleeping at night because of this. In the end, she did show up, and we had pizza and conversed. I took the time to learn more about her and listen to what she had to say. I noticed while we were eating that she was rubbing her legs anxiously at the start, i could tell it was anxious and not cold related because she had more layers on than me and i was slightly chilly but not cold. During our conversations she was talking to me about inviting me to more events next semester.

after the pizza we left for a walk around campus. theres a lot of conversation im leaving out because its not really important for this post but just know i did learn quite a bit. I will say though, at some point during our walk i asked about home life and learned that Its fine but she likes the dorm life more because she can hide what she does, nothing illegal but you know like.. playing video games where its viewed as ""a waste of time/not productive"". 

near the end of the walk its time to depart, she tells me that she had a good time and it helped alleviate some stress of her last upcoming finals. I tell her im glad i could help. We're looking at eachother for a solid 3 seconds maybe? idk what shes asking for so i extend my hand for another handshake and we shake for a pretty long shake. we say bye and both go home.

Any fear or doubt i had is gone, it was a pretty good time and i feel good about it... but then i start overthinking. Should I hugged? should i have told her how i felt? I ask a pal of mine and he said he would of just told her how he felt and how i should of hugged. I asked another pal and he said I did the right thing by not rushing anything and allowing her time to open up to it.

So finals end and shes moving back home for the summer, I open up discord and I let her know how i feel. I can assure you it wasnt some dumb overwhelming stuff you'd see some 'nice guys' send girls. I kept it pretty simple. para\-phrasing, hey wanted to tell you in person but i like you and enjoy spending time, know your moving back home for the summer, it wouldnt be hard to visit \(\(dear reader: its not that far away\)\) would like to see you again. she responds the next day apologizing for being late, she said both that its a good thing that hanging out with her \(and not to apologize for saying that\) is liked and she guaranteed me when she gets back that we can go to more events. but also informed me that shed be busy with family and work over the summer and when she does have free time it would be spent either with family or alone as she said shes shy and introverted. so she'd probably not be responsive at all during the summer, but also informed me that we could still play video games.

Honestly, thats fine. I'm glad she responded and it was a bit re\-assuring that I'm not overwhelming. Anyway, i dont hear from her for 2 weeks. We did get to play a game like once, and when we did she asked how my summer was going and general interested in catching up while playing.

In the past, ive met and interacted with people who have the same positive and happy aura around them. but the downside is that they often are afraid of hurting people and will do things to please them even if it hurts them. People who are non\-confrontational like that frighten me and people like that in my past relations ended badly when they finally snap. \(or sometimes lack of a snap and they just  G H O S T\). I wont see or hear from her for 3 months, and i have this creeping anxious fear that keeps telling me ""hey maybe shes just being nice because shes selfless and puts other people being happy over herself"". thats kinda why i asked about home life when I did and the fact that she hides seemingly normal things from her parents so they arent disapointed is a bit of a worry.

Everytime i've interacted with her, its been great. and she hasn't given me a reason to suspect that its not genuine, infact it feels pretty damn genuine.. but then again so was previous relations with people, they say what you want to hear to make you happy. My friends say to just trust, innocent until proven guilty you know. and I know its not fair to her if shes genuine with what she says and does JUST BECAUSE people unrelated to her have lead me to be cautious about people.

How do i not let the thoughts paralyze me during the summer because i have stuff i need to do too? and when/if she returns, how and when do i ask for reassurance that this is genuine? help me reddit, i like her a lot and I hope this develops into something long\-term.

TL;DR: I met a girl who when i've interacted with has been nothing but positive and happy, i have a history with people who are happy and positive on the outside but cant confront people, and have a hard time disapointing people even when it hurts themselves inside. Im afraid its happening again. due to circumstance I wont see/hear from them for 3 months and I wont get my answers for awhile, and it worries me.",31May2018,1
101,"This majority of the time happens at night and it's overall pretty random. Sometimes I feel a tightness (is the best way to describe it) in my chest and it forces me to keep moving which really sucks when I'm trying to get some sleep and I keep jerking my leg or arm. It also feels as though I can't breathe and I need to take deep breaths. It hasn't been happening as frequently for the past three months but has been going on for at least eight by this point. It's really frustrating when it does happen because it usually lasts all night and I spend a good 1-4 hours trying to get some sleep. Is there any way I can cope when it does happen. Is it something I should be worried about? I have visited doctor's and they usually say it's allergies. Although the only allergy I suffer with his hayfever and this was going on through winter as well. Triggers for it is when I'm not wearing a bra, I'm cold or I'm wearing a lot of layers of clothes.

I felt so betrayed because I ASKED them to stop! What the fuck!

104,"So, my sister sexually abused children she babysat and tried to abuse my younger brother.  She claims it was all because when she was five she was ""molested"" by a four year old and that she's cured now due to Jesus.

My concern is that just isn't how how pedophilia works and my parents are letting her around kids without letting the parents know she's a risk.

This past weekend for her birthday she really wanted a BBQ and water balloon fight, didn't realize what that was about until she couldn't stop talking about how the kids she was playing with were acting afterwards...I really feel it's inappropriate to have her around kids like that and I think most people would feel really uncomfortable with that situation if they knew their kids were playing with a child predator.

Obviously this is a sensitive subject but I do feel it needs to be brought up that it's not okay to put her in situations that might tempt her and might lead to children being abused.  So how to I describe my concern in a political way? I'm not entirely sure how to convince my parents that despite her claiming she's cured it's still not safe to have her around children.",31May2018,82

I haven’t been that proud of something in a long time. Our teacher gave us all permission to use profanities in our paper and I did at a moment where it needed it. Unluckily for me, I left it sitting out where my super conservative Christian family could read it. Sure I share the same values but they could never understand why I needed to write what I wrote. My mom flipped through it, saw the word “fuck” and lost her mind. I’ve been trying to explain to her that it’s there in the context of the story and to make it punch more but neither of my parents are having it. They’re convinced I’m going to ruin my reputation and I’m only doing it to get a reaction out of people and are overall dismissing something I’m quite proud of. They gave me the whole you live under our roof lecture and all I could say is it’s my writing and I wrote what I wrote. So they made me read an article about why Christians can’t swear, out loud to them. I truly get where they’re coming from and their concern but this is going to cause a rift between us for months and I really don’t know what to do to fix it. They think I’m being stubborn because I don’t see anything wrong with my paper but of course I’m stubborn! My works are mine and they exist for the purpose of me getting some emotional release.

121,"So me and my boyfriend have been together for about a month. He’s in the military a state away so we don’t get to see each other that often. We are having a small dispute over something that doesn’t really matter and I believe that he’s overreacting to the whole thing.

Last weekend on Saturday we were talking on the phone until he told me that he had to go. Right after we hung up I asked him “do you want to continue our conversation through text or should I call you later” he said later and that he was sorry. It registered in my head that he was busy so I told him to text me when he was done. Later that evening I accidentally sent him a text that I was supposed to send my friend,  I asked if the person would like to come to the lake with my family. After getting back from the lake, I still didn't receive anything which was no biggie so I thought maybe he was on base so I went to check his location, turns out he went to the outskirts of LA. Personally it none of my business was he does, but all he had to tell me was that he would be hanging with friends and that he'll text me Sunday. It oddly made me a little upset, so I didn't text him Sunday plus I was busy with other personal things. Later Sunday night I went to my friend's house and ended up staying the night, my friend is gay, and I've mentioned it to my boyfriend before. So with that in mind, I had my GAY friend on my snap story. The next morning I woke up to a text from my boyfriend saying goodbye and that he wishes he knew why I left [the relationship]. That's when things went downhill.
He said that I ignored him for 2 whole days and accused me of cheating on him with the guy on my snap story (which I can understand looks bad). I tried calling him later that evening and he said that he was still pissed and didn't want to talk, but I wanted to sort things out. I told him that he's handling the whole situation like a child which apparently mad him even more mad. We never got anywhere that day. Tuesday comes around so I planned to handle this like the adults that we are. I try to text him and get my side sorted out also admit my wrongs. But he wants to send short replies like it doesn't matter until I ”say” something wrong. Also trying to play the victim, he uses excuses about things is ex did in their past relationship. I kept telling him that this argument is blown way out of proportion and isn't that big of a deal. I also mentioned that this fight won't affect our relationship in anyway in the future. 

I don't understand why he's so mad. He won't admit that he has handled this conflict poorly and won't apologize for it. It makes me second guess our relationship because if he's dealt with the situation like this, I can't imagine how he'll handle even more severe cases. It makes it even harder because we can't situate this in person. And ill also admit that I've had periods in the argument where I got heated and sent multiple texts trying to get his attention to talk.

How do I talk to him and take care of this whole deal? If I could get a man point of view that'd be great!

124,"Throwaway for obvious reasons...

My best friend of four years is starting to get on my nerves. We went to high school together and now live together as roommates. I go to community college, they go to a state college. I don’t have a car, they drive a BMW and have many other things someone who is “poor” wouldn’t have (ex: xbox1, Nintendo Switch, Year Pass to our Local Theme Park, Expensive Fast Food Habit). I would never consider myself poor, there are people out there who are really bad off, I’m just trying to give you an idea of what this person’s income is like. Let’s get to the problem. 

Recently, they’ve responded to every invitation that anyone in my friend group has had with “i cant, im poor”. Normally, that would be fine. People can spend their money on what they want.  But this is constantly, any concert or movie or dinner we (mostly I) want to do, is rejected by them because they don’t want to spend money. Even small purchases like chipping in on pizza ($10 tops) is met with “i have no money!”.  

But on top of all of that, they pout about it!  My friends have so often put money in for this person to not have a bad time when we’re out and I completely refuse to do that. Whenever we go out somewhere that has food and I buy some, they’ll get quiet and won’t talk the rest of the trip.  

And its just so frustrating because it feels like its only when they want someone else to pay for their stuff!  I’ve been on trips when they drive through a starbucks and buy stuff for themselves twice in the same day(and no one else in the car gets anything), or spend $50 on a bunch of videogame fanart posters.

To add some further context, they have a full scholarship however their mom pays their rent and has a joint bank account with them.  She monitors their bank account.  When we moved in she gave them $400 a month as spending money but I don’t know if that’s still in place. Also their mom recently lost their job but this problem has existed before that. These are definitely things that I also need to take into consideration though. 

I just want to know if my feelings are valid or should I reassess the situation.  Obviously, at the end of the day they’re my friend and I want to get along with them, I just feel so uncomfortable being around them with money. 

TL;DR My best friend (who is definitely not poor) only spends money on things they want to buy, and, when faced with other purchases, will completely reject the idea with “im too poor”. They pout when they “cant” spend money on food when we’re out and I feel like they’re just sad I won’t buy them food for them. ",31May2018,1

126,"I've been recently put on suspension by our loss prevention guy following the suspension of my boss at work regarding my past year and a half of service at my job. I've been put on suspension because I was suspected of refunding too many items improperly and taking the money. They have been watching me ever since I got promoted to a shift manager and got off my probation period. Along the way they caught me taking petty things like pens and stuff out of the trash like discontinued items or items that were missing parts or pairs \(I'm insane about wastefulness\). I am absolutely accountable for the crap I took but I have had nothing to do with all these supposedly fraudulent refunds. They claimed that I had been using the feature to refund items without receipts abusively and kept that money. This was wrong and I clarified that with them. I live in a tourist town in California and when people come up here to my town on vacation they act really aggressive for some reason. I have been threatened with corporate, facebook, video taping and reviews over refunds and verbally abused over our companies return policies throughout the day on a daily bases. My name has been in the store comments on the computer for refusing service \(refunds and coupons\) and I have been told that corporate looks at those as complaints and its not good for me. Occasionally I'll get a positive comment and at one point during the slow season when I just got regulars I actually won a five star award because our regulars really liked how friendly and helpful I was to them, enough to write a good review. But of course that is not regarded in our company. So yeah that is that part of the story. The other part of the story was that over the time I have worked there I had also taken some stupid crap I imminently regretted taking. I don't know why I started taking stupid crap. Maybe it was my 23 year old hormonal insecurity causing me to act out? My outlook changed at some point in that I was upset with things like my boss never being around to talk to or help me develop my skills, how threatening people were, how I had to cover all the bad employees shifts, no actions were being taken when I reported something doing something bad. People were also completely ignoring the fact that I busted my ass to keep the place going regardless of what was happening. One sick day, never late once. I felt totally un\-appreciated and like I did not belong in my job so I went from superstar in the making to burn\-out 'I don't give a shit' employee just like that. Went out on a do stupid things spree because I felt a wide range of negative emotions. Its hard to describe. Just lots of grief. I have been through some tough shit in the time I worked there and I even quit my job once but came back a few months later after being begged to return and promised improvement in my job. That improvement only lasted until winter and I was back to feeling horrible for working there again. I feel like I have done so much for that store and endured through soo much more turbulence that regardless of my shortcomings I should be viewed with some kind of respect by our higher ups. The only thing this guy told me and I have no clue if he was for real or not \(probably not seeing he is LP\) is that they were not going to put me in a spot where I could not use my references or show up with an ugly mark on the background check because he saw me as an otherwise good person. That there were days where I had put in tons of effort and there were days where I did not. So that was that. Our temporary manager that came in that I worked with for two days looked upset or betrayed, and our assistant manager made a joke about quitting. I had established a good relationship with some of our team. So here I am now, all hopeless. I feel just absolutely terrible that I wont get to work with anyone I liked again and have to go through the waiting on the investigation period to end so they can tell me what they found before firing me. At least I've been in the process of looking for houses out in the midwest where I am from and have some money saved.

Now, it sounds like an automatic accept, but it's tough. I have some social anxiety and am kind of an introvert. At the first university, my two closest friends will also be attending the program, so I won't have to worry about making friends. At the top school, I don't really know anybody outside of a few people. Also, at the top school, those accepted tend to be very hardcore when it comes to business (vs me who barely knows if I want to go into it) and they seem intimidating from the outside (I was accepted from my essay while most others were accepted for extra curriculars and such).

I probably shouldn't choose a school based on where my friends are going, but I would feel more comfortable there. However, perhaps I should go to this top-flight program, which also has a bit of a better campus, as it would take me out of my comfort zone. I just don't want to end up lonely.

I feel like maybe I should be doing more but I don't really know what. I appreciate any kind of advice. Sorry for the long post.

136,"As a PhD student, I have been working as a TA to many classes. What I've noticed is that I am not prepared to be a good educator (my goal is to become a professor) because I have never learned how to handle difficult students. I am tired of the excuses and lies these college kids come up with... not to mention some kids are so rude and aggressive that I don't want to be involved with them at all.

Yesterday, I watched a kid interrupt the lecture by loudly claiming that ""he would kill himself if he got older than 25"" and proceeded to accuse older generations of being arrogant and immature. I watched in horror while the professor kept the straight face. Seriously, I don't know what I would have done if I were the lecturer.

144,So I had a thing with a girl recently that came to an end. I can’t stop blaming myself for letting it end.

147,"My best friend is a girl I used to have a thing with. We’ve been really close friends, basically family, for the past year. A few weeks ago she found a group of friends and she basically cut me out. We’ve hung out once in the past month, and it was only because her group of friends were all out of town. We used to faceiime at least like 3 hours per day now we FaceTime for maybe 20 minutes 2 times a week and we barely text. I never wanted anything to change but she just forgot about me. Anytime I tell her this she just says I’m a drama queen, I’m over exaggerating, or that I’m just wrong and nothing has changed

Yesterday I just blew up and told her how I’ve been feeling. How I went from being a main character in her life to a background person. How when she basically left me, she had other people to go to but I had nobody. That she left me alone 

Anyway I still love her and today she facetimed me in a terrible mood. I told you guys how she left me for a group of friends, but she was introduced to them because of a guy. She basically left me for the guy and then got introduced to the group. So she calls me, she’s gotten into a fight with the guy. She isn’t attracted to him she just loves him as a friend but he’s in love with her. She made it clear today that nothing will happen (after months of leading him on). He got mad and left and stopped talking to her

Then she facetimes me, in a bad mood. She talks to me about it then she has to go for a few mins because her sister called her. Then she texts me and says “how can you say to my face that I’m the reason that we barely talk anymore”. She’s in a bad mood, and I have no doubt in my mind that she’s to blame for what happened to us because I tried everything to get her to stay 

But, I don’t want to fight with her. I tell her “if we talk about this, we’ll fight and I don’t want to fight with you. You’re in a bad mood and I’m here for you, forget the rest for now”

I guess hat made her angry because she just said she’s going to bed. I tried facetiming her so I can be there for her but she said she wants to be alone then hung up. Was what I said wrong?

148,"I’ve worked for this company for 6 years and climbed up 4 different positions/job titles. Every time my position/job title has changed, I’ve been contacted by HR to discuss the employee contract, salary/benefit info, and sign the new position job description before any training.

In February, my manager and project lead basically created a position for me. They told me they wanted me in the position, gave me a brief overview of job expectations, and that’s it. I’ve been asking my manager weekly for the past two months when I should hear from HR, but she always responds that she’ll follow up with them.

The position will come with more hands-on and detailed work. Not to mention being the team lead for 12 people (currently I only have 3 people on my team).

149,"Hello,


I come to you today with what is probably a common issue.  My wife's sister cannot get a man. She is 31 years of age and has never had a boyfriend.


Her current status is:

- Lives at home with her parents.

- Is very much into Sports and cheesy TV (supernatural, marvel stuff (but not Legion) etc)

- Works full time in an office.

- Uses tinder, plenty of fish, etc dating apps.


She uses these apps and speaks to various men, but the process always goes the same way: They get talking, have a conversation, it seems to be going well and then suddenly the man vanishes. Rinse and repeat.


My wife always asks me if there are any single guys at work, in my circle etc but her sister has a very specific set of requirements:

- He must be good looking.

- He must be sporty.

- He must not smoke.

- He must be around her age.

I have been able to find gentlemen who tick *some* of these boxes but not *all*, but even if and when I do, I don't know if I *want* to conduct an introduction as there has to be a reason why, when she chats to guys online, they disappear at a certain point.  What if she's telling them she wants to do devil's three-ways in public places? I don't know, but I don't want to subject one of my friends to what could be a *bad time*.


I have suggested the fact that she lives with her parents may be hampering her efforts.  Based on my own experiences, I have suggested that living with her parents may suggest:

- That she is dependent on them, and that she cannot function in society on her own - men don't want to date, for all intents and purposes, *a child*.


- That she has overbearing parents who will not let her move out, maybe they're heavily religious or just crazy - men want to date a woman, they don't want to date her parents too.


- That she is their carer, in which case any prospective suitor might feel like he also has to take them on in a caring capacity.


While none of these things are actually the case (she's living there so she can save for a deposit for a house), men don't know that and they might be bailing as soon as they find out she lives with her parents, without sticking around long enough to find out why.


While she is not me, nor *my* sister, I feel that her situation affects my wife's happiness, and that matters to me. 


I'm not looking for a magic bullet here, I'm just looking for ideas, maybe reasons I've not considered or maybe I'm completely wrong in my assessment of the reasons why.


Thank you for your time.",31May2018,4

152,"TLdr: My work friend really likes me and constantly wants to hang out outside of work, but our husbands do not get along and I think she is slightly weird. I want to distance myself.

So I have a nice work friend. She is cool to pass the day with at the office, but she always ALWAYS as in, literally everyday wants to plan a time for us to hang out outside of work. I am a full-time student as it is, and I am generally pretty private but she is very nosy. I have used every excuse in the book, both legitimate and made up, but now she is at the point where she will call me out to my face about not texting her back about hanging out. She is emotional too and pretty sensitive so she gets her feelings hurt easily.

I just think she is weird is the honest truth. At the beginning of our friendship I hung out with her a few times and went to her house. Her and her husband talk very openly about their sex lives which makes me uncomfortable. Once when I went to their house, she tried to make me wear her onesy/footy pajamas to bake cookies with her in. It was very strange. My husband also doesn’t have anything at all in common with her husband, and has only hung out with then twice and haaated it. They are an awkward couple and sit in silence a lot and I just don’t enjoy their company. We are all mid-20s.

So what do I do now? She knows where I live and had brought me Christmas presents to my door as well as “get well” treats and birthday presents. She is a very sweet girl but I have no desire to hang out with her outside of work. I have a job, i’m a full-time student, teach night classes, and am involved in my church.

About 3 years ago I split from my 3 year female partner. When we  first got together i was madly in love and gave my everything to this  lady. I pushed everything and one away for her so that i could give her  my undying attention and love. I loved  this lady with every inch of my  heart and soul i could. Unfortunatly she was not feeling the same way.  Over the course of the 3 years we were togther she had been disloyal on  virtual every other week. Whether that was from talking dirty with other  guys, to leaving me in school to go off with them on dinner, to taking  photos/videos of herself and sending them to people. Now i knew all this  happened, as i say it happened alot. Yet i always forgave her, becuase i  couldnt imagine not having her. I knew she would hurt me again and  again but i didn't care as i loved her so much. Now fast forward to the  end of our relationship 3 years ago she did the unimaginable and slept  with my bestfriend. This was a week before our schools prom, which me  and my partner had planned for, for the 3 years of our relationship.  Needless to say she went with him. This is when i also discovered that  she had been trying it on with rest of my friends. I was truly alone, i  had no body. They all were with her. The rest of my school were also  with her, seeing her happy with my bestfriend on our prom night killed  me. I had never been so alone. I  ended up walking a hour home in the  rain alone.

Now time passed, i had nobody. and now we fast forward to now, 3  years since it all ended and still to this day she is all i think about.  I cannot get past the thought of her, and how much i loved her. And  unfortunatly still do. We don't really talk anymore and i have taken on a  job working 54 hours a week just to distract myself from the tought of  her. I tried to kill myself twice during all this becuase the pain  hasn't got any easier.

160,"I have a coworker I've been friends with for about 1&amp;1/2 years.  About two months ago, he had a kind of mental breakdown and went on an 11 day drinking binge.  He went the hospital twice and the second time he was able to detox.  Since then, he has been away from work on medical leave.  He's was, or is, in an outpatient rehab program but I don't know how seriously he took it.

While on his bender and before, he made comments about committing violence or committing suicide but he is smart enough to never say anything the police could act on it. 

In the past weeks, it seems like he's been really isolating himself from other people.  He blocked my phone number and when I stopped by to visit, he wouldn't let me in or talk to me.  As far as I can tell, he does not see anyone except maybe his parents.  I don't know if he's drinking again, but suspect he is.

Tonight, his ex-wife messaged me, sending me screenshots of text messages he sent her.  One second, he says he wishes someone would rape and kill her, then he says he misses her, then he says I am a good friend, then he accuses me of betraying him.  This is how he behaves when he is depressed.  He lashes out at everyone like a cry for help.  At the same time, he lies constantly and appears to be somewhat disconnected from reality, speaking in Star Wars metaphors.

I asked another coworker, with whom he had a sexual relationship, if she had been in contact with him.  She said she blocked hid number, but she is also scared of him.  She says that a few months ago he made comments about wanting to hurt people at work including shooting, but he also said that he wouldn't do it, because he knows it's wrong.  According to her, a different coworker saw him ""lurking"" in the parking lot.

As far as I know, he does not own any weapons, but his dad is a gun collector.  He might have access to them.

I don't know what to do.

Should I call the police?  Can they really do anything without an overt threat of violence?  What if they do nothing except make him more angry and paranoid?  Should I call or text my bosses right now at 1AM and tell them my concerns?  I'm afraid to go to work and I'm afraid for my coworkers.

161,"I'm a 20M and i've been feeling this ""pit"" inside of me. I don't party much. I don't smoke. I'm active and have a lot of friends and only a couple of close ones. I'm in a fraternity that's respectable and doesn't fit the stereotype at all. However, I have never had a girlfriend or a relationship. Most importantly of me is that I try to be as genuine as possible. That stuff matters to me. This is all pretext.
--
The feeling i'm trying to represent is from example like: say I am on the lawn with a bunch of fraternal brothers hanging out and talking to people pondering rushing. In those situations in which most people feel involved.. I feel the loneliest. When I'm by myself and no one blows my phone up. I feel alone. Social media; I have quite a few followers yet I still feel alone.
-- 
It makes me ponder why am I cursed to bear this feeling that literally engulfs me and it hinders my days. I've tried to beat it over and over. I've tried growing in multiple ways. I even got into religion recently. But it doesn't leave me. It even has got my mind to think that I deserve to feel that way. It makes me feel lame and sometimes I don't want to leave my room. A further point is when someone talks to me, they tend to treat me as the butt of the jokes. I try to be a really good guy, honestly. I try to follow altruism. I really do.

162,"I met this girl on [meet.me](https://meet.me):  

  
What honestly annoys the living crap out of me is her grammar. Her teachers said that she was a lost cause, and I think they should have been fired. No child is a lost cause ever. Doesn't matter what it is. How she has a speech and grammar issue is beyond my understanding. Do you know why? I literally know an autistic guy who asks  me once in a while about  things he doesn't understand but he is near perfect on grammar. However, his speech is a bit flawed. But, I can understand him. He's also 25. Her? It's like I'm talking to a 5\-year\-old who grew up and never learned proper English. I thought when I first met her, that I was talking to a girl from Mexico or Spain because her grammar is so off it physically hurts me at this point.

	 I have a Plugin on my browser called ""Grammarly"" so when I fuck up on something, it shows a red underline saying ""Hey, you fucked up there genius"" because I admit, I make mistakes too, I mess up on like sense and since. A few minor words here and there but that's about it. I asked her if she messages other people as much as she does to me, and she said yes and I asked her if they liked it. She honestly doesn’t know but compared to her, I can say they do not appreciate it. I do want to talk to her but when we do, we get nowhere, we have little in common and she doesn’t really like anything I like when it comes to superheroes, anime, comics, TV, Movies, hobbies...  

	I feel like I'm talking to my first girlfriend again. She might as well have been raised on an Amish farm with nothing more than the bible... Seriously she lacked everything. She told me the reason she never got into Pokemon was that she thought her parents thought it was weird. After talking to her mother, her mom never thought that. Another thing that still bothers me is that she couldn't make up her mind when she wanted to meet me. I could have done it. I could have said ""I'll be there in 20 minutes."" She couldn't make up her mind, thinking I was going to say something ""weird"" to her friends and ""keep me in line?""  

	 I'm 26... If I'm being honest here, I think she’s about mentally 16 at best. I know that's hurtful but she said ""I heard worst and I use to it and I stronger then you seem and I won't"" Even tho that sentence makes no sense I got what she meant out of it after picking it apart. She once asked me ""Why do guys not stay with me for long?"" LITERALLY ALL THAT. MEN don't want to look after a 16 year old girlfriend, they want a WOMAN. I know she is 25 but god damn, I feel like I'm talking to a 12 year old that keeps on smiling and doesn't know when to take a hint.

Every night we’d talk on the phone. Eventually we hooked up etc but he was still going around with plenty of other girls. Once high school ended he finally decided to give me a chance. We dated but he couldn’t stay committed. He’s a fuckboy. Despite that I was still with him everyday and his family loved me as their own. Truthfully he didn’t treat me well because he knew I loved him enough to never walk away, which I wouldn’t have. A year ago he officially left me once he had met a new girl who was richer and had the same social status as him. His friends reassured him she was a better fit (white, pretty, rich etc) over me. He bought into it but would still see or talk to me secretively. He wasn’t faithful to her but seemed to treat her better. She (F21) eventually got pregnant and he felt as if she did it to tie him down and keep him. He made it seem as if he didn’t want to be with her.

172,"Quick backstory, I've been seeing this guy for four dates now. Tonight things went sour after a conversation and I believe he swiped my wallet. Here's the story:

I picked up my date to hang out somewhere and he wanted to be dropped off his cousin's house really quick to discuss a surprise party for his mom. I decided to stay in the car since I thought it was going to be quick. It turned into nearly an hour and I was pretty mad. It was the second time he left me waiting for a long time so I figured this was the last straw.

When he got into the car he asked if I was mad and I said yes. He gets apologetic and pretty touchy while I'm driving, grabbing my shoulders and giving a kiss on the cheek. He asks me to stop the car really quick where he runs to a friend's house for a minute and comes back. He doesn't explain why.

This is where things get weird and I wouldn't read ahead if you don't want to read certain sexual details. I should note I'm a guy. &gt;!During the drive to his home from the friend's house he decides so get more adventurous and starts grabbing my crouch. He asks what this is when touching my junk and I begin to think he's a bit intoxicated. When I pull up in front of his house I accepted the fellatio as I felt it was something to end the bad night on. This is where I think he took my wallet out of my shorts while I was... distracted.!&lt;

Afterward he starts asking if I would see him again after the disastrous night. When I couldn't give him a straight answer he gets mad, asking where his earphones were \(we couldn't find it\) and for some reason his ID was gone from his wallet, but he storms off. I was able to start the car when I realized my wallet was gone. Thinking it was maybe some mistake that my wallet fell out and he took it by mistake, I go up to the house and ask. He denies everything and is still mad at the night and his ""missing"" items. We search the entire car finding nothing. I decide to leave and immediately canceled my cards.

So here's what I want advice for. What should I do about the still missing wallet if I think he took it? We didn't go anywhere where I would have taken the wallet out and he was the only person I had contact with all night, and I was in the car the whole time. My idea is to just text him in the morning asking if he has it just return it no question asked. I was thinking also to bluff I had a dash cam and would ask if he took it to just return it no questions asked to get a more honest answer.

TBH I only had $11 in the wallet and a few cards I cancelled/replaced, but I kept a small note my mom left me before she passed away in it, and that's what I want back more than anything else. :/",31May2018,0
173,"Hello everyone.

I came back to a job after a few months abroad for university. I should never have come back but I needed fast money. It's a toxic place, most people quit in their first year due to bulling. It's currently being investigated by Fair Work Australia for under paying it's staff. This place is a nightmare. 

In total I've worked there two years.

I've been back for four months. Last month they cut our pay \(a raise on our base rate, but they cut all our commission which is how everyone made money\), they changed all our contracted working agreements \(it's legal as they moved our ""award"" of pay, hence the old contracts become voided\). 

Pretty much I've acted like I'm ok with all of this and agreed to keep working\- even though they much told me as I am a part time weekend worker I will be made casual and have no guaranteed shifts. As of two weeks ago, I needed this job as I had nothing else lined up. Those who didn't act ""ok"" with it have been moved to under performing stores or told to leave. 

Today out of the blue I got an offer from an old friend to work for them. Better job, better pay, no workplace bullying, and they will fit around my schedule as I'm still at university.   

Here is my problem, I told my current job I was fine with everything and agreed to do casual shifts for at least the next few months. They have a big global conference which they use as a carrot and stick to keep people working under such poor conditions. 8 people have quit this month already, there is no one to work. during this period. 

I am quitting, I can't stay in this awful place with something better offered\- but I will be messing over my co\-workers. People who are also getting royally messed over by this place will be 100&amp;#37; made to do 3 weeks in a row with no day off. People will take it personally.

Advise, how can you quit a job when you know it's going to mess over the wrong people? How can you make yourself not feel guilty for quitting a job which is known almost country wide as being the worst place to work in sales? 

I don't need them as a reference as all my previous managers quit due to the changes.

I abhor the person I am/choose to be

The *hypocrisy* and the *lethargy* and  substandard quality of life and being cool with it all. I cant call myself a man when I live off welfare and do nothing to change (*hold your moans, ladies*)

Somethings gotta give and I'm putting my  chips down on it being my sanity

I *know* I can be better/happier if I simply buckle down and make the changes...yet time and time again I choose to sit on my ass and do *nothing*

Example: I spent 16 hours on my laptop yesterday playing Rimworld and KSP when I should be out enjoying the gorgeous weather and running the errands Ive been putting off for days...(*i cant believe im single?!*)

Or, ya know, socializing with other human beings

The fuck is wrong with me? I have zero ambition to do ANYTHING other than wasting away in my comfort zone. All else beyond that boundary is unpleasant and to be avoided

And its not like Im horribly disfigured or mentally retarded, or even have a *legitimate* excuse for this behavior
Anyway, here's some stats...

Im 26, a highschool dropout with no marketable skills and hardly any identifiable passions or interests. I simply eat, sleep (a lot), avoid all unnecessary human contact, and jerk off at near chronic levels...

*""Have you tried 'NoFap'?""*

*""Have you tried shutting the fuck up?""*


And the cherry on this heap of shit? Generally, Im content living this way

Not depressed...not unhappy....but content. Again, the fuck is wrong with me? 

Therapy is far too time consuming to reap effective results, coupled with my own lack of emotional intelligence making the process more tedious. Medication is hit-and-miss at best

I digress. Im not sad or lonely, I'm a friggin' dumbass looking at myself through shit-tinted lenses



***tl;dr***

How can I stop being so negative about myself and start appreciating the positive qualities I posess? 

Also, help me out of this mental hole I've dug myself into. Bad patterns and coping mechanisms and such...Im already seeing a shrink but not much is happening. and ive subbed to r/getmotivated and r/decidingtobebetter but it just discourages me seeing others succeeding where I fail.

So here's my situation summarized:

I work with my father every summer in his small establishment (office work). I also study in university during the year. Moreover, I get an allowance from the government which I only get 10% of it, but I don't have to pay for rent or groceries. 

However, my father demands a lot from me and I've been working with him since I was 11 ( I'm now 18 btw). I work very long hours in the establishment, about 12 hours / 7 days a week. And if I don't do the job, he threatens to end my scholarship and disown me.

TL;DR: Parents kicked me out, tired of everything want to move away and bum it out on a beach somewhere.",31May2018,0
177,"Hi all, I will start with my questions and follow up with my fairly lengthy story that lead to them.

**My questions are:** how do you choose a future when you don't even know if it's right for you? How do you commit time and money to something when there might be something better that you haven't thought of yet? Am I too old at 30 to do a college course? Am I too late with getting a handle on my life? When nothing feels right, how do you make the right decision?

**Story:** I'm currently going through a breakup which I'm tremendously heartbroken about (full story is in another reddit post) but I'm trying to do my best and focus on the future and address the issues that my girlfriend has and better myself (she believes that I need to work out what path I want to take for myself and follow my passions to find a fulfilling line of work) because in all honesty A. I need to for myself, and B. she and I are perfect together and I still believe that things can work out between us. 

In the past I have struggled a lot with anxiety - particularly in social situations but also in decision making because I can become paralysed from everything feeling so overwhelming. I didn't go to university because I didn't want to waste the time or money of anybody when I don't know what I want to do, and I stayed in the same job for 8 years because it was ""okay"" and I feared moving into something else that wouldn't be.

Currently I'm unemployed trying to work out what the hell I'm doing. I've updated my CV, I've been looking at different job websites trying to find something to do short-term to make some money and I've contacted places about doing volunteer work to gain experience. On top of that, I have been looking at college courses to see about learning something to follow my interests to develop into something I can make a living from.

Now, the thing is that I feel like I'm really too late to the party with doing one of these college courses - I've literally just turned 30 a few days ago - and especially in terms of trying to do something to show my girlfriend I can do something with my life, while simultaneously trying to make money and be independent as much as possible it feels like it will take too long. As well as that, I never really did well with academic work because I don't learn well from traditional classroom teaching or from books. I want to do something that I have a genuine interest in but besides doing a course I'm not sure where to go, or where to look. 

I have done online courses and I have done a classroom massage therapy course to try and explore different things but I just don't know which way to go. I love animals and would enjoy working with them and this is what I looked at doing a 1 or 2 year course in college, or alternatively an apprenticeship. The massage therapy idea I had was one that I still might pursue but I felt a little uncomfortable because it felt a little too personal. But perhaps this is just something that I need to persist with to get used to and be more professional at. I've also tried to do personality tests to see what career choices suit my personality (INFJ) and it basically reaffirmed what I already think: I want to help people, or do something creative - I just don't feel confidence in any aspect.

Honestly, I know I need to do this stuff for myself because my current situation is just not healthy, but my girlfriend is a huge driving factor in this because I just can't lose her for good.

178,"Hey everyone,

I have been seeing a guy for about a month and I really like him. We have a lot in common but our relationship seems to be very, very sex-driven and we have had no conversation yet of exclusivity or boundaries. However, we have expressed that really like each other's company and I have a sense that it has relationship-wise 'potential' if we decide to have that conversation- which we haven't had yet. 

We are 22 and in university (not saying that that justifies it) and he's been away for a few weeks and I happened to kiss someone last night on a night out. My friends say I am overthinking it because we are clearly not exclusive and just seeing each other. We plan on seeing continuing to see each other when he comes back in about a few weeks; and I see a potential for exclusivity in the near future but can't be too sure. 

I just want to note that I am one to prefer not talking about 'body count' or sexual escapades/history before exclusivity is established. I understand some people are like that but I don't find it necessary.  

I really do like him and I know the feeling is mutual but I wonder if what I did was 'wrong' and if any of you think that I am morally obligated to tell him. 

Am I overthinking this?

Any input and thoughts are much appreciated.

180,"Hello. It is nothing new to me for others to call me narcissistic, as it has been happening for a few years now. Anyway, tonight made me call it into question more than usual. I was out with my friends, and they were high as fuck. I prefer being sober, and was the only one that was sober, so I was the one driving. I was driving my friends vehicle because he picked me up earlier. I had driven his vehicle about 3 times prior to this. Anyway, I began going somewhat fast down a hill, at which point they started screaming at me to slow down. I then slowed down. We went to waffle house from there, and one of them made a remark about how there were only two, both being the opposite direction I was driving. I replied that I was confident that there was one the direction I was driving, but that I'd go to theirs (trying to not kill their high, and I don't care which we go to). Then, the guy who owns the car, said ""I'll prove it to you"" and got his phone out, and made a big deal over how many fucking waffle houses there are in our city. Anyway, we got onto the street that the waffle house was on, and I thought it was on the left, so I got into the far left lane, not turning my blinker on once. I then saw that the waffle house was on the right, and relatively close, so I got back over, not using my blinker again. I didn't use my blinker because it was half past midnight, and literally no cars were on the same street. Anyway, I parked, and the bumper hit the parking curb. Keep in mind, when I say hit, it was practically just touching it. By this point, the guy who owns the car, who I thought to be one of my best friends, is going off at me for how bad of a person I am. He tells me I am too analytical, and hypocritical. He wouldn't drop the fact that I didn't put my turn signal on, and that that was careless. Anyway, we went downtown. On our way to downtown, he would change lanes for no reason at all, very obnoxiously putting the blinker on. Once we got downtown, he would literally fail to see reds at points, and almost hit pedestrians. He would run reds, too, when no one was around. He would constantly forget which gear he was in, then inform us, and begin laughing. After this, I asked him how he could complain about my hypocrisy, and then pull this. His only response was ""my car, my rules."" He would also repeatedly tell me that there was a door to my left. During all of this, I was trying to get to the root of the issue, which I made very clear, by literally stating exactly that. He would just shut me down and tell me ""you never let anyone finish their points and you're just going to lock yourself into a ball of self pity."" We spoke for a while after that, but I don't feel as if any of it mattered, so I'll end this fucking novel here. I'm incredibly scared of being a narcissist, and I actively try to avoid being one. However, what tripped this guys trigger to such a large degree, is alarming to me. I didn't insult him once the entire night, and I gave up driving to stop further discord. Either way, I am very convinced he is the asshole, but that's a fucking side effect of narcissism. Thanks for reading this if you did, and thank you for your opinion",31May2018,1

182,"I'm sorry, this is a long post that required a lot of context. I didn't intend to write this much, but I feel like I had to for you to have an accurate frame of reference. 

Preface: My parents recently moved to another state, leaving their home in my current state empty (at least for the most part). My dad is the caretaker for my Alzheimer's-suffering maternal grandmother, but to continue getting paid by my state for this, he has to come back here from his state every 4-5 weeks, while my mom stays there and works her full-time job. His and my grandmother's stays are usually 1-2 weeks. With rent prices becoming increasingly unaffordable in my state, I asked my parents if I could live at their house here while I get back on my feet (paying $400/mo for a 2 bed 2 bath house instead of paying $2000 for a 1 bed 1 bath apartment is hard to resist). I've been living here since January, working two jobs to pay off debt and going to college full-time. 

The point is that I've hit rock-bottom living here, but it's the most I can afford given my current circumstances. Having to sleep on the couch while my dad and grandma come to my state for 1-2 weeks seemed worth it. 

Now here's where things get sticky. My brother and his wife have an abusive relationship. Things between them started falling apart this year. My brother cheated on his wife and explored his sexuality. He started threatening her and abusing her when she threatened to leave him. My parents, both having savior complexes, decided to fly my sister-in-law out to their state so she could get some time away from my brother. She's been staying with them for almost 2 months, living in their spare bedroom, and doing house/yard work for rent. 

My brother was livid when he found out about this. He started spreading rumors on social media that our dad was fucking his wife. We all ignored him because he's had a history with meth and heroin, and wasn't unknown to have outbursts like this. 

Three weeks ago, my dad, my sister-in-law, and my grandma all came to town for the weekend. Sleeping arrangements were tight and uncomfortable. I ended up sleeping on the floor so my dad could sleep on the couch so my sister-in-law could sleep in the bedroom. When my dad goes to sleep drunk (every night), he snores like an elephant that sorted a wet squid up its trunk. So, me, being on the floor, 3ft away from the couch he's asleep on, makes it hard for sleep to be restful. Especially with the ground rumbling from every sloppy breath he took. I was so glad he left and was only there for that weekend. Unfortunately, last week, my mom told me my dad, my sister-in-law, and my grandma were coming back out here again, but this time for two weeks. 

They got here Wednesday afternoon, but I went to work at 8am and didn't get home until after midnight. When I got here the lights were off and everything was quiet. Strangely, my dad wasn't sleeping on the couch; in fact, no one was sleeping in the living room. I figured that my dad got the bedroom this time around and my sister-in-law was sleeping on an airbed in my grandma's bedroom (the arrangements we had discussed originally). 

I quietly went into the kitchen to make a quick midnight snack before going to bed, when I heard my dad's bedroom door open. I put down what I was doing and looked down the hall, only to see my dad's white naked ass quickly retreating back into the darkness of his bedroom and closing the door. He didn't realize I was home. I pretended not to notice him. But I saw his bedroom lights turn on through the crack of the door and heard some whispering. When he came out he was fully clothed. He walked into the kitchen and we made small talk about how my day was and how his drive was. He then proceeded into the living room and laid down on the couch, when I walked in he asked, ""what, were you sleeping here?"" 

Then he passed out. 

I'm currently here, three hours after this has happened, laying on the floor with my headphones in, listening to music with my dad snoring audibly in the background, writing this post while trying to process what the fuck I just witnessed, anxious about what the next two weeks will be like, and the moral dilemma of if I should tell my mom (who struggles with mental illness) what I saw. It's worth noting that 13 years ago my mom told me she cheated on my dad and swore me to secrecy. I never told him because when I was young I didn't see how divorce would've been healthier, so I did everything I could to keep them together. 

But now, I'm almost 25. I've watched my parents marriage crumble and my mom slip into mental illness. Divorce would've been great 5-10 years ago, but my mom has gotten so codependent that she doesn't believe in herself anymore. She's afraid of life without my dad because that's all she's known for the past 30 years of their relationship. She doesn't know how to function as a singular person, and, despite loving encouragement, is too afraid to relearn how.

I'm afraid of what my mom would do if she found out about what I saw. She and I have had a difficult relationship, but I wouldn't wish her pain. I would feel guilty for shattering her world if I told her, and guilty if I don't say anything and she were to walk in on them together in her bed while they're back in her state. I'm not sure what I should do here and I hope those of you who've managed to read this whole thing can offer me some advice. 

How should I handle this? How would you handle this? What are your thoughts? 

And for the love of God, will someone stop this fucking snoring.",31May2018,1
183,"Note: I'm 19 and my experience with dating/rejection in general is really limited. Only had one girlfriend before and barely ever asked anyone out. Apologies in advance if I'm being silly here.

Last tuesday I met a gal while going out. We talked for a little bit but before I knew it we were making out. We exchanged numbers as well. In hindsight I wanted to talk to her more, I think she was more interested in making out though. Nevermind the fact I was quite drunk too and really wasn't thinking clearly at all, so we just kinda said goodbye. 

We started texting a bit yesterday, and eventually I asked if she wanted to grab a drink sometime. Her response (translated) was pretty much ""yeah sure why not"", which I found kinda strange. After that she also mentioned she doesn't want to give me the wrong impressions. I wasn't sure what she meant by this (and a little let down admittedly) so I asked her what she meant. Basically what I thought though, she told me she isn't really looking for anything serious, and she asked me what my own intentions are.

What should I do here? I'm definitely looking for something serious, so should I tell her this? Or should I say that I want to get to know her better and see where things go (which is also true)? Should I ask her first if she'd be open to a relationship even if she's not looking for one? This one seems like a bad idea though.

I was thinking I should meet her, see if we have chemistry and basically just see where things go from there. Just treat it like a date in a way. Is it stupid for me to hope she might be open to it anyway if we hit it off? I really like her, and the fact she was glued to my face for nearly an hour seems to indicate to me that this feeling is mutual. I'd honestly find it a waste if this doesn't turn into anything. 

I'm really inexperienced with this and honestly don't handle rejection well at all (don't worry I don't hold it against anyone, just hits me hard in the feels is all, I'm a sensitive bloke). Any advice would be appreciated, including on handling rejection. I guess I'm just scared of being lonely in a way.

186,"One of my friends I've known for around 9 years now. I hung out with him a lot back in secondary school, he was the first person I met, and I would have called him my best mate for around the first 4 years of knowing each other. After that point though, we started to follow our own different career paths, and I started meeting new people and working on myself. I've changed a lot in personality, and picked up new interests and hobbies along the way. I've become a different person than I was all those years ago.


I lost contact with him 3 years ago when we both went to different universities. When he wanted to reconnect with me about 7 months ago, I thought, ""cool, it would be awesome to see him again"". After meeting up, things felt a little weird. He hadn't changed at all after all the years, very much a typical, pretty lazy student. Instantly, I felt like we weren't clicking. I didn't find him engaging, his monotone voice and habits were starting to annoy me, and I don't think we really shared many jokes. He's the kind of guy to go on instragram and ask girls out in the comments of their profile. I didn't enjoy it when we first met up, so I gave it another go the next week and went to see a movie with him. Still, no click. I wrote it off as a loss and just said it's a result of our personalities drifting apart, especially considering we're now grown adults compared to when we met as children.

However, the problem comes in that he won't stop messaging me to hang out since then. I haven't really messaged him first at all, it's always him making the suggestions to go places. He's mentioned how he doesn't really know anyone at his university, how he hates the people he's living with and doesn't really hang out with anyone there. He works night shifts as a paradmedic, and is rarely up and about during the day, which probably doesn't help the matter. Whenever he asks to hang out, I mostly say yes out of pity, not because I feel I would actually have a fun time with him. I've considered the fact that he might be on the verge of depression, and I've given him as much advice on this matter as I could and reccomended he sees a specialist. He hasn't yet, and I don't know if he ever will (he's not the kind of person to make that kind of decision).

I'm painting him in a bad light here, he is genuinely a nice person. However, I find his communicatation is pretty bad (monotone voice, doesn't talk much or joke), doesn't seem to share the same sense of humour as me anymore and has a lot of habits that I don't like and have gotten rid of.


This has left me in the awkward position of hanging out with him because I don't want him to see him get depressed, not particularly enjoying it, then him messaging me at midnight on a Monday next week saying we should go and see a movie. I don't know what the fuck to do, as it stresses me out and I really don't want to tell my friend of 9 years that I no longer want to hang out with him. I need advice, from anyone who's been in this situation or someone who know's someone in one. Thanks Reddit! :)",31May2018,1
188,"I’m currently working in research and studying genetics. I’ve been working in cancer research for the past two and a half years but just found out I’ve been offered a job in mental health research.

I’m going to be moving to a different hospital, so working with my current team will be more difficult.

I have three options for my dissertation:

1. Systematic review in cancer (current knowledge)
2. Systematic review in mental health (will need to learn)
3. Cancer data processing project using data from current team

The benefit of a systematic review is that it won’t matter where I’m working. Although the data project will also be massively real based after the initial work with my team here. 


I can go into more detail about any of these but I’m currently unable to choose and think.

I have a meeting on Monday to discuss systematic reviews and I have to hand in a formative project proposal on the 20th June (although I have a marked assignment due the 16th that is currently taking my focus).

191,"Hi guys,

I was wondering, do you have any advice about how can I stop overthinking about my regrets about the things that I didn't do in the past? I feel like I missed out on my college years \(I have a few external reasons for that, but my fault can't be ruled off either\), and it bothers me so much now. I still have two more years of my masters' degree, though, and I plan to do a few stuff that I didn't get to do. My biggest regrets are the fact that my first REAL relationship \(sex too\) started at 23 yo \(right after getting my bachelor's degree\) and that I didn't really party much in college. Apart from that, I did have some nice moments, but I still feel sad that I didn't do so many things. I've asked something similar before, but now I would like some advice on how to stop overthinking about these things, because they are really getting to me. I've always had this problem with overthinking everything, and I want it to stop, because it refrains me from being happy.

Thanks for reading!",31May2018,1
192,"Okay so I have **two** problems I'm facing right now and I'm gonna try and keep the post short and simple.

Okay so not to long ago i got invited to play air\-soft for the first time in a very long time, they told me that they were gonna play at an abandoned warehouse a few km out of the city and asked me if i wanted to join. Clearly i accepted and so the plan was made. 

Me, guy **A**, guy **B** and guy **C** so a total of 4 guys were gonna do this. So I didn't have any gear so i went and bought mask, glasses and pants for roughly 70 EUR since that was the only thing they couldn't lend out to me other than the gun to play with. 

The day before the trip they asked me how I'm gonna get there and I said i don't know for the moment, most likely i'll take the car. And then they asked me if i wanted to get a ride in guy A:s car there. Of course i accepted so we don't have to take separate cars and it would be something fun that we could do and talk while we were on our way there. 

We got there and played and had such a great time.

When the game was finished guy A demanded payment from everyone, 10 Eur for the local which i had no idea about that we rented and the gas money, 8 Eur each which is really overpriced for 3 people having to pay. 18 Eur total now. Anyhow  we were gonna go home but guy B was complaining about that he was hungry and that he wanted to get some pizza, guy A and guy C thought this was a good idea but I really wasn't that hungry and was just a bit tired and wanted to head back home, but nonetheless i accepted and so we went there. guy C and guy B had ordered their pizza and sat down by the table and while i was ordering guy A said that guy B is the one paying. But since guy B was short on money for the moment guy A was paying for him for now. I said that was really nice so i ordered a Hawaii pizza and we sat down and ate. We finished eating and then we went into the car again and drove to guy B:s home to hang out. After we hung out I decided to go home and so did guy A. But guy A refused to drive me back even tho it was on the **same route home.** 

Clearly this made me a little sad that i had to take 1,5 hour buss home having to pay a bus ticket for over 6 eur becasue i went through different areas where i needed different bus tickets. 

So now, **two** weeks later i get a message from guy B asking me If i had paid guy A for the pizza. Obviously i was confused and asked him what this was about since it was him that was paying for it. Guy B started denying it and guy A now wants his 7 Eur for the pizza?

It's actually really honestly disappointing and makes me mostly sad over this charade... I've lived my life mostly alone not having to many friends and i actually thought i had some people just now but it feels like they used me to ease the money load on them? 

What should I do, I honestly feel like just blocking them all and isolating myself from everyone but I know that's not a mature way to go about things. But i don't want to pay them a single penny either after what has happened. What are your opinions? ",31May2018,1

197,"Original Post: This is gonna be long so here it goes.

My (24F) girlfriend and I (23M) had sex about a week or so back and I needed some help on a subject. During sex, I wore a condom the entire time. For half of the time, we were in one position until she orgasmed and then we changed positions until I finished. I made sure that the condom was still on properly before continuing. Right as I was nearing, I felt myself orgasming, so just around the time of the first wave of it, immediately I pulled out with the condom still on. I went and checked the condom and it held up perfectly. However, before I went and checked, there was white liquid on the entrance of her vagina and on the base of my penis and scrotum  where the condom stopped. I read somewhere that a lady's ejaculate is similar to a guys during certain time during their cycle (please correct me if I'm wrong and forgive if I am). Her period was due a few days ago and during that time it was due, she got sick with a nasty cold and has been stressed about school. I don't know if that would delay it but I bought her a pregnancy test in case anything. We decided if something were to happen, we would terminate the pregnancy. My question is, if things turn down that route, how can I be as helpful and supportive of her as possible? I love my girlfriend more than anything in the world and want to do everything I can in this world for her to help her and make her happy. I know how that procedure can be very hard on people and I want to be as helpful as possible and go about this in the best way I can. Thank you so much.

Update: I'm gonna see her later on today so that she can take the pregnancy test. During my lunch break I'm gonna buy her favorite chocolate as she takes it so it calms her anxiety and worries down. Whatever the outcome is, I want to and am gonna be here for her 100% of the way. I'll make another update when I can. Thank you for all your support!

Update 2: She took a test, and it came back negative. So far, things are okay but we're going to take another in a few days just to be safe.

198,"So basically, I am completely new to the job. I am a programmer and I am doing an internship in a startup. The people here are pretty cool but we don't have a lot of manpower, like most startups. Anyway, I just started a few days ago and while I like what I do, it is also exhausting.

202,"Ok so this is one of the most fucked up days I have ever had.

I was at school today \( I'm grade 10\), and I was sitting with my friends eating, when suddenly, one of my friends from another class \(let's call him lamb for now\) came up screaming to me, and told me that there were 2 people in the music practice rooms naked together. Of course, at first I thought it was bs, so I went with 3 other guys from my class to investigate. 

When I arrived, it seemed to be clear. However, lamb lead us to one of the music jamming rooms \(these are only like 2mx2m room with soundproof walls with the only window being on the door\). It looked normal, the lights were on, and it appeared like there was nobody inside. Lamb told us to be quiet and to look into the room. These practice rooms usually contain a piano and a drum kit. He told us to look through the reflection of the piano, and surely we could see a guy, having his pants unzipped getting sucked off by a girl. 

One of my friends ran off, whilst the rest of us were watching saying ""what the fuck"" etccc.......... The guy appeared to be in one of the higher grades, but the girl seemed to be younger than us. I couldn't see exactly in detail, so I took a picture on my phone, and examined it. The photo was pretty blurry, but it was good enough to see the general shape \-\-\&gt; it was pretty obvious that the girl was sucking the guy's dick

Meanwhile, the friend who ran off brought another 10 guys. They all started peering through the small window on the door, and there was a lot of commotion, so we all decided to back off a couple of metres, so that the people inside wouldn't hear. 

We all wanted to know who was inside the practice room, so we waited outside of the practice rooms pretending to be waiting for class. \(There are music classrooms next to these practice rooms\). Everyone started fetching other people to come over outside so we could wait, and people were asking me about the photo, and so I started showing them. \(Lol\)

After about 5 minutes, about 15 people had joined our group waiting to see who would come out of the music room. Finally, the school bell rung, and people from the other practice rooms were coming out. And then from practice room who had the girl and the guy, one of my friends \(Let's call him parrot\) came out. He was an older student, but the thing was I was so surprised it was him. He wasn't one of the ""cool guys"" of our school, but one of the nicer ones, and very charismatic. We hadn't known each other long, but I was still very surprised. 

He came out of the room looking slightly nervous and agitated at the amount of people here. He approached me and asked ""Hey, you going to the party next week?"". This question might seem normal, but I don't really know how to describe it. He said it in such a way that it was very blatant that he was trying to find something to talk about. Anyway we had a completely unrelated conversation and then he walked off. 

Apparently, I didn't notice, but another younger student had walked out from that very practice room, and quickly ran away, but I was too stunned to notice her. 

Anyways, over 20 people knew already, and we still had one period left, and as you can imagine, people started talking, and what also spread was that I had the photo of them. And after that, somehow a teacher found out about this. However, this was one of the most incompetent teachers, so I am not entirely sure that they would report this.

The thing I need help from is should I delete the photo or keep it?

Also if Parrot was exposed, he would potentially be expelled / be charged with sexual assault for oral sex with a minor.

I had felt quite attached to him \(no homo\) , so I want to support him, I feel like I want to support him, but everyone else seems to be against him. 

Do you guys think there is anything I could do?

And finally, would it be possible that I get into trouble as well?",31May2018,1

I decided to change it due to negative association with an abusive parent who gave me the name, on top of a few practical reasons. I love the name, the first letter starts with the same as my given one, and the name itself sounds exactly similar to a nickname of my real name. I don't think it would be hard to adjust to, however I'm nervous to go through with this name change because of social perception. 

I just recently moved in with my dad and stepmom, who are both awesome and supportive. However, my sister is the only irl person who knows I want to change my name. I'm scared to bring it up to anyone else because it feels.. awkward. I feel like I'm living a double life. I figure maybe I can just not bring it up to my parents until I move out, but is that the best thing to do? I feel like my stepmom will be a little more open to it than my dad, which is understandable. But what about the rest of my family? I'm worried what they'll think, I almost don't want them to know.

I have no problem introducing myself to people online as my preferred name, but not people irl. I feel like I'd just be lying. I'm worried people will think I'm weird. I got my name from a fictional character who is extremely inspiring to me and someone I identify with. No one knows that and I'm afraid to tell the truth because.. what if that's a ridiculous reason? What if my family doesn't think it's valid? I don't mind the legal hoops I'll have to go through, it's the social one that's the hardest for me.

I also don't know what to do when I start working. Can you legally go by a different name than what's on your paperwork? Would it be safer to just grin and bear going by my legal name? Again, it just makes me feel like a phony. I'm not planning to change my name legally for at least 4 more years. Within that time though, and even after, I'm scared I'll change my mind. What if it's a phase?

210,"I'm trying to decide my next steps. I am an American living in Poland, where I have a university degree, a decent job, and I do not need a work permit. I recently discovered that I am eligible for permanent residency here based on ancestry, which is a process that would then fast track me to Polish citizenship, assuming I can jump through all the bureaucratic hoops. I believe that the full process would take me about three years in total.

On the other hand, I have connections elsewhere in Europe, particularly Germany and the Netherlands, who could easily help me land a job there. The salary would be approximately double what I'm making now in a similar role. The downside of this would be that I would go back to only having temporary residency, and I would need a work permit. 

Is it a better financial and career decision to move abroad, with less security as an immigrant/expat? Or would it be wiser to stay in Poland and earn less, but open up many additional options for myself by getting EU citizenship?

In January I texted him that I wanted to stay to his house for a few days because I had a work to do there and I wanted to see him but he said he was busy and then he ghosted me.

So now. I dreamed about him last night and the dream was a little bit dark. I want to tell him about the dream because I am very superstitious but I dont know how to start the conversation. We haven't talked for about 4 months. I want to have a friendly relationship with him because I love his companionship. What should I text him?",31May2018,1
213,"So this happened two years ago, and was also two years after my good friend and his now ex broke up. I am still good friends with her ex, and was friends with her before they were dating. One day we were catching up over text, I was drunk, and she said she recently got her nipples pierced and jokingly asked if I wanted to see them. I stupidly said yes and she sent a Snapchat to me showing them.

I immediately regretted saying yes and felt so embarrassed and ashamed. Even though my good friend and her have been broken up for a while I still felt bad that I agreed to her sending the pic. I’ve learned since then and would never let something like this happen again, especially even if I was drunk. Should I tell my friend that this happened, or would that just cause unnecessary drama? Am I just overreacting?  ",31May2018,2

217,"I hope this isn’t too long.. I recently had a falling out with a female (let’s call her K) whom I thought was a pretty close friend. My husband and hers are very close but definitely drinking buddies and K’s husband (H) has a drinking problem. They just had a baby and ever since she was pregnant she has been on his case about controlling his drinking and from an outside standpoint it truly seems that he’s trying.  H never goes out anymore, he DOES drink at home and I know he still gets hammered a lot, however, before K and I had our falling out I saw that H was doing every little thing she requested except completely quitting drinking. I’m proud of him because I know how much he has improved. From his perspective he is clearly an alcoholic and always has been but he is getting everything done around the house which I have noticed. Not really my business though. Anyway..

I do see K’s side, too. H does not help with the baby much and spends most of his time outside working or at his job (or drinking) and that’s got to be frustrating  for her. 

This is my issue: K and I had a falling out because she has been so insufferable and stressed out and pushing everyone away from her and H in hopes (I think) of solving his drinking problem which he is not on board with. Last week my husband and I had 2 friends visiting from out of state and all 4 of us went to the pub which we don’t do often. Soon after arriving H showed up alone and then I received a scathing text from K pretty much accusing me of enabling H and saying she hopes I have fun partying with her husband. I did not invite him nor know that he would be there. What the heck you guys? I’m super hurt about this and bummed out for my own husband. We are both pretty much losing our friends and it sucks. I’m really trying to see all sides of this and it just seems like K is being very mean and dismissive of anyone else’s feelings but her own. Maybe this is their family issue and I need to be less concerned but that text hurt because my husband and I have always tried to be there for her and when I explained myself to her she was one sided and defensive and no one can have a discussion with someone like that.

218,"So, I’m in a relationship with someone and I have been for about four years now. Our relationship is great and I don’t doubt that I’m in love. We met at a movie theater and it’s been a good overall relationship. 

When I was younger, I had a crush on my brothers best friend. As we got older we started messing around and we ended up really liking each other. We knew each other’s past because we grew up with one another and we knew each other like best friends did. 

Four years ago, we both started seeing other people but we still kept fooling around with one another behind everyone’s back. Fast forward to about a year ago, they end up having a baby. This of course broke my heart because I somehow knew that the fooling around had to come to an end. Even though a baby was involved, my crush didn’t want to stop messing around and when I cut things off, no one took anything ok. It’s been a year since I stopped talking to this person and not a day goes by where I don’t think about the two of us. I also don’t want to end my relationship because it’s a pretty good one, there’s communication, there’s mutual understanding, there’s patience. But sometimes I feel like maybe I should cut the relationship, even though I’ll end up with neither one of them. I really don’t know what to do. I’ve been tempted to text the crush but not wanting to out of fear. ",31May2018,1

222,"Hey everyone \- kind of my first text post here. Sorry if it's a bit long, there's a lot of info left out.   


Background info: I work for a large HOA \(Homeowner's Association\) in the Sunshine State. Started here mid September as a ""Senior Supervisor"", wherein my main job duties were directly overseeing our lifeguard staff and running the main office full time during the week. I'm also responsible for reservations, pool maintenance, and our Fitness Center. The only two people above me upon my hiring were/are the Community Manager, who is my direct supervisor, and the Assistant Manager \(AM\), who is a glorified accounting clerk, and who I do not report to for anything.   


Long story short, AM worked as a lifeguard here a number of years ago, left for a couple, and then was hired on as an accounting clerk responsible for HR, payroll, and invoicing. AM was then ""promoted"" to an Assistant Manager, with no incurred responsibilities, with the assumption/deal that she would obtain her CAM license, something necessary to have in order to do a lot of HOA business. That was about three years ago. The Association paid the costs, around $500, for her to take the steps leading up to and including taking the State exam, which she failed. She had the chance to take it again, and ended up waiting so long to reschedule it that her eligibility expired.

She's currently re\-applied, again, and is waiting to take the exam the 24th.

Meanwhile, I got my CAM license within 6 months of being with the Association. At the last Board meeting, I was promoted to Assistant Manager as well, meaning we now have two assistant managers. With this, I incurred new responsibilities, mainly taking some of the Community Manager's CAM\-required things off his overloaded plate.

My main inquiry for advice is monetary. I make 31K and did not receive a pay bump when I was promoted, but will receive back pay when my new pay is approved at our next board meeting. Is it unreasonable of me to ask to make what the other AM makes, 37K? Especially considering I have my CAM license already, have applicable managerial experience, and a degree.   


Thanks in advance. ",31May2018,1

Wednesday morning, her dog got very sick and they put her down. I know from the text she sent that she blames me. I feel so guilty and awful from it.

Which would be doable, except the pay is really low (hourly, an average of only about $36 000/year gross). The average entry level position for my field in Canada should pay $43 000, which is the estimate for someone without a master's.

233,"Hey guys,

I’m not too sure where to start....

A brief history of my life: I had a childhood full of little traumas and abandonment in mainly emotional forms. Now, I have depression, anxiety, slight PTSD and borderline personality disorder tendencies. All due to upbringing and genetics.

Anyway, due to my childhood and current mental issues, I am very good at seeking emotional dependency from others and trying to build a deep emotional connection to people where I get overly and unhealthily attached. I’m currently 20 years old.

3 years ago, I started dating my best friend. We were together for 2 years. Before I get into things, I really did love him, a lot. While we were together, we had many arguments over stupid things that should never have got to the argument phase. I also noticed some things about him that I found turn offs \(namely; his arrogance, playing the victim/pity\-card\), but I loved him too much to end things. Every time I thought about it, I thought about all his good qualities how he just feels like home to me, how I could be myself around him, how we both wanted the best in each other, and how deeply I cared about him.

Eventually, we told our families that we were dating, and my family was very strict with things which bothered him and pushed him away. He broke up with me because my family was getting too involved and he wanted to be able to make memories with the girl he loves and enjoy his youth with her. This was nearly a year ago.

Since then, it has been CONSTANT arguing, if not every single day, then at least a few times a week. AT LEAST. When we first broke up, I wanted to take time away to heal and move on, but he didn’t want to. Neither of us wanted to lose the other person, so he ended up convincing me to stay in his life and not cut him out completely. Being honest, in hindsight, if I had tried to cut him out, I would have failed, now having gone through multiple attempts of cutting him out for good. Anyway, since then, constant arguing. Jealousy on my behalf due to noticing he has become very close to another girl. Him treating me like virtual trash\-ignoring me, being incredibly blunt, and just generally horrible and cold. Me being rude in response. Him again being even more cold. Basically, a never ending cycle.

After we broke up, until around April this year, we would hook up occasionally. I would ask him if he still had feelings for me, because as stupid as this sounds, I could feel that he did with how he kissed me, and how gentle and tender his touch was. He kept avoiding the questions, which obviously bothered me a lot. One day, he cracked and answered, “I have slight feelings for you, but you have more cons than pros that turn me off and push me away.” I felt like a piece of meat that he was just using for his own fun. That happened in April. Around two months ago, I had enough and decided to completely cut him out of my life on all social media platforms. During that time, I was hurting really badly, so I took a really bad coping mechanism which was to bad mouth him to my friends, namely a mutual friend of ours. Around a month ago, we were at the same place at the same time, and we talked. He told me that when I was asking him if he had feelings for me and if he would ever reconsider us, his answer was yes, but he didn’t want to say so because for the first time ever, he saw that I was finally focusing on my studies and doing well at uni, and he didn’t want to distract me from that. He found out that I had badmouthed him to our mutual friend, who he is now no longer friends with because of what happened. He said it would take me a really long time to get his trust back. So again, we started speaking. And again, it’s been constant arguing. Sometimes he will be warm, very rarely, but when he is, it reminds me why I fell in love with him originally. Then he becomes cold, and I wonder why I bother with him at all if I get hurt by him sooo often.

At the moment, I do still have feelings for him, but they are no was as strong as they once were, not after everything that’s happened. Some times when we argue, I feel suicidal, and a lot of the time I end up self\-harming. I often just want an escape from things because I’ve tried to cut him out, and I mentally and emotionally cannot do it. My psychologist has been great in supporting me, she understands that it’s incredibly difficult for me because I have virtually no support from family or friends, and that I’m so attached to him due to my upbringing.

Anyway, this whole thing is a ramble/vent. I’m really lost on what to do from here and where to go. If you’ve gotten to the end of this, a thousand thank yous. Any advice or thoughts at all would be VERY much appreciated.

236,"First let me start off, with I know that it is partially my fault.  I chose an entrepreneurship route rather than the classical career route. Because of this decision, I am where I am today. My business was doing very well in 2012 -2014, but I had a big snag and I have been trying to recover ever since. So because of this I have had to rely on my parents, until either my business takes off again, or I am gainfully employed. 

However, since I was young, I understood the importance of contributing to the household to show appreciation to my parents. I have acquired skills such as carpentry, plumbing, electrical work, computer repair ( I have  B.S. in Electrical engineering and a M.S. in Telecommunication Networks), cooking, auto repair, landscaping and some others. I figured if the company doesn't work or I can't find work, I can make my own work with at least one of these skills. I use these skills to contribute to the household. Every once in a while I get a nice gig, where funds are allocating to savings and the household. I really try my best to be a responsible and appreciative son. 

Ever since 2013, the relationship between my father and I has been heading downhill. However, since I try to be a spiritual person, I always practice honoring my father, but yesterday really brought me to place of anger. 
My father retired and started to become heavily influenced by my neighbor's boyfriend.  Things have been falling apart in this house, and he has been ignoring the repairs. In my youth I would anxiously try to repair them. However, he has made realize this isn't my home, so I have fallen back on taking the initiative on a lot of things. I used to go all over with my father, helping his family with computer, electrical, and simple home repair stuff. I have four other siblings and the older ones show no interest. yet they have no problem demanding assistance from dad.  I did a lot of things for my family(relentlessly), because I know my father is getting older and I didn't want him to over exert himself. I don't really care too much for my family, but if it means my father's life extends a few more years so be it. 

Yesterday, I look outside my window and I see the neighbor's boyfriend edging our lawn with a razor blade. My father doesn't know I heard him complain about the situation, but I saw he was visibly upset. He stood there and watched him do it and then swept up after him. The things is, I worked very hard on that lawn. This gentlemen cut the roots of the grass, so I anticipate some dead grass on the edge in a week or so. When my mother confronted dad about this, ""oh this what I always do."" (You are lying, just look at the other edges) Now in this household, no one likes this neighbor's boyfriend. So for dad to do things for him at our expense brings us great frustration. We hold our tongue, because he heart attack at the beginning of the year and it was rough seeing him in that hospital. (interestingly, the day of his procedure, only my mother, my younger brother, my uncle and myself were present) We are always astonished by dad's behavior, and I'm wondering how long must I remain ""spiritual."" 
This moment just sparked up so many unpleasant memories of my father. I can't tell you how many times I found something missing, only to find out he gave them to someone, then throws insults as me for acknowledging his inappropriate behavior. I get called selfish and whole array of things one night, then the next a knock on my door "" can you help me."" I have siblings who didn't feel it was necessary to be in the hospital, but as soon as he got out.. hey I need you do something for me. lol I asked him if he wanted to help me study for an electrical exam and he flat out told me no I have no interest, then a day later asked me for help on something. I used to get screamed at for using the printer for school projects. So I bought my own. My sister comes here uses the printer and says nothing to her. She leaves him papers to scan that he doesn't want to do, but says nothing. ( He had three children before he met mom, and my younger brother and I surmised that he stills feel guilty about that and my siblings take advantage of that guilt) 
I worked very hard on that lawn, and for 30 years we never received a complaint that the grass was touching their driveway. The previous owner, the husband passed away, was a great neighbor and never once complained. The wife been there almost 10 years after and never complained. then all of a sudden without asking us, this boyfriend just starts cutting away. Then I get screamed at for showing how inappropriate he was acting. 

At what point do you cut your father off. I've been playing the smile while scheming approach. I don't ask for anything and I'll help until i know I'm at a stable point and then I can release all the pent up anger. I'm also wondering if i should continue not to say anything and when I'm stable again, continue not saying anything. However just cut him off without warning. I used to say this a lot in the past, but then I would picture losing my father, get emotional and tell myself to just get over it. However, I noticed I'm not feeling the same way in the past. I also know that there are people suffering from stronger challenges and my situation is minuscule compared to others. lol I appreciate who ever reads this vent. I will most likely continue to be there for this guy, but this is just beyond frustrating. Dad has helped me financially many times. He was the one that taught me those skills, and he has invested in me. However he has this mentality that everyone in this house owes him (apparently I owe him the most) but he owes everyone else. Anyone else go through this? Is this even sustainable behavior? ",31May2018,1

Eventually everything seemed to cool down until a couple of months later she made him runaway from home with her for a few days. I tried my best to tell him how stupid  that was but that turned into a mini fight, that's when i realized that this girl could be the end of our friendship (i know that sounds pretty selfish but making friends is hard man and i really care about him). Once again that kind of blew over, he came home and we had a good month or two. Last night he texted me that he had something important to tell me apparently somehow her father found out the had sex and now her father is trying to end their relationship. Not going to lie i felt a little relieved at first but then i realized this wasn't going to be easy at all. He is acting like the world is going to end. I tried my best to convince him that not everything was lost and they might even still have a chance together but he wasn't having any of that. Now he said he doesn't want to talk to anyone and is going dark. 

Help me Reddit, i'm worried that he might do something stupid but i feel like anything i say is just going to make everything worse. i've already lost sleep over this whole stupid thing,it's killing me to think that a 8 year friendship might be over because someone can't get over their first girlfriend. Once again i know that i'm pretty selfish here but i really do care about him.",31May2018,1

243,"I have a serious problem of being a ""people pleaser"". Recently I've learned the saying ""don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm."" and that's the best description of what I do. It's exactly what I've always done. Either with my parents, with people I live with, coworkers and strangers. It's like I have this idea that I should always try to be flexible and help everyone/do everything to accomodate people's needs. And I often regret it, suffer from it, get extremely anxious/angry about it but can't seem to learn from it. 

My friends always try to help me, telling me what to say in some situations where I'm clearly being exploited but I just can't grow the courage to say any of it. 
A few examples to showcase what I'm trying to say: 

* A few years ago, I did an exchange program to live with a foreign family. The father treated me horribly but I still stayed for 9 months with them. I shared the bathroom with their kids but wasn't allowed to go pee at night, after the baby had gone to bed so as to not wake him up. So to keep everyone happy but also cater to my need to pee, I peed in those red plastic cups I kept in my bedroom and then would throw them away first thing in the morning. (I'm a girl, to give some setting to how difficult this was).

* A coworker of mine that absolutely hates me often asks for me to cover her shift (her classes, to be more exact - I'm a teacher) and I never seem to say no, even when I already had made plans outside work. She never talks to me at work and constantly berates both me and my classes, but whenever she needs someone to sub in for her, I'm always the first choice for having the free window. 

* I have roommates who have been living here for free - both of them had setbacks and haven't been able to pay rent properly (they pay it directly to me, everything's in my name back at the real estate agency) since February. I've been busting my ass off to cover all bills and utilities while they seem to keep living their lifestyle of drinking beer, smoking week, eating out and partying. I'm not sure how much of that is being provided to them by friends/dates and how much is coming from their money that should be being used to pay me. 

* Speaking of said roommates, there's a party/gathering every week here in the apartment, where they're loud/have loud music on and even with my asking them to turn it down, they never seem to do it in a proper way that will allow me to sleep. For example, last night this happened and I just gave up on sleeping and stayed up until later than they had gone to bed just resenting everything and overthinking. 

* Before them, I used to live with another roommate (same paying arrangement) who also left without paying me 5 months worth of rent. I have no way to track her down since she went back to her state. She told a different story to her friends as to why I kicked her out of the apartment (she had stolen from me, and I don't even know where I found the strength to confront her) and they trashed the apartment when she was picking up her things (I was at work).

* I'm extremely tight on money (obviously, with covering living for three people alone) and was offered a private student in the morning. Although when I put things down, the amount I'll get for these classes won't be worth it if I consider how much travel costs will be. Despite that, there I am, waking up way too early for someone who works until 9PM to practically work for free. 

So basically what I need is some real talk advice about how can I grow a thicker spine and start being a little bit more selfish to make my life less overwhelmed. Apparently I'm not learning from my experiences and keep trying to cater to everyone's needs. 
I apologize for any grammar mistakes since English is my second language and also formatting, I'm on mobile. 

TL;DR: I'm the biggest pushover ever and can't say no to people. Whatever advice is given to make me help change this will be greatly appreciated. ",31May2018,1

246,"So my sister has a business where they source bully sticks from North and South America, and they are sent out on a monthly subscription basis. 

A lady left a review that they are ‘mass produced in China’ and ‘its a scam’. This couldn’t be further from the truth. 

My sister and her SO spend so much time finding natural bully stick and making sure they are ethically sourced.  We have nights where me and my husband go and help them pack their orders. We sit in her living room and watch TV most of the time and my sister write personalized messages on each bag for each dog. Hundreds of bags she writes on.

248,"My cousin, who I love very much and consider to be a very close member of my family, can be somewhat of an irritant. No matter what I bring up around her, she finds a negative connotation to reply with. For instance, her husband asked how a movie my wife and I recently saw was. Her response to our answer was how she does not like the theater we went to, blaming her bad experience on the theater, making us feel akward.

“Deadpool 2” was brought up, and I mentioned that Bill Skarsgaurd is also Pennywise in the “It” reboot, to which she replied “Oh, I don’t do scary movies”. To me, I would have responded with a “No Way! That is awesome. I haven’t seen that one yet” or something to that regard.  

Later when we ordered food, she gave an “Eww” remark at ordering bleu cheese dressing. Like really lol?  

Last Christmas when my family was putting music on in the car, the driver put on Tenacious D. Her immediate response? “I don’t like Tenacious D”. Sorry, the list just goes on and on.

250,"Hi r/advice. It's my first time posting here. I'm 27 and am just now going back to school. I've traveled a lot, lived in different states and am pretty happy with how I spent my 20s. My biggest regret is not going to school when I was 18-22. I went on and off, always struggled financially when I lived at home, had a rocky relationship with my parents, yadia yadia. I moved across the country with my s.o. and decided I'd go back to school after a year so I'd have residency in that state. (I was 25 then) After a year we broke up and I left. I've been in my new state for just over a year. I stated at this community college for environmental science, because that's what I've always wanted to do. However, I'm having a hard time with my math courses and am getting really depressed about being a 27 y.o. community college student. Community college is also expensive, and it will take me another year to graduate, and then I'd have four more years of full time classes. At best I'm looking at being career ready at 31. 


I have this sinking feeling that I'm doing the wrong thing, that I've already fucked up my life beyond repair. I want to be educated formally, I want to have a respectable career and make a living. I just don't know if it's realistic to go to traditional school at this point.


I've thought of other trades, for example, I am into skin care a
 holistic approach to wellness. I've considered massage therapy or becoming an esthetician. Does it seem like it makes more sense to take one of those routes at this point? Has anyone else been in this position?

252,"I've been of legal working age for 10 years and in that time I've had 12 jobs. I've worked in retail, customer service, IT and administration. For some reason, I've never been able to get a job and stick to it. The longest I've held a job for is just over a year. I have never been fired, it's always been my decision. Something weird comes over me and once I feel it, the feeling intensify until the only solution is, leaving the job. It makes me restless. I feel like it's not where I belong, or not what I want to do. I feel like I'm not doing enough with my life and I feel bored. Not the average 'ugh work tomorrow' bored, but an aching, sad feeling that gets worse over time. It consumes my thoughts while I'm in that job.

I know that it's ridiculous to leave a job without another one to go to, but for some reason, I just don't think logically. I feel an overwhelming urge to get out of there. It's really hard to explain. The real confusing thing, I am so disappointed in *myself.* This is not what I want! At all. It's embarrassing. I want to have a career, a job that I am proud of. I want to work hard! As much as it sounds the opposite, deep inside I know that I'm an incredibly hard worker and I've proved that if I put my all into things, I can really achieve big results.

255,"I need some unbiased outside opinions because between myself and my wife, we have speculated far too much and we're not really sure what to expect. Please allow me to give a detailed explanation.

**TL;DR - I left a child 16 years ago and now she wants to meet me. I'm horrified at what's going to happen at that meeting.** 

Before I met my current wife, I was dating this other woman whom I won't name, but we'll refer to her as 'B'. We lived together for a couple of years and although I was content in the relationship, I was never happy enough to take it to the next step. I was young and very stupid and we stopped using protection. During the course of our time together 'B' got pregnant twice and lost the baby both times. Prior to that, I had had multiple thoughts of leaving the relationship because I hadn't felt fulfilled, but it always seemed like another excuse kept me from doing it. She had a miscarriage, well I can't leave her in that state. Then it was Christmas, or her birthday, or whatever other excuse I gave myself to remain the comfort zone of a seemingly stable relationship. 

Well, the third time she got pregnant, I figured that I had to rip the bandaid off because it wasn't fair to anyone. I left the relationship which angered her and broke her heart. In the back of my mind, I thought that maybe this one wouldn't carry to term either and she'd miscarry again. Shortly after our child 'L' was born. 

I tried to be a part of the process. I requested to go to some of the doctor's appointments with 'B' and although it was hard on her, I know, I thought I was doing the right thing. She requested that I stopped going and had her doctor ask me to stop coming because it was stressful, so I relented and didn't attend the appointments. Later when 'L' was born, I tried to be a part of her life as well. I asked for visitation and we ended up having to go to court over it. After a lot of lawyer fees and multiple lies on 'B's part that the courts took as gospel no matter what I rebuttaled with, I was awarded visitation every 2 weeks for only 4 hours at a time on one day, with supervision and ordered to pay $1100 per month child support. I couldn't afford this. I was making around $40k per year in a really expensive part of the country and could barely make ends meet as is, but I did my part and tried. 

I would take what little visitation I had and cherish the time I had with 'L', but whenever I would bring her back, I would get berated that she looked like she had poop on her (which she didn't) and that 'B' was sure I was unfit and unsafe. I had managed to negotiate out of the supervised visits, but part of that negotiation was that a social worker would review the visits after they were done, to which 'B' would go on tirades about how she believed 'L' wasn't in proper care with me.... even though that wasn't the case.

This went on for a few months, angers swelled, I got more and more broke and desperate and then 'B' came to me with an offer. She said if I gave up all custody and all visitation and disappeared into the ether, never tried to contact her or 'L' that she would relinquish child support from my burden. I reluctantly accepted because I was on the verge of being bankrupt and we had our lawyers sign it into a legal document. I had no contact with 'L' from the time she was 6 months old on and I've held up my end of the bargain to the T with not trying to reach out in any way.

Well, a week ago 'B' reach out to me and said that 'L' wants to meet me. At first I was elated. This has been something that I've often thought about, even as time has gone on and I've met my current wife and we've had two children together, I've always thought about 'L' in the back of my mind. 'B' said she wants to meet in a restaurant near their house and wants only me to come, not my wife or my kids. I understand not wanting my kids there, but my wife is my support structure. She compliments the sides of me that I don't get right, such as dealing with high stressful social situations. She rights me. I need her there more than I want her there yet they're being pretty persuasive about wanting only me at the meeting.

I feel like because of that that they're just setting me up to be a whipping post. An hour of ""why did you leave?"" and ""why don't you love me but you had two other children?"" I'm not sure how to take it. I don't want to miss out on the chance to meet 'L' but at the same time, I don't want to just go there and get beaten up over something that happened 16 years ago... and something I tried desperately to do right by. I'm not sure what to think. I'm not sure what to say. I feel nervous and scared. I'm a grown ass man, I shouldn't have to feel this way. Has anyone here experienced something similar and can give me words of encouragement?

256,"Here's some context. OK so in all my 4 years of high school I've never been to a school dance they just never appealed to me. I'd rather be at a house party with my friends than a school dance with my friends. Also, I would consider myself a shy person, but some how I managed to ask out the girl I like to prom and to my surprise she said yes! I don't think I've ever been this happy in my life 

Sadly, this only lasted a few minutes once I left her house she texted me saying ""Hey Gabe as friends right? \*Laughing emoji\*"" once I received this I instantly knew I was about to get friend zoned. I guess I just wanted to hear say it. So I responded with ""No, dingus"" she then proceeds to tell me that she isn't allowed to date. which I believe because her parents are extremely strict. We kept on texting and she eventually says she doesn't see me the way I see her but continues to say something along the lines of ""I still want to go though as friends you still want to"" I responded saying yes but I felt bittersweet the rest of the day. The next day I tried my best not to be awkward however my friend said that he could sense it and to make things worse I was ignoring her and her texts a bit all day which I know is a terrible thing to do. I know I can't force her to like me but I was just bummed out that we didn't share the same feelings for each other. All my friends tell me to lighten up and say that her feelings can change which I doubt. 

Now I've accepted the fact that she doesn't like me and that we're just going as friends. At this point I'm just trying to have a great time, but the thing is that I just realized have no idea what you do at prom. I probably should've mentioned this earlier but I've never really liked a girl and therefore have never had a girlfriend. And to top it all off I don't know how to dance.",31May2018,2
257,"Guys and gals I'll try to keep this short. Please be blunt.

I was hired in Feb to do yard maintenance at a big company property (cutting grass, spring cleanup). The snow melted in the beginning of May, so I just did small jobs up until then and was quite bored. 

My boss was supposed to get the tractor mower running and train me to use it in the beginning of May but has yet to do either. So I'm left using the weed whipper to trim the sides of the grassy areas, around trees , etc., while not actually cutting the entire field. This leaves me frustrated and overworked as I'm walking around with this 50 lbs thighs strapped to me in 25C all day for the entire week. Alternatively I clean up garbage or stacks of broken pallets which people carelessly through around over the winter.

So recently I've been taking it a lot easier because my wrist was injured at the gym/rock climbing and my right knuckles are literally sore from holding the trigger on the weed whipper most of the day for 3 weeks straight. Until I've been trained to use the tractor, the work I'm currently doing seems pointless. 

Am I being a lazy pos by dicking around at work and not trimming the same shit every few days, or am I justified at least somewhat in just slowing down til the tractor is ready to roll?",31May2018,1

I'm terrified of being alone. I hate not being in a relationship (anymore) and I feel it's a negative influence everytime I do go on dates/get close to girls.

259,"I have had a very good and close male friend since I was 15. I am 25 now. Our friendship has highs and lows over the 10 years. One of those lows was when he sexually assaulted me 3 years ago while he was drunk. Although I was interested in him in high school, the feelings have long been gone because I realized that although he's great, he's not my type. He also did not have feelings for me in hs. This incident, however, has made me think otherwise. I could have very easily slept with him that night and I did not. I even pulled away each time he tried to kiss me. I remember sobbing when I was finally alone because I could not believe someone who had been one of my closest friends had violated me like that. I also sobbed because the awesome friendship I had seemed obsolete. When I told my mom about what happened, she and my dad apparently were upset that I was not willing to pursue a romantic relationship with him (because if white people had arranged marriages, our families would have hooked us up instantly). I told my mother that what he did was a crime and while I could have called the police, I did not. She just kept encouraging me to pursue something with him, all while failing to look the past the idea that a decent-looking, intellectual and athletic family friend could violate me. She also told me that I should be happy that guys give me attention, then added ""well, you looked sexy in those jeans"".

It's not just the occasional walking into a room and forgetting why you are there, I do that every day. If I need to remember to grab my camera, or some paperwork before leaving the house I will invariably forget it. a few days ago my gf asked me to change the laundry over when it's done washing, then she reminded me 3 times. I had forgot by the time she reminded me each time, I finally decided to set an alarm for myself in 15 minutes so I would do it.

As of recent, I basically cannot hold a conversation. I forget words all the time. Last night I was at a friends house and I would just trail off and do the whole ""umm, uh, what is that thing, oh yeah \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_."" Things like forgetting the most basic words ""red meat"" and such.

All this negativity just made me really tired of him. Like, just watching the phone ring exausts me. I don't want to keep him chasing though, because it's honestly to me a dick move to keep him in the dark. Last night after he called me 3 times he called my mom. Like wtf

266,"Hoping to get some experienced or professional advice on a problem I have. Throughout the past few years I’ve been a pretty big party person. I’ve had several blackout nights and some of which I’ve taken adderal for more of a high or to last longer. Rare cases I’ve blacked out on that. And in each of these rare cases I’ve done something I never would have believed myself capable of. 
1. I partner swapped with my fiancé and my best friend and his gf. I never would have been okay with my fiancé and best friend together (it ended the engagement) but I rationalized it as perhaps wanting the other girl somehow? Not sure what I thought 
2. I cheated on my gf. It was during a fight but again I took a ton of adderal and still blacked out because I drank SO much. I rationalized it as some part wanting out of the relationship?
3. Most recent and the reason for this post. I’m happily with a girlfriend I wish to be engaged to soon. I party much less these days but because we were so tired and had company from out of town we took adderal to stay awake and party. We ran into her cousin who I had never met before and all is going well. Her cousin finds some guy she wants to take home and everyone is crashing at our place. I start to blackout around here. When we get home everyone wants to sleep except for me, who gets games out and continues to drink more even though no one is really interested. The cousin and hook up guy get an air mattress downstairs, the rest go upstairs to bed. I’m outside drinking and listening to music and text my gf that I can’t come inside because I hear them having sex so I’m waiting for them to finish. Don’t remember anything from here on but the cousin meets my gf the next day and says that I came inside and watched them a couple times. Like I would pass by the room and look in or something. Then later on somehow I crawled over to them and put my hand on her clit to help get her off. They realize it’s me, freak out and are like wtf, and then I stand up and say let’s do more shots before taking one in the kitchen and going to bed. 
SO I’m mortified to hear all of this. I don’t think they would lie but I cannot rationalize any of this. I didn’t find the cousin attractive, I’m very happy with my gf, that’s fucked up and creepy on a million levels, and I’ve been trying to prove myself trustworthy for months due to lying months prior. There is no way any part of me could have wanted to do such a thing. I’ve wanted to kill myself with shame and guilt. It’s worse than anything else I’ve done. I find myself blaming the adderal and alcohol and swearing never to do that again in life but I don’t know if this is enough. I told my gf I would see a counselor but i feel like it’s hard to get therapy for what you don’t remember and would never do. Is this a common drug issue or do I have deeper issues? Should I see a therapist? I’m worried about drug abuse or anything on my file because I’m going into the medical field this year. I’m not sure what steps to take

TLDR: I got blackout drunk on adderal (way more drinks than usual blackout) and basically molested my girlfriends family member. Wondering how I could have done so and what I should do next other than never do drugs again",31May2018,0

272,"This problem is keeping me awake, so I need some serious thoughts on this.

Earlier this month both me and my wife lost our jobs. I do have toughly $20k coming in  a severance package, my wife has $0 coming.

I have a crazy ex\-wife who is always trying to sue me over my divorce with her. A few weeks ago she won a judgement for $10k by lying in court. We are still seeking clarification on how long we have to pay the judgement but she is now threatening me with jail time \(not sure how\). We will be speaking with our lawyer about that. No doubt even if we pay her off their will be another lawsuit coming from her soon... if she could sue my dog she would.

However my wife is from the Philippines, so we have an option of starting a new life their. The standard of living will be lower than the US, pay will be way less... but the severance package will go further \(low coast of living\). This will also give me some protection from the crazy ex\-wife and her legal actions. 

Moving the the Philippines will give us  the quiet life we deserve but it also comes at the cost that I may never be able to return to the US. As most of us know people do get arrested at the border for unpaid judgements, things they would never extradite a person for.

I guess it comes down to two options. Stay and fight and loose everything \(even my freedom\), or cut my losses and accept a lower quality of life.

I'm a 2nd year student in Comp Sci, he's a student in Business. He's inside an association that organize events around their campus and elsewhere. It's a pretty serious assocation from what I've heard of them.

He's in charge of web developmnent and people in his association asked something from him that he couldn't do, so he asked me for help.

He first described it as a timer, so it's a fairly simple thing to do I just did it on the go.

It turns a bit more complicated than that. For people who wants some technical details, it's a timer that must be synced along with other computers on the same network. There's one ""admin"" that can do stuff on the timer. Since I have no knowledge how their network works, I don't know how someone will be defined as an "" admin "" but I've found a workaround.

Anyway, it's a little bit more than just a timer. And it's probably gonna take up a day or two of my time.

Now I kinda feel guilty about asking for payment, because you can just google stuff and do it, which is probably what I'm gonna do, but at the same times, if I don't ask payment, I just feel like being used? Beside it's not my problem and it's urgent, and I could've ask for more because of demand and supply.

294,"First off, we aren’t dating but we have been very sexually active with each other lately. Just a month in a half or two ago we became roommates. And now, she just announces she wants to have a threesome? Like what?!

\&gt; Before I go into detail, I’m a girl but I was born with a dick. And I also have natural breast with a b\-cup.  I don’t have a deep voice either so please don’t torch me with the you’re a guy comments. Even if I miraculously am, even looking feminine everywhere else... I still need help with the same problem.

The main reason I mentioned that is because my not girlfriend practically wanted us to be more intimate with each other. Mainly because I was pretty sexually active. Once I got out of my shell about looking like a girl but having a dick, I banged so many girls I got a reputation. I even tried guys at first but majority of them was either grossed out about it or refused to have sex with me because I had a bigger dick. \(And I always had the mentality to let the guy fuck me, I didn’t try to ask to go inside them. Eventually I met my roommate and she and I got extremely close. Oral, sex, kinks was just the fun part. 

But when we became roommates it felt like it was more serious. She wanted to go on dates, shopping, movies, we would happily kiss each other, share I love you‘s... now she tells me. ""Cee Cee, I’m inviting this guy to come over Saturday, let’s have a threesome!"" And I’m just so confused and upset in a way... I mean she told me when we moved in together, let’s focus on us more. Just her and me... I have talked to her about this but she says it’s already set up and she wants me to join. I really don’t want to be in the house while she’s fucking someone. I have thought about it but I just feel so distraught over it. She tells me I have a bigger rod than him but that’s majority of the reason why guys don’t want to be intimate with me... Then she tells me, she set it up for me just as much as her... omg.

What should I do? I really can’t decide on my own and I really feel awkward now because she practically admitted she still fucks other people. Again, not cheating but damn. I really hate how I feel atm, please send advice my way.  ",31May2018,0

We didn't have sex, but long story short she is worried that my semen could have managed to drip down her body, into her vagina and get her pregnant. She washed it off her chest in the shower. 

I wasn't even worried about that being a possibility until she brought it up and now I'm stuck with a *what if* running through my head.

As far as I know, my semen can't defy gravity, and if any did drip down that far it would have continued to go down past her vagina. She read online (of course) that ""sperm are strong swimmers and could have swam up the shower water."" I don't actually know enough about it to know if she is right or not, but I don't think that sperm are sentient enough to know to only start 'swimming up' when they are near a vagina. If her whole body was wet and they could actually swim up they would have started swimming up the second it hit her chest. 

I know I'm probably overreacting and making an absolute fool of myself but I'm just checking. I don't want to be worried for the next 18 days about if I'm going to have to drop out of school to be a dad or not and need some advice.

299,"Story time/context: my little brother is 16 years old, about to finish his sophomore year of high school. He’s always been socially awkward, doesn’t have many friends, doesn’t really talk to me and my family in depth about what’s bothering him, his temperament is he’s usually pissed off or in a bad mood about smth small and refuses to talk about it, bottling it up, he doesn’t try at all in school, he has a low self esteem, he thinks he’s stupid, and really all he does with his free time is play video games or watch Netflix. Anyways, today he had his drivers test. My parents couldn’t drive him bcuz they both work, so I did. He doesn’t pass so on the way back I’m reminding him I didn’t pass on my first try, asking him what the guy said he did wrong and telling him how to correct these mistakes for next time, letting him know he can be pissed for a few hours like I was when I failed but don’t let this ruin your day, etc. all my being supportive was to no avail cuz I could tell he was still in a really bad mood. Anyways, we get home and I let him know mom said I gotta drop him off at school after his test so he should gather his things while I brush my teeth. He goes into his room, I finish brushing, tell him it’s time to go. No reply. Knock on the door, no reply. So I walk in and he’s laying under his blanket crying. I ask him if it’s failing his test that’s bothering him, he shakes his head no, after another 30 seconds of me trying to get him to talk, he gets up and goes to the bathroom. I follow him and for the next 30 min he is hyperventilating/crying/calming down, blowing his nose, and I’m sitting in the room closest to him saying things like, “I’m your brother, I love you, I’m not going to judge you, just tell me what’s wrong and I can help you with it. But for that to happen you have to talk to me.” (Remember above I mentioned he doesn’t like talking about stuff that bothers him). So after a half hour I say, “hey, if you don’t wanna talk to me this one time I get it. If you want, I’ll get you your phone and you can text me what’s wrong.”, he agrees to this, and sends me this text, “U wouldn’t understand I don’t feel good at all anymore, only bad thing happen all the time never feel happy ever lose appetite almost few times week . Feel sick to stomach always. I don’t know if i wamt to live anymore idk..” following this I tell him supportive things like, I know you’re not in the best place right now, I can and will help you get your life back on track etc etc. and then he texted, I don’t know what I want anymore. Following he texted, “I think I just want to sleep right now”, and I said ok you sleep I’ll go buy you food. 

Sorry that was so long. Anyways, I meant what I said. I am going to try and help him get his life back on track. I know I can help him lead a healthier lifestyle. He goes to the gym somewhat often, I’ll make sure exercises everyday, I can help his diet and force him to eat right. I’m sure both of those things will help. I’ll have talks with him about how high school is a small part of life, and not having a ton of friends isn’t as big as it seems, etc. The biggest thing I think I need help on is how to improve his mental state and health.. bcuz right now he’s in a horrible place, as you can tell by the alarming text from above. Also, getting him to talk about things he doesn’t wanna talk about. He’s very adamant about being quiet when he wants to be.

I always act enthusiastic but she can always tell I don't love it.)

I was really hoping she would go to the jewelry store where one of my best friends works, or we could have even gone together, but now that I know she's bought something it's too late. Unless for some reason she changes her mind and returns it. I don't know what to do. ",31May2018,18

310,"Firstly, I hope anyone with a gambling addiction doesn’t take this advice. My story is very specific and I don’t have any gambling problems. Please find help if you do. 

TL;DR won a bunch of money on an online casino, already got most of it cash, I don’t deposit my own money, looking to have fun with the little bit of money I have left in the app and try to expand it. 

One of the major casinos in my area has an app to play online. I got very very lucky and, after depositing $20 of my own money to play for fun and being down to $6, they gave me $200 in bonus cash. So I decided to focus and try to make something out of it. 

I played one of the slot games, Euro Roulette, and Blackjack. I ended up going up to $400, so I withdrew $200. This happened a few more times and before I knew it, I withdrew $750 in winnings from the app into my bank account. Obviously most of this was luck. 

So after investing $20, I am now up $730, and I still have about $20 remaining in the app. Does anyone have a certain casino game/strategy that works well? I’ve been using the James Bond strategy in roulette, which isn’t too bad. 

Any ideas would be awesome! ",31May2018,0

The fact that it was forbidden to draw him made me want to draw him more \(this made it seem like a cult to me\) and I didn't like the fact he murdered people.

One grows and develops and I have taken a different approach to religion. My new belief is so long as people are not harming others, whatever they have to do to get by is ok. I am still atheist but not anti\-theist. I am now taking part with a shared tackling homelessness approach with multi\-faith groups, some of whom are Muslim.

314,"Hello. I posted my life story on here a couple days ago. I do not know if my anger is based on past stuff I am bringing up, it seems like pretty average day to day stuff, or I am just being foolish. But today my disability check did not come in. This made me worried, as I was layed off from my part tome job early this month, and got myself into a bit of a hole for this coming month. There is $530 after rent and I owe out $350. The person at disability in charge of my file said it would be in today, and well I know it will very likely be in tomorrow I am worried, as a whole weekend with nothing and people asking about debts is hard.

There is a some meat in the house, but nothing to cook it with. So I phoned my social worker, who is in charge of my housing, to tell him the rent would not be in for however long, He is a great guy, we have a good relationship, he has told me how we are friends, and he has done an enormous amount to help me these past ten months. I would never actually say any of this to him. He had been here the other day when the person at disability said it would be in today on the phone.

He tells me to phone the person at disability and that it will likely be fine. I said I was just a bit worried, and he said he did not have a magic wand. He then asks me if I am going to be OK if it does go through the weekend, and I tell him the truth, which is not really. He offers me a $20 food voucher, the fourth one I have received in the ten months we have been working together, and I say that would help. He then tells me that they cannot give me more vouchers in the future. It just pissed me off. Its like, I never fucking asked you. Not before, and not now. You asked me if I was going to be OK if it went through the weekend, and I said not really. Because not really.

I would have survived, I always have before, I have gone three and four days without eating a single thing on dozens of occasions in the last fifteen years, and I will be fine. The guy is wonderful, and has helped me a great deal. But it felt like an intentional attempt to act like I am a burdensome charity case. I just don't know. I have made a lot of progress in therapy, and he has helped me. He says that he is very happy with the progress I have made. But he seems very unhappy about the fact I have not met certain goals he had, despite those I have met, with only two months left to go in our work together. I will meet them, the timing still works, but I do not like how pushy he is becoming, and I do not like being treated like burdensome trash. At least it is how I see it right now.

The time after he proceeded to lift me (I asked him not too) and dumped me on the grass where he lay beside me. Little things like that kept happening, I was worried he may be interested, so I shared about how I really don’t want a relationship and like being able to focus on my work in a generalised way. Now though things are a little bit worse. Last time he shoved me against a wall and proceeded to feel my boobs, I shoved him off and said please don’t. Everything was alright after that until just before I went home he done the same thing again but wouldn’t move until I had really struggled this time. 

I was really kind of shocked, so I just kind of left. I find him really uncomfortable to be around, but I literally know no one here and don’t know any of my surroundings. My parents only allow me out if I go with a friend, I don’t want to be around him anymore, but I don’t want to spend every waking moment in the house.

My father attempted suicide last year on Halloween; cocaine was found in his system. He swallowed multiple medications, ended up stabbing himself in the head with a razor blade before taping a gun to his hand and firing his gun twice. The gun malfunctioned last second and SWAT was able to secure him as he passed out and slipped into a coma.

I recently discovered that the person that he's been getting his drugs from lives right in his neighborhood due to increased rumors of people overdosing (which is extremely unusual since it's an extremely good area). It all adds up as this guy moved in the last few months. I found out from a neighbor that he lives right down the street and I feel like an idiot.  

Do I leave an anonymous tip to police? How can I make sure my dad stays safe? My dad has severe substance abuse issues and has threatened to kill my family while high on cocaine. 

I'm terrified that if I report this guy, it's somehow going to end up coming back to me. The community I live in is extremely small, the police know my father and I'm terrified that they're going to find out my dad with cocaine in his possession.

326,"I'm dealing with a pretty hard and shitty post-friendship breakup phase. I'm dealing with depression and was very actively suicidal about 3 months ago and had a plan and a means to do it. I talked to my best friend (let's call her Lily) about it through Facebook messenger and she freaked out and had a panic attack because she didn't want to lose me. I didn't know that she would feel that way because I never thought that someone could care enough about me like that for them to have such a strong physical and emotional reaction. So Lily called my other 'close' friend, Mary, late at night and told her about how suicidal I am and that I am in need of support. I basically heard all of this back from Lily two weeks after, but she basically said that Mary didn't really show any empathy and as if she couldn't care less, and that she said some words of sympathy and that's it. Lily and Mary hung out the day after that call, and Mary basically talked shit about it, and talked about how she thought I didn't value the friendship because I isolate and distance myself sometimes, esp. when my depression flares up. Mary doesn't understand that that is a symptom of my depression and mental health struggles, rather than me trying to be an ass and ignore people. She's had a lot of ableist views and talks about people with mental health struggles in a very disgusting way. Throughout the course of this year, I've been working on my trust issues a lot and unfortunately Mary is one of those people who I opened up to, not knowing that she would be such a toxic and manipulative person, who also lies a lot, but is such a people pleaser that it's hard for anyone to call her out on her bullshit. 

I've basically confronted Mary about this, and she basically downplayed my hurt and emotions and told me she was just kidding, when in fact, I know she was trying to be malicious and distance my other friends away from me by talking shit about me. I know it's better for me to cut her toxicity out, but it's pretty hard to because we're in the same social circle. I think I just feel really hurt still, even though it's been almost three months since the friendship fall out, and I still can't really deal with the fact that she's such a toxic person to me, but to everyone else she has on this facade that she's a great person and is everyone's best friend. She is a fun person to be around, but when it comes time to being a dependable and trustworthy person, she's not there for people. I just kind of hate how everyone thinks she's so nice, and they don't see how manipulative she can be.

339,"Hello!

I'm halfway into my junior year of university and I will be graduating with a dual-degree in Biology and Computer Science. I'll also have a minor in Creative Writing.

This is probably the time where I have to start prepping for my GREs, deciding on what grad schools to go, etc. However, I don't know if I want to go to grad school. I don't even know what grad school programs I would want to get into.

For a while, I did think about neuroscience because I find that incredibly interesting. Alternatively, something with diseases and illnesses also piques my interest. But, the idea of spending another 4-7 years of school to get a PhD to qualify for a Post Doc to hopefully find a job as a Professor sounds grueling. But, the idea of running my own lab and doing my own research and teaching a shitload of students sounds amazing.

I currently work in a bioinformatics lab in my university since that combines biology and computer science, but I do not want to continue with this in grad school. I don't think I can go my whole life just looking at datasets and analysing them. I'm thinking of joining an ecology lab alongside this simply because my ecology classes were some of the more interesting biology classes I've taken and I'll be doing an animal communications course in the autumn. 

If I drop the idea of grad school entirely, there's the industry. But, I face a similar dilemma: I don't know what sort of jobs I should go for? The idea of a 9-5, stuck to a desk, every weekday for the rest of my life is awful, to me.

Ideally, I would like a job/career where I can be active and not stuck on a chair all day. I want to move around and do something with my hands. I want to be able to think and be creative and come up with weird solutions that are too crazy to work but will work. I don't even know what sort of jobs in biology/computer science would even offer that sort of work environment. I've gone to a few career fairs but I haven't really found something that made me want it. I don't know what else to look for in careers.

I've spoken to advisors and mentors at my university regarding this, but I only came out more confused and it felt like they were pushing me in a direction that didn't seem right to me. That said, I'll also be scheduling appointments with my university's career centre once school's back in session, but I'd love to get some advice on the sort of questions I should be asking myself to come to a conclusion.

It's a long post, but I'd appreciate any direction that you can give me.

Thanks~

342,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this but you guys seem to give good advice. 

I'm 26 years old, i'm currently studying VFX \( I used to work in the industry as an FX Artist but left for personal reasons\) &amp; when i'm finished my class in a couple weeks i'm pretty sure i'll get a job right away. The starting salary for what i'm doing is about $36k/year. 

I dropped out of school when I was younger because of really bad anxiety/being immature. I got accepted into uni in Art History for September &amp; I was planning on taking it, getting my grades up and then switching into something related to programming. My end goal for that was to one day be able to implement technology into biological structures like the human body or plants, that's the kind of stuff that would push me to go back to school anyways. My end goal for VFX would be to one day direct my own movies, I know it's a long shot but I would have the contacts and the VFX to fall back on if anything. 

My question is, I don't know if i should just stick to the VFX and work back into the industry and work my way up  or go back to school. The problem with VFX is that if one day I don't like it/want to switch industries I wont really be able to since I don't have any academic background but I also don't want to waste another 4\+ years of my life when I could be making $50k/year \+ after those 4 years... 

I like VFX but i originally got into it because I love film making, I don't LOVE it.

I would have to take out a student loan because my family isn't doing too well financially but school is really cheap here in Canada. I just want to get my life together but not sure which direction to go into.

I don't have a lot of savings due to past stupid mistakes &amp; I am currently working in a restaurant to pay the bills.  ",31May2018,1
343,"Hi Everyone,

Firstly, in case you noticed that this account is completely new, it's because my first one is linked to my school email and has my name, and I made a second account for this post just in case my school found it or my name was connected or something.

One of my friends came over to my table, where 3 of my really good friends and I are sitting, and spoke to us. I noticed that he had these cuts on his arm that were larger than a scrape like a knife did it. At least a dozen of them. I asked him about it jokingly, but he got really defensive and said: ""I don't need help"". We were all a little surprised, so we called him over. We are all decent friends of him, and we've known him for about 3 years, so we asked if they were real or not. I asked if he was OK if he had run into a bush or something. They were in an octagonal pattern on his wrist with random lines here and there, so we weren't positive that he was ""cutting"". Usually, he would laugh and say it was something else, but this time he kept saying ""I'm good"" over and over, and when I asked why he got them he said, ""I was just bored"". We said that we care for him and he can always talk to us, and he said, ""I have a girlfriend"", I think because he was trying to assure us he had someone to talk to. We think we know who his girlfriend is, but we're not positive. We think it's a shy girl at our school. He wouldn't be the guy to date someone outside the school, and he's definitely not on drugs or even drinking.
It seemed super out of the ordinary and fake, so we're all a little worried. He doesn't seem like the person to cut themselves, but who does? 
I knew a kid at camp who cut, and he was obviously unhappy. My friend seems fine but in this last conversation he looked stressed and it was suspicious how much he insisted he was fine.

What should we do?",31May2018,1
344,"Hi all,
I had my nails done today at the salon. The nail artist who did them used 3 thick coats of polish and then a thick coat of top coat. I feel that they weren’t under the dryer for nearly long enough. He rushed me off the dryer as there was another customer that needed theirs to dry. 6 hours later and the polish still hasn’t set, it is still smudging all over my new nails. Am I within my rights to go there and ask them to redo it?",31May2018,1
345,"Hello! So.. the title is pretty self-explanatory. I turned 18 last month (which makes me a legal adult in Quebec) and I really, REALLY want to finally live on my own. Problem is that I have absolutely no idea which steps to take in which order. Also, I'm really scared that I'll have a hard time getting a job quickly since I have no work experience yet, and I don't even know if I should get a job or an apartment first. The city I want to move to is about an hour drive away from where I live now, so that's scary. Just for context, I'm not a student, and I'm not in the right mental state to be so that's out of the question.

346,"Hey guys.
I'm an almost-26-year-old, trying to find a career in entertainment, writing, or editing. I graduated from a good college with an interdisciplinary degree in history, theatre, and communication. I'm a great live performer, and I have a fiery and pretty girlfriend. I'm on vacation in a beautiful place with her.. but all is not right. She just yelled at me and said that I'm ""just sad,"" and ""not an artist,"" and that I'm ""wasting away.""

I'm just having a hard time. I struggle with low-grade but constant depression, and I've experienced my passions slowly slipping away over the past couple of years. I love my girlfriend, but she rarely makes me feel positively energized. Then again, I rarely experience that in life at all, typically. I do enjoy lots of things though, like playing video games, sports, reading, writing, singing, acting.. it was my dream to act in movies, growing up. I'm really good! I have a good look and skills. But it's just so hard to break into the industry. So many people fail. Makes me feel like I'm in a coffin in the grave, just thinking about it.

I'm also really passionate about God, but I don't think he talks to me very much, so I am trying to just kind of.. not forget about him, but not ""rely"" too much on an interaction I have literally no control over. At least when it comes to practical decision making, if that makes sense.

Anyway, my girlfriend runs her own entertainment company. She gets lots of gigs for performers and often tries to cast me, but I never want in.. I already work as a full-time live performer, and to do her gigs I would have to take off work. (admittedly, her gigs pay better for the time than my other jobs which I do, and I don't even like my other jobs that much). She feels disrespected and then either she makes me feel like shit, or I feel like shit for being uninterested in this aspect of the performing arts.

I just don't know what happened to my passions.. I'm trying to land a job with a big company somewhere, but it's not easy. I'm looking into video game companies, cruise ships, administration, the Air Force.. I want to save up all my money and retire in 5-8 years (or maybe a little longer) with around 200-400k saved up, for around 1-2k/month in residual income.

Maybe I'm wrong for prioritizing that. Maybe I'm just a lazy fuck and I need to shape up.. but I don't feel any fire or passion inside me. I just feel tired.. tired of this world, tired of its woes and its problems, tired of taking them on as my own. And when she pushes me to express my passions (or what used to be my passions) of songwriting, performing, etc.. ..there's just nothing there.

Thank you for letting me vent a little. Any advice is appreciated.",31May2018,0
347,"Around last Christmas I [19,M] consumed LSD for the first time in my life. Was a nice experience, but I never did it again. 

My girlfriend's (we've been together almost a year and a half) dad recently has been very ill and he was looking for blood donors. Today we went to the hospital, and I couldn't be a donor because I needed to wait at least 8 months since the last time I consumed LSD.

When I told her [22F], I thought it would not be a big deal. But she got mad at me because I didn't told her. She said that I don't trust her.

The thing is, around Christmas we weren't so good and on that time I thought it would be a bad idea to share my experience with her. I live away and moved temporally to see my parents for holidays, so we weren't seeing each other neither. She is not against drugs (we even smoked pot together a few times), but the timing wasn't good so I didn't told her.

We always tried to be communicative and honest with each other, and it helped us go through a lot of stuff going on on our lives.

The thing is, what happened that time wasn't a big deal for me, so days passed and I just forget to told her about it (I forget things very often). But now she feels that our mutual trust is broken. I never thought this would be so important for her and I really feel very guilty about what happened, I would've told her straight away if I knew. I apologized after she told me she felt betrayed, but she said it doesn't matter, now she feels that I could be keeping more secrets from her.

How should I proper apologize to her? I don't wan't to justify my actions, I just want her to know that she always had my trust and that I don't keep any other secrets (which is true). I want her to know that I'm truly sorry and I've never ceased to trust her.

Ps. I know that drugs can be dangereous. I'm fully aware of how dangereous is, and also that I haven't got any addiction, it's just something we do sometimes, and try to not abuse. 

Ps2. English it's not my native language, I'm sorry for any mistake.",31May2018,1

355,"Sorry if this isn't the right place to post but I need to say this somewhere. Right now I'm struggling to find meaning in my life. I recently broke up with my girlfriend of 2 years, the closest friend I've ever had in my life. I'm a very shy and introverted person, so I tend to rely on close friendships with a very small number of people for my socializing. Because her and I were so close I barely socialized with anyone else besides her. She was really my only close friend. Now that we're broken up I'm left here completely alone with nothing to do other than contemplate on how pointless my existence is. It's not like I haven't achieved a lot, it's just that I've never really had anyone to share my accomplishments with besides that 2 year window. I'm nearly 23 now, and I've never met anyone that I've got along with in the same way as her. I highly doubt that I will ever meet anyone that will compare to the friendship that her and I had, and I just feel like that will ruin every single one of my future relationships. I don't see a reason to keep living my life and chasing after my goals if there's nobody to support me or even really see my accomplishments. Everything seems pointless. I don't feel like doing any of my old hobbies anymore such as music, and I don't even feel like watching movies or playing games. Everything just lacks its appeal. I'm incredibly lonely and I have no close friends to talk to about how I feel or what happened. I've struggled with mental health issues for the majority of my life (depression, attention issues, anxiety), I think it's genetic and runs on my fathers side. I just don't see a point to keep living if it's only going to be pain with no foreseeable end. I don't know what to do with myself or how to ease this pain.",31May2018,2

He freaked out but not fast enough. Unshared his screen and I apologized. She was doing homework and had no reaction so we assumed she didn't see.

He said it was Ok, but if she says anything about it to me, I need to tell him.

Got a text from her that she saw. Since the message to him was vague, I told her that he had been depressed lately (which is true) and he needs caring friends right now. She didn't question it but I'm worried she knows.

Without her I don’t have the energy or skill to even do anything anymore. I keep fucking up and making mistakes. I used to be the guy that always got it right and was hot shit, but now I’m useless and I can’t snap out of it.

She said she just wants to be friends but I genuinely would die if she ever got with anyone else. She was my first, I was hers, we’d already planned our wedding and kids names and everything. My entire life, my future, our future is gone and I can’t take another day.

We’re on talking terms and she tells me she still loves me and she wishes she didn’t but she just can’t be with me. I can’t keep hurting myself or her. 

I made a promise that I wouldn’t hurt myself or do anything stupid, but to me this doesn’t seem stupid it seems so right because the thought of ending it all is the only thing that doesn’t hurt. It feels right. 

I know she’d hate me forever if I did it but if I can’t her anyway then she might as well hate me. I was never the emotional type or the soppy type but I grew up and went through the most important years of my life with her and I was so ready to spend our lives together and die a happy old couple.

She’ll hate me for doing it, but at least i won’t be around to deal with the pain of seeing the person I put my entire heart and soul into just for them to go and give it all to someone else.

I don’t want to break the promise because it means so much to me, but I really think i Should I just do it.

We made sure that they know people there and will be sitting with their friends, so we didn't think it would be a big deal. I had a friend message me saying that she would feel weird going alone and not having her boyfriend with her at the wedding (they've been dating for 3-4months and I haven't met him yet). I told her that if she wanted he could go to the ceremony with her and come for dancing, but due to cost and space of seating he wouldn't be able to come to the dinner portion (and if I let him come then I would have to let others' SOs of 3-4months come too whicu would be a greater cost too, but I didn't say that).

Anyway, she seems quite upset which makes me a bit upset. It would hurt me a lot if she chose not to come to my wedding because she'd feel weird/her new boyfriend can't come. We've been friends for a long time, and so... I guess I just don't know if I'm in the wrong or how I should feel about this situation, should I feel so hurt?

363,"Last Saturday at work (I work as a service clerk at a grocery store until graduation) while bringing in carts a guy was outside taking donations  for a trip to Africa him and his volunteer team will be going on.

I thought it was pretty cool what they're doing for people over there. Anyways, he's been in my city for just four months after just moving here to join a local volunteer center. He asked me what we do for fun around here, we exchanged first names, talked about his experiences he's had asking for donations, and a little about his hometown. He talked differently around me than customers since I was his age, and we both complained to eachother about what we we're doing. Troughout the day we joked around and talked off and on when I was outside working. I donated a few dollars to his cause. He was really chill and clearly appreciative. He also clearly likes helping people, is in a band,.and has good vibes. My type of person. 


Since I've thought about him a lot. He was a really cool guy. Definitely at least friend material. I found him on Instagram with the minimal information I had but I've been debating on following him. I don't want to come off weird. He'll know I looked him up. He doesn't know anyone from my town so we have no mutual followers or anything. I'd like to potentially to get to know him.

I've known this person for just over year through another friend. Throughout the time I've known that there was always something a bit off about her.

Over time she'd hinted at and told me little things about her past, her childhood and such. I'd learned about past boyfriends that have cheated on her / hit her, friends that have betrayed / abandoned her, emotional abuse from her dad, and then some.

I've never been a person that's very emotionally attached to things or people, but for some reason I really want to help her, but I don't know how. Having a friend who's been through these kinds of things is so new to me and I don't know how to react.

The other day, she opened up to me more. She showed me some songs she listens to the relate to the struggles she's been through and went more in depth to them for me. And afterwards I just didn't know what to say. I asked for her own thoughts on these things since I just couldn't think of anything I could say to help or comfort her.

After doing whatever minimal things I could to try and help, I brought up the subject of therapy and brought up a website on my phone. When I did, I could instantly tell she wasn't happy about that, then she just picked up her things and left. 
I've had one message from her since saying that she 'won't do anything stupid'.

368,"I have a 2006 Chevrolet Cobalt that I bought from my stepdad's best friend last summer. I initially paid 700$ for the car. It has a new engine but 200k miles on it. When I started driving the car and it ran fine at first, that's when I started noticing a few issues.

So the car likes to stall out very often, i'll be driving, and then the car will just stop accelerating and slow to a stop. I'd then have to shut the car off and turn it back on, this happens almost every time I'd drive the car. the passenger window now doesn't work, the wheels are in bad shape, and the drivers side lock button doesn't work, and my emergency brake doesn't work. I put this car in the shop twice, the Man I bought it from has an uncle who is a mechanic, I put my car in his shop and he fixed the tires up for me (they would leak horribly and i'd have to fill 3 tires up with air weekly)

I told him the issues with my car and he ""fixed"" them. Sure the tires are good, except the front left one which is slowly flattening now. The car still stalls out even though he said he fixed it. I took the car to the shop twice, the first time, he changed out the Transmission Control Module and fixed the tires. The second time was him trying to find out why it stalled out, he said the fuel pump was messed up and might be covered under Chevy's warranty. however he didn't fix it, instead said it was bad ground and fixed that. I had this car in the shop for a month and seeming nothing was fixed but the tires for $325.

I've been trying to call this mechanic, but he never answers, never calls back. I feel like this car is a burden, my stepfather is saying that I should fix up the car and sell it. However I am on the fence about that, I don't think it would be worth fixing the problems, then selling it to maybe profit off of it, I kinda want to just get rid of it.

I have an account with the credit union, and I can get a car loan. Should I fix up my car and sell it? or should I trade it in, at this point I feel like i'm paying monthly car insurance for a burden. The car is not inspected, with a rejection sticker too. so I risk getting pulled over and fined. I am 20 years old, this is my first car, and I need some opinions to help me choose what I want to do.

TL;DR Car has lots of issues, should I fix and keep it? Fix or sell it? or trade in and get a car loan for something better.

We made sure that they know people there and will be sitting with their friends, so we didn't think it would be a big deal. I had a friend message me saying that she would feel weird going alone and not having her boyfriend with her at the wedding (they've been dating for 3-4months and I haven't met him yet). I told her that if she wanted he could go to the ceremony with her and come for dancing, but due to cost and space of seating he wouldn't be able to come to the dinner portion (and if I let him come then I would have to let others' SOs of 3-4months come too which would be a greater cost too, but I didn't say that).

Anyway, she seems quite upset which makes me a bit upset. It would hurt me a lot if she chose not to come to my wedding because she'd feel weird/her new boyfriend can't come. We've been friends for a long time, and so... I guess I just don't know if I'm in the wrong or how I should feel about this situation, should I feel so hurt? 

TLDR: My friend is upset I didn't give her a plus one to my wedding, which is causing her to question coming to my wedding at all. She has a new boyfriend of 3-4months and I haven't met him yet. I'm hurt. Am I in the wrong to feel this way? ",31May2018,1
370,"I gave recently gave birth within the last month to a baby boy, we will call G.  Ever since bringing him home and for some of our stay at the hospital, I haven’t felt attached to him.  When he was born he swallowed some of his first stool (I don’t know the actual term for it) and required observation.  He also was required to be kept in a warmer and on oxygen for the majority of our stay so i had little to no interaction with him.  I was unable to go into the nursery to check on him, the nurses would simply say he was okay and tell me to return to my room.  

When I saw him through the nursery windows, it pained me to see him in an incubator and with tubes sticking out of him.  After the first few times of being turned away from actually seeing him when he happened to be out of the incubator, I didn’t want to see him.  I didn’t want to see him through the windows or at all.  It’s gotten better since we got to come home though.  

I still don’t have that overwhelming love and desire to basically helicopter over him at all hours that seems the norm.

I’m not saying that I don’t run to him when he cries, but I give G a chance to self-soothe as encouraged by his doctor.  I check on him multiple times during the night to make sure he is still breathing and doesn’t require oxygen.  I ordered a tank at home at the insistence of his doctor as a precaution in case he begins to have issues again.

I try to make sure that he doesn’t sit in a dirty diaper for long, to the extent that I will wake him up when he is sleeping to check.

But it’s been brought up multiple times by my family that I will probably be a mom just like mine was.  I admit that I’m not attached to him but it doesn’t automatically mean that I’m going to be neglectful or abusive to him.  

It’s been brought up that since I don’t like holding my son, that I must not want to be around him at all and it’s the first sign that I will be neglectful.  

I’ve been trying to bond with him.  I’ve been babbling to him even though I find it awkward since he can’t say anything back.  I don’t let anyone else except his father watch him since my family is heavy smokers and I don’t trust them to not smoke around him.  They all smoke in their houses and get petty when they come to visit and I make them smoke outside and wash their hands before they touch him.

I just don’t know how to make my family see that I am trying to bond with my son but their remarks are making it harder to do so.",31May2018,6

372,"Hey Reddit.

I started working for a Union Costco 3 weeks ago. Today is my brother's graduation and I called off to go visit him. For the past 3 weeks, I have been early every day, I make sure to perform above and beyond my capabilities and work hard. And I have never been told my performance has been bad. 

However, when I did call off, the lady on the phone seemed VERY unenthusiastic and even asked if I was a new hire and advised against it. 

Two of the other people I was hired with got days off already though but it was not as short notice. The only reason this graduation was short notice is because another family member ended up not going so I was able to.

Was this a bad move? Its too late to go in and reverse my decision but I have this feeling this I will be fired. In my other jobs I very very rarely call off and always offer to help others and come in for extra hours.

Should I be worried or am I safe? I am also on my probationary period with them.

There are shells everywhere and they are called people. I know only one person, ONLY ONE person that I can talk to. I doubt I have a problem as I can learn in one day what someone learns a month. I can read 40 books in one week and learn everything in there while someone can't learn 2 or 3 books in a month.

Other than that, she puts tasks off and leaves piles of mail and such. She also does not eat as well as she should with her disease. She also will not listen to me, and hides her symptoms from the family.

In 6 months she has two episodes where I have had to rush her to the hospital from an episode. She has said she didnt ask for help and say she was fine because she did not want to bother anyone. This most recent time it was traumatizing to find her in the state she was in. I struggle with PTSD, Clinical Depression and BPD myself and just lost my mother in December. I am still young and have been through so much already.

389,"I am about to finish my junior year in high school. I currently have a 2.5 GPA out of a 4.5 and scored an 1169 out of 1600 on the SAT. I am part of my school's two programs for gifted children and one of them netted me a $75,000 scholarship for tuition in an in-state school. My parents, who are living here illegally from the Caribbean hold me to a nearly impossible standard in school and become visibly angry upon looking at me when I don't, which is almost normal. 




I used to play travel soccer since I was 10 but they took me out of it in my sophomore year for having Cs on my report card. I love soccer with all my life and being taken out left a hole in me that I can still feel and sometimes it hurts too much to watch it on TV considering my dream to make it pro is all but over. I play soccer at my school and we started off the season placed 4th in the state but it isn't the same as going out with your best friends on the weekend, winning three points and going out to dinner after, or losing and having to console everyone, or winning a tournament and seeing everyone so happy to be part of the team, or scoring the winner at the last moment and getting mobbed, or pulling off a trick that took hours to perfect. I miss the smell of the grass, how much the game immersed me and made me forget about the problems I was dealing with, the feeling of the ball on my foot, the adrenaline rush I got when I opened up the game, the dejected feeling I get when the team concedes a goal and how it gives way to determination to score one right back. The slightly-achy feeling that my legs got after a match, flying 5 feet after I styled on a defender and he has no choice but to foul me, the anticipation in the air before a corner or free kick or penalty is taken, the happiness that you feel when your team scores, I miss it all.





My current hobbies are tinkering and playing videogames on my custom-built computer, but I cannot do it a lot because my parents don't approve of it. I may come across $300 in the next few weeks and will use it to buy fishing equipment to add to my list of hobbies.






My dad is a high-ranking member of the church that we go to. He has been there for over 20 years. As his son, I am extremely popular among the old folks and younger folks alike due to me being his son, being extremely bright when I was younger, and opting to play soccer instead of basketball (I'm currently 6'3, and they did not influence the choice in any way, I just enjoy soccer **WAY** more than I enjoy basketball), which is the most popular sport in the country where my parents and the majority of the congregation come from. They constantly ask me how school is, and it's starting to annoy me, like I'm supposed to be the saving grace of this church by getting a degree and a good job to, quotong my dad, ""Give back generously to your roots"". It doesn't help that the church is in quite the pickle financially. The popularity has been pretty useful lately since the love of my life goes to that church and my popularity makes it easier to dance that pre-relationship tango with her, ans she seems to be quite fond of me, always wanting to talk and being very physical, but with most other times thinking about all that pressure makes me queasy inside.






I am scared of the future. A lot of people around me are graduating and then going to the nearby community college, relying on the hope that their GPA is salvageable enough to transfer to another school with in 2 years. The people at my church tell me that they hope I don't go down that path, and honestly I hope I don't, either. As early as I could remember, in my head, only being able to get into a community college was a failure. I want to go to a big university and experience college life. I am scared that the work will be too hard for me and I'll have to drop out and will eventually start my own business, which will fail Tom-Haverford-syle and I'll be crushed in debt. I'm scared that I may get into a big university but nothing will have developed between my crush and I because of my social awkwardness and I'll lose her forever, or shit will hit the fan during a long-distance relationship and I'll lose her forever. I'm scared that not even the local community college will accept me and I'll become one of those stereotypical dudes that smoke 5 packs a day and live in a tiny apartment with 5 kids that won't shut the fuck up and a bitchy wife that also won't shut the fuck up and that isn't my crush, and has to get involved in illegal activities to sustain himself and his family. I'm scared that that last soccer practice before my parents made me quit was the last chance I had to prove to anyone that I could make it pro.


I don't know what to do. I'm so scared.

It was a very sudden process but sometimes life throws you curveballs &amp; we've now been living together for almost 2 years. Anyhoo, we've never had a very close relationship &amp; my younger brother always got almost all of their attention wether it good or bad. Because of this I've never felt like I can talk to them about literally anything and so I keep my thoughts/feelings/wants to myself. When I was at home they  made comments about wanting me out the house at age 18 &amp; not caring about if I had kids because I don't carry the family name. Well when I actually left my mother did not deal with it well. She constantly tells me I need to come home &amp; guilt's me about leaving.  I'm not the kind of person who likes confrontation &amp; I avoid it at all cost. We used to speak regularly but the way she approaches things can be very harsh which in turn has made me want to speak to her less often. I love my family and they've really never done anything wrong to me (as in they have provided for me until the age of 18) so I really feel like I shouldn't complain, but I dont know how I can let her know that I'm just doing my own thing now and that its not a big deal. So in turn I give myself a hard time as if ive done something wrong.

411,"Job situation: Just got hired onto a poultry farm. Processing chickens, duck, quail. It's just what was available and came along first. Regarding the numbers: $7/hr plus a piece rate. But, there's only a certain number of birds we need to get done per day, so getting 200-300 done isn't going to happen, but if a place ordered 30, or 60, those are more realistic numbers. And that piece rate figure is split between 3 of us. I just started. One shift was 6.5 hours, the other was 2 hours, the other was 3 hours. The problem is it's a 45 minute drive away. I put in $35 for gas last Saturday and I'm already a little more than half empty. It might end up so that I'm making $30 after fuel costs. I'm considering dropping it, as much as unemployment sucks. And finding something close to home.

I'm in community college, finishing up a general associates. For summer semester I'm only taking Anatomy &amp; Physiology online, which will fill a gen ed requirement, and is also part of the LPN program I will be doing next year. That will be one less class to worry about while in the program. However, right now I gotta pay $230 for a lab kit, which I was blindsided with. And of course had to buy a textbook for the class. And a tuition payment of $165 is due June 5. (I'm on a payment plan with the school, this 165 will be my 2nd of 3 payments) The school did email me some forms to apply for a student loan, which I will do and see what I can get from that.

My details: I think a little over $600 in the bank. Three credit cards, one with a 1500 limit, 0 balance. Another with a 500 limit, and about 250 balance, and another with 1500 limit, 0 balance.

Living costs are extremely low thankfully. Between the two of us, our monthly bills come out to about $300/mo each at the moment. My partner is willing to pay for whatever school stuff I need, for which I'm forever grateful, but very uncomfortable with and will both be keeping a tab and paying every penny back, and using it as an absolute last resort.

Options, drop the class now, which would prolong the associates graduation, and take the class during the nursing program next year once I'm hopefully in a better financial spot. Or just get the class done with, use some credit card balance, and whatever help my partner offers.

The job: Stay, eat the fuel costs, net about $30-$40 a week, or find something (anything) nearby (we are in a small city of about 60,000, and there are some jobs to be had, but we're not overflowing with them by any means but the last small town we lived in a state over was much, much worse)

412,"Currently 6 months into a year lease. I recently inquired about the communities fees to transfer from a 1BR to a 2BR apartment (my brother is moving in with me) the leasing office stated that it would be half months rent to transfer the lease with a 30 day notice. 

I received a breakdown of the fees in the mail last week and they were referring to the transfer fee as a “cancellation” fee. I called the leasing office to clarify whether or not they were same and asked if I needed to pay was half months rent to transfer or cancel the lease all together and leave the community. The leasing office confirmed that was correct.

415,"Last Saturday at work (I work as a service clerk at a grocery store until graduation) while bringing in carts a guy was outside taking donations for a trip to Africa him and his volunteer team will be going on.

On my lunch break, I went outside and talked to him about it. He's around my age (I'm about to be 18 and he's 19) I asked him about the program he's in &amp; he explained it. I thought it was pretty cool what they're doing for people over there. Anyways, he's been in my city for just four months after just moving here to join a local volunteer center. He asked me what we do for fun around here, we exchanged first names, talked about his experiences he's had asking for donations, and a little about his hometown. He talked differently around me than customers since I was his age, and we both complained to eachother about what we we're doing. Troughout the day we joked around and talked off and on when I was outside working. I donated a few dollars to his cause. He was really chill and clearly appreciative. He also clearly likes helping people, is in a band,.and has good vibes. My type of person.

Since I've thought about him a lot. He was a really cool guy.  I found him on Instagram with the minimal information I had but I've been debating on following him. I don't want to come off weird. He'll know I looked him up. He doesn't know anyone from my town so we have no mutual followers or anything. I'd like to get to know him. He also has a weird way of spelling a common name so I dont even know how I found him. Lol. I'm not sure if he'll be around my work again or not. He's leaving for Africa in two months for six months &amp; told me that he might move back to Cali afterwards. I live in Michigan so there's a chance I might never see him again! I know I'm overthinking all of this. Just don't wanna ruin any chances by conning off a weirdo, ya feel? Our short interaction probably didn't mean anything to him especially since he probably meets a lot of people through his program. I go back.and fourth between I don't wanna look a stalker &amp; he's leaving anyways for awhile what's the worst that can happen?

419,"I'm sorry for the long post   

All my romantic relationships begin extremely well and passionate. Everything is perfect and I'm starting to really enjoy my partner. But after a while and the initial stage of dating has faded I start getting extremely anxious and depressed. In the beginning I am a little anxious but over time it builds up and I am constantly stressed over little things. I start to put them on a pedestal. I start getting paranoid that the person I am dating is getting bored of me/doesn't like me anymore/ I'm not worthy. I also begin to start believing that they are going to break up with me, and are cheating/planning something malicious \(even though there is no evidence or reason\) and I begin to dislike them greatly. I start to emotionally distance myself subconsciously from them and close myself off, slowly cutting all forms of communication and talking to them less and less. I now hate despise them  and believe 100&amp;#37; they are about to break\-up with me and I do a disappearing act \(even if my partner believed everything was going very well\), cutting all ties with them and removing them from my life completely \(I won't even think about them\). I've broken numerous hearts multiple times, especially my own, for no good reason and I feel awful. I can't stop.

This pattern happens with ALL of my romantic relationships and casual relationships. It's like I'm afraid of intimacy in all forms\(emotional, sexual, etc\). I've never had an actual relationship and this loneliness is killing me. I don't want to die alone.

I started noticing that I feel a compulsion to avoid emotional situations and potential drama \(my friend needs support over something and is crying\) . I noticed that I tend to isolate myself and never reach out to others. I noticed that I physically can't cry in front of other people \(I subconsciously won't let myself\). I noticed that after a breakup I will do everything in my power to avoid that person, avoid thinking of them, avoid places they could potentially be without reason, it's like they completely died to me. I noticed that I self\-sabotage all of my relationships \(even just friendships\) as soon as someone gets emotionally close to me or tries to become intimate/shows affection. I struggle with openness. I feel like I can never trust anyone, even if we are in a relationship. I feel like I'm never honest about myself or ever show people truly  who I am because I am constantly trying to please them or fit into their mold of their ideal partner. I recollected that as a child I would often avoid people who expressed their feelings for me to the extent I couldn't look them in the eyes or be around them because I didn't know how to act and would fill me with constant anxiety. I should also mention that I never go emotionally deep with my partners \(I really want to but I am terrified of doing it, out of fear they wont accept me or dislike my input\) and all of my relationships have been superficial and shallow/not fulfilling.

I went to a psychologist and all he told me was to practice breathing techniques, and try to ground myself whenever I dissociated but neither of those helped. I feel so alone and I really need help. I don't know what to do, I'm willing to try absolutely anything. I've even tried dabbling with some drugs to see if they could remove my anxiety when I'm in a relationship but it only made things worse.

What should I do? If anyone can diagnose me, share related experiences, insight or provide steps/help/advice to cure me they would be immensely appreciated. Thank you all very much.

tldr; I self\-sabotage relationships in the exact same pull\-push pattern and can't stop, I'm hurting people I love. I can't trust people or express myself.",31May2018,2
420,"Hi, 

So to cut a long story short, one of the people in my shared house has been acting increasingly erratic in the past few weeks. I will refer to him as John. John approached me a few days ago seeming very troubled, and asked me if it was normal to ""hear voices"" in ones head. I told him that it was generally not normal, and advised him to go to a doctor, which he did.

Yesterday however, the situation escalated a lot. As I was cooking dinner in the kitchen, John came into the room in a pretty agitated state, and accused me and another housemate of ""putting our voices in his head"". He was visibly upset and a little angry, and I could not calm him down. He went on an extremely long winded and nonsensical rant, basically accusing me and the other dude of conspiring against him and putting our thoughts in his head. He also accused me of using the voices of his dead relatives to manipulate his thoughts. 

I realised he was having a psychotic episode, and he was becoming very angry and warning me that I better stop messing with his mind, etc. I began to feel very threatened and disturbed, so I ended up calling for an ambulance. They showed up with 3 cops and forcibly took John to the hospital, where he was held overnight and released.

He is now back in the house, back to his normal self and has apologised to me. He said he now realises that he is having mental health issues. Obviously I'm pretty worried that this could happen again, or that he could get violent. However I can't really afford to move out of this house without taking out a loan, which I REALLY don't want to do. 

I'm wondering if theres anyone here with experience of mental health issues, and if they can tell me if this is a dangerous situation for me? I don't want to demonise the guy, who is obviously having a terrible ordeal right now, but I also need to keep myself safe.",31May2018,2

I myself have not really sent her anything all that intricate besides a couple of animal pictures and a few questions. Sometimes she will send hearts and compliments, the compliments not being very intricate, though.

427,"So my boyfriend was making conversation with a coworker about Childish Gambino and his new song This is America and asked about what he thought. 

His coworker responded with “nah he needs to stay in his lane, he’s a writer and a stand up comedian, he’s not a rapper”. Pretty sure he saw the video but he made that comment. My boyfriend thought it was racially charged (since his coworker is white) but honestly I didn’t see that at all, I just simply saw that this dude just didn’t like him nor the way he sings. My boyfriend clearly stated to me that his coworker mentioned before that Gambino was incredibly corny and just didn’t like any of his songs, and dont like the way he raps, nor bothered to really listen to any of his new hits.

Also, his coworker listens to rap, my boyfriend stated that even when people listen to rap it can still be appropriated. Which is true, but I feel like in this it wasn’t, the dude simply never liked him nor cared to really listen to his songs.

 Anyway I become a nervous wreck about her a lot. If she goes on vacation or out with friends ect then I get a lot of built up panic. Now part of my anxiety is not being in control of things which I think is part of the problem but im not going to be an abusive controlling guy. I never stop her from going out or tell her who to hang out with or do manipulative things to guilt trip her into staying home. 

However it’s difficult to handle for me. I trust her more then anyone and she trusts me. I know she’s not going to cheat or put herself in dangerous situations but it’s all I can think about when she’s gone, sometimes. 

There’s no history of cheating or unfaithfulness between us, were both satisfied in all the major categories with our relationship, we make time for dates and we’re happy.

Today, with half an hour left in my shift, my boss called me into her office. She said I've been slacking off since January (I haven't, and even if I was, why is this the first I'm hearing about it? and why did you hire me after my probation ended in March if I'd been slacking off for 2 months already?), that I'd been repeatedly warned (I hadn't been), and that I'm fired.

All of the coworkers I've talked to said that everything she said was bullshit, none of them have noticed any problems and none of them ever heard about me being given warnings. Apparently my boss did this to another employee before I got hired, and then tried to torpedo her EI.

That other employee got the labour board involved (I'm in Canada btw), and the labour board has a file on the company with all of the complaints about them. For the first few months I worked there, my schedule violated labour laws (I was scheduled to work 8 days in a row every other week. Legally they had to give me 24 hours off, every 7 days, but I didn't say anything because I wanted the money.)

Now for the fun part. My boss is the executive director. Her husband works there, her sister works there, her brother-in-law works there, her niece works there, her son's girlfriend worked there until they broke up and then she left... and her son is graduating high school in a week. Everybody I've talked to thinks that she fired me so she could give my job to her son.

So can anybody give me some advice on what I should do here? Obviously nothing I could do would get me my job back with so many members of her family working there, but they could torpedo my EI like they did to the other person and I need to know how to fight it.

And if they did fire me just to hire their son, I know the laws they were breaking. I will go to war with that fucking company.",31May2018,2

[Stil Looking for the MiraCast HDMI device](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8k01s7/i_think_the_cleaning_crew_might_be_stealing/)

I'm almost at my wits end if I'm not there already. I'm doing everything in my power to figure out if I'm being stolen from or not.

I've only one spy camera that I've deemed worth of using and need to figure out if the second one I bought can be used.

-----------

**Question one**:If I got a fingerprint (haven't yet), will I be able to submit it (without telling whose it is) to see if it has a criminal record? If it got a hit it might help, but I don't know how to begin that process even with my constant googling.

**Question Two**: What are some good ways to bait a trap that isn't obvious for a thief? I've been googling this and been unsuccessful.

--------------------------
I have a certain area where I keep this Hdmi dongle for when I'm ready to use it. It was always there until two weeks ago whenever said cleaning crew came. I made a topic for this provided said Reddit link. Thing is they have had plenty of chances to steal this device, but I believe they finally did because they finally figure out what is was, because unfortunately the box the device came in wasn't hidden well enough and IIRC if you open a drawer one could figure out what the unknown dongle device is by reading some box in came in.

_____________________________________

My roomie doesn't think they stole it and I know they have smartphones. She says something along the line ""They are this old and blah blah this gender blah blah why on earth would they want this or that"" and its frustrating the crap out of me.


All I can think of is ""Don't judge a book by its cover"" and ""Looks can be deceiving"".

Thing is I like the crew and it breaks my heart to even think ""they might of betrayed me""and I'm doing my utmost best to figure out if I'm the idiot.

I think I will be willing to let you guys know if I was wrong once I've put the camera plans in action. I need to do this right with the spy cameras.

My roomie is really great don't get me wrong, but this is driving me mad. I'll take responsibility if I'm the fool. I just don't like the thought of being stolen from.


Anyway I""ll be looking for an answer for a fingerprint, while I get the second camera ready and organize like crazy looking for that **device I payed $40** for.

Thanks.

443,"I signed up for medicaid when I had no real prospects. Barely a month later, I got a new job which pays significantly more than I ever expected to make, but when I applied for medicaid I qualified by being under the income limit. Am I allowed to keep my medicaid? Does it just cancel itself out once I exceed an income limit, or am I going to be charged or fined? If so, should I just cancel it out while I can? ",31May2018,1

I’m just confused as I’ve never had a nosebleed and it just randomly started with no obvious cause.

446,I’m in year 10 and sent in an application for head boy that got accepted. Now I have to get through an interview about why I would be a good candidate for the role. 5 minutes is a long time and I’m not sure what to say without sending too generic and the same as what everyone else in the interview is saying. duff like I’m a good leader or a hard worker. I’m not sure what they’re interested in hearing about or what will get me head boy.,31May2018,1
