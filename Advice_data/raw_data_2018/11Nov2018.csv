0,"I am sorry if this makes me sound like a heartless monster, but i am at the point of breaking.

Me and my fiancee took in my severely autistic brother \[23M\] almost a year ago, after our dad suddenly passed away. Nobody else in the family wanted anything to do with him. My brother struggles with almost everything, he struggles to communicate, and he has the mentality of someone a fraction of his age, and is basically incapable of taking care of himself. 

So we decided to take him in until we could find a proper home for him. We thought this would be easy, but it was absolutely further from the truth. We are on waiting list after waiting list, and there is frankly very little help we actually get because he isn't a minor. Thankfully my fiancee has an amazing job, and basically allowed me to quit my job and focus on taking care of my brother 24/7.

My dad shielded me so heavily from my brother and his outbursts, that i truly had no idea how difficult this would actually be. Another huge mistake i realized is that moving him to where me and my fiancee live was a terrible mistake, we basically destroyed the entire support network of therapists, doctors, help groups, etc that dad had cultivated over the last 20 years almost instantly.

Dad used to take him to specialized hockey, swimming, and countless other activities. I have tried to replace almost every single one of those activities but to him they aren't the same, and he basically refuses to do them. He has somewhat adjusted to his new schedule, but he hates my fiancee, and he doesn't really understand the fact that i am well gay.

The biggest issue right now, is that almost a year later he still doesn't understand that dad is dead. When i went down to sort out dads affairs, and try to figure out how to .help my brother. He begged me not to leave him until dad got back. Even now he still keeps talking about how he can't wait to go back home, during his outbursts he often screams about how he wants to go home. The scariest thing is there have been times where he seems to grasp the idea, but then it seems to trigger an outburst, and he seems to forget everything we talked about.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I am on a wait list for every therapist who works with people with autism within 2+ hours drive. I even managed to get his old therapist to try to do a few sessions via skype, he understood who she was, but that just seems to trigger him, as apparently he can only see her with dad.

I have been trying my best, but i feel i am way over my head with a lot of this. This isn't the life he deserves, and it is killing me.

TLDR; Took in my severely autistic brother, and he doesn't understand; dad is dead; dad isn't coming back; life isn't going to go back to the same thing as before.",11Nov2018,1

2,"Okay, first of all, sorry for my bad english, it's not my first language, I hope you can still understand everything.
So first of all, I'm pretty naive. People can manipulate me very easily and I trust people too fast.
Well, a few hours ago, I was chatting with some guy on the Internet. I told him about my problems in real life (my social anxiety etc.).
He was very nice and talked to me about that, but he seemed kinda strange. Anyways, after a while people told me that I shouldn't trust him too much, because he loves manipulating people and that he's actually a hacker etc. (it was an online game).
I told him that I need to go offline now, and he said that he wants to stay in contact with me and gave me his number. 
I told him that I don't really want to give him my number and stay in touch with him. He was then pretty mad and threatened me to hack me and find out my location through my IP-Adress. (Apparently he has a master degree in computer science). Anyways, I logged off and haven't heard from him since, but I'm pretty anxious now. I feel really stupid now. 
I wanted to ask you guys, if any of that stuff he said, could be true? Like could he really find out my Personal information or anything like that? He only knows my first name and age.
Thanks for reading my Text.",11Nov2018,1

Good thing is Im probably going to be leaving the city at the end of this academic school year. Bad thing is shes about a 17 while Im a 2(not even exaggerating). I dont need help with telling her or anything like that, just dealing with this till I leave. Any suggestions would be appreciated.",11Nov2018,1
4,"I'll try to make this brief. Basically me and a best friend of three years, like most important person in my life, had a falling out. We had one big issue that we both were kind of shitty in and I thought we had finally gotten over it and were ready to move forward. After that they just kept doing shitty things and I kept giving them chances. In the end after maybe two chances they told me they needed space to figure things out and after waiting a month or so I wrote them a letter saying I moved on because I was miserable waiting and figured they ghosted me. They responded with their own letter a bit later where they apologized sort of and said they'd like to work things out. But at that point I knew needed time on my own to work things out and didn't want to rush into a decision so I didn't respond. I considered reaching out a few times afterwards but kept finding shitty posts about me on their social media any time I checked in on them and decided overall not to reach out. There's been one or two posts though as well where they say they miss me and accept their blame in the situation. Its been six months since we last talked now. I do really miss them, but because of all this I'm having a hard time between deciding to reach out or just move on entirely. 

I've already reached out to two people who I've had previous falling outs with, that were mostly due to their error overall, and tried to work things out with them. I'm glad that I talk to them and am on okay terms now, but part of me is also sad I had to reach out to someone who screwed me over. It makes me feel like they don't care since they never bothered to try to reach out first. This makes me hesitant to reach out for a third time to someone who hurt me. I'm sick of being the person who cares more every time. 

I also have friends who've seen everything and all the messages tell me i should not bother reaching out to this friend or wait longer. My issue is it's already been six months and I feel like if I keep waiting I'll miss the window to reach out. I really think this person has realized their error and would work to repair things, but my friends don't at all. I guess I'm hoping if I reach out we'll reconnect and we'll both be able to fix things and make it better than before, but my friends think I'll just get hurt again. 

I'm really at a loss for what to do. I do miss them and I'd love for us to be able to repair things, but I've also given them multiple chances already and it feels like they'll just hurt me again. I'd like for someone who's hurt me to finally realize their mistake and try and repair things  with me on their own, instead of me missing these people who've hurt them me and always having to make the effort myself.

5,"I am already in the process of trying to find a better job. I know that advice is coming.

I work for a contractor. I am the sole dedicated office staff for the small company. As a result I have a great deal of contact with our clients as I do the billing as well as some of the dispatching and scheduling. I must say that it is not a plumbing company however a great deal of our work overlaps with plumbers.

Our boss is a man in his mid-60s who is nearing retirement. He is showing up to the office less and less. This week I would say he was there about 10 hours. That's fine but he is also paranoid and micromanages everything. Most importantly, he is stuck into business practices that were appropriate thirty years ago. Despite endless conversations with people both inside and outside of the company, he refuses to admit that there must be change.

The silly example is that our technicians are scheduled on an Excel spreadsheet that the boss started literally 20 years ago. It is only accessible to the people in the office and none of the technicians.

We have one client with two large condo buildings. Both of which we have maintenance contracts for that are a sizable amount of money for this company. Recently they developed a problem with a piece of large equipment. This past week the general manager and two technicians went down to check things out. The bus showed up out of no where. He hadn't been in the office that day.

Despite the fact that the technicians and the GM had already come up with a very good plan where everything would be dealt with quickly, efficiently, and safely, the boss had to have his two cents. Boss wants us to go for a plan that would take significantly longer, inconvenience the tenants for at least a month, and no permits.

This plan could not only destroy the business (fines for lack of permits and inspections as well as being liable for paying others to do it right), it could easily get the condo property company in just as serious problems.

I have had some email contact with the property manager. Is there some way I could reach out and warn him not to take it? Ethically I can't let something that would have such huge consequences happen. But I know I can't do anything to stop my boss.",11Nov2018,1
6,"I been working the same position for 6 years with no movement due to my industry going through rough times (I work in Mortgage). 

I just recently got promoted to a new title after all these years a few months ago, but training has been slow and I have yet to be offered any pay raise. They also hired some new guy who just started in the industry less than six months ago in my same position, and he is terrible at the job. I digress

I just got offered 5 extra dollars at a larger company, with more opportunity for growth, but for the same position I’ve been in for 6 years. I’m really trying to get out of this position, so for me to start again at a new company doing the same thing sounds very unappealing and unchallenging to me. But 5 more dollars would help me tremendously. 

I’m worried that if I get laid off at this new position (which is common in Mortgage) that id be stuck with the same title/experience on my resume and wouldn’t find another job who can match the same large pay increase I’d be getting. Even though I am getting less money with my promotion, it would open up more doors for me long term if the promise of opportunity for growth at this new company turns out to be bullshit.

8,"This involves my circle of neighborhood friends, we are military, stationed in a foreign country so it's like a close knit family.  Of course with any family there is the one person you ""tolerate"" and that happens to be one of the husbands in the group; let's call him John. He's socially awkward and does borderline creepy things that makes us keep a close eye on him and not trust him to be alone with anyone (adult or child).  Now to the issue at hand, we had a party a month or two ago and at the party mostly everyone was drinking minus myself and one other DD. John's wife is a modest Japanese woman, so my wife and another wife (let's call her Jane) think it would be funny to run off take flashing pictures on John's wife's phone. When they return they are promptly reminded John is the husband of modest wife and he might get into them. So they quickly delete the picture(s), but tell the modest wife what they did. The modest wife proceeds to drunkenly explain to John what my wife and Jane did; he IMMEDIATELY tries to get into her phone to try and see them and after his wife yells at him and tells him they have already been deleted he begrudgingly stops. So we thought that was the end of it, but sadly it isn't. Two nights ago my wife tells me that Jane told her John went back and recovered the deleted pictures somehow. I am beyond mad this man maliciously went through his wife's phone to find pictures of his friends wives, for his sick amusement. Now I am not sure if he still has the pictures, if his wife knows, or if he's made copies and what he's done with them if he does. So I'm am looking for advice on how to deal with this. I want to stand up for my wife and confront John but not sure how to go about it.

So, Me and My fiancee are in our third year of college and there's a guy with down syndrome who is absolutely obsessed with her.

But they say I’m old enough to chose which house I wanna stay in and that sounds silly cause the other house has no furniture and gets really cold and the Internet hasn’t been setup ( I need that cause a majority of my assignments for school are on the Internet) so I have to resort in staying in my old house for the Internet. And now my parents want to put the house up for rent because no is living there and we wanna make some money even though I been asking to move there.

14,"Let me start off with I’m 16. I’m a twin and I have an older brother. My mom is my favorite person in the world. I’ve gone through 3 divorces. 1st one I was little (mom and dad) 2nd I was like 12 and glad it happened (mom and stepdad) 3rd the one I’m talking about (stepmom and dad).

The basics are I live at my stepmoms house and I don’t like her. I can move to my dads house but it’s not as good as her house and it’s hard to love him sometimes. I can but can’t move into my moms house cause it’s too packed. 
 
Ok so my parents got a divorce because my dad drank too much,  he had always had a drinking problem but it got worse since his father/my grandpa was dying, so I decided staying with my stepmom after the divorce because I didn’t want to move all my stuff in another house again (note: parents just moved over summer and it was very painful). My dad said he was fine that we were living with my stepmom but today I heard my stepmom was seeing another guy when my dad was at his depressed state (his father was dying). fast forward a month I heard him say that “(my stepmom) told (me) that he can stay over at her house if anything goes wrong with the relationship. So that’s why he is staying there.” But note that I didn’t want to move again and I do remember her saying that. Anyways I also heard him say that he can “take them by force like I did to (my older brother)” (when he said he’ll take my brother and I by force I think taking it to court. Also he has done it before by keeping my older bro, twin bro, and myself because he had better lawyers than my mom) but he waved it off because he said “(my brother and I) are old enough to make my own decisions.” 
Ok so first off if he did take this to court then I’d stay with my mom. Also my dad stopped drinking after the divorce so yay on that but since my stepmom was seeing another man she was like nope to my dad. Note she hasn’t told me about any of this and my dad never said she was dating when my dad was at his depressed state. My dad never asked me what was my viewpoint was in the situation so I bet he thinks I’m falling for my stepmoms trap. I also heard from my dad that my stepmom was like “since (my twin and I) was living with me you need to pay me”. Wtf? Why don’t you be a responsible parent because you wanted us to stay at your house. Since my twin and I are staying with you your going to mooch money off my dad. Just say u don’t want us to live there. I hate my stepmom and I hate my dad. Just noticed my stepmom was plotting this or something and I hate my dad because he abused me. I’m still scared of him to this day if he gets mad even though he doesn’t abuse me anymore. But thanks to him I feel more suicidal than usual. I was always an angel child including my twin so that’s probably why our stepmom kept us in the first place. You might be thinking, just live with your dad if she’s such a b*tch. Like I said I don’t want to move again unless it’s my moms house. My dads place is only a couple blocks away from my stepmoms house anyways. I can’t stay with my real mom because she has a full house and she isn’t as rich as the other two. I feel like this was my stepmoms plan all along which makes me think my dad thinks I’m falling for her games. I don’t know how to feel because I just didn’t want to move again but now I really don’t care. I feel like I’ve been lied to most my life but that’s a different eavesdropping conversation. Also my older brothers story is another whole conversation. But basically he used to live with us but he wasn’t here for the 3rd divorce.

15,"This is my first year in college, and I met a girl fairly quickly. About five weeks into school, we decided to start dating. It went great at first, but eventually I came to dislike the relationship. She was a great person, but we had a lot of personality clashes, up until the point where I dreaded our dates. On top of that, the college workload plus a serious relationship was a bit much for both of us. So we broke it off.

About a month has passed, and she’s a part of my friend group, so we see each other every few days. She let slip soon after the break up that she forgot we weren’t dating anymore. She wants to hold my hand during scary movie nights. She asked if I wanted to marry her if we were both still single in a few years. She wants to sit next to me everywhere we go. She keeps asking me, in front of my friends, if I want to take late night walks with her like we used to and just talk.

21,"First of all I’m not English native but also I’ve been learning that for one year so I’m sorry for my terrible English. I hope you’ll understand me.

I’m 21/m and for long time I don’t believe God so I feel so lonely always but anyway. Even I hate myself I have enough reasons about that. But I just wanna say the most important thing: Height

My height is 153m (5’0”) and of course this is terrible for a man and funny for other people. If I were a girl absolutely it wouldn’t matter but I’m a man and this height is embarrassing. Thus I feel weak in social relationships so I alway prefer to be alone because I don’t want to be funny (topic) due to height.

So I am loosing faith in myself day by day.  I can’t  explanation myself now. Example if I discuss with someone about important thing, he could make fun of my height. So may I be half-human as a hobbit??

All aside, I will walk alone forever. Any girls in the world will not like me at first wiev and then I will have not any chance as a matter of course.  If I rich or handsome maybe height wouldn’t so problem but unfortunately I’ve no money nor goodlooking. So why I should believe in god? If there is a god, he must hate. If there is no a God and my life is terrible as you can see, why I must live? There is no hope at all, isn’t?  Do suicide a type of being peaceful? After die, a man who never born nothingness.

23,"So a little backstory about me. I am 20 years old studying abroad in Europe. Basically I come from a country where a lot of people move out of the country due to poor economical situation. When I graduated high school I was clueless on what I wanted to be and under the pressure from parents/friends I’ve decided to move abroad.

When I arrived here I had no connections here, I didn’t speak the language and the city I moved to wasn’t that bigger from my hometown (which was dissapointing for me since I wanted to experience the life in a big city). I did one semester of language learning and then I enrolled normally as any student would. 

Fast forward to present, I am depressed and have developed severe social anxiety. Since I cannot speak the language perfectly I get very anxious when I am in courses where presentation in front of other students is mandatory. It is so bad that I dropped out of most courses that require presentations two semesters in a row. Going to the university and simply sitting through a lecture feels like a giant accomplishment for me. I’ve also had multiple anxiety attacks which never happened to me. I’ve made some friends here but none that I can hang out with and the city is almost a ghost town.

Why don’t I simply return to my home country? I am financially dependent on my parents (who I am extremely grateful for) who think that returning would wreck my future and that it would show that I am not intelligent enough to finish the university here. I’ve had the talk with them about returning 5 months ago and they got extremely upset that I even taught about returning. They do not know that I am depressed and that I have anxiety and anxiety attacks.

What weighs me down is that I either stay here and mentally destroy myself or move back and start my studies all over again (costing my parents even more).  I’ve never wanted to be considered an ungrateful child but I feel like this would show me in that light.

Also going back means I would start university at 21 and that most of my friends would start their masters degrees or work while I study. I know I shouldn’t compare myself to other people but I can’t help myself. 

I will also most likely seek help from a therapist when I go back on a holiday.

What do I do?

28,"I have such a shitty situation on my hands right now. (Lets call my friend Jason and his ex Anna).

He keeps saying she was so special to him and the first GF he would die for (but Idk if he's saying that cause he truly feels this way, or because he misses her and is in a bad place).

Now its been a couple months. The thing is I'm friends with both Anna and Jason. And he wants to know about her. I don't mean like "" what she's wearing today"" or that type of thing. He just asks about things like ""does she still mention me"", ""is she interested in someone new?"", ""do you think she even cares?"". Because she seems to have moved on, she's with a new guy now and everything.

My question is should I tell him those things about her? Will that help him move on or just worsen the situation? Should I just shup up and say I won't talk about her? And what can I do to help him in general?

29,"Without going into too much detail, my boyfriend has been through hell and back. He is the strongest person on earth and I love him dearly.

But I need help on how to support him when he needs it. I myself have a few issues but I know how to deal and cope with mine. Im really not sure how to help him when he needs it. I try my best but its starting to overwhelm me because nothing I do really helps. 

Just some additional info if needed; no he is no in therapy, he doesn't like talking about his trauma or issues, I know only parts of his struggles and if I had to give any kind of diagnosis on his mental health Id say PTSD and depression.

Any advice at all would be truly appreciated. Thank you all. ",11Nov2018,1
30,"Hello! Long time lurker, first post ever. And as the title says: how do I become an interesting person and make friends. I’m 22M, Indian, and I go to LSU, and I have a lot of problems that I have been trying to fix. I’m introverted but I have been trying to get out and actually do things. I’ve never been able to make many friends and most of my friends in high school have moved away and I have about 2 people who I hang out with consistently. They’re both great guys, both heavily extroverted, like to party, basically frat guys. They both are very good at talking to people, and have been in long term relationships, and have lots of friends. Recently, I’ve been trying to change myself, mostly due to my depression. I’ve been working out as often as I can and I don’t feel like playing games anymore which was a huge part of what I used to do, I played league of legends and a couple of other games almost 4 hours a day every day, and lately I don’t feel like doing anything. Sorry for going on and on, just felt like giving you a little insight about me.

So basically I would like to know how do you make friends and just become an interesting person in general. Thanks!

32,"So.. in order for me to fall asleep I have to be watching/listening to something. I go through phases of what I fall asleep watching and usually it's something comedy related (Impractical Jokers, Bert Kreischer, Futurama, etc). However, recently I can only fall asleep to murder trials or disappearance videos (crime watch daily type videos). I've tried switching back to comedy and I spend hours trying to fall asleep with no success. Currently, the only thing I can fall asleep to is the Jodi Arias trial.

33,"Hi all, this issue is weighing heavily on my mind &amp; heart... the backstory...

I am the youngest of 3 daughters, I’m now 51.  I disassociated myself from my mother &amp; 2 sisters approx 11-1/2 yrs ago.  My Dad died in a tragic accident when I was 27, he &amp; I were very close... I haven’t ever felt close to my mother.  My mother wasn’t a happy person &amp; resented the life she chose as a farmer’s wife; I always felt that I was her chosen target to take her frustrations out on.  She emotionally, verbally, mentally &amp; sometimes physically abused me... she never laid a hand on my sisters or treated them like they weren’t worthy of being loved.  My Dad never saw saw the abuse &amp; I don’t think he ever knew how bad it was.  Because of the abuse, I grew up to be very codependent &amp; it ruined my life &amp; every relationship I was in.  Fast forward to now... my oldest sister texts me when anything bad in the family happens, but I’ve never replied... my 26 yr old son does have contact with them, as I always told him it was his choice.  My mother contracted hepatitis in the mid-eighties &amp; was very ill.  I went home every weekend (2-1/2 hr drive) to cook/bake/clean/do laundry at this time, neither sister made any effort to help.  She was on prednizone for 13 yrs &amp; was weaned off as her liver healed.  She is now very ill with cirrhosis (started feeling ill about a year ago) &amp; was diagnosed a few months ago.  It seems that she is approx at stage 3-4 &amp; it’s just a matter of time... she is 76.  My son is planning on seeing her tomorrow due to her deterioration... I was planning to go with him but as the day draws closer, I’m having serious issues with facing my abuser.  She is losing her memory, could be from the toxins in her body or just old age... I do *not* want to lose it on her, as I do have compassion &amp; empathy but she really fucked me up growing up - the abuse affected every part of my life.

Please, if you have any advice, do I go visit her?  If I do, how do I keep calm &amp; not think about everything she put me thru?  Do I not go &amp; just make my own peace with her by not seeing her?  I’m seriously struggling with visiting or not... genuinely appreciate others experiences/opinions... thank you!  💕",11Nov2018,1

36,"So long story: I have a friend, she's my boyfriend's co-workers wife. They have 4 kids, the youngest has a developmental disability. She has been mostly a sahm, with spotty work as a waitress. She recently began working again, and was overheard saying she wanted to work to get away from the youngest child. She also recently made the decision to medicate their oldest (she has add) without consulting her husband. She initially agreed to work only on the days her husband would be home to watch the kids, as daycare is incredibly expensive for 4 kids, but after only a single day working, they now want her to be there on other days and begin her shift before her husband gets home, leaving the kids with the neighbor (not a good choice for childcare). This is completely idiotic in my opinion and not in the best interests of her kids. She won't make enough to even cover costs, so why do it? Most of the time when a child has a disability, a parent would quit working to devote more time to them, but she wants to leave him? I don't get it. She can't even keep house, why does she think she can do that and work? 

I really want to say something to her, as I don't think it's good for her marriage, or her children. She's not being rational or logical. I would think she would work on keeping house well before attempting to add any responsibility. Should I? ",11Nov2018,1

and before you ask, no, its not changes in my body.

i believe i should explain what happens in my mind. in some days i could be very happy and other days i could be very sad, i think a lot about suicide but in those happy days when i don't feel like dying i know i won't do it. I'm a very negative person, i am very insecure about my penis, i say a lot of shit because i don't care about... almost anything, I'm also fat, ugly and very grumpy

in about the middle of this year I started thinking about woman a lot, I believe that's a little late but idk.

so the advice I want is if i should try and date a girl, there's this girl i met in my old school, she's too beautiful for me, but in school we had some chemistry, we liked of the same things, i know that's not much since we didn't talk very much about things other than movies and netflix... well except that weird phase where i was pretty much a sjw since i discovered myself as also liking guy's, i mean, don't get me wrong i don't want to date a guy, i would if i felt in love and i watch gay porn, but that's not what i want. should i invite her for a date or should i seek someone else, remember i still have some friends from that school.

38,"So I had a major national exam today and since we’re all assigned specific seats, I went to sit at my assigned place. It was only when I sat down that I realised I was seated next to this girl that’s really smart (often tops the level for multiple subjects). And I have no idea why but her very presence just distracts me, and especially the things she does during the paper. I feel like she has more exaggerated actions (like she has larger actions) when I compared them with the other people around me. For about half the paper I was so distracted I couldn’t really do the paper and only when it was too late I started to focus but like I said.. it was too late and I have a pretty good feeling I majorly fucked up the exam even though I spent so much time preparing for it. Went home and, not gonna lie, cried because this exam will literally affect my future.

So do y’all have any advice on how to ignore this kind of stuff? I’ll be sitting at the same spot for my next papers too and will probably be just as distracted. Although I’m not sure if it’s because of her or my state of mind, I didn’t sleep well last night and kept waking up.

TLDR: very distracted by the person sitting near me in the exam hall, fucked up an extremely important paper. Not sure if because of insufficient sleep or other reasons. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! ",11Nov2018,1

40,"This is very long. Apologies.

So I (20F) have a younger sister (15) who is very mean. Some people would say what she does is abuse, but I’m not sure. She would cut me down mentally by making fun of everything I do, use my disabilities to her advantage and just be rude. She’s also rude to my brother (12) but it’s not as serious with him. She’s been at this for the last 3-4 years and telling my mum never worked since she always said she would just talk to her. My stepdad is on my side, but has little say in the situation since my sister hates him. My stepdad did recommend that I write down everything she does to me for a month, then give it to my mum to prove a point. I currently have 5 days left until the end of the month.

Recently however, my sister lost her mind. She refused to get up for school, so my mum took her phone. So then she spent half the day running away to find a random person’s phone to call CPS on my mum for “abuse”. My mum has to give her back her phone if she promised to calm down. If my sister had called them, there would have been a chance that my brother would get taken away or something. She didn’t go to school for the rest of the week, is having a netting with the school soon and there’s a chance that she will be getting homeschool for the rest of the year because of her anger.

She is getting checked by a doctor to see if she has something. She was checked before and we are waiting on results, but we are pushing for it now. I’m scared for her, my brother and myself. If she gets homeschooled, then she’ll be home more often. I’m going to be home with her whenever I’m not at college and my brother now has to finish high school alone. My mum is walking on eggshells around her and she’s getting away with things I would be severely punished for, just because of her reactions. The only good thing that I can think of is that the notes I was writing about her behaviour towards me could come in handy with getting some sort of diagnosis. Plus my mum finally understands that she’s extremely mean to me. So there’s that.

I just don’t know what to do from here. Short term, I’m trying to be the only adult in her life that isn’t constantly asking her questions about her feelings. But she doesn’t deserve my positive attention after everything she’s done to me. Yesterday when we were hanging out in my room, she threw a stress ball at my face.

41,"So, my cat went missing 4 days ago. She, on occasion, will go exploring, but she usually will come straight home. When we noticed she didn’t, we posted in our neighborhood’s Facebook group, walked around and called for her, etc.. Two nights ago, we could hear her meowing loud. Last night, it happened again, so we just knew she was stuck in a tree or something. We were able to pinpoint that the area was coming from the neighbors two houses over. 

Today, we visited that neighbor, and he was very kind by letting us check in his backyard since he had a shed. She immediately ran underneath the shed and wouldn’t come out (although she was non stop meowing). Naturally, we left some wet food out for her, and another can inside of a live trap. We just now came back to check on her, and she is still in the same place. She hasn’t eaten in four days, yet her food is left untouched. 

I was able to get a glimpse of her eyes reflecting and she is still meowing, yet she will not budge. I think she was hurt and couldn’t hop the fence. But if so, why can’t she even come out from under the shed if she was able to run underneath it? She is pretty far underneath, and the crevice is too slim to crawl under. How do we get her out?

49,"Hi,
So a bit of background, I get a lot of pain due to a condition that leaves me bedridden or unable to do normal day to day things sometimes, this could be as simple as going to the toilet, cooking food, cleaning etc. 
I (now) have a great group of friends, I love my work and work really hard (unless I have to take time off due to being sick).
I had my first real holiday, 3 days at home, in the last two years and it gave me some time to reflect.

This year has been so intense- I’ve hard the longest stunts of being sick and some huge life changes (heartbreaks, deaths, moving and selling houses, relationship break downs and numerous health issues and scares)
A few months back my pain was so bad, I had to take a month off work, I was in and out of specialists, pain management, hospital admissions - my meds were not helping and I was became suicidal thinking this is how I had to live. 
I got some Pot to have just when the pain was so eye numbing to help me when nothing else would. 
My pain levels where so out of control sometimes I would pass out from the sudden piercing white pain. This could happen anywhere at any time. It would wake me up in the night, I couldn’t fall asleep with it. I was willing to try anything 
And it helped, I tried it and I went from crying and lying in the shower to being able to make a meal and hang up my washing.
I’d have it just when I needed it and I found I was able to get things done. I began to feel like I was beating this and getting my life back.

My new medications were helping and I was able to do a small walk around the block, then I was able to take the dog for a walk, then to the beach, we were able to do these things once or twice a week which was incredible! I was back at work, 3-4 days a week. Things were getting back on track.

Then came the tidal wave, had to move house and had some huge personal events happen. Through this I ended some close friendships because they were toxic, had time for better loving ones again, but it’s been a hard. Emotionally I’ve been through the wringer. I started smoking pot everyday, just a joint, now one or two (at night) but I’m finding im reliant on it. Now when I come home it’s the first thing I do and I become anxious if I take a night off seeing someone or going out because I’m not coping. I’ve been starting to become more social and happy but I know I’d prefer to be stoned and by myself at home.

The reason I’m here and not leaning on my friendship group is two fold.
1. I’m embarrassed, I’m scared they will judge me or I’ll lose people or it will start confrontation. I know with my old group this would be the case, but with my new ones I think they would be supportive to me but I’m really scared in case I’m wrong - and it’s still so new seeing them all again 

2. I need help, I want to change what I’m doing, I want my life to be better and not reliant on getting stoned every day - I know there is a wealth of knowledge and experience I can learn from here and I’m incredibly thankful for any advice - if ya know... you’ve made it this far, sorry for the length.

I used to see a psychologist, she’s no longer practicing and I’ve got my first session with a new one that specialises in pain in two weeks. 
I’m scared to tell her about this too as I’ve never met her and we haven’t established that relationship.
How can I stop smoking? how do I deal with this want to smoke and keep smoking - I can see that if I keep smoking I’ll loose everything I worked so hard to get back -yet it still doesn’t seem to be enough to motivate me to stop,

51,"Asking for a good friend of mine living in another state.

Someone close to me has been scared to see a therapist for years due to past bad experiences with them but needs help.

He is absolutely not in any immediate danger to himself but really needs to talk to someone. He does not need to be committed and is scared to seek out help because of people in the past overreacting and involuntarily committing him.

He fears that talking about it to anyone may risk him being ostracized and hurt but he is at the point where he does not know what else to do. Therapists are expensive and require a lot of commitment and he has heard about how hard it is it find a therapist that doesn't immediately dismiss you or overblow things. My friend is very scared to seek help but knows he needs it.

It is affecting his ability to form relationships with others, his self worth is low. Suicide hot lines scare him, as does asking for advice online because he doesn't know if he can get in trouble for it. So I am asking on his behalf.

He's an otherwise well-adjusted guy. He has suffered from anxiety and depression from an early age, but in the past couple of years he has gone through a lot of self growth. I whole-heatedly believe he isn't in any danger to himself, but the thoughts and impulses are still there and have been getting worse again.

Is there any advice I can give him? Is there any way I can reassure him that suicide hotlines will not send anyone to his house? Or, if they will, are there any fully anonymous and free sites he can go on?

53,"Hey, umm so this is gonna sound pretty meme worthy and funny but at the same time messed up and sad..I’m way too young for this shit, should be enjoying middle school.

So my parents found out I smoke after finding my e cigs, which I recently switched to to help me get off smoking. They were nice about it just shocked, they said they would just return it, I played dumb and claimed I had no idea it was harmful. Then I nearly shit myself remembering my mom would see my purchase history when she goes to return it. As you can see I spent nearly $100+ on smoking supplies (this is from a forum I posted on where to hide it) [stash](https://forum.grasscity.com/media/f70eb8e4-1014-400d-b827-5654ebb16c39.178986/)

Gave everything to my mom, got grounded, banned from ordering online. Now I was smoke free. I found a spare pack of rolling paper inside a box but didn’t have the willpower to do it all over again.

I was smoking some herbs (no nicotine, thc, any addictive chemicals) because I didn’t have any weed, I just did it to relax, chill, and thought I wouldn’t die from it. 

So it’s been a month since this all happened and I have hade strong cravings to smoke off and on. I miss the smoke in my lungs, the taste, the feel, rolling, etc..I’ve been getting more desperate, I’ve been trying to build a vape so I could do it in my room without my parents knowing, and nearly caught the bathroom on fire in the process.

I’m afraid if I get too desperate I could burn the house down or do something that will kill me. I’m wayy too young for this shit I feel like I’ve made a huge mistake and this is all a nightmare. 

could anyone recommend something to me to help me stop the cravings and stop trying to build things to smoke/vape? I don’t wanna tell my parents about this they won’t believe me because they think I just did it to look cool and that there wouldn’t be any “withdrawals” when they took it immediately.

54,"I just found this out today when I looked at my past insurance claims. I go in detail about it after the first paragraph if you want to skip to there.

For a little more background detail, I am 18 years old and male. I have been living with my mom for about a year now, in the state of Hawaii. My parents divorced early and my father got full custody, so I never had much contact with my mom growing up (I only saw her during summers). You can imagine how excited I was to spend the summer in Hawaii with her, reconnect and make up for our lost time. My relationship with my father is pretty bad, and I was more than happy to be able to leave the house when I turned 18. I had planned on staying only a few months before starting college, but enjoyed Oahu so much that I decided to get a job and enroll in the local university. My mom is a therapist, she runs her own private practice and everything. She has always made good money, and always seemed to like her job.

*So now for the whole insurance thing*: I have Medicaid, which is covered by the state, so I have no monthly fees/limits. Since I don't get bills I almost never check my insurance but happened to do it today on a whim. What I found completely shocked me. For 6 months now, my mother has been billing my insurance as if I were a client of hers, collecting hundreds of dollars a week. There were pages and pages of charges. I genuinely couldn't believe it; I wanted to think there was some way this could be an honest mistake. My mom has always had problems, but I never thought she would be capable of this. According to the internet, fraud charges of more than $1,000 are a felony. My mom has stolen nearly $5,000 from the state.

If I report her, she loses her job, and most likely goes to prison. If I say nothing, I am worried that I will be implicated in all this. After all, I am her son, it could seem like I was helping her all along. On top of that, I have hardly any savings, I have no car, and my job is barely above minimum wage... Without her, I think I could be homeless. Obviously I would be better off if I kept my mouth shut. But I don't know if I could live with myself, and the pure anxiety of knowing that she could get caught at any minute and uproot my entire life... I have yet to confront her, can you imagine confronting your own mother with this sort of thing? Every time I think about it sickens me, makes me literally nauseous. I just got her back into my life, I honestly don't know if I can emotionally handle this, and what it means to our relationship.

There is no way to stop her without turning her in, I can talk to her but honestly don't know if that will discourage her.

55,"Hey, so I’m a freshman in high school. I’ve just recently found out I can’t really trust anyone. One of my friends threatened that she would tell my mom I send nudes to my boyfriend, which a lot of people know about. I should’ve just never told anyone. Anyway, apparently a lot of people hate me. Someone I’ve been friends with since 5th grade, who I don’t know if I can trust, told me what a lot of people think about me.

Many people don’t like me because they think I’m a spoiled brat. Apparently I look like one, act like one, and walk like one. I don’t think I am, but if everyone thinks so then? I don’t know what to do, I’m gonna be more private from now on. Will this pass? How do I let it just not affect me? I feel really bad right now and feel like I have no friends. Will people forget about me sending nudes to my bf if I just never talk about him again? He lives in another state, so they won’t see us together. Will people forget by next year? Should I change schools next year? Our hs keeps 9th and 10-12th separated. What can I do to change my behavior? How do I become private? I’m an open person and like to talk a lot, I tell my boyfriend everything. I plan to keep telling him everything, as even if he wanted to spread it around he doesn’t even live in my state so now at his school cares. He’s the only one I know for sure doesn’t think I’m a spoiled brat and that I can really trust. 

There’s other girls at my school that everyone hates. They’ve always been nice to me, but they are tough and keep a small friend group. They’re popular and really pretty, which I guess is why everyone hates. But, I don’t think I’m popular or that pretty. I wish I could at least be like them, I wish I could just not care. How can I just toughen up?

Also, the girl who threatened to expose me to my mom, she told her mom that I send nudes to my boyfriend. Her mom said I don’t really think she should be doing that. Do you guys think she’ll tell my mom? I told my mom that I’ve never done so and not to believe her but what if other people tell her that I have? When will people just forget?

I then asked him if he wanted to hang out Sunday on that same week and he said yes, but last minute he canceled because he was busy (he gave me this paragraph of how he had to clean his house, so i think he was legitimately busy). Last week i asked him to hang out and we went to a haunted house and it was fun and i told him if he were to ask me to hang out i would say yes. I saw him on Tuesday after school and asked him if he wanted to walk with me to this guys car because i was buying a vape from this guy. He said sure but then when we were walking he turned around and i asked him where he was going and he just kept walking and then i said okay bye and he turned around and waved (he vapes to so it wasn't the fact that i was buying a vape). Basically what i'm trying to say is should i ask this guy to hang out or is him not taking the initiate to ask me a sign that he doesn't want too?

58,"I have worked in the same office for 6 years and have seen many different Supervisors come and go. They are all under one Manager that is in charge of the whole office. So far, I have not had an issue with any of them. But a new Supervisor was recently hired for my dept. and she is a terror. I am unsure of how she got hired. Our Manager is usually very picky about who she puts in admin roles. This supervisor is constantly over looking important things that I end up having to fix, without receiving any credit or pay for, and is just generally clueless. On top of that, which while annoying I could deal with, I have witnessed her verbally abusing a co-worker. She will often pull the co-worker aside and berate her for little things. I have overheard her call this co-worker a fucking idiot, moron, even retarded etc. behind closed doors. My co-worker is very sweet but is also very young (she is 20) and does sometimes make a mistake here and there but she does not deserve this type of treatment at all. I have witnessed her leave her shift crying multiple times. I am unsure of what to do as I have never seen someone treat an employee this way. Do I confront her myself or do I take it directly to Manager? What evidence do I need to provide? My other co-worker has also witnessed this and like myself has defended the co-worker being treated badly. We feel like she is being singled out because of her age. Any advice is appreciated.

60,"This guy and his mates have been being dickheads and I tried to blow it off but unfortunately being passive has made them feel like they can keep doing it. The other day I was in a bad state, feeling sick at a party so they decided to start fucking with me. One guy slapped me a few times and spat on my face. I’ve done everything I can to get them to go away passively but chance are a fight will go down soon.

There’s three of them, one is a little shorter than me and small so no problem, the second isn’t really involved and the third guy is weaker than me but taller. The main issue is with the last guy, neither of us can fight, I haven’t been in a proper one for years. I’m ~5’9” and he’s maybe 6’1. I’m semi fit, my cardio health isn’t amazing, I work out at the gym a lot so I’m much stronger than he is. He’s very skinny, he acts tough but his legs are thinner than my arms. He’s a smoker and a dropkick so he’s dumb and unfit but he still has height and confidence. 

I can probably military press twice as much as him but it won’t matter if he hits me in the head 10 times before I even get in reach. I’m not huge btw, I’ve been gymming since the start of the year. I can bench 80kg as a max, curl 35kg full arm extension on the preacher curl, do about 10 pull ups (I weigh 65kg), militarily press 40-45kg. My legs are lacking compared to my upper body due to me doing leg day on Fridays and then getting a gf who was usually only free on Friday. I’m catching back up now but my squat max is only like 50kg and idk my deadlift max because I don’t get the form 100% so I’m not sure what weight counts. Core strength is decent, I can do 12 reps of max decline situps with a 20kg plate with 5 second reps. 

The other guy looks like he can probably get some quick punches because he’s skinny and light for his height. If my advantages is strength and endurance and his advantage is reach with a toss up on who is faster, what would you guys suggest I do in a fight. I don’t like violence and I will fight him just to get him to go away. I want to teach him a lesson but not break his arm or anything, also I don’t want to do anything that will cause further problems with more people like dog hits. Right now everyone who knows about it besides those three is with me but if I sucker punch him, gang bash him or hit him in the nuts it could sway some people and then I have to deal with them as well. 

I’ve looked up articles on this but most assume that I want to take on a guy taller and stronger than me using my superior speed but this is not so much the case.

64,"My parents tried to push me into doing multiple things (music, sports, etc.), but I never found interest in anything. In fact, I hated doing anything other than staying inside and playing video games. I absolutely despised anything my parents would try to push me to do. They gave up in pushing me after much resistance when I was around 13, and since then, it's just been video games. I'm a terribly boring person to talk to; I wondered all these years why I could never find any friends, and worked years to develop my confidence. After realizing that I can't be confident for no reason, without having any talents, knowledge, or skills, I started to look back to the different phases of myself I used to be and who I am now, and see myself as a fraud for being confident.

&amp;#x200B;

Walk into my room in the house I've been living in all my life, and you'll see nothing but a bed, a dresser, and a closet. I think this is the detail about myself I noticed that brought about these realizations. I'd walk into my friends' rooms and see things they'd consider as part of their identity (hobbies, etc.).

&amp;#x200B;

I just was never interested in anything. I don't have any great knowledge in anything particular and I'm not good at anything. Every day, I'd come home from school, do homework, and then go to my games or mindlessly watch something on TV or YouTube just to pass the time, not even to learn anything. I don't even remember anything I watch. I consider myself very sheltered even though that's my own fault.

&amp;#x200B;

After realizing these things, I have no confidence and I feel like everyone is better than me for being good at things. It's disturbing how little I pursued things in my lifetime. I'm 19, and I can summarize my entire life to 90% accuracy in just a couple sentences. Here, I'll do it:

&amp;#x200B;

Ages 0-6 my parents made me watch those Einstein videos as a kid and played with my parents. I didn't have any friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Ages 6-11 become introduced to video games. All I do besides school, still no friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Ages 11-14 I finally make some friends for the first time, but I don't really understand why they were my friends looking back. We didn't have anything in common and kinda just messed around together.

&amp;#x200B;

Ages 14-18 I push myself into sports and meet some new people too. I don't make many friends and don't become close with any of my teammates except for a few. School, practice, video games.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm in college and don't keep in touch with anyone I was friends with in high school. I realize that what I had weren't friendships, but people who felt sorry for me. They started to develop their own egos, values, and personalities and forget about me once they realize I haven't changed at all. I've been asked, ""What do you even do, man? We don't really know who you are.""

Anyway, it's been peaceful, for the most part. He's been getting frustrated with his younger siblings, but other then that it's fine. Except for one thing. I have a friend, i went to college with her. She's divorced, single and everything. But the thing is, my son has been hitting on her. I've overheard him talking to her, whenever i go out of the room, he does this. 


She came by to return a laptop i lent her, and when i put it back and came back, i saw him talking to her. Like, flirting. For example, I have him call her Ms. Johnson, not by her first name. And he said ""It is Ms Johnson, not Mrs., right?"" He was touching her arm and she giggled. I just watched them, and i made my presence known. He stopped and immediately changed the conversation.


Every since then, she's been coming over almost every day. For no reason, she says it's to eat my ""wonderful cooking"", but before this she always complained about my cooking. That i didn't season enough.


Anyway, he always comes in our living room when we talk. He's came in their shirtless and acted like he didn't know she was there.


I think she's interested, i mean one time, she brought her kids over and we had a pool party. We stayed outside and watched our kids in the pool. But after awhile when he went inside, she followed behind him. She disappeared for over 10 minutes and when i went inside to go fetch her, my son had his arm around her waist and he was kissing her neck. He freaked out when he saw me walk in.


So, i don't want this to happen. I find it gross and wrong. I mean, she's almost double his age! How can i put a stop to it?

Unfortunately, my only job to date was something I got through connections, and I wasn't even interviewed, so I have no idea how to approach these recruiters and what I should expect.

74,"So this situation feels overwhelming to me because I'm living through it every day and need to figure it out by the end of the month. I'm hoping some kind of outside perspective will help me feel a little better about everything. 

Before I start, I'm a 25/F/US. I have just started going to therapy and the only reason I mention that is because I know it will be suggested at some point. 

I'm recently single and was living with my now ex-boyfriend for two years. I moved to a state that I hate, am working a job that I hate, and I now have no reason to stay here. However, my family lives about an hour away so I was able to make an emergency (and temporary) move to their house while I figure things out. 

My relationship with my family is very strained at best and (in my opinion) we do better when we're apart. I do appreciate them helping me out during this but my mom in particular is very controlling and tries to make every decision for me when we are in regular contact. I feel more stressed when I'm around my family but I'm sure most people say the same. My mom wants me to be more involved and move closer to them while I want to just place distance from everyone and start over somewhere new with a lower COL. I just want a fresh start. I've really been thinking Texas. The move would be about 16 hours away. However, I'm a very shy person and do not have any friends that I could live with anywhere. The move would be blind. I have about 5 grand saved right now and would feel comfortable with a little bit more saved away for a blind move.

In an act of desperation, I had my credit ran and was approved for an apartment a little bit out of my price range. The move wouldn't be for three weeks and I have not signed a lease yet. All I've done is had the hard pull on my credit and an approved application. Nothing I can't back out of. I have a two job interviews on Monday and both potential jobs would pay a little bit more and cover the cost of rent/living expenses there. It would be doable but a lot of my expenses would be going into this apartment and rent making it harder to save for a move.

Pros to moving: Fresh start, New people, No snow, Complete independence/freedom from stressful people in my life, lower COL.

Cons to moving: No connections, Potential financial struggles, Strained family ties.

So my question is, should I hold off on this lease, save my money, and try to move somewhere completely new or make it work with this apartment? ",11Nov2018,1
75,"First, I'd like to thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedules to read this post. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since I was 14 years old I've been heavily involved in entrepreneurship and building my own businesses. Currently I'm 18 and I have roughly $42,000 in my bank account. When I was 17 years old, my father gave me my own car which was a 2016 Toyota Rav 4. Everything was perfectly fine, until about 2 weeks ago.

&amp;#x200B;

My father is a car salesman and apparently October was a pretty slow month for him, so he was falling behind on bills, etc. 2 weeks ago he asked me if I could loan him $2,000 which I respectfully said no, considering that I've loaned him money before in the past and sometimes never see that money ever again.

&amp;#x200B;

After I said no to $2,000 he left me alone until today where he then asked me for just a mere $1,000 in order to pay for my car payment, car insurance and other bills he has. I respectfully said no, because once again, sometimes when I loan him money he sometimes does not pay me back.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, because I declined his offer to loan him $1,000, he's saying he doesn't have enough money to pay for my car payment and car insurance this month so he's planning to give it back to the dealership next week which I obviously don't want to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

I've loaned him money multiple times in the past when I was 16, 17 and 18 years old with anywhere from a few hundred bucks at a time to a few thousand dollars. Sometimes he pays me back, sometimes he doesn't or heavily delays it. Also, aside from this, he's recently asked me to loan him $10,000 and $5,000 on two separate occasions to help him build his credit in order to purchase a house in the future which I definitely declined.

&amp;#x200B;

I suppose my reasoning behind creating this thread is to ask for an opinion on what you guys think. What do you think, who's in the wrong and who's in the right? He makes $90k-$100k a year, while my mom makes $26k a year.  I'm only 18 years old and I've got a future ahead of me, so I can't just  keep loaning him money all the time.

80,"Why do we want our parents present at moments of achievement?  Obviously, a desire to impress our parents is normal and a bonding part of the human experience, but I believe the desire seems to be stronger than it should be. 

If there is an extra layer of compulsion present in our psyche, as I see in myself and others, what could be the cause? Is it possible that this compulsion we feel to impress our parents is rooted in a deep evolutionary fear?  In the animal kingdom, we often see mammalian mothers assessing the litter, but casting aside one of the young, which is obviously a death sentence. The mother felt that something wasn’t satisfactory with that baby, and the result was death. 

Biologists posit good reasons for why the mother will do this, but have we overlooked the effect that this could have on all offspring? An evolutionary imprinting of sorts? Perhaps there is a subtle imprinting in our genes that communicates to us, “Your survival depends on you impressing mom.”

My hope, in presenting this deep thought, is that could add perspective for those might be grappling or even anguishing over problems with your parents. I also think that it is a therapeutic step in our next leap in psychological development. There is a high degree of independent maturity to do something for the right reason. Maybe it will be for yourself, or for the greater whole of society, but less so for mom.

83,"I will preface this by staying that at no time were the many personnel involved with this unprofessional. 

I was in NO for a work convention Wed through Fri (I'm an oncology nurse). The full body scanner alerted my crotch area and hips with a huge red box.  I was tested on the palm of my right hand with the residue wand and it alerted positive.  I was asked if I wanted a private room for the crotch search,  I said no. I was thoroughly patted down with the back of the woman's hand right outside the scanner. She had a weird running monologue of everything she was doing. The search included under the curve of my buttocks and pushing all the way up between my labia and thighs under my skirt Of course there was nothing there.  

They decided to change their gloves and test the wand on themselves.  It didn't alert. They then decided to take me into a side room with two female personnel with all of my items- purse, shoes, carry on bag and test me with another wand. Once again it alerted on my right palm. For some reason never explained,  they decided to have a new woman full body search me. This included a much more detailed crotch search as well as my hair,  collar bones, under my boobs, all over (except they didn't look at my feet or toes). The second observing agent left halfway through this search.  Again there was the monologue which honestly made me more nervous than them just getting the fuck on with it.   This body search was about 10 minutes. After this they took me and my possessions out again to the public staging area and they went through every single item and used the wand on everything, finding nothing. They damaged one of the $36 voodoo dolls I had bought for the kids. They didn't fold anything back up or take any care with my items.  They then sent me through to the boarding area with no explanation,  no thanks for cooperating and no reassurance that they do this for a reason,  nothing.  I just got on with my boarding,  what else can I do?  

I've been thinking about this more today and I just feel pissed about it. I just don't understand why a common false positive can lead to a 40 minute ordeal with two crotch searches and a full body search.  Should I complain?  I know it's probably a waste of time. 

On a side note,  the body scanner at the local municipal airport on my way down to NO also false alerted on my neck and left thigh.

When I went to submit my 8th one online the website wasn't working so I emailed the lecturer my lab report after class to let him know the website isnt working. I was told that its fine and Im not the only one having issues submitting it. I submitted it to the website as well later that day when it was working again.

I started doubting myself when he told me I didn't get a mark because I must have never given them a paper copy, its not impossible that I forgot to submit it but its highly unlikely because:

1.  I found a finished copy of the lab report he claims i missed that was last edited on the day that it was due right before class started, the reason for this being that I had to add a chart to it last minute, I then printed it on the university printer.

2. Its also on my memory stick along with every other lab report that I had to take with me to print at university. 

The only way I didn't submit it is if I finished my lab report before class, printed it and then just walked past my class and went home. It just doesn't seem likely. 

If he refuses to give me a grade is there anything I can do or is it a case of their word over mine? I will fail the entire paper and have to repeat the class if he doesn't give me this grade.",11Nov2018,1
85,"Hey reddit. Let me start off with saying I’m 18 and she’s 17. Me and my ex have been together for 4 years, and out of the blue she just broke up with me last night. We ended on good terms (I assume) but she says it was because I was asking for too much sex. The sex was very abundant once we started and it eventually just went to about once every month which really didn’t bother me that much because I enjoyed just having her there more than sex. Very little did I ask if we could have more sex but I did ask here and there and she got upset with it, like way too upset. She started talking to this guy recently and that’s when it all went downhill from there. She started talking to him and snap chatting him and calling him more than me. I suspect that he has to do with how she feels. I asked her if she could give me more attention than him and oh nonono she did not like that one bit. “I give you way more attention than him, and all you want is sex anyways” is what she said last night. And then we got into arguing some more and then the last thing she said was “all you ever do is ask for sex, maybe I don’t want too” mind you, I ask for sex maybe like twice a month, we’ve gone out on dates more than most couples do. I think maybe she likes him and is just throwing me away. I guess my main questions are, is he playing a part in how she feels? Also, should I wait it out or just assume she’s gone and try to move on. Everything was going good too, we were both happy or at least that’s what I thought.",11Nov2018,1

87," Im actually ruined within. My gf of 4 yrs was always a feisty one. Very negative, suffers from anxiety attacks, agoraphobia, strong of character, very “street”, harsh, but sensitive and emotional. I met her as a church man! I was about 28 moving into a new apartment back home in puerto rico. I really liked her and, being single for about 5 years i decided to give myself a chance. Maybe I could become a good influence!   


Fast forward a few months... I was no longer the church guy as before. I noticed i was becomming more like her. I was helping her find drugs, and was degrading myself. She had no intentions to change and often argued that i should just accept her that way and receive her love... So I did and continued.   


About 2 years in we still wasnt married. But i decided to reaffirm my faith and abstain for sexual activity ( i know i know.... big mistake and pretty much a huge deal breaker to many.). But she accepted it and told me she supported me as long as i showed some affection. She was always the type to leave me behind for her friends, to smoke some weed drink and relax. I was secondary, and i like to believe that during those times she was faithful. Lots of arguments in the early stages. 1 week without arguing would be relief. Apparently i was always doing something wrong...  but she loved me?  


We then moved to Texas! Starting afresh. Moved in with my parents for a moment till i can save up and get my own place. We were there for a about a year. This is our first official “move in”.  Very exciting moment for us and she was drug free for about 5 months. That was until....She found a dealer. Even during that 5 months something was always bothering her. When i began to work at the office ( my own business ) she was working with me and helping me out the best she can. But felt i was giving more attention to the work instead of her. I tried to explain to her this is a natural phase for any startup. “ Dont worry, this is temporary and just know that we are always together. But lets bring this up together. “ i would always tell her. Only sometimes 9 hrs per day, but usually 8hrs i figured this was totally normal. Besides the self study sessions at home after i cook dinner for us. Id never say no to movies, or a walk by the lake.   


Eventually my business was irritating her. We would sleep arguing and wake up for round two. Id get so infurated by the constant battles that it began to grow in me to become cold... no longer showing affection due to constant fights. I found myself in such anger id explode and throw my frameless glasses accross the room not knowing what to do.   


Months later she goes to puerto rico to visit her family for three weeks. Turns out during those three weeks she was sleeping with some other guy. She even called me during one of her sex sessions to see what i was up to ( she confessed this to me with tears ). She did this to make sure i wouldnt facetime her since she already called. When she came back and confessed it all to me. I cried... To make it worse, She kept talking to the guy telling him she wiuld go back for him. So what did i do? I fought for her. Told her it was my fault because i let the fights take away the affection i had for her. So to win her back i went out of character &amp; did things that was more “her style” even to the point of getting high with her snd started having sex again. She decided to stay...  


Moved to a new apartment and my parents suggested we move to settle things and to have our space. Fights continued. Id catch her texting other guys and erasing messages. I forgave her those times too.   


I decided to do everything in y ability to convince her unstable self to go back to pr for vacation and surprise her with a 1 way ticket. I wasnt having it anymore... after months of failed attempts to convince her, because she was paranoid and fearful that id get revenge by cheatinf on her.   


Presently: shes pregnant by my kid. A boy! My first son! Born to a woman who has betrayed me very often and supports nothing that i do ( she despises my work and family ). During her pregnancy she abstained from all drugs, and went into a detox program. I visited her as often and i could. But even during that process she would often times tell me not even to show up and refused to see me because i had my business to attend to. I felt like i had to choose one or the other. Most of the pregnancy was full of arguments and explosive temper. I was never a man of short temper, but i learned to become one with her. I changed... for the worse. To make it all the more sweeter, during her program they told her she tested positive for chalmydia ( special thx to the asshole back in puerto rico!)  


She decided to visit her mom and sister out of state. She told me she felt so good and relieved. Full of joy and laughter. I felt good for her. So i told her maybe it would be good for her to stay for the rest of the pregnancy so she can spent the final trimester with peace. Another argument. She insisted to come back instead of doing medical transfer. When she came back all hell broke loose. Non stop crying. Her parents were constantly fighting me. I lose 10 lbs, sleep 4 hrs per night. Less focus in business and more customer complaints. Things were getting out of hand. I told her i really needed to think about things which made her cry even more. During this period i found her textinf another man and walking out to the balcony to speak in private saying “hello” in that tone which we use when we speak to a crush. That pushed me over the edge, and again she cried and asked for forgiveness. I wasnt having it anymore... now im fully decided and going against all advice of keeping her for the sake of our kid. Her dad calls me insulting the crap out of me which pushed me even further over the edge.   


Shes leaving in two days... and i feel guilty. I feel like shit. Nobody wants me to do this. But i insist that its better for my son to be born under a roof of peace instead of divided parents. Besides, i absolutely refuse to be cheated on and taken advantage of multiple times. Now everybody spits on me for this... suicidal thoughts torture me but ill be okay.   


She insists and telld me shes sorry for everything and wont put a court order child support on me. But asks for me to be there even though i shouldnt expect as much as a phone call from her to see how im doing. The only time ill hear from her is to tell me about my son or to allow me to see him. I told her not to worry i will be there, and i will continue to send her 1/4 her salary (whic is $200 weekly) pretty much for the rest of her life as long as the business last. If it grows she will get more, but she wont be a shareholder.

88,"Hello,

What I'm trying to do is create an electronic invite for an event.  Everywhere that I look there are services that do the following:

1) Charge money for the distinct privilege to spam my guests (I've tested this and it sucks)

2) They would send out a picture via txt message and then with links underneath the pic itself.  Which I don't want.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'd like to do is create an PNG (or some other picture file format) and include all of the relevant information on that pic and then send that out (e-mail and txt message) to my guests.

What's the best way to do this?",11Nov2018,1
89,"I'm a female in my early 40s, been happily single most of my adult life,  no kids, never been married, fair amount of experience dating but  almost all of it was in my teens and 20s, though I'm generally  considered attractive, am an extreme introvert and mostly keep to  myself.  
 

A few months ago I met a guy through a dating site.  He's also in his  40s, was married in his early 20s and in the process of getting divorced  now.  He and his wife have one child who is in her early 20s and on her  own/living with a boyfriend.  He says he has ""no idea"" why his wife  suddenly told him she wanted a divorce as soon as their daughter moved  out.  They are still living together but sleeping in separate bedrooms.   He's made almost all of the money during their relationship; only after  their daughter moved out did his wife get her first job which she still  has now.  He says he wanted her to be a stay-at-home mom and she  homeschooled their daughter.  
 

I have some concerns about this guy and am looking for advice on whether I should pursue a relationship with him.  
 

First, we do have a lot in common, almost identical political and  religious views (Anarchist/Libertarian and Atheist) and life goals as  far as where and how we'd like to live (rural homesteaders/prepper  types).  He's very intelligent and I'm attracted to that plus he is  well-prepared, informed, ready to retire and move wherever he wants.  I  also have significant property, savings and investments to help fund a  good life for us together.  
 

My concerns -- how could someone have no idea why their spouse wants to  end a 20+ year relationship?  That seems like he doesn't want to tell me  the reason(s).  She must have told him something.  He told me he used  to have anger management problems, once broke his hand punching a hole  in a wall for no real reason other than he was mad.  He says that was  about 20 years ago and he hasn't done anything like that since.  Also he  told me he ""laid his hands on"" his wife only once, also about 20 years  ago, verging ever-so-close to the classic abuser's line of ""s/he made me  do it"" by saying ""she made me mad and I slapped her,"" added that he  also caught his hand in her earring and ripped it out of her ear then.   He says their daughter refuses to have anything to do with him,  completely taking her mother's side and he claims he also doesn't know  why on that.  
 

He's never shown the slightest sign of violence towards me but we are in  the early stages of a relationship and I can tell he's completely  trying to portray himself as perfect for now.  He's also really trying  to rush things though, like he told me he loves me before we even met,  keeps making all these plans for us even though I haven't committed to  anything and whenever I back out of anything which is often because he  keeps pushing all this stuff on me while I'm trying to take it slow,  like for example we live in different states and he'll email me one day  trying to ""tell"" me he's coming to visit the next, even though I told  him I'm really into planning and don't like last minute stuff/surprises  so I'll tell him I need more notice than that, he basically throws an  online fit, sending me a flurry of emails going on and on about how I  need to be more cooperative and flexible, I try to respond rationally at  first but after so many emails I just start deleting without reading  and going on about my business until he finally calms down and accepts  that last-minute plans and demanding stuff from me won't work.  
 

Does this seem in any way possibly normal, or completely wrong, or??   I'm afraid if I keep dating him he'll keep acting cool while we're  together but then if I ever move in with him he might change.  He's  already told me he doesn't want me to work at all, he wants to be the  provider which sounds good to me, who wants to work?  LOL  I could have  my dream life of living way rural, growing and raising almost all our  food and I already know how to do almost all of that.  But I'm afraid it  might become a borderline hostage situation if he has control of all  the finances, if we combine everything together and I no longer have  income, I wouldn't really be able to just move out at that point.  His  dating site ad mentioned that he was looking for a submissive partner  and I'm not really that, not really dominant either, just want to be  equal.  I'm not worried about him physically hurting me because I'm  pretty tough, well-armed and have a couple large excellent guard dogs,  plus I'm in much better physical shape than this guy and if all else  fails I could easily outrun him.  If it turns out that this guy really  isn't at all abusive or controlling it would be an awesome opportunity  for me but if he is I might have a hard time getting out of the  situation.  He also wants to get married already even though we haven't  known each other 6 months.  
 

I have very few friends but already asked my two best, both male, all my  friends are male, one told me he sounds great, go for it, the other  told me I should keep going after that first friend who I am actually in  lust with but that's a completely different, long, confusing story that  has no good ending.  I know both of them want the best for me though.

The biggest problem is the church located on the property directly behind my house. They leave the back door open and amplify all sound to the point that my windows shake and have services 4 days a week starting at 7 pm. Between the services they also have band practice so the noise is constant. I have spoken to the police about this and they say they will send a patrol, but because this is a high crime area I doubt they have ever recieved a noise complaint. It's a Spanish church, so when I tried to call I wasnt able to speak with anyone.

91,"So the way my apartment works is there's 3 and 4 bedroom options but you basically just rent out 1 room and get 2-3 other random roommates (unless you plan ahead with someone.)

I don't really even see one of them but the one I do talk to on occasion planned on moving out and cancelled his lease. Well things didn't turn out the way he planned and now he's been living in the apartment (he broke into his bedroom after they locked it) without paying much in rent. I'm not sure how much but he did tell me they took his $1000 deposit and just doesn't have to pay as much each month until they find someone else to move in. It's been like this for almost a month now maybe three weeks but he also did give me money for my share of the utility bill last month. He's an ok guy, not the nicest man in the world but not too bad. I don't really even mind him living there but it doesn't really feel right letting him and not saying anything. And if I do say something and they kick him out he's probably gonna know I said something. So I don't know what to do. It doesn't feel right letting him stay but I also wanna be a nice guy and help him out.",11Nov2018,1
92,hi all! looking for different methods for fixing my reoccurring cystic acne. I went on the pill in HS for my acne and got an IUD when I went to college. The first time my acne became really bad and was cystic was freshman year of college and then it disappeared when I moved back to NC to continue school elsewhere. I mean completely GONE my face was SPOTLESS. I never broke out sophomore year and didn’t even have a scar left on my face. Literally I was glowing. Peak of my skin for sure. I didn’t realize my transformation until I had people left and right asking me how I had fixed it. I used curology and it worked really well for me so when my cystic acne came back now in my junior year of college I restarted my curology but I’m two months in and can’t see a difference whatsoever. If anything my face is more irritated. I’ve tried changing my skin care routine which didn’t help at all. I don’t really want to go to the dermatologist bc my insurance is ass so anything I can buy online is my preference. What has everybody done to get rid of their adult acne? I’m fucking tired of this.

94,"This is going to be a long one. I joined reddit a year ago with the intention of telling this story but I haven’t been able to get it out until now. It’s time. 

This story is about my marriage. For those of you that hang in there until the end, thank you! 

TLDR: 100% disabled veteran husband who developed a meth addiction, abusive mother in law, infertility that resulted in twins... this is my life with the man that is my person, my soulmate. And it’s killing me from the inside out. 

I (26F) met my husband (30M) when I was 16 years old. I had just left a very strict religion and was having a bit of a rebellious year. I met (we are going to call husband) Derick in a mall and immediately hit it off. He was everything I was not. Mysterious, older, carefree, experienced. I was done for. I guess you could say we “dated” for a month or so, until we attended a party together (my first) around St. Patrick’s day. To this as short and pertinent as possible, I am going to try to stick to main points. That night we ended up going for a walk to the near by park. We were met by a sheriff who ultimately decided I was too intoxicated to be released to anyone other then my mom and Derick was allowed to return to the party. My father found out Derick was 20, pressed charges for statutory rape, and forbid me from ever speaking to him again. I chose not to admit anything. I chose not to testify, and the case was dropped. I move towns to live with my father as punishment, and Derick ends up joining the Army. 

At the end of my senior year I had enlisted in the Air Force. Despite my fathers rules I had emailed Derick over the last few months, slowly rekindling a forbidden relationship that was addicting to let go of. Rebellion was so sweet. 

Derick deploys to Afghanistan in March of 2010 and I have a ship date of Jan 2011 for basic training. We Skyped regularly but kept things undefined for the sake of the situation. We had a great few months, until the month of October. I found out via his mother’s Facebook that he had been shot in Afghanistan. It was not good. It was very very bad. He was in a coma in Germany not expected to survive. I was a nobody to his family. I had no one to ask questions to.. no one to ask what the hell had happened... so I glued myself to the daily updates (public) his mom would make and waited. After 7 weeks in a coma he defied the odds of every surgeon and woke up. He was missing his entire right lung and the top two lobes of his left lung, but he was alive. They moved him to the states where he began what would be two years of recovery. Three weeks before I was scheduled to leave for basic training he flew home for the first time since being shot. I met him at the airport. Something strange happens when the person you’re supposed to be with is almost lost. I knew instantly. I felt a pain I had never felt learning he was shot. I felt scared that I’d lost my soul mate, and didn’t even know he was mine. The three weeks I had with him before leaving for basic were bliss. I hadn’t seen him in person since all those years ago but he still had the same effect on me at 112lbs and in a wheel chair. I was in love. 

Coincidentally, the hospital he was recovery at was in the same city as my basic training. I left for basic after three weeks together only to have him and his mother follow two days after I left to return to the hospital. I was granted special permission while in basic to see him because a month in, he was fight for his life. He was dying, and my mom, his mom, and him decided not to tell me so that I could focus. I only discovered how dire the situation was after not being able to get ahold of him during my weekly call home. He was my motivation. With every run. With every push up. Every challenge. I was pushing my hardest for the man I loved who was shot by some fuck hole terrorist. To say I excelled is an understatement. 

I graduated and spent my graduation weekend by his bedside instead of out celebrating like all the other Airmen. My tech school was also in the same city so I knew I had 4 months ahead with him. I spent the next 4 months by his side every second I could. Every weekend I spent $100 to take a cab from my base to the hospital. Eventually, he was stable enough to move from inpatient to outpatient, and lived in special barracks for wounded warriors. He would come see me every weekend. When I was allowed to leave during the week, we would spend all evening together until I had to return. 
I loved this man with every breath I had. As my graduation was approaching, we knew I’d get orders somewhere and I would have to leave. He asked me to marry him. His mother (whom was his caregiver this entire time) was furious. Basically a “who is this bitch coming to swoop in and take my son after I have watched him almost die twice.” It did not go well. A week later I received order for Italy, a two year assignment. We decided to get married in the chapel in the hospital basement 4 days before I was scheduled to get on a plane. 

The night before our “wedding” his mom sent me a Facebook message explaining to me that he didn’t love me. That I was taking advantage of him in his mental state, that he had cheated on me with another girl while he was home on leave for a brief time. She said some really horrible things that I haven’t ever been able to forget, knowing we were getting married in the morning. We went ahead with it anyway. No family present, even with her down the next corridor. 

I get in the plane to Italy, spend a month there, and get rerouted back to the previous city due to the fact that I was now married. I had to file a hardship reassignment to get there, but it worked. After a month apart I returned, now his wife and legal caregiver, with a whole mess of responsibilities at 19 years old. His mother, now VERY vocal of her dislike towards me, leaves back to our home-state. 

Over the next year I am by his side navigating his recovery while trying to fulfill my role in my job at my own base. We had appointments, therapy, PTSD counseling, hospitalizations, close calls, Percocet addictions, withdrawals, and all of the above over and over again for almost two years. I want to focus on this first sign of addiction for a moment. The military literally throws pain pills at wounded warriors. I didn’t doubt his pain, but his abuse of his medication was out of control. My first breaking point was the night of my own knee surgery. I was given a bottle of 30 the morning of, came home and took two, went to sleep for the next 12 hours, and woke up with 5 left. He had taken them all in an evening. The evening of my massive knee surgery. That one hit pretty hard. 

I decided I had to choose. My military career, or my husband. I was struggling to do both, and both called for my complete attention. So I left. I filed a hardship separation and was released the month after he was retired with a Purple Heart at 100% disabled. We moved back to our home state and started over, as civilians once again. We decided to have a real “ceremony” for our families, as a lot of people were upset at the way we went about getting married. We paid for everything. It was a nightmare. His mother/sister were rude as hell, making comments, not sitting next to my family, but the worse part.... the pictures we took that day were hung in her house... with my face covered. No one in his immediate family signed out guest book, no one said congratulations, and his sister refused my offer of peace to be a bridesmaid.   

Over the years it only got worse. His mom ended up telling me she only wrote that email the night before our hospital wedding to scare me away. I endured years of passive aggressive abuse while looking like the asshole wife because I pushed my husband to distance himself from her unless he could stand up for me. He went to counseling, took a year off from them, and ended up becoming a fake, facade of a family being nice to each other for about a year. Some months were okay, were I felt included, then something would happen and I’d be reminded why I would never fit in or be accepted by his family. 

We decided to have children four years ago and after a battle with infertility, gave birth two twins via IVF who were born severely premature. For a year this seemed to bring everyone together. Things were calm for the first time since we had gotten married, and I thought “this is it! This is where they move past their dislike and finally accept me.” I couldn’t have been more wrong. 

Two years ago I decided to go back to work after YEARS of being my husbands caregiver 24/7. After being a stay at home mom to twins on tops of that, everyone was alive. Every one was healthy, and it was my time to pursue the dreams I put on hold all those years ago. I was accepted into a law enforcement academy that was weeks long in another city. I had husbands support, and he had the support of my mom and his parents, I thought. Turns out, he couldn’t do it. He just simply couldn’t do it. The fear of being alone for the first time, the fear of loosing me to someone else, whatever his excuses were, caused him to pick up a needle and inject meth into his arm. I found out 8 days before I was supposed to leave that he was using. I had no idea. I didn’t know what to do. I called his mom who showed up to my house and promptly blamed me. After asking to speak to her son alone, I overheard her suggesting it was my fault that he was under so much pressure that he turned to drugs. I didn’t say a word to her that day about that. I just begged her to take care of him and watch him because I HAD to go to the academy. This was my shot and I was not giving it up for him, again. 

She did not watch out for him. He used drugs the entire time, unbeknownst to me. She didn’t look for signs, track marks, requests for money, or a babysitter. She chose to look the other way. I graduate and come home and he tells me that this was it. All he needed was to have me home. Now that I was home, he could stay sober. He made it a week until I came home on my first Friday to him injecting in our bathroom. I sent him to rehab the next morning, where he stayed for almost two months. During his rehab stay his mom blew his phone up, worried why she couldn’t get ahold of him, telling him she had $200 for him if she could have the twins for a day so her father could see them while he was in town. At my request, she was not told what facility he was in. She was not allowed to speak to him there, she was given no information other then he was in rehab, and he was alive. 

The year following rehab (which he completed successfully and is still sober from meth, but not weed) was rough. I was surrounded by flirty overwhelmingly male officers which was the perfect horrible distraction to the disaster that was my life. I was dead inside. I was hurt. I was lost. And I found solace in the attention of others. I dated. I cheated. I got caught by his sister.  

His sister told his mom she saw me holding hands and kissing another man. His sister was right. I had guilt, but not for the right reasons. I didn’t care. He destroyed our family and our marriage and I was angry. I didn’t care if he watched me fuck 15 people, if he wanted to be my husband he’d wait and deal with the pain. Wrong? Absolutely. But that was where my head was at. It’s very hard to explain. So, his family hates me even more then before because of what I have done, and no one gives a fuck what he has done. 

This coming March will mark two years sober. I have not seen or spoken to his mom at all. I can’t. Derick does I guess, but he knows I don’t like it and hides it most of the time, which makes me more mad. He has never stood up for me, never will, and his mom will always be a vindictive, lying, evil bitch. She recently asked for pictures from Halloween of our children and complained that she couldn’t find me on social media because I blocked her.... I have never blocked her. She in fact, blocked me. After showing my husband my blocked list, he chooses to say nothing to her because like every other issue over the last 8 years “it isn’t worth the argument.” 

So here I am, still married. Too afraid to leave because A) im too scared he will relapse. B) im too scared he will commit suicide. And C) because I literally can not picture my life with anyone else. I don’t want anyone else. I want the old him. He still lies. He still does nothing to contribute around the house besides watch the kiddos a few hours a day. I left law enforcement at his request in exchange for him giving up weed. I got a new job, he got a new weed dealer. Nothing has changed. We remain in the cycle. One where every other month I’m about to walk out the door, and I just can’t do it. I have no idea why. Even if he got his shit together, the topic of his mom and his refusal to stand up to her once and for all is enough for me to day dream about never having to deal with her again. I am at a complete loss of what to do. This is my family. This is the man that I have vowed to love in sickness and in health. The man who has chosen addiction over me three times now. The man who sat by my hospital bed day and night while I tried to stay pregnant to keep my babies alive. The man that shaved my legs for me when my stomach was too big. The man that takes hundreds of dollars behind my back and spend it on weed. The man who has no drive or passion. Who is content being retired for the rest of his life sitting on the couch playing video games. The man that gave me two beautiful children, whom he is a great dad to, aside from being a little too lenient in my opinion. 

This man is my person, and it’s literally killing my soul. ",11Nov2018,1
95,"I grew up in a household where my mom did meth and my brother didn’t really care about his future. 

I’m a straight A student and a senior in high school. Though my decent GPA, I’m going to community college next year for financial reasons (I’d get my first two years of college free). 

My boyfriend (20) and I grew up together throughout high school. He has a “big boy” salary job and we’ve decided to move in together to avoid me having to deal with this mess any longer. [My brother gets drunk and tries to beat me up for supposedly getting “more attention” as a child, and that’s just the start of it]. 

I need all the advice I can get from my fellow Redditors because they’re the only real parents I can accept having. 😂

96,"My mother was driving me to my school's financial aid office to drop off a document. We came up to a four way street. My mother was looking to her left. She thought traffic was only going one way. However, traffic was also going in the opposite direction. My mother wasn't looking on my side. My mother just kept riding while a bus was approaching on my side!

I told my mom, ""Mom watch out!"" and she quickly backed up in time. I'm so glad I was paying attention and looking on my side. Had I not been looking, that bus would've hit us and we both could've been killed. I definitely would've been killed because I would've took all the impact since the bus was coming on my side.

That was such a close call. My heart was beating so fast because my life and my mother's life could've ended.

People on the sidewalk were looking at us in shock after that happened because that could've been an ugly situation.

That incident keeps replaying in my head. How can I calm down and get over it?",11Nov2018,1
97,"My sister is an adult but she keeps taking my stuff without asking. We live in the same house so she can easily walk into my room and take things. 

I've gone through with her that I'm ok with her borrowing as long as she asks. She has said ok but still doesn't go through with it. I've found clothes in her room that I thought I had lost because she has taken them. She takes new clothing/shoes and returns them dirty. 

She's also one size larger than me so I'm concerned about her stretching out my clothes and shoes. Today she took my shoes (which have sentimental value for me) without asking. After I messaged her about it, all she said was ""ok sorry"". This is essentially how it goes down each time: She takes my stuff, I confront her, she apologises. 

She's also quite materialistic and owns/wears a lot of designer clothing which I ask and borrow from time to time (not often). As a result I think she thinks it's ok for her to take my things because she feels like the ""value"" that I get from borrowing her things is balanced out with her taking my stuff.

The only thing I can think of now is locking up my belongings and my room so that she can't take my stuff. Moving out is not a valid option for me as it would be at my expense. Wondering if anyone has experienced this before and what they've done to resolve the issue?

TL;dr My 22yo sister takes my clothes/shoes, often returning them dirty/damaged without asking to borrow. I've asked her multiple times to ask before borrowing but all she says is ""ok sorry"" and keeps taking my stuff. Don't know what else to do other than lock my stuff up.

98,"I'll try to keep this short, because I have a tendency to ramble. So me and my girlfriend have been in a long distance relationship for a year but these past few months I have just not been myself at all. I've been dealing with so much stress and pain. I also have a lot of problems coping with all of the things I have been going through and went through. I went through so much physical and emotional abuse when I was growing up and I still have trouble coping with all of it. The thing is though, is that failure to cope has caused me to just lash out. It's like I get so hurt and so frustrated and so upset that I just lose myself and just become a monster. You can probably see where this is going. I ended up lashing out at my girlfriend, more than once. I feel so guilty and horrible and have started getting much needed therapy. It eventually got to a point where she broke up with me a month ago because she couldn't handle the stress from it because she has also been abused her whole life. She couldn't handle being in a relationship and it broke my heart and hurt so bad. I pushed that pain aside and struggled through it and tried to stay her friend because she said she needed me and depended on me for a lot. Eventually though, with the pain of losing her combined with a lot of other things I snapped again. It's like I just lost myself in anger and pain. I said the most horrible of things and she kept telling me she still loved me and still needed me but I was too far gone and I kept being so mean and cruel. It's like I couldn't stop myself until the damage was done and she finally had enough. As soon as I snapped out of I honestly felt so guilty and horrible that I wanted to commit suicide. She trusted me to never hurt her and protect her heart but I betrayed that hurt and hurt her even more. She blocked me and called me a monster. I spent the past few days crying and just feeling so bad. I finally got a therapist and am trying to do better. She messaged me this morning and told me that in a few days she will unblock me and we can talk. She also said that she could never hate me. Me and her have shared so many beautiful times and moments together even from so far away and I love her with every fiber of my being. I know the chances of being with her are slim to none but I really want to make amends when we talk and be there for her as a friend if she will have me. I don't deserve it at all after all the things I've said and done, but all I can do is hope. How do I apologize? What's the best way to make amends? I hate myself so bad. I really do.

100,"My grandmother turned 90 this year. She lives alone, relies on social security, and generally has a sustainable, but perhaps somewhat poor quality of life. That's how I see it, anyway. 

Her eyesight isn't good. She has macular degeneration, and has trouble if things get ""out of whack"" around the house. Meaning, if things stick to the pattern she's used to, she's fine. But when something gets out of place, then she has to call for help from my dad (her son).

This is where it gets sticky.

My mom died unexpectedly in October. I returned home for a week (I live three hours away) and got to see how my grandmother is really quite a burden on those who have to deal with her, mainly my dad and my sister. My sister has grown tired of my grandmother, and finds her truly taxing to deal with. I know my dad feels that way as well.

I was cleaning out my mom's phone and found text messages to my cousin, who works as a social worker. Mom was asking about her about social workers, senior care, and what could be done around June. So, this line of thought that ""something needs to be done about grandma"" has been going on for awhile.

In talking with my dad, it doesn't sound like he's going to do anything soon about grandma. I'm not sure what I should do to help. My cousin had suggested to my mom that an anonymous call could be placed to get grandma evaluated to see if she isn't fit to be living alone. I'm not sure if I should make that call.

I'm really not sure what to do here. Should I intervene? Should I contact someone? I don't think my grandmother is living a good quality of life, but I don't like the thought of taking away what little independence she has.",11Nov2018,1
102,"I (23 f)need some advice on telling my mom I have a tattoo. It’s a well hidden spot (upper thigh) and I would never have to tell her about it but I know that I will eventually want more. 

A little background: I’ve had quite a bit of trauma in my life. The biggest being when I lost my father at 11. Most recently a divorce that forced me to move back home. I was always a pretty good kid. I didn’t have the best grades but I never did drugs or drank. I didn’t even start dating until I turned 18. I’m a fairly responsible and level headed person. I have a decent job for now although it doesn’t pay that great and will be going back to school next year. I’ve brought up getting a tattoo previously and she completely lost it and even went as far as saying I would look like a slut. I was 17 at the time and remember I never even dated until my freshman year of college. She also said that she would disown me and I would be out of the will. I’ve struggled with depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts previously and she knows this. I’ve just recently began seeking help and I think it’s working for me but part of me feels that she doesn’t truly love all of me since I have a tattoo and she hates them so much. 

The reason I want to tell her is because I know I will get more in the future and I just don’t like the idea of lying to her and keeping something that I enjoy so much from her even she doesn’t like it. I understand that this sounds very superficial and that I shouldn’t care about what other people think, but she’s my mom and I really just want to know that she loves me unconditionally.

103,"First time reddit post here, need some guidance. Sorry for the essay,  I need to get it off my chest. 

I'm at 22 year old female who graduated college in May, and and just moved to SoCal, where I got a job at an extremely well known tech company. 

The town I now live in is very small, popular with celebrities, and is basically paradise. There's sandy beaches, sunny skies, awesome bars and restaurants, and beautiful people everywhere you turn. 

My weekends are filled with oceanside drinks in the afternoon and parties in the evening.
 
On social media, it looks like I am living the dream. 

However, I feel as if my life is slowly turning into a subtle nightmare. 

My job, while cool to tell people about, is monotonous and stressful, and pays horribly for the location I'm living. I feel as if I have absolutely no positive impact on the world, and my post college dreams of making a difference are starting to dissolve. I need experience, so I feel pressured to stay at the job for at least a year. 

The people around me are nice, but all have addiction issues. Whether it's alcohol, cocaine or bad partners, there is addiction and negativity surrounding my circle.  

The town is close to LA, so the people look as ""LA"" as they can, i.e. super skinny, blonde as hell, with filled lips and unmoving foreheads. I'm a normal weight and body type, and I constantly get talked down to from men. One guy actually told me to ""dress more provocatively"" if I wanted a chance at a guy. My body image and confidence in my physical appearance have nosedived since coming here. 

I feel like this paradise is slowly making my life hell. I came here filled with dreams,  and am turning into a cynical, self conscious, broke, negative human who I don't want to be. 

I dont know what to do, or have any idea on how to reclaim my feeling of self again.

109,"So I dated a girl for a grand total of four years. We dated all throughout high school and she broke up with me right after I finished military basic training because she couldn’t do it. 

When she broke up with me, I attempted suicide. It was a very rash thing to do but I had spent the past four years, from 14-18, with this girl and now I was alone. When my attempt failed I called 911 and was taken to a hospital and counciled and all of that fun stuff. Once I got out, I went to mental health on the base for a month and I told them i knew what I did was a mistake and that I panicked. I was cleared to return to class where I finished out my technical training and went on to my first base.

I didn’t stop talking to this girl for 6 months. Then I made a friend who I went out partying with every weekend. Ya know, underage drinking and all that nonsense. 3 months pass and it stopped when I met this other girl who I clicked with right off the bat but we would get in arguments all the time but I didn’t care.

1 month passes and we talk about getting married. 2 more months and we do get married. All the while, we are still arguing but i don’t care because I want to be with her. Now 1 year has passed of us being married. Constantly bickering and clashing on every from money to who needs to do the dishes.

We went to therapy but i already knew how I felt. I was in a relationship for so long that once I was out of it I was lost. I used this poor woman to fill a hole in my heart and in my life. I knew the truth was that I didn’t love her.

We went to therapy and I expressed how I felt. (One of the hardest experiences in my life). Now we are in the process of a divorce and I’m glad to separate because it’s not fair for either of us to live like we are. The issue is that I’m still lost. I don’t know who I am if I don’t have someone else. I feel lonely and maybe even slightly depressed. I haven’t had anymore thoughts of suicide but I’m definitely not in the happiest state of mind.

My question is, How do I find myself? How do I gain this feeling of belonging or happiness? I don’t have many friends who aren’t from work and I’m 1400 miles from any family.

I was buying McDonald's on a kiosk and a guy approached me asking if I could buy him some food. I had a Monopoly coupon with me for free coffee, so I gave him that and he went away to get himself a coffee.


While I was waiting for my food, he seemed to be asking multiple people for food or money (I heard a guy explaining that he has a card that taps implying he had no change). Once I got my food I left and walked home.


Now I know I don't owe anybody money or food. I know I wasn't obligated to buy him food when he asked. But the whole walk home and while eating my food I felt guilty. I kept thinking, ""He wasn't asking you for money, he was asking you for food. Can you imagine how hungry he was to be asking people that.""


My conscience was killing me so I went back to the McDonald's and walked past a few times to see if he was still in there. He wasn't.


I have a reason/excuse as to why I didn't buy him food. My finances are tight seeing that my job ends within the week and won't have a job until later. But a hamburger or two would've been $5 or less. What kind of crap person doesn't help out someone in need?


Regardless of what people say, I will be carrying my guilt until I die for not helping someone in need. It'll be one of those things that I remember during a shower, before I go to sleep, doing my dishes, etc and have to make effort to de-stress.

112,"During conversation, I'll formulate what I want to say in my head almost instantaneously but it dissolves right in the middle of when I'm translating it for whoever I'm speaking to, or sometimes before I even start.

113,"DISCLAIMER: I don't want to offend anyone who's seriously had a dark past (death of parents/siblings, abusive parents, etc.) so I will state up front that this doesn't truly qualify as a dark past.

Background:
I was raised in a standard 4-person American family, fortunate enough to have a father, a mother, and a sibling. Both my parents are originally from India and came from religious families, so they had an arranged marriage after moving to the US. However, I'm not as religious as them and they are fine with that.
Unfortunately, conflict between them began when I was very young. They have been violently (verbally) arguing with each other over random issues for as long as I remember. One issue in particular that consistently caused conflict is that my dad thinks my mom isn't spending enough time with his mom (his dad died when I was 3, but my mom spent time with him while he was alive). As a result, he gets angry when my mom asks him to spend time with her parents and I am fairly certain that my mom's parents dislike him for that (or they have disliked him at some point for that reason). This frequent conflict is likely the buildup that leads to larger fights (loud, no name calling, but insults used). However, these fights were usually triggered by some stupid shit that means little on it's own. One time, when I was around 10, I tried having fun when they were fighting by staging it like a televised debate. At some point I lost hope and started crying and that's when they stopped fighting. They've done that around every 2-6 weeks ever since, maintaining that level of severity. More recently, my dad threatened to divorce my mom the day before they were dropping me off at college for the first time and they only stopped fighting when I cried about the possibility of not having one home to go back to during winter/summer break.
Now rewinding back to when I was in high school, I went to one of those hyper-competitive high schools where there's pretty cut throat competition get into the best college possible. I was really socially awkward and still am. So people there expected me to be one of those nerdy smart kids who gets shit done. My first year this didn't stress me out too much, but in my second year I failed a class people respected me for taking, and actually thought it meant I had no potential to accomplish anything in my life. When I talked to my parents they asked what was going on and I started crying and confessed to them I was suicidal due to the pressure from peers and them (mostly peers) to perform well. However, I overcame my suicidal thoughts for one more year until college admissions season. Everyone thought I was going to get into a great college in part because I lied to them about my grades to temporarily avoid their condescension. When admission decisions came out and I decided to go to a mid-tier state school, many people who I thought were truly my friends looked down on me. Even other students' parents, who you'd expect to be more mature, criticized me for the college I chose to attend. This condescension led to my second phase of suicidal thoughts and it was rough, but I made it through, knowing I wouldn't have to deal with this in college. Some people from my high school have been nicer recently (though not apologizing), but it doesn't change the impact this had on my life.
In college, I've been doing fine for the most part. However, sometimes my past causes me to do stupid things. To some extent, the competitive, aggressive environments I was raised in is causing me to lash out on my genuine college friends. For example, I have deceived them multiple times in the recent past either to compensate for something or to compete against them (both academically and otherwise). I'm fortunate enough to have forgiving friends so we are on good terms now, but I can't let this happen ever again.

124,"So I’m friends with this girl in my grade and we’ve been on very good terms with each other and have talked a lot for like two years and were getting to be closer friend over the past couple months but this past week she’s suddenly started ignoring me and generally acting cold. She’s done this before but only like for a day or two. 

I’m not quite sure why. I know the last actual conversation we had involved me mentioning my sexuality (I’m bi) which I thought she knew but she apparently didn’t. But I don’t think that’s it because she is pleasant to other people in our school that are more flamboyantly gay than I am.

During one of the first rehearsals, I met and connected with someone who I thought was pretty special. After our first show, she gave me a ride home and we talked about our lives and outer space (something I am really passionate about). We ended up parking in the parking lot of the YMCA and talked even more. I've never felt so close to someone that I felt butterflies in my stomach. This week, I asked her what she thought about dating. She brought up the fact that she doesn't really date people. I was a little disheartened but I respect what she wants to do.

Should I tell her how I feel? I'm worried that If I do, it might ruin our friendship. ",11Nov2018,1

In the last two years ive been raped by another man.

I have flashbacks 1000x a day on all of that stuff and I'm tired and can't take it anymore. I need a fucking way out!!!!

No one understands me (or so I think) and those intrusive thoughts that keep telling me that are growing every day. But people are mean to me every where I go. (Or so I think too) I understand that these may be my perception but it's getting hard. I never been to a physc ward. But lately I've been more suicidal then ever. And for the first time ever, I feel myself getting angry towards other people for no reason when I'm out and want to physically fight them. I've had a couple heated arguments today with random people and I realize that's a problem. It's gotten to the point where I hate the world. When it comes down to it, I don't think I'll ever hurt someone but myself but I'm scared on what to do. I can't afford a therapist...

Most places I’ve interviewed with really liked me. However I just don’t have the “relevant professional experience” and have been getting a hard time getting into what I want to do.

I would technically be the only other client service/customer success managers right hand man at a time of huge growth (recently gained couple hundred million in funding) and stated if i stay with the company it would be EASY for me to climb the ladder quick. Alternatively they also said since it’s a startup they give a lot of leeway in what responsibilities I want to take and can even work with the sales/ops team to develop skills as a business analyst.

I cannot ask my parents for any money as we are not a wealthy family and I may be able to borrow money from my friend who is off doing activities in Raglan/Waitomo etc until the 15th.

Anyway I’m really fucking scared I’m gonna he called to the office especiallly since I don’t know how he found out, am I fucked and could I get kicked out of honor society!",11Nov2018,1

So this post I've tried before and I need real advice on, as its still happening, so I have a strange Situation and as most of the internet knows, Reddit is a good place to go for that when real life friends aren't people you can turn to.

Basically my situation is with a friend, and it sucks, but here's the whole story. I've been in 2 relationships in my 16 years on this earth, which is a surprising thing as a junior. but one of those relationships lasted 2 years (and ruined my life for even a year after i ended it and is still continuing to do so) and another for 3 months (Which I'm still friends with the guy). It has now been 7 months or so since that last relationship and I'm in a way better place emotionally and physically. And also vowed never to be a first relationship for someone because of those 2. I also have in place ass I'm maturing to actually go on dates before you become ""Official"" because its kinda stupid to do it based on if you ""Like"" the person, and should get to know the person dating wise before becoming ""official""

That's pretty much the background of my problem. As now I am ready to start dating again. And someone has literally come smacking back face first into my life again. My history with this guy is that I have known him since 6th grade, and we've have entered and never fully exited each others lives. Its hard to explain our history. But its very strange, at some point in time we've both liked each other but have never been single at the same time. and there has always been that ***tension*** and there still is. And a couple months ago we reentered each others lives again after i invited him to my birthday party. There we shared some stuff that had happened there the tension was AGAIN. But at the time he was with his girlfriend and what I thought was a happy relationship. And she seemed nice and I personally liked her so I made sure nothing happened, as I respect her and would never do that to someone. (Cheating is truly awful) But we continued to talk more after that. And then a thing happened a couple weeks ago that made me question things. He called saying that him and his girlfriend were done, and that they were not good together and a lot of toxicity. And we talked about and gave him my shoulder to cry on, as we are still very good friends. And in these last few weeks we would hang out more and call for *hours*, one time we talked until 2 am. Yesterday I was hanging with his parents (They invited me over to bake cookies) and were talking about how nuts his ex was. And there was the tension again with it, the other day he mentioned that if we were in a relationship he would give my ex(the one that ruined my life) hell if she said anything again (because shes still harassing me). And the hypothetical ""If we were in a relationship"" talk shows up a lot in conversations. And we have moments, but I'm just not sure what to do. Should I go for it? Should I wait for him to make a move? Or should I just give up? I need help

Update: Week or so later. So recently I got told I was lactose intolerant and milk really bothers me. And since breaking up with his girlfriend he now sits with me in homeroom even though he knows one of my friends don't like him. (Cause shes in there as well) Anyways, one day I'm not wanting to eat my usual breakfast as its cereal with milk. And he notices and asks why I'm not eating, so I tell him why and then offer him my breakfast. To that he then gives me his muffin and INSISTS I eat. Then later during CAT he's hanging with all these girls and makes sure I'm looking over at some points, or I'll catch him looking at me.

187,"Alright, so let’s set this up. 
It is late spring of grade 8 and I’m in gym class playing dodgeball with my classmate when the substitute calls me to his office. 

So I am super hyper and happily go to meet him when he springs on me something along the lines of “Did you assault person x during this class ”.
Of course having done nothing I say no and he tells me to sit down and calls the office. Then tells me to visit the principle.

When talking the the principal I find that personal x had told the sub that i had touched her ass. The principal proceeds to interrogate for a good 15 minutes before letting me go back to the class.
Now here is when the real shit kick in. 

Person x continues to slander me for the following two and a bit years saying that I had done this. Even when I am taking my exams for the first time a grade 12 guy walks up to me and asked if I touched a girl in gym.

During normal conversations i usually listen or talk about things that recently happend to me or i've seen somewhere. Since i have a pretty uneventful life, that list isn't very long. So after some time, if there's an awkward silence i panic and start going through random stuff in my head i could talk about. Most of the time i just sit there awkwardly because i can't come with some relevant subject. So i guess my question is, what do you do when there's silence?

I also should add that, now, I am feeling much better and have joined groups for support, so that I never get that close again. That being said, I feel like I need to tell her what happened. She has responded very negatively in the past to other people saying they had planned something out and I need a way to tell her that won’t be blunt, but not sugarcoated either. 

I also need a way to tell my other friends, if I ever want to tell them. I’ve only told one friend of ours, which is her boyfriend, and he had no advice as he doesn’t know how to be gentle when it comes to explaining things like that.
Honestly, I have never been good with words, and I am very blunt by nature.  I’d really appreciate some help.

193,"An old friend of mine just lost her life in a double murder suicide over a family dispute. I have no idea how to handle this, and it feels like there is no one I can lean on. I'm young, just turned 20, and I've never experienced the loss of a loved one. 

She was my first friend in middle school. And she eventually turned into my first ever relationship. We had both come out of the closet for each other. Her family wasn't supportive of her being with another girl. We faced a lot of hardship together, mainly over the fact that we were gay. But we loved each other very much. Even after we had broken up, we still kept in contact. It wasnt until after graduation (about a year and a half ago) that we drifted apart. 

I found out that she passed away just a few days ago. Her and her sister, were shot by a family friend who then shot himself aswell. Finding out felt like a huge part of my heart had been ripped out. All I feel is a heavy saddness that has muted every other emotion. But I have yet to even cry. I cant sit still. I keep finding things to do so that I won't think about her. A few of our mutual friends have reached out, but there hasn't been any conversation that went passed, ""My condolences, I hope you're okay,"". 

The one person I thought I would be able to talk to about my emotions was my boyfriend of almost 3 years now. But everytime I bring it up he shuts the conversation down. He doesn't want to talk about her because she's my ex, and although he hasn't said it outright I think he is uncomfortable with the fact that I'm bisexual. I've been shoving all of my emotions down trying to not make him uncomfortable, but I lost it tonight. He picked a fight with me because I was giving him an additude. I was trying to put together an outfit for the candle light vigil happening tomorrow and he was so busy watching TV that he wouldn't even look at abything I put together. It escalated into a yelling match and he just called me a bitch and walked out.

I'll admit that I had an additude. And I've one for the past several days. I just thought he would understand how much inner tormoil I'm going through. Everytime I close my eyes all I can think about is her bleeding out on the ground. I haven't been able to sleep, I've hardly eaten, and anytime I've expressed an actual emotion it's upset someone. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle all of these emotions? I don't want to keep everything bottled up, but I also don't know how to manage them.

205,"Just some context before I get into it: I am a 19 year old guy who is a sophomore in college. I go to school pretty damn far from where I'm from so I only ever go home for the big time breaks.

This is all a long story so I'll do my best to keep it short. I've been really close friends with a girl since I was a sophomore in high school so roughly 4 years now. She is pretty attractive and I was a guy that didn't really get too much attention from girls so needless to say I developed feelings. 

She would tell me how she wanted to date but those statements were never followed up on even when I had made moves. From an outside standpoint, as I asked many of my friends and my sister as well, it seemed like she was taking advantage of me and leading me on. Many girls at my school saw her as a mean person but I ignored them all, including my close friends and sister, because I was in love with her and I trusted her. 

Every time I would try to convince myself that she doesn't actually want to date me she would say something or do something that would drag me right back into it. And over time this caused me to do whatever I could to get her to like me. I would buy her food, drive her places, pick her up from boys houses in the middle of the night, whatever she wanted I would do. Throughout our friendship or whatever this was she would say something or do something that would make me really mad and make me not talk to her for a few days. The problem was I became so used to talking to her every second of every day that once it was gone I felt an emptiness in my life. So I would always go to her and apologize and beg for her forgiveness.

Fast forward to today. A couple of days ago she said three things to me that are making me never want to talk to her again. These things being: 

""You can't handle anything in your life""

""If you hang out with *guy friend that I've been friends with for years* then I won't be hanging out with you at all""

And, when I got mad about those statements, ""This is you being nothing more than a piece of shit to me""

So for the last 3 or so days I have cut off all contact with her. But I can already feel myself going back to that emptiness and I'm worried that I'm gonna get on my knees again and beg for her forgiveness for something horrible she said to me. I know that this girl is bad to me but when I think of her I can only think of the good memories and I just forgive her for all the bad no matter how horrible it was. What can I do to keep myself from throwing myself back at her? As some added info, contact with her is inevitable as we are from the same very small town that when I go back on break it will be impossible not to see her.

I (19f) have secretly been dating my boyfriend (20m) for 8 months. This is because I have been told that I am not allowed to date. Three months into our relationship I attempted to tell my mother (single divorcee strong Christian) that I was dating and she completely flipped told me the guy was taking advantage of me wasn’t Christian and sex and alcohol is evil and that’s all he wants is sex she would not hear anything else. She was pissed off I hadn’t told her before but given her reaction I think you can see why. She took away my phone for 3 months and deleted and blocked his number. We secretly messaged each other using my other phone.

When I got back to college we spoke and decided we still want to carry on cos we love each other. For the past 2 months at college I’ve been seeing him secretly again however my mum is suspicious. She calls me every night asking who I’m with as well as every morning. 

This weekend was a massive mistake. I usually bring my bedsheets home to be washed so I had to. We’d had sex and so I washed them at uni to try and get the stains out thought they had come out but they hadn’t. My mum saw the stains and flipped again saying she’s praying for me and it to all end that she prays for his death, I cried. She said if I’ve been having sex she wants me out the house. I lied and said I didn’t know what the stains were. 

I feel so judged and dirty for the decision I made to lose my virginity to a guy I’m in a relationship with and feel that it’s wrong. Honestly the way things are going I really don’t know if I can put up with the conflict and lying this relationship if causing. 

The only reason I lie is to avoid the conflict that comes with telling the truth. My mum says she hates and doesn’t trust me anymore. I feel broken and confused child not the adult I’m supposed to be.

Please any advice on how to move forward should I tell my mum the truth? End the relationship? Help please.

211,"Bit of context;
So 2017 was an extremely tough year for me, And around july ish i met this guy who made everything a little less shit, he was so nice and help me beat my pill addiction and get through the other stuff (yes, yes, poor me wah wah). I really liked this guy, and me being the teenage girl that i am wanted to seem hiP and cOoL by listening to the same music as him, turns out his favourite band was this pretty lowkey band called “panuccis pizza”. Anyway it turned out i really really liked their music, and listening to it definitely help me get through that difficult period of my life. I also learned one of the guys was also part of another band called “Jank” which i also really liked. So i’m someone who relies heavily on music to dictate my emotions and these two bands really helped. 

Then one day i was googling what happened to panuccis pizza because they had broken up in ~2015 i think. and i found out that one of the guys, Lou Diamond allegedly sexually assaulted a 15 year old girl several times. Listening to some of the lines it kind of made sense (“the only girls who give me the time of day are far too young to realise the horrible mistake they’ve made”)

This really sucked to find out but it has conflicted me so much. On one hand, i don’t want to listen to a sexual predator or think highly of him, especially because i’ve been in the girls shoes before. But on the other hand his music helped me through one of the darkest points of my life. 

So this confliction keeps making me ask myself; am i a bad person for enjoying the work of a bad person?


TL;DR; Am i a bad person/ a hypocrite for enjoying and continuing to listen to the music of someone who allegedly sexually assaulted a 15 year old girl, when i have myself been sexually assaulted as a minor and think sexual predators are one of the worst kinds of people?

I’m currently at an awesome job (I absolutely love it so far), but all’s I’m doing is sitting... FOR 10 FUCKING HOURS.

I do light cardio: I walk to work but it’s only for 50 minutes TOPS.

I don’t really want to go to the gym because I have little time to get there, get a decent workout and go home; so for me, I think it’ll be a lot more efficient if I just buy a stationary bike.

I want to improve my cardio (I already do strength training program at home too which has been amazing).

So what are your thoughts? Is it worth it?

229,"Hi, this post is going to be long in order to get a full picture. I'm not sure if the community prefers more or summarized info. I looked at r/relationship_advice and it seemed like that was more for couples and less for those who are struggling to commit to relationships. If there is a more suited subreddit could you point me in the right direction? It probably belongs on get this off my chest but I'm more interested in getting some advice to put this part of my life behind me because I feel it is stopping me from ever being happy. Oh, and this is a burn account because I would like to keep this quite anonymous.

&amp;#x200B;

So my family moved when I was 16 to Europe from the USA and the culture shock was one of the hardest parts of day to day life. Just not having anyone to talk to in english was very hard considering I did not speak the language and could not fully grasp the social norms in that language for 2 years. So, when I went to school in this country all the classes were in another language and I just sat in class all day feeling like an idiot not knowing what they were talking about and most people in my class did not like me because I was a foreigner. So the first year my grades were really bad and I failed and had to repeat that school year but by the end I started to pick up on the language and understand more of my lessons but by that point I'd failed already so it did not really matter. The next year I worked really hard to get good grades and this attracted the attention of one girl, let's just call her Hermione. 

&amp;#x200B;

She asked for help on math homework and I would help her and she started to send me pictures of herself harmless at first but it escalated to more later on. I thought we were in a relationship but she had a very different idea of what was going on. We went to the movies and I had my first kiss with her (homeschooled in the south is not the best way to get action as a kid). I was really happy for awhile but when I kissed her at school on the cheek she looked... furious. I did not understand this but I figured she was just a private person and decided to leave it at that. Eventually, I got distracted in the relationship and when she asked for help on homework I could not always give her the right answer. I started to notice a change in her attitude towards me and eventually she would just get mad at me for no reason, and call me things like stupid and useless (I'm a chemical engineering student in honors differential equations, in retrospect it shouldn't sting but that wound left a scar). 

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, she started an argument about the refugee crisis saying something like this is so sad, and I agreed with her saying we should help people regardless of who they are or where they come from (verbatim. still believe that we should help refugees in camps. Like, in Syria and expand the worldwide effort to relocate them to safer areas). She called me racist and dumped me. I was surprised and hurt. I wanted to know what was wrong with me and what I did wrong to make it up to her. I texted her, no response. I texted her after waiting 3 days no response, we were in the same class and one day I went to her to ask her what was wrong and she ignored me. This drove me crazy because I was in one of the lowest points in my life and I just went a bit lower. Eventually I waited for her outside of school and asked her what was up and she ignored me and I just went home (hindsight that was really wrong and very stupid of me). I texted her and she said her dad was going to the principle to tell him I was stalking her. I went for a walk and considered killing myself seriously. I remember, how I googled the proper way to do it and I'll save you the details I cried a lot that day. 

&amp;#x200B;

The next day I just went to school and nothing happened I didn't talk to her or make eye contact with her for the rest of that school year. The next year she had another boyfriend who she kissed and made out with during the break at school. I told myself I didn't care to try and make myself numb to the pain. I left that school after taking the ACT and GED and went to university because I couldn't stand dealing with seeing that happen every day and put myself through that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm one year through university and I met a lot of nice girls but the truth is I am so numb I just can't open up to people and will self destruct and make fun of myself to let them know what kind of a loser I am in case they ever feel like I might be boyfriend material. For the distinct purpose of avoiding rejection. How do you move on and build confidence after all of this? Am I broken?

230,"So I have a roommate and we hardly see each other and hardly talk. All of our communication is through text. We have lived together for three months now and I have been the clean one. She constantly has messes and leaves her hair everywhere. She has unwrapped pads in the bathroom, toothpaste residue all over the sink and our shower doesn’t drain well because of her hair. There’s a ton of other little things that contribute to her having a mess but I’ll elaborate if someone asks. However, as of late, she’s been getting in the habit of messaging me whenever she’s upset(which she has the right to do of course). On Wednesday, she told me she couldn’t bake because I had dishes in the sink and asked if I could wash them. She knows I’m normally very good with my dishes but hey I wasn’t bothered if she needed me to wash them. When I was done washing them I told her I was done and asked her if she could remove her onions from the kitchen counter. Now these onions are CLEARLY spoiled and rotten. She’s had them since around the first of September. She didnt respond to my message although she definitely read it. She’s been home several times over the last few days and hasn’t taken care of them. I feel like she’s testing me because in the past I’ve just bit my tongue and cleaned after her as well. However, I am not understanding this response because since she’s been asking me, the cleaner of us, to clean more I figured she was opening up communication about the apartment. I want to handle the situation as delicately as possible because my food items are in the kitchen and I don’t want to do something petty and she retaliates(like putting the onions in her room because I’ve thought about it).

233,"My ex boyfriend and I became friends after our break up from 3-4 months ago. I make boundaries clear with him of course. I am honest and I always tell him when or what bothers me (about his actions). He's naturally a nice person but I feel like he talks to me too much. Whenever I tell him that I'll talk to him tomorrow, he gets upset and starts asking me why I don't wanna talk to him. I remind him that ""we are just friends so you shouldn't act like that."" He says he understands but continues to act up sometimes. 

The way he acts up: he bombards me with a lot of questions and assumptions that annoy me or spam me with texts or calls to get an answer out of me. When I tell him I don't need to explain myself, he gets annoyed and says I'm annoying for keeping something small from him. He's a great person but he just comes with a lot of luggage and I know his feelings are still there. He persists that he knows where he stands in our friendship but I feel like sometimes he's just too obsessive. If I leave him alone for a few hours, he gets very worried and texts me non stop until I answer. 

Am I just thinking too much or what? I know he has a great heart and he doesnt have bad intentions towards me but, sometimes his behavior can be too much to deal with. I always talk to him how I feel about what he does etc but I feel like no matter how many times I tell him to calm down, I think he'll just be the same.

236,"I'm way too emotional right now and filled with guilt, so I'm not sure I'll be perfectly clear. Also, English is not my native language. Sorry for the grammar in advance.

To give some context, I'm a 21-year-old male. Yesterday evening I went to a party with some friends, including my best friend (which is a woman). We tell each other everything that happens in our lives. And we both have been there for each other when something good or bad happened. Because of that, we never thought of being together. We haven't discussed that, but I always thought it was too much of a risk to try to date her. Our friendship should be bigger than any love relationship we had. And for now, it has been. Anyways, we went to the party, she just got off a one-year-long relationship and then, after some time dancing, I saw her kissing one of my other friends. I was took by surprise when I felt troubled for seeing that and it seemed to me that I was just fooling myself this entire time for having feelings for her.

I believe that was the sign that all the hope I hid (even from myself) about one day being together went to the ground (because it was with one my friends, that's a rule that I don't break - even though I'm pretty sure that was something without any commitment). It was a terrible surprise for my heart. A bad feeling got through me the moment I saw them kissing each other. Just as it was by surprise, it was also very unpleasant. I even told her once that when I really like someone I do everything in my power to not demonstrate it. Silly me, because I was the one who encouraged them to be together. I fell right in the fable I created to fool myself. Event worse,  it wasn't the first time in my life. They say when you make the mistake twice, it's for stupidness. I'm on search for my dunce cap to use in the corner of punishment that I myself grieve. I'm guilty for damaging a relationship as amazing as ours once were, for a dirty and selfish feeling. A mere caprice I had that wouldn't take us anywhere. I thought our friendship would be bigger than all of this. I realised that, because of me, it was more fragile than the glass of a cheap cup. In the silence of dawn, I curiously ask myself: ""how far have I gone to feed this illusion?"" I need to start looking out for the signs that in my life box say: ""careful, it's very fragile""; or ""strolling self-saboteur"". No-one deserves someone like that!

Anyways... I just want to not damage our relationship more than I already have. And I want to get over her so we can continue our relationship as friends without any other intentions hidden. Please, if you have any advice, give me. I'm affected with the guilt of having these feelings for someone I shouldn't have and it's consuming me.",11Nov2018,1

I am scheduled to graduate on time if I complete all my courses.  I already failed Algebra 2, and I just barely passed my Game Design course.

239,"There’s kind of a bunch of factors to this so i’m just going to explain it in a couple parts, TL;DR at the end 


Sleep;

The past few months i haven’t slept well, like, at all. It started when this kid at my school passed away, i didn’t know him but i took the friday off because i’m not good at comforting people so i figured it would be for the best. I stayed up late (4am ish) the Thursday night seeing as i was going to have a three day weekend. i slept in for a while the next day, as expected, but my sleep never really recovered which is unusual. I’ve never had trouble recovering from an all nighter but lately i fall asleep as soon as i get home from school (3:30 ish), skip dinner then wake up around 10:30pm, maybe fall asleep around 3am if i’m lucky, then wake up at 5am and just get ready for school. I thought maybe i was distressed about the guy from school, but i rarely think about it yet the restlesness persists. 

Health;
i feel sick everyday. It’s like the feeling you get in your insides when a plane gets turbulence, or when you go down suddenly on a roller coaster. Everytime i feel hungry, i go to eat something but i’m full after 3-4 bites. I’ve tried pregnancy tests, panadol, drinking more water, different food, different shower temperatures etc but it won’t go away. my S.O is telling me that i’m losing weight but i can’t see it because i always see myself as fat regardless. Sometimes it feels like i’m going to faint when i’m not even doing anything. and sometime it feels as though i’m freezing on the inside and burning on the outside. 

suicidal thoughts;
I’ve always had occasional suicidal thoughts. but this time it’s different. it used to be heat of the moment type stuff, like if i got in an argument with someone i’d freak out and want to hang myself. But now i don’t feel anything. Sometimes i just hear a normal song and think ‘this would be nice to kill myself to’, i think about slitting my wrists and filling the wounds with flower petals and bleeding out all over crisp white sheets. I’ll be doing a normal mundane task and my mind will just go to these places like, killing myself out of boredom. It’s mindless suicidal thoughts, almost like i’m casually suicidal, like i don’t have reasons for wanting to die it’s just kind of like it’s something to do just because. 

things going on in the world that scare me and make me feel upset and uncomfortable;
so incels are a pretty spicy topic. I by no means consider myself a feminist or a LiBtaRd or anything, but these incel dudes really get to me. But it’s not like how other people get annoyed about them or anything. Everytime i see an incel post (couple examples on r/niceguys) at first i think ‘that’s terrible how these awful men assume they deserve sex from young, beautiful, pure women’ but then i think ‘i wish i was someone they’d want’ i mean don’t get me wrong i am young (15 f) but i’d never consider myself beautiful or pure. i know it’s my own fault for being impure, losing my virginity young to a literal ‘chad’, dressing slutty, getting raped. But i just wish i was what these men want, even though i haven’t been rejected by a man like this or anything like that. There’s also all this stuff going on in the news that just makes me scared and upset. i just don’t want to be a girl. i wish i was born different. i wish i believed in a christian god, i wish i wasn’t a girl (i am cicgender female)  

ok this is more feeling like some kind of suicide note now so i guess TL;DR maybe i’ll finally do it? i don’t know i’m just so confused and nothing feels real. 

How was anyone even meant to give me advice on this when i didn’t even clearly state the problem or how i want help. i’m an idiot.

1. The work is mind numbing. It's been three months and I swear all I have done is copy pasting, formatting documents, adding figures in excel and the sad thing is that is all I will do if I stay here for most part of my career. 

2. The pay is low. Very low. Though I get paid in Indian rupees to give you guys a idea, my monthly pay is 297 USD. ( Shift is from 7 am to 4:30 pm or 8 am to 5:30/6:30/7:30 pm )

3. The ,total daily commute is anywhere between 3-5 hours depending on the traffic. 

4. Come January to March, They'll make is work 12 hours day without any extra pay. 

5. My health is suffering, I don't have any time for myself. Mentally and physically, I feel exhausted all the time. 

I am 21 and I have a bachelor's degree in commerce and after much research and thought. I want to have a career in financial planning. For the same I'm planning to move to Canada and settle there. I have found the the relevant courses that help me meet the  requirements for ""Certified financial planner"" designation. The problem is that session begins in September 2019. 

It's been three months here for me at EY and I have to serve a notice period of 1 month if I quit within 6 months. What I really want to do is quit and focus on my health and find a internship in a bank or the  financial services industry or give CFA level 1 exam this June and the rest in Canada. 

The only reason staying a year here is to get that EY brand on my CV but it's killing me. Please help. 

 I have talked to a lot of people. Some suggest to just keep going as 1 year will look good on my CV and help me in the future. But the thing is I don't want to work for a company like this. 

We are basically a KPO and EY USA team sends us the backend work. Needless to say, the work is just depressing.

244,"I ran into a thread on askreddit earlier about ""how to tell if you're ugly"" and it got me thinking about how I genuinely have no idea where I am because of the contradiction that has been my life. 

I'm not posting a pic of myself for privacy reasons but if I share my experience here I'm hoping you guys will be honest with me. To start this off, I have had strangers coming up to me telling me that I'm beautiful/asking if I'm a model/etc. in public for about 3 years now. It's normally at completely random times at a restaurant or in a store and it's almost always another woman asking. One time at a park someone told me I looked like Angelina Jolie. Another person Ive been compared to is Blake Lively. 2 people have come up to me while I was out in public asking if I'm a model in the past month. 

Now, here's the contradiction; Im a 19 year old (almost 20) who has never had a boyfriend. Ive never been catcalled or sexually harassed like almost every other girl my age has. I've been approached by maybe 7 guys my whole life and they were each really respectful about it. In college, I'm kind of ignored by the people in my classes. I'm almost kind of shunned by people among my age group, actually. I'm stared at, and then ignored. It hurts my feelings and makes me feel like something's wrong with me. A few months ago I was talking to a lady at work and she said passively that I must be so used to getting hit on all of the time. It took me by surprise because like I said, I've never really been hit on. Another day one of my coworkers came over to me and asked me about my experience with using plan b because she was worried about a slip up. She just assumed I had used it before. I've never even had my first kiss.

It's super confusing to have people say one thing to me, and then have my experience completely contradict it. Makes me feel like I'm going crazy.

Basically, I'm just confused about how I'm perceived by other people. Would you guys feel like I do if you were in my shoes or am I just dense? Sometimes I wonder if everyone who's ever complimented me was lying to me out of pity. ",11Nov2018,1

246,"Hey all,

I set up a blog for me to talk about my feelings and what I was going through when I was first diagnosed with PTSD. I’m in a relationship with a toxic person and at the moment the situation (which I don’t need or want to get into for the purpose of this post) means I can’t leave.

The toxic person has said I’m posting the blog posts for attention (when in reality talking like this has saved my life and also encouraged others to seek help because of my posts) and I live in a fantasy world. 

Tbh I’ve no idea what he means, as if I wanted to play pretend or live in a fantasy world I’d just go play The Sims. That’s by the by

My close friends think deleting the blog is a horrific idea given the work I’ve put into it. I’m also devastated over losing it, but if I don’t the relationship will continue to become more and more toxic. 

I want to keep the blog, but I don’t know how, to change the whole layout, name and so on would cost money as I’m pretty sure changing my site name would incur a charge. My old posts would also still be there so there is still the risk of said person realising it’s not dead and gone.

He has a protected VPN so it’s not like I can just block the IP and there’d be nothing to stop him finding it if he used another phone or computer.

You might think what I’m doing is shady, you might judge me, or think I’m ridiculous and I should just delete it. That’s fine, but you don’t know the full story so please don’t comment unless you know of an actual way of fixing this without being judgemental.

The site is a wordpress self hosted site, if that’s any help. ",11Nov2018,1

Everyone keeps telling me ""dont worry you're only 18"" but like, really? These same people are the ones that were able to get into relationships and sex way younger than me and when they tell me about it, it makes me all the more obligated to find a girl. 

The problem is, I'm terrible at talking to girls, at least in real life.

I always have been and I've never learnt how to do it properly. I always end up saying something stupid and never realize it, and then the girl that I was planning to ask out is turned off and wants nothing to do with me. It happens every single fucking time. Like honestly.

Every single one of my friends has gotten at least somewhere with another person, wheter they be male or female. On the other hand, I can't even get a girl to give me the slightest bit of interest.

Do you know what it's like to be in a constant state of panic and overwhelming doom barely able to get to out of bed, not eating right, not sleeping, no energy to even bathe for days? 


Why do they get to be happy and I don't? Am I suppose to just continue living in a constant state that's equal to being tortured without a break?

253,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

Yesterday, after a server of an all time favourite game of mine went live, I was so hyped to play. I got my ex's friends into it since they were fans of the game. They know an admin, and the admin was really nice to everyone. Including me. 

Thing is, through the day, we kept messaging each other. And the more tired I got, the more he flirted with me. We started talking about my past, and how I argued i was a bit broken after he vehemently opposed to the idea saying that ""you're pretty. And nice. You can't be broken."" 

Now? After yesterday, and some flirting from his side, he's acting like a boyfriend and is really clingy. He's guilt tripping me whenever I want to go do my things ""don't go, I'm lonely, don't leave me alone."" Etc. And I'm really worried. 

Are these red flags? I can't tell. It's a bit more than weird that under 24h he's acting like this. But I'm just wondering.

255,"My daughter from a previous relationship was born 10 years ago. The relationship I had with her ""father"" was abusive, I got out of there as fast as I could, and met my fiance a couple of months later. Everything has been fine with us since then minus usual relationship drama. 

My daughter's ""father's"" aunt, we will call her K, has always offered to help us from day one. Sometimes she took my daughter (and younger son, now 8) for the weekend or a couple days if I needed a break, since I was working two jobs or one job and doing school most of the time. You would think it was nice, having some free childcare. Now I just work full time and I have plenty of time for my kids. The couple still tries to see them frequently. 

They cut my child's bangs without asking me, and lied about it. I'm a hairdresser for fucks sake. They showed up at my house crying because there was some thing my daughter ""had"" to go to, and they pressured me into spending my last 20 dollars on it. Because who needs groceries, right? They went behind my back and conspired with my narcissistic grandparents. God knows what they think of me with all the toxicity and lies from them. They still show up unsolicited with food all the time, unhealthy stuff I don't even want. We are not a charity case at all. It gets worse. 

Years ago, when I was busy all the time, we were pushed uncomfortably to sign a letter saying they were able to help out with school activities. All well and good though. I never had a problem. Last year my son tells me about how K has shown up at the school without asking me, without teachers saying anything to me, whenever she wants. Bringing snacks to school, etc. Normally I would not be upset by this behavior, but I was infuriated that they did this in a shady way. And who knows what she was telling people at the school about me. I asked the office who gave them permission to come visit. Lo and behold, there's the letter we were forced into signing 8 years ago with a stamp that read 2017. 

Now two days ago I was ignoring texts from K's husband because I didn't feel like dealing with them. He called and texted, as he does every single week. I was having a horrible week with lots of 9 hour workdays and I didn't want to explain to him how I wanted to hang out with my own family this weekend, like every weekend. The relationship with these people is fucked anyways, I don't like talking to them and I'm worried they say some dumb shit about us to our kids because they always come home not acting right. 

Anyways, when my daughter got home from school Friday there was a fucking note on the door. She took a picture of it and sent it to me. It was a note from K's husband saying he stopped by and will be coming back around 8pm if I don't answer him. So I had to fucking text him.

I can't stand being forced to do things, even reply to a text. I grew up with toxic family and maybe I'm making too big of a deal about it but I want this relationship to be over. I'm not getting any support from my fiance other than him being visibly annoyed by the situation (or my bitching about it). I've told them before how they have hurt my feelings. They act like they haven't done anything wrong or they don't know what they did. I don't want toxic people around my kids, showing them that they can treat me however they want, if they are persistent enough. I want a peaceful Thanksgiving and Christmas and 2019 and forever after. I feel like I'm going to explode. What can I do?

257,"Hey so this guy I met a few months ago very clearly likes me, he's mentioned it a few times and asked me out. I've said no multiple times and clearly stated to him a few times that I'm not interested in a relationship and said ok (but then went on texting me anyways bc friends? I'm not sure). 

Anyways, this past month, like 4 pretty bad things have happened to him and every time he tells me and only me (aside from his family). And I'm not really comfortable with this because 1) I don't like him but he likes me and is giving all his emotional trust to me and 2) I was brought up in a very toxic family where everyone would tell me their problems and they would constantly whine nonstop about their problems and now I despise people who tell me their problems on a regular basis. For me it feels like he is trying to gain my attention/sympathy by telling me his problems, because that's what my family would do. Likely, he just wants some support and has no bad intentions, but I can't help but feel this way. 

I really try to be a nice person but I don't know how to deal with this situation. I don't like him, and I can't deal with my own problems let alone anybody else's.

While I didn't do amazingly in Physics and Math, I passed them with around 70-80 each, while a 99 in Program engineering. Where I live we have mandatory enlistment, and the year before the enlistment(12th grade) you do tests to try get into a unit that fits you. I passed a Program engineering test, and then had to wait for the interview, only to fail it, and by the time I had the answer it was too late to apply to any more tests, so my options were either to try my luck with what I get, or try postpone my enlistment. After school I was planning on getting a job, while trying to postpone my enlistment but couldn't because had a vacation 2 weeks after my final exam, and when I came back I decided it would be best to wait until I was 18(another 3 weeks), when I became 18 I tried to get a job, but since it was so close to holiday season where I live, I was told to wait until after the holiday season, after that I had to wait another two weeks because we went to my grandma's 80th birthday, and after that I was told my postponement request was denied, and thus I could no longer look for a job, as I only had 2 months~ until I enlist. Note that by then all my friends are already in the army/working, so I am basically alone all the time.

Right now I feel empty. I feel bored, I no longer really enjoy anything, If I watch a show I find myself looking at my phone while doing so, I started jogging around the end of august, but can no longer do so, or any for of fitness because I had an operation last week, I find no satisfaction in almost anything I do, and basically feel like I am just trying to pass my time onto the next stage of my life. Up until now everytime I felt I was doing nothing important, I would try think that its fine as long as I enjoy myself, that there is nothing to life beyond what I make of it. But now I just can do anything to convince myself, I find myself looking forwards to the army, so I can meet new people, have a new beginning, maybe find a girl who I like and will like me back. In total I feel useless right now, empty. What should I do?

Basically, this guy and I have been talking on and off since high school. We keep going back to each other, but nothing really materializes because one of us always seems to “push back” and we go through a period of not talking, only to resume talking.

Anyway, in October he sent me this obvious romantic interest text, which I didn’t respond to. Then I said “hey you’re sending me mixed signals” and he said that he was “drunk.” I don’t buy it at all cause he’s said similar things to me sober. He then said we can talk about it in December, unless I’m in the area. 

I told him I’m in the area about a month later and asked if he’s around. He responded instantly and said “maybe but he might need to work.” I waited 13 hours before responding (not because it’s a game, I just didn’t know how to respond). I said “you told me to let you know when I’m in the area... lmk.”

I did that and he never “let me know.” So now I have no idea how to approach the situation. I believe he was working last night (got info from social media that suggests so), but people were saying it was rude he didn’t let me know? I didn’t think so because it’s gonna be a difficult conversation and neither of us are great about talking openly about our feelings... but I feel as if it’s something we gotta do.

- don’t say anything 
- call him out on it and say he should’ve let you know
- ask if December is still an option 
- try contacting him with things unrelated to December

272,"My partner and I dated for about a year. The first time we had sex, she told me I needed to put on a condom because if she got pregnant she was keeping it. Over time as we got to know each other better, we stopped using condoms. She was on an oral contraceptive.

A few months ago she told me she was going to stop taking her oral contraceptive and she was going to switch to a fertility tracker because her OC’s all made her sick and she didn’t want to have a surgery. I told her that didn’t make me feel comfortable and she insisted we started using condoms again if that didn’t make me comfortable. When I insisted that getting an IUD was reversible and they made non-hormonal ones, she told me I could get a vasectomy because that was reversible and wouldn’t make my periods far more intense.

I trusted her to make the right choice and I didn’t use the condoms because she seemed sure this method would work. Despite me bringing up all the possibilities (what if you miss a temp one morning, what if you don’t sleep well, etc).

It took one month before she was pregnant. We were in the middle of a breakup when it happened, but I’ve been to the doctors visits and with the timeline, there is no question that it is mine.

We’re both pro choice, but she wants to keep it. She says she loves it already. She tells me that she’s not trying to punish me, but I knew the consequences when we started having unprotected sex. I feel like she’s blaming me and acting like we have no say in the matter now that we are here.

Everybody wants to talk about equal rights, well what about my right as a parent? How do I get her to see that even though it’s her carrying this baby it’s me who is the parent afterwards? I can’t raise a kid, no matter how much I love it I know I’ll be a dead beat dad and my kid will be just as fucked up as me. This is literally my whole life that is about to change all because I don’t have a say in the matter.

Her counter to that is that I don’t have to be a parent. She insists that it’s her right to be a parent to this baby and it’s my right to be a parent to this baby. She has he choice to have it or not and I have the choice to be there for the kid or not. She won’t ask for money or support or shared custody, she just wants me to be as involved as I feel like it. How do I get her to see that if she has this kid I will have no choice? That I’ll have to be there and I won’t do a good enough job and our kid will be fucked up and I’ll hate her forever?

Sure I met people but I wasn't really invited to as many events as others. My study groups have kept in touch with each other, texting etc, but way less with me. 

I have spent a lot of time overthinking this only to realise that this is why they didn't want to spend more time with me. My anxiety and overthinking is not very charming.  Instead of socialising properly, I ended up not engaging with them or being fun. I think because of this I seemed boring.

I am slowly trying to fix it, with new people at least. I am trying to not talk about my problems too much and ask them more about themselves. My question is:

You know, I put my all into people, and I expect the same In return, maybe it's greedy but that's just how I am. I expect loyalty in return. I'm not going out of my way for her.

My friend that she broke up with, doesn't really trust me anymore. Because I feel like he doesn't want me and her to argue or have conflict, but he's not the reason why I cannot stand her anymore. I don't know what to Do, he's pushing his feelings aside for her, and she's for sure not doing the same for him. 

Should I confront her in real life?
I feel like there's nothing more to discuss though, it'll just make things worse. 
Or should I just not go out of my way for her, but still remain nice to her if she talks to me. 
I mean if someone really wants to talk to you, they would make the effort to do so.

276,"I don't know what much to say. I can only say that I'm kind of put off / hurt by this shockingly blunt insult to my social skills by one of my friends 🤔🤔🤔

It has got me feeling really wary about what other people think about me, and if I should act a certain way etc in order to be a better conversationalist (?) I'm not sure if this description makes sense. 

But yeah, basically, this started to make me worry about being a poor conversationalist. Am I overthinking this? I think I constantly worry about not being ""good enough"" for others as well. I know many people struggle with this horrible inner self-critic and crippling self-esteem so I don't think there's a need to elaborate on this part (?) But yeah. I'm still learning to trust myself more but I don't know how seriously to take my friend's advice and work on it as ""self-improvement"".

The reason why she started to call me a bad conversationalist in the first place, was because I shown her some screenshots of my conversation with my crush. Then she gave me a general observation that I kill conversations pretty easily which I feel is quite troubling. What do you all think? 😅

Well I didn’t forget my nieces this year because it’s a very easy date so I got all her presents ready. I was expecting a reminder text, but I got nothing.   

Today is her birthday. Every year my sister has sent out a mass txt letting everyone know what they’re plans are for the day and when people should come over.   

I didn’t get a txt so at 1pm I txted her asking when she wanted presents to be brought over.   

She said everyone was already there and to come when I want. Everyone aswell. My mum, dad, sisters, the boyfriends family etc.    

Am I right to feel off about this? I feel my sister expected me to forgot so just didn’t bother, didn’t invite me and knowing my sister was getting ready to cause drama if I had forgotten. But why be so spiteful just text me?    

I told her I’d drop the stuff off later but I don’t know what to do now. I just wanna stay at home. I rarely see my niece anyways, she won’t even notice and I’ll just give the presents to my mum to drop off another time.

278," I had something odd happen. I parallel parked my car as I do very single day. I’m not bad at it and I can fit in small spots after years of practice. I was walking away from my car when I got a text from an unknown number asking “Are you XX?” (My name). I’ve had this happen once before from a friend I had deleted their number years before. So I answered yes. Thinking maybe they had seen me.   Then they asked if I were in XX town. So I asked who is this? To which they sent a photo (that never came through, it just says IMG 5274) and said you hit our car while parking. 1- I did not hit any car. Yes, my bumper was touching theirs because they were pulled into the white lines of my spot and it was a tight fit 2- they never told me who they were 3-there was no note or cops or anything when I got back to my car. 

Is this an old friend that I didn’t keep their number and thought they’d be funny? Or does someone really think I hit them and got my name and phone number through my license plate?

I haven’t responded because i know that I didn’t hit anyone. But it really bugs me that my phone won’t load the photo. Not sure what to do at this point. I’m having a hard time letting it go, because I’d really want to know if someone thinks I cause damage. ",11Nov2018,1

280,"Just for some background info I’m 16/junior in high school. 
I’ve always loved playing basketball ever since I was 8, I’ve done basketball camps, clinics, club basketball, you get the idea. It has always been one of my favorite sports- until high school. I made the varsity team at my school, and I was excited to improve and play. But my coach made my life a living hell. Yes, she gives some constructive criticism. But 9/10 times she is mentally abusive. She makes fun of the way I talk, yells at us for not memorizing plays within a given practice from all positions (something nearly impossible to do), and overall very critical over every single thing we do - and she makes sure to announce our mistakes to everyone while putting us down. Her number one priority is to win, but we have never been a very good team (we only win several games out of a 20ish game season), and that just makes her more angry at us, even if we put 100% effort into everything. During the winter season, I’m usually so hurt by what she says during practice that I cry when I get home, or can’t think straight by what insensible things she’s told me. 

I am not the only person to think this way. The majority of the team knows she’s too demanding of us, but we are all too scared to go talk with her/about her with the fear that she’d still remain coach and just be even more mad at us. 

Sorry for the long post, but what should I do? I love basketball, my dad wants me to do basketball, but it’s my junior year and I don’t know if I can take her constant criticism for three hours a day and still stay focused on my studies without being mentally drained.

281,"My boyfriend have been together for a few years, since the beginning he has known I have been with girls and identify as bi. I am now with him, and feel no interest being with girls, or anyone else, besides him. He keeps mentioning that he would be okay with me kissing girls, and potentially having sex with them, because he wants me to “have fun and experiment”. This honestly makes me a bit sick, cause when I asked “What if it was a guy?” He freaks out and says “No that is cheating!”. I feel as if the “have fun and experiment” isn’t for me, but for him, for his fetish....

We had this issue a few years back, when he kept trying to convince me to have a threesome with a girl. I kept saying no, cause it made me really uncomfortable. To make him understand how I felt, I said; “What if we had a threesome, and I invited a man?” And he told me to never do that and that he thought it was gross.

He keeps asking me what I think of girls, if I would “do them” or if I would be interested in having a threesome with them.

I am kind over this, because I feel like he sees my sexuality as an opportunity to pleasure himself or live his own sexual fantasies and it is so fucking weird to me. 
I don’t want to have sex with anyone else, I don’t want to be in a relationship with anyone else, I want to be with him and not involve anyone in our sex life. How do I REALLY make this clear to him? Cause the “No, this makes me uncomfortable” doesn’t seem to be working.

I like to flirt with people and dress a certain way but for me I really only want to sleep with people I really like and trust and I haven’t met that person yet. I’ve been made fun of in the past for being a virgin so I just lied about it. I became a little sexually educated and make jokes about that so people tend to joke and say that I must be experienced so I just took on that persona and I don’t like it. I have a bad habit of trying to fit in and be exactly who people think I am and who they want me to be. 
I’ve also had people try to force themselves on me and then yell at me and call me a prude for not going along with it. 
So during the game I sort of half jokingly said that I slept with 5 people including my previous two boyfriends (my previous boyfriends were emotionally and physically abusive) and they all completely believed me. I know it was a terrible move but I panicked. Now I’ve gotten really close with one of the friends and I feel really bad for lying and I don’t know if I should come clean or just ignore it and not talk about it. Is there a way I could just be like “yeah it’s less than 5” without sounding like a terrible person for lying?

Today i took the plunge and called my dad and had a proper conversation ever. I hung up just now and I need someone with a clear head to tell me what i need to say/think.

1. I called him and straight up asked him why he didn't pay the child support (£15/week) when he was asked to by the government agency.

\- He said that he has been sending more than that per week (£25) and he deposits it into her account)

\- My mum says that he hasn't paid a penny

2. I used to go over to his apartment to sleep over sometimes and he would pick me up from school occasionally. I can barely remember how many times though. The last time i remember meeting him properly was when i was about 7.

\- Mum says that she could count the number of times on one hand. Then he just stopped coming

\- Dad says that they were cool until i was around 9, then she just said that he wouldn't be able to see me any more (he said something about her being upset that he had a new gf)

3. He said that he would send me things all the time and that he has receipts as proof. The only thing he mentioned was a laptop I got for my birthday. I asked him when he sent it and he said when i was 13 or 14.

\- My mother did give my this laptop for my 13th birthday but she never said it was from him. I never assumed it was from him either.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to think or to feel. my mother is in her early 30s according to ancestry.com , He's in his 50s or 60s (I cant remember if it said 1958 or 68) That means he would have been in his 30s when my mother got pregnant when she was 15) she's told me of all the horrible things he did to her and things he did to other girls younger than she was.

I feel sick and disgusting for even questioning her story. She's been nothing but a kind and loving mother to me.

How does he know about the laptop? I told him if he's really been sending the money to her then he can start sending it to my bank account directly. Now i'm agonising over whether or not so send him the bank details.

should I tell my mum? She's said that she has ptsd flashbacks and nightmares when she is reminded of him. How would she feel if i start interrogating her about her story? 

&amp;#x200B;

He told me i was his first child and that he loved me and always thinks about me. I feel so manipulated and sick for not even raising my voice to him. After all these years and all the things i've heard about him I couldn't even pretend to sound hurt or angry?

305,"I'm turning 18 in 5 days, and yesterday I decided to tell my parents that I'm planning to get lip piercings, which I've dreamed about for a long time, but they would never consent and soon I can consent for myself. Best-case for me was they wouldn't like it but wouldn't try to stop me, and worst-case was that they'd threaten me with decreased financial support. However, I received worse than the worst case.

My mom said that I can't do it at all. I was a little flabbergasted since I didn't expect them to just say no. She basically said, I'm paraphrasing, that I should expect to completely live by their rules until I don't need support from them. So that seems to me that I'm under their control, even in stupid things like that I want a piercing. I want to be able to make my own decisions without needing their constant approval. (I'm also scared they'd kick me out of the house/take my money then if I did get piercings anyway.) I feel like I’m mature enough to make my own decisions...or at least I feel like I’m becoming an adult, not that I’m still a kid like my friends who are 18 feel.

The obvious answer to achieve that is to move out, but this is impossible at the moment for many reasons: 

1. I do have a job where I make $210 a week, but apartments around my rich town cost upwards of $2,000 a month. I still go to high school, so I can't leave until I graduate at the least. Also, I would become very unhappy if I had my entire paycheck go towards rent.

2. I'm very dependant on their medical insurance. I have a recurring issue with earwax impaction so I have to see an ENT monthly, I see a therapist weekly, and most importantly, I give myself testosterone injections and have upcoming top surgery (I'm ftm).

3. I have severe financial anxiety when it comes to college. Housing at a college either means going to a university with a subpar computer science program which I will NOT do under any circumstance (my community college, for example, says PHP is a modern programming language and Central doesn't offer web dev. concentration) or going to an expensive college. My mom is holding the fact over my head that I'm using my college fund, meaning to her that they're paying for college, as part of my dependance on them, so now I have a new dimension of anxiety about paying for college.

4. I got my driver's license about 4 months ago, and I still have a lot of driving anxiety. I don’t think I can go buy my own car right now (I use the car my parents lend to me) when I can't drive confidently yet.

5. Most importantly, I don't have the mental stability right now to live on my own. The added stress of having to move out would kill me inside, and I'm already constantly stressed because of 2 very hard AP classes and a job for 3:30 hours after school every day Tuesday through Friday, along with other things like my inadequacy, college admissions, and my parents' alcoholism. I can feel it straining my brain 24/7, and my depression and anxiety are coming back. I don't know when my brain is going to break down.

The argument today overall let me know that anything my parents ""don't support"" won't be happening while I'm dependant on them, and I feel crushed. I already keep a lot of things hidden from them, and I still won't be able to open up. And it makes me think...what if my transition was one of the things they ""don't support""? It used to be, in my middle highschool years of extreme depression...but that's another topic that's thankfully done with.

Can anyone offer some help or at least sympathy? Extreme answers like “you live with them and need to always listen to what they say” or on the opposite site “wow your parents suck” are not helpful.

310,"This might be a bit long but,

I turn 18 very soon and I feel like my parents, because of their overprotective and strict behaviour, are wasting my life.

They just don't understand the fact that I am growing up and can be totally responsible for my own actions. They also have a really stubborn mindset and follow the society's customs and traditions which I consider very stupid. In addition to all that, I am not a religious person unlike them, and so I am not allowed to just be myself and free. I just have totally different thoughts and beliefs.

There is nearly nothing that can be discussed without it going their own way by force, obligation, and loud voices. If there's something we are different about, they think they're always right and know the right thing to be done.

Also, they think the only way to be completely out of their control is to be married and ""get to have a husband to be responsible for me"". So basically I can't be fully responsible for myself. But what if I don't want to get married anyways? What if I don't find someone suitable? Will I live with them forever like this? That's of course beside the fact that they only believe in arranged marriage which isn't my style at all.

My love for them decreases plus my bad thoughts of them and that makes me feel guilty.. if it's not my parents themselves who make me feel so.

I can't blame my mom for being anxious and stuff, but it's really overwhelming and she considers it normal to be so anxious about me and my brother (she thinks it's normal worrying) and due to her being anxious, it made me anxious too! She always thinks the minor of things are bad for us and so we get to avoid a lot of things, for instance: eating anything made outside of our home and taking new medicine pills. I never even got the chance to sleep over at any of my friends' houses. I actually never got the chance to do a lot of simple, basic stuff that all teenagers did at some point of their lives. I feel like I am always behind everyone.

That's not to mention the fact that my parents also lack some love for one another. Like they are just still married out of duty.

I feel so stuck and helpless and they have no idea how it affects me negatively. I literally tried everything and it all ends in not solving the problem. I feel like the only thing to do is to accept everything the way it is or just be depressed.",11Nov2018,1
311,"I'm looking for cool t-shirts/hoodies (and maybe clips and pins for my bags), especially about my favorite video games (Doom, Fallout, Overwatch, Starcraft, Binding of Isaac) and artists (Slayer, Metallica, Rammstein, Gorillaz and some others artists you probably don't know about).

I always bought shirts at ""normal"" stores, so I started by checking some official websites and :

\-Bethesda asks for 9€ of shipping, and Blizzard 5€, so except if I buy 2 or 3 shirts there will be an additional price

\-except for logo shirts, I don't like the designs of the official sites

&amp;#x200B;

So I was wondering if there was unofficial stores that would buy cheaper and/or with less shipping fees and/or better art than the official sites.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I live in Lille which is a big french city, so there must be at least one geek store I could check out. But I don't think it would have shirts about some specific things I like, and there is always more choice on the internet.

&amp;#x200B;

So what is the best option ? Buy the official shirts ? Look for unofficial shirts ? Go check the stores of my city ?

For now I'll keep checking official stores, but I'd like to have additional advice from people who know better than me.",11Nov2018,1

So pretty much since I was 10 years old my entire life was school, family, and gaming. I spent hours upon hours switching from game to game over the years. As I've gotten older  (21 now) It has finally dawned upon me that my normal routine doesn't make me happy anymore. I would almost say my gaming has become and addiction. I've lost multiple real life friends over it. It didn't bother me too much, because I'd always have my online friends, right? I was always the replaceable friend in my normal day to day life so as long as I had SOMEONE to talk to, everything would be okay right?   
I'm currently extremely unhappy in my everyday life. I have no friends (real life, and online), the games I used to play all day everyday on my days off don't make me happy anymore. I've been single for about 8 months now and with not having any friends, things get rather lonely... My dad has been getting on my case about getting myself out there and whatnot. The only time I'm rather sociable is when I'm at work, because I have to be. I work in a high end salon so it's not like I can really meet anyone there... Everyone that comes in is usually 40+ years old and I feel like trying to find friends within clients would be rather weird.   
I've never had a talent. My parents worked all the time when I was growing up so I really didn't have any hobbies except for gaming... Nothing else interested me. I grew into this very unhealthy habit of spending hours, even days locked up in my room, eating junk food out of boredom and gaming. I've gained a lot of weight over the years because of it. I'll go to the gym and be motivated for like a week and then go back to my same old routine and most likely gain more weight.   
Online dating... sucks. I don't know if it's because I'm overweight, or if I'm just disinterested. I think I'm decently attractive other than my extra weight. The people I end up talking to just end up becoming meaningless conversation. I feel like nothing is genuine anymore. I just don't know what I'm doing with my life anymore. I'm unhappy with myself, and my life. I'm sick of being so lonely. I don't know what to do anymore.

319,"Tl;dr Do I tell my sister before I gift her money?

My sister is in a financially challenged situation because she had to stop working due to my nephew with Cerebral Palsy. 

(Cerebral Palsy is a group of permanent movement disorders that appear in early childhood.)
Thank you Wiki.

Also with some early signs of minor brain damages due to lack of oxygen at birth.

My sister has always been a role model to me. Things started to get rough soon after my amazing nephew was born and suddenly the cart was rolling full speed downhill. It’s been a long war back and forth between her and Board of Health in her local community. Withheld information from a corrupt Doctor in Charge at a hospital (he’s retiring) and more questions about my nephews condition than answers. It’s only recently that they’ve gotten A LOT of aid from a small independent company-fund who aim to help kids with Cerebral Palsy. She’s also getting help from a professional nanny who works with special needs kids that will take my nephew off my sisters hands for a couple of hours a week.

I want to help my sister. She’s not without money but she has always been able to sustain herself through her own work, but no longer can because of the full time work that is my nephew (plus my youngest newphew) this really breaks her heart and makes her incredibly sad. The way I understand her situation is that she’ll start working soon but with limited hours. 

My sister is still my role model. God. She’s a role model for every hard working mother out there.

I’m not rich. I’m actually close to poor but currently building a savings account. I want to be here for her as she has always been here for me. I have never gifted anything to my sister close to serious value and I’m afraid she might take it as an insult rather than an open hand.

Ex in question is a narcissist and a womaniser, I was with him only a few months - between leading me on (TBH when I found out what he really wanted I tried to convince myself I could cope with being casual), gaslighting, using me as a hookup. I am hooked on this guy and I don't know why, I'm a serial monogamist and normally wouldn't fall for fuckboys. 

I cut him off a while ago...but let him in again, just for him to show he's a douche again...he was blocked, I'd seen him a few times in town and he didn't try to approach me so I was 'free' of him. 

He swiped right on Tinder and messaged me. For me to give him an 'in' by swiping right was a really stupid thing to do, but part of me is still trying to convince myself that maybe I got him wrong or maybe I can just be casual to get my sexual needs met for now. It's clear he's looking for sex, and I'm apparently considering starting something with him again. 

Not sure how to run damage control to protect my heart, or sanity as I predict I'd feel like a constant power trip for him and he may go along with this then reject me as payback for my blocking him last year, if I attempt something casual with him.

I haven’t showered for a while, and zu hate showering so much because you have to be in so much contact with your body. And all that.

I read the conversation she had in the chat with some other guys from the server. The server is filled with guys and there is a really small amount of girls. Probably only 3. From what I have read I don’t think the guys know what to do here. I don’t know either. The conversation went like:

The guys talking about how skinny another guy from the server is.

The girl telling them she is fat.

One guy denied because she probably has sent pictures to the server before and she’s probably the only one who believes she is fat.

Her repeating she is fat over and over again.

Other guys didn’t know what to do.

One guy request her to send a picture so they can tell her if she is fat or not.

I have tried a few different things to help her, i tried reminding her occaisionally then often to keep looking for another job or driving lessons and she says that she uses this app called ""Indeed"" to try and get a job and I keep telling her that she needs to call places that she wants to work, that I can drive her to places again to pick up applications and she says that they already have her application from July.

330,"Hello everyone.

I am currently a collage student and I feel really strange about the practice my teacher is using.
Here is a little backstory :

New teacher came to my school recently .
He started teaching us programming in C.
I was pretty excited because I already was programming some really simple stuff just for fun before and I wanted to improve myself.

Here is the catch...

Instead of learning by our own mistakes and by practice , we are forced to take Paper and pencil at start of the every class and start writing the whole c program on paper. After we are done he take our papers and basically search for every mistake we did there. If it isn't exactly correct by syntax you get worse mark.  .

We have no access to computer or Internet during this Exam he invented as his practic.

I believe programming should be done on Computer with proper compiler or maybe even with internet access because it's really pointless and probably close to imposible to remember everything.

Every one of us have public school computer that is built for programming in front of us. 


Do I have too big standards and this is completely fine and normal?
Or do you think thats not really the way teacher with mulktyple diplomas from Computer science and programming should teach?

Thanks for any thoughts.

Since I was 14-15 I've been interested in film and psychology. I wasn't able to choose between those two till l the day I had my country's GPA equivalent and saw that I couldn't get into psychology, so I chose film (I have to mention that there is no tuition at my country's universities). Throughout my 1st year at uni my moods varied between hating it - wanting to drop out and regive the entrance examinations and small periods during which I was quite excited about it. So I couldn't make up my mind. Some of the reasons I want to give up:
 ▪it's a 5 year programme - 30 hours per week, but I feel that I get nothing from 2/3 of the lessons
▪I'm not sure it's worth studying it, and I think studying something else and trying to learn about film by myself at the same time would be more useful
▪I can't understand if it's the job that I don't like or the uni in which I'm going to
▪I'm not sure it's worth it in general. Plenty of times my anxiety gets quite worse than it already is and I feel like I'm drowning due to that.

On the other hand my only other interests are  English Language &amp; Literature (for which I can't find a possible career which I'd be interested to) and Psychology (specifically the department of brain and cognitive sciences). I don't know if I'd be happy doing either of these, though, and If i want to do something related to these enough, in order for me to spend what's left of this school year in order to study and regive the examination.

I have to mention that I'm struggling with anxiety and depression and I'm trying to start therapy at the moment, while trying to start going to the gym (cause I have back-neck problems and it's quite necessary in order to get well) and get used to staying by meself at the same time. I also have to say that I don't have to pay for the appartment, which is huge relief, but there are of course, other expenses, and I'm planning to find a part-time job as soon as possible - if I'm able to- and stop burdening my parents with my expenses.
I had a hard time throughout HS due to family issues and mental problems, which worsen quite a lot during my last year due to the anxiety that the exams caused me, and uni - moving out seemed like the end of it. I thought I'd get better when school was over and I was out of my (kinda toxic) family environment. But I'm worse. I just want to be okay.

I love talking to him but at the same time I have even made up lies saying that I can’t call for various “reasons” otherwise I will be feeling nauseous all day knowing he’s going to call me. 

I think this time I’m super anxious and physically getting sick because he mentioned he maybe wants to hook up, and I’m a very awkward virgin and idk idk. 

He wants to meet in real life soon, in a public place obviously, and I would like that. I really would, but I kind of don’t want to at the same time? We are meeting in 2 weeks, and I have felt shaky and sick the past 3 weeks since I found out he’s coming down to where I live. 

I think it’s worth mentioning that I have social anxiety and am a very quiet girl in real life, even with my closest friends I can be deathly awkward so I almost always call sick to cancel plans with friends. 

I want to meet this guy so bad. And I know that if I didn’t go, I would be beating myself up about it FOREVER, thinking “what IF I pushed myself out my comfort zone”.

She yelled at me for stuff like taking a walk with a boy (at 16) and made me feel like I was very gross or disgusting for doing that. She constantly compared my grades to others and if my friends got a little better grade then it was hell on earth. I remember being yelled at for nothing just because her friends kid got a medal in sports (I was the class nerd but could never do well in sports). I was always held at an unachievable expectation. If I speak up it was either ""I raised you so well but God is punishing me by making you this bad"" or ""it's your smartphone that's ruining your life"". Whenever she sits me down for a talk, I get this cold feeling and go numb all over. My entire family treats me as gross for being the way I am. What do I do?
Ps. My mom is otherwise very understanding. ",11Nov2018,1
342,"I ve never felt pressure from school or work itself, but the interactions you have to go through everyday, seeing a lot of people, hearing them, having to talk to a couple for whatever reason, you find someone who helps you do all that and more, you know she picked you because you are a little broken but shell fucking fix you, 5 years later she leaves you for the same reasons she fell in love with you, you know exactly what you are doing wrong but for some reason you keep doing the same things, you try to hate her because she left but you cant because she was always the nicest even when she broke up with you, so you are again there alone, struggling to do the things you thought were now easy, you feel like a kid wothout his mom but you already have a degree and you keep moving, dead inside, hoping you had the courage to kill yourself, but knowing you wont because you cant even commit to that, just wishing that someone will make the decision for you just as hows been your whole life, thats why i dont think its school itself.

 I feel lost, alone, I know I have the tools to turn things around but I just cant, even if I change my behavior i know ill be back to usual in a couple of weeks, my parents dont talk to me, the only person I had to talk things through was my girlfriend but I already ruined that, I feel surrounded by burnt bridges.",11Nov2018,1

344,"I’m 22 years old and have tried to go to university before but because of some health issues it wasn’t successful and I had to take some time away. 
In taking time away I got swept up in life and finding jobs that paid the bills and just got stuck.
I’m now finding myself feeling a little lost and sad because I want to find some direction in life and start working my way towards a career.
I’ve always been a smart person and while I’ve been primarily a creative, over the years I have found my interests have changed.

I’ve been interested in psychology and science since I was very young and would love to put in the years of work to make this a career.
However, because I’ve been away from any kind of study I’m worried I won’t be able to hack the academic life. I’m so damn motivated and I want this so bad but I’m scared of failing, or worse, simple not being good enough.

Do I give it my all and risk it, or do I settle for something safe even though it will make me unhappy?

345,"**TL;DR: My lack of productivity causes me to guilt-trip myself into never doing anything fun in life, which causes me to have a really depressing life, with no hobbies, interests, or activities, and is possibly affecting my study habits as well.**

Hey. So, for the past 2 years or so, my mental illness made a relapse. I had so few responsibilities that I never took any free time because I felt like I didn't ""deserve"" to take it. I would spend all week not having much to do except for 3 classes and working 15 hours on weekends, so I got into the habit of ""punishing"" myself for not being productive.

What this means, ironically, is that, because I have more free time, I am actually LESS likely to engage in fun hobbies, such as drawing, playing guitar, writing and recording my own music, or going to concerts, because of this notion that I do not ""deserve"" to do so.

Fast forward to today, I am in a university. I have several goals: I study for five hours per day (or at least try to), I go to the gym, and I run (I did a 17-mile run on Wednesday night) in preparation for a marathon next June.

However, all of my hobbies have suffered. I am playing guitar a lot less, despite owning 11 guitars. I haven't watched a movie in about 5 months. I haven't published an original song in nearly two years. I used to go to metal concerts frequently (they are like $10-30 so they are very affordable), but have only been to about 2-3 concerts this year. I bought several awesome books like The Road and Metro 2033 a year ago, but have barely started reading them because I guilt-trip myself.

I didn't celebrate Halloween this year because I was too worried about a test I had the next day. The prior weekend, I missed After The Burial AND Erra - two of my favorite bands - on a killer tour, because I was freaking out about how it would impact my grades. Ironically, I was not very productive school-wise that night, so I missed it for NOTHING. I missed Cattle Decapitation on their recent tour as well. I missed Slayer, Behemoth, Judas Priest, and Lamb of God IN MY HOMETOWN for the same reason.

I have so much creative passion that I feel is dying because it is not being used. It's coming back a bit due to No.fap and porn.free, but they are only ""boosts""; I need a solution. I use the pomodoro technique to study; I try to do 60-75min of studying followed by a 15-minute break. But what typically happens is that I end up studying 45-60 minutes with a 45-60 minute break in between. And these breaks are typically spent trying to prepare myself food (due to an eating disorder) or mindlessly surfing the internet, where I tell myself the lie of ""I'lL oNlY sPenD fIvE mInuTeS"" and then not only wasting my whole pomodoro break, but also overshooting it. It is typically 12 or 1 AM by the time I have made myself study for five hours in a single day.

**I feel that this may be affecting my study habits as well. I never feel fully relaxed during these ""breaks""**, because I'm not doing things I love, like playing guitar, drawing or reading. I'm smart, I have an IQ of over 125, and I love engineering, but I feel that I am really being held back from studying as productively as I could, which makes me guilt-trip myself out of leisure, which makes studying harder, and on and on. I have just wasted the entire morning doing nothing due to this anxiety. I cannot focus on anything and I never give myself ""off"" days, even when there is little to do in school.",11Nov2018,1
346,"I will try to keep it simple. I am 24 years old, he's 29, I have only been in one serious relationship before him, the others were just casual. He's the first guy that I've had a STRONG connection with, the others were lukewarm. He really liked me (and I, him)  and we were together for almost 2 months (I know, I can't believe I'm one of those people) but we broke up this morning and I regret it. The thing though is that the relationship was really dysfunctional. 

&amp;#x200B;

We didn't fight for maybe the first month, but for the last 3 weeks or so we have fought every week and have almost broken up twice before. The dysfunction centers around our unwillingness or an apprehension to be completely vulnerable on my part. Even though I like him, I have never really told him even though he has told me multiple times how much he likes me. He is also pretty jealous and I've seen it manifest multiple times. Our communication was also pretty abysmal, we weren't totally upfront with one another whenever we would get into a conflict. Even the break up was dysfunctional, we had a disagreement and I told him I was going home (I often do this when we get into a conflict). He told me that if I left then it would be the end of the relationship...and I did. 

&amp;#x200B;

Other than that, we have a really strong connection and he's told me that if we weren't dating, I'd probably be one of his best friends. So now I'm feeling horribly and I know that I've made a mistake breaking up with him. He has contacted me since (we broke up about 6 hours ago) asking if he left something of his at my place but I think it was an attempt to talk to me again. However, I don't know what I should do. I'm feeling very lost and confused, can anyone give me some advice on what to do?",11Nov2018,1

348,"Hey all! I am not a confrontational person so I am having a hard time thinking of how I can tell my roommate of an issue I am having with her not telling me she’s inviting people over or having people sleeping over 

My roommate and I have been living together for over 1 year and we didn’t have much problems between us and we generally get along great. We never had problems with guests coming over before since she and I will always inform each other well before hand but that seems to change on her side. 

Recently she has been inviting people without informing me, and there are times where people slept over on the couch in the living room without me knowing. I don’t have a problem with her having people over but I do have a problem with not knowing it because I could’ve planned differently in terms of where to go. I will sometimes come home to some people at my house (That I know) or some people will tell me they are coming over, all without my knowledge. This is getting quite bothersome since my room is directly next to the living room, separated by a thin wall which means I’ll hear pretty much everything, from the tv to people talking, almost as if I am in the room myself. This is not only annoying when I am trying to sleep (at least after 12am) or when I am trying to do my
Work and study since it’s midterm season. If I have known before hand I could’ve head out to my bf house or the library to get some study time. 

There were times where I came home after 1AM to see her and my friend blasting music in the living room. I was kind of shook because I didn’t know she will be over, especially so late at night but I was more annoyed because they were being quite loud. This friend is also the same friend who stayed over without my knowledge on multiple occasions, and once I got spooked when I head out to the kitchen for food only to find someone on the couch. Another time she had a friend over and they were blasting music till 5:30 AM. I was studying the entire time and it was beyond annoying to hear music and even when I head to bed at 4, music was still playing even though she turned it down. (Music is passing through the vent so even if it’s not loud I can pretty much decipher it). I feel like she doesn’t tell me people are coming over especially that friend who stayed over mainly because she thinks I am close with her which I really am not, but no matter how close I am with that person I still want her to tell me. 

Keep in mind she usually heads to bed at 1AM and I usually will come home around 1 with all the lights turned off. At this time I am super quite and so was my boyfriend if he is over. This means we stay inside my room even when we are eating and does not turn on the tv/comp to play shows or music like she does those times she had friends over. As well, her guests (girls) also do not sleep with her on her bed but in the public area which I feel deserve me knowing that they are over especially because it’s a public space. 

The only thing she will tell me in advance is if she wants to have a pre at our place. However she usually tell me 1-2 hour in advance, meaning she already had it planned out but doesn’t tell me. At this point she already planned everything out so I am stuck with reluctantly agreeing and I will usually leave the house to do something else since it’s too loud and not my type of environment. I did say to her numerous times that I prefer not to have pre at our house just because of the waste that they’ll leave after as they usually leave before cleaning up, and whenever I come home the whole house reeked of booze, but she often tells me they planned it and it’s the closest house to their party location so I will just be like fine. Also the pre has been getting quite frequent as of late (1-2/month) and it’s pretty annoying because I need to study. 

I also should mention my boyfriend comes to our place often. When we started going out, we will always ask my roommate for permission if he can come over since st that point she doesn’t know him quite well. As time passes by they became friends as well and she said to me she knows he’ll be over and that doesn’t bother her. I honestly will feel the same if she has a bf and I don’t care if he comes over without me knowing. But friends, I am having quite a bit of an issue and I don’t really know how to voice them. Please help!!! (I let her know always if my friends are coming over)

Tldr: roommate stops letting me know if she has people over or when ppl sleeps at our public space. She also hosts pre at my place and doesn’t leave me much choice but to agree. I want to tell her but don’t know how. ",11Nov2018,1

354,"Hi guys, so I adopted my cat Zyra a little over a year ago. She was just a kitten when I first got her so I figured some of her behavioral issues would go away with time. 

Long story short, I've loved having her in my life and she's been a great cat with the exception of her habit of chewing on my belongings. She will chew pretty much any wires in sight, resulting in me replacing my iphone charger more times than I can remember, along with other cords around my apartment. She's clawed holes in my bedding and chewed on the clothing in my closet, ruining several of my favorite hoodies. It's been driving me crazy; today I woke up to her having chewed the cord of a $100 fan and feel like I've had enough. I can't keep throwing money down the drain to replace all these things.

I've tried to train her and prevent her from behaving like this, but nothing works and she will literally go back to destroying my shit the very next day. I have some toys for her, but she has long since lost interest in them. I live alone in a small studio apartment so I feel like the lack of stimuli is driving her behavior. 

Part of me wants to give her back to the shelter with hopes that she'll be adopted quickly by a family that can give her a larger space and more attention. At the same time, I feel horrible for wanting to send her back because it's as if I'm abandoning her. I will also undoubtedly miss her as she's been a wonderful companion, apart from her destructive tendencies so I'm at a loss on what to do, but am leaning towards giving her back. Have any of you been in a similar situation? Do you have any advice for me? Thanks in advance for taking the time to read my post.",11Nov2018,1

356,"Sorry for the length. I (F22) can’t remember/reset the password to my old main and nobody really knows i use reddit anyway so comfortable using my new main for this. I spent my latter childhood in a very strict evangelical church made up of mostly homeschool families - I have a bunch of wild stories from this experience, mostly having to do with being the only black family there. I was in the closet the entire time my family attended. I knew I was bisexual but due to the extreme homophobia in the church I wisely didn’t tell anyone. Once I graduated high school and went to a large state university I came out, although I remain closeted to my parents and all of their friends where they live. One of these church friends is the X family, whose son A was a good friend of mine when I was in middle/high school. In high school I actually had a crush on him, and he very kindly/gently turned me down, without our friendship changing at all. I don’t ever recall him mentioning girls that he had crushes on, and although I know this is a stereotype, he tended to hang out mostly with girls and had trouble relating to the type of hyper-masculine “straight guys” the church encouraged the boys our age to be. 
Once we graduated (same year), even though we went to the same college, he stuck with religious crowds and I assumed he’d judge me for my sexuality since he did so, so I slowly cut contact and never came out to him. We’re still friends on social media (i’m very private about dating stuff on there so you wouldn’t know my preference based on my profile). I occasionally watch his story but don’t really engage with him. 
Today, however, I received a follow request from a male model bot page on Instagram - typical pics of muscly dudes in underwear. I was declining the request when I noticed that A follows the page. Several minutes of stalking later I noticed that not only does A follow several model pages very clearly aimed towards gay males, but he often posts similar content (i.e.  shirtless photos of himself in bed showing off body hair) and uses hashtags on his public profile that tend to cater to the gay community (I won’t include because he actually has a lot of followers and I don’t want to out him). None of this is solid proof that he is gay, but seems pretty damning. A and I were as close as two people can get with one person being in the closet in high school - he was a great friend to me and I’d like to think that was reciprocal. I definitely didn’t like cutting him off but the pressure of staying closeted eventually became too much. If he is gay, I wonder if we’ve been through similar experiences that might be helpful to share. I’d love to come out to him and give my explanation for distancing myself if he is gay.

I’m in a pretty good college doing the pre-med track and am a member of a fraternity and I feel like my academics and social life are hurting and it’s only gonna get worse. I feel like almost everyone in my frat gets along and helps each other out and looks out for each other but I’m just sorta the odd one out that nobody really wants around. Amongst kids my age, kids think I’m funny and stuff but I always feel like they’re laughing at me, not with me and I feel like I’m always the target of jokes or criticism (my ideas are often knocked down and I feel like I have no voice amongst my peers). Lately it seems like 2/3 conversations with my frat brothers are them asking me for something, almost knowing I will say yes and it’s making me think that they don’t care about me as a person at all and don’t want my friendship or company, just my stuff. Overall I just feel like they all are annoyed by me and that it would all be better without me. On top of that I have had little success with girls lately and that just makes me feel like even more of a loser. I’m not hideous but I’ve always been super self conscious about my looks (I’m very pale and have very light hair) and I just think that girls just think I’m an ugly creep. Now it’s getting even worse as I’m starting to get the feeling that I’m losing my hair, which is the only part of myself that I find attractive and it makes me feel like I’m never gonna find someone because I’ll be so ugly. As the cherry on top, I’m struggling with my classes even though I’m a pretty hard working student. I usually go to sleep around 3am and get maybe 6 hours tops of sleep a night, leaving me groggy and spacey all the time.

I try to be more confident around girls but it only makes me feel like more of a creep and a loser as it always seems like girls are looking at me with disgust or pity. And I try to improve my academics but the other two problems end up occupying my mind and distract me.

368,"Just background, Im an introvert, kinda awkward. She’s an extrovert, really kind until recently. We are both in high school, and have been friends for years, even in elementary school. I had a crush on her last year, but kinda got over it over the summer. In the summer, we hung out a lot, most of the time with a mutual friend. We talked every other day at least, and she told me she considered us to be best friends.

School was back in, we sat together and have all our classes together. We talk like normal for almost a whole month, and then she starts getting a little quieter out of nowhere. Like, on friday we were talking and then the next monday she barely says a word to me, won’t initiate a conversation, barely replies when i try to talk to her. I keep up the one-sided conversation for almost two weeks, but i get kinda depressed and frustrated because we were super close, and now she wont even talk to me. It escalates, to the point where i ask her a question about how her day is, or how her family is, and she wont respond, even if i repeat the question. Then, she says she thinks im annoying and insults me. Later that day, she asks me for the math test review, and i tell her i cant give it to her because “im just too annoying” (i know, petty, but it really hurt my feelings) to which she responded by insulting my appearance, and telling me i have no friends. I sent her the review after i got home, and she didn’t even open it. The part that really gets me: my personality hasn’t changed since we became friends. I’ve matured, but im no more annoying than i was when we met. These days, i just ignore her. I understand if she doesn’t want to be friends, but it sucks because i still dont understand what went wrong, and she is closer to the mutual friend (that we hung out with in summer) and thus the friend doesn’t talk to me much anymore either. 

Is it my fault? If not, what could cause such a turn in personality? I havent done anything (that i know of) to hurt her feelings. Should i try to save the friendship, and if so, how? ",11Nov2018,1

370,"I'm going to try to make this as short and cohesive as I can but a lot of it is pretty confusing for me. I feel stuck. I've lost who I thought I was. And I can't bring myself to change anything about it. I just want to shed some light on where I am in my life and hoping an outside perspective can help me process what I'm experiencing. 

On one hand, I enjoy my life. It's simple. I have a good job with flexible hours that pays well and allows me enough free time to do anything I want. But, I've been there for 7 years now... and all my other friends are climbing the corporate ladder. For the life of me though, I've never seen myself in that environment. Even now, trying to picture it... I just can't see myself being any happier there than where I am. I love my job some days and I absolutely hate my job some days. And at times, which does frighten me, is that it feels like I have to get one of these career-corporate jobs. But the last time I followed the herd, it left me with a massive amount of debt and a marketing degree that just bores me. And at this point, out of school now for 5 years, I've probably forgotten most of it anyway. 

I live at home, which again... great and not so great. Great because I can save almost every penny I make and have roof over my head, with a family that supports me and loves me. Not so great for dating. Being 30 years old, I know, I have to move out-- and I'm getting to it, I've done it before for 3 years... I just can't justify spending *that* much money for rent. I wish I had friends to ask but, everyone is either living with their significant other or co-workers who are out tailgating today without having bothered to invite me because I probably pushed them away but, I pushed them away because it felt like they stopped inviting me to things. And now, some days I feel like the outcast at work because I don't like to get shitfaced in the afternoon and grab girls by the tits whenever I want. Never in a million years would I have considered myself to be the outcast because of my respect and manners towards others. BUT, yet again, I feel like that level of standard I imposed upon myself at whatever age has made me bland and doubtful because I don't want to speak my mind anymore since everyone seems to love to tell me I'm wrong. Or, out of fear that I would try to emulate this behavior and end up crossing the line with some absurd ill-aligned comment.

And then, to top it off, I can't tell if my standoffish-insecure behavior has always been who I am but now it is exemplified because I'm 30. Or, if it was the product of putting all my will and effort to test a lifelong theory, belief, reinforced affirmation and weird coincidental moments that led me to believe I could manifest anything I desire. And finding that out, over a girl, has completely ripped my identity within myself. She toyed with my persistence for a full year and in her devastating wake, I couldn't even tell who was on my side and who wasn't. Friend from foe because wickedly blurred and grey. I'm so grateful my best friend since 4th grade stuck around, he received the absolute worst of it and it's an absolute blessing he's still in my life. And while all of *this* with her is in the past and I've come to terms with it(even though it might sound like I haven't in explaining it), it left a monumentally gaping hole in my soul. One I crawled out of but can't resist looking back down it.

But, I used to be creative. I used to want to do something with my life, make something out of myself. Open my own restaurant. Write a screenplay, or a novel. Code a video game. But what was once a fantastic dream at 18, is now a harsh-potential, risk-taking reality. I'd write-draw-paint, ponder ideas, photography. But when she came along... I want to say she stole it all, but I don't even know if I can blame her. Because maybe I've always been this way. This unmotivated, uninspired half-assed start-stop person. Or whatever happened, left behind me: a 30 year old man-child, lost wandering a vapid plane, smoking weed everyday and pissing away all my time in video games that don't even excite me like they used to, while constantly fighting the urge to draw or fucking write something only to freeze completely upon the act of it. But, I've become so absorbed into the comfortable habit that trying to break from these vices seems damn near impossible.

W-why couldn't I get invited today? I think they knew I had the day off. Why did I turn on and push away so many people in my darkest hour? Why do I think *everyone* hates me, but only sometimes? Where do I go from here? How can I find the courage enough to act on the impulses that have been *rejected*, *ignored*, *mocked* for *years*? Do I abandon my 4-day a week job and these lackadaisical pursuits of dreams in place of what is considered traditional, safe and normal? Would that even help? What am I missing? And why can't I find it? ",11Nov2018,1

375,"For a while now I've been looking around at art jobs. I've been on Craigslist, Glassdoor, Monster, and I have a LinkdIn profile. I was on Craigslist looking around for people who wanted artwork (I know, why was I on Craigslist?) Looking around I came across this post looking for someone to draw a Science Fiction adventure comic. I was super excited and I emailed some of my art in the response to his post. He got back to me and said he was interested in my work and that I was a talented artist. I responded to his email. He emailed me back asking if I could send the email I sent him earlier. I did that then I waited. He seemed busy so I waited about four days. I emailed him and he responded that he was moving forward with another artist. He wasn't sure if I emailed him before. He seemed scattered and busy but I don't know. I don't get it. Do you think it would have been courteous to at least get back to me and say ""hey man I like your art but I found someone else""? Maybe I sound entitled and I am sorry if I do. I'm just bummed because I was excited. This is something I wanted to do. My mind was reeling at the possibilities. I was excited that something good and positive was happening in my life. I work a job in manufacturing and I just want to break away from that. It would be great to work a job that I want to get up in the morning and go to work. I know that's what a lot of people want. Not just a job that pays the bills. Look I'm not ungrateful for being employed. It just feels degrading working the job I do. Someone can literally walk off the street, get a job there, and take my spot, and it wouldn't be any different. I feel like my family looks down on me. It would feel good to tell them I did something with my life that not many people have. It's not a job that would allow me to quit my day job. It's a start in the right direction towards something. I want to work in art and design preferably illustration. I realize it's a tough competitive field but I keep trying. Should I have been more agressive and assertive? I don't know.

379,"Awhile back, I accepted a job at a ski resort for part of the winter. At the resort I work at, they have employee housing, but I didn’t get in. I basically asked my boss about it when I got accepted (like September) and she said I would probably get a spot but she’d get back to me. In late October she got back to me and told me I would not have a spot in employee housing, so I am now desperately searching for a place with a one month lease in this expensive ass totally overcrowded resort town. I have been searching very actively for about a month and have found nothing in my price range, but have found a few things I can’t afford.

My boss has decided to try to help me and a few other employees who are in my situation by providing us with one another’s contact info. She basically sent out an email to me and a few of my future coworkers with all of our email addresses listed and suggested that if we get in contact and look together we may be able to find something affordable. I don’t know any of these people but at this point I’d be totally down to go in on a place with all of them. I am absolutely desperate to move to this town because some of my closest friends live there and this could be my last shot at seeing them for a long time (or, possibly, forever).

I guess what I’m asking is, would it be weird to send an email to these people asking if they’d be interested in renting a place together? It’s been about a day since our boss reached out to us and none of them have contacted me or replied. I’m really afraid that it would be off putting and weird for me to just email a bunch of strangers (who I will end up having to work with if i do get housing) asking if they want to rent a place together, especially considering I can only stay at/pay for that place for 1 month.

381,"Hello Reddit community, I’m here right now because I’m feeling guilty and I have absolutely no idea of what I did was the right thing or not. 

For starters I’m a single father of a 14yo girl and 13yo boy. For the last few years we have been living in a two bedroom apartment and they share a room so naturally between being at home and going to the same school they spend a lot of time together. 

This past weekend one evening I unexpectedly walked into my kid’s room to ask them what they would like for dinner and to my shock they were laying on one of the beds and masturbating next to each other! Quite frankly I don’t even think I overreacted and just yelled OMG! Naturally they tried to cover themselves up looked embarrassed. My son as completely naked and my daughter was just in her underwear. 

My first question to them in a rather stern voice was if they knew what they were doing....I got silence. My next question was if they touched each other and they said no which was a huge sigh of relief. 

I had always known my kids knew the differences between boys and girls but I’ve never really had the chance to sit them down and have a real talk about puberty and sex etc which I then proceeded to do for the next 20 or 30 minutes. I calmly explained that what they were doing was completely normal and natural for them to want. I told them about sexual frustration as they get older and wanting certain things. 

Long story short I told them that they are free to continue masturbsting whenever they want just so long as they DONT touch each other and that it’s not okay for siblings to do that.  I also asked them how long they had been doing this and they said a couple of months which was weird because I never suspected a thing...mostly because I usually work later and just so happened to come home early that day so I could run some errands.

They confided in me that someone at school told them about masturbation and they wanted to try it. 

Obviously I know that incest is NOT okay but honestly I felt like as long as neither of them go any further or touch each other it’s fine to explore. 

I thought I did the right thing but I’m not so sure anymore. In the back of my mind I grew up just like them always being sexually frustrated and learned everything from friends at school and hearing sex talk which is the wrong way to go about it. I also think it’s better than them watching hardcore porn or something. 

I need advice :( ",11Nov2018,1

I know I shouldn't stay hung up on her, but I also don't think I can get past this if I have to talk to her, and I don't want to ignore her because then she'll think something is up and I'd feel awful treating her like that.

So I think I'll just lay it out there and just let her reject me, but then it'll be so awkward when I see her and it'll be weird for me to talk to our mutual friends too.

390,"I'll try to keep this short as possible. 

For starters I'm 27 years old. Located in Florida

About a year ago I stepped away from managing a restaurant after a 4 year span working 7 days a week. I was severely burned out. I took a month long vacation to snowboard at various places across the US. Ended up having a knee injury I had to have meniscus surgery once I got back during this time since I was out of work. I was doing side deals buying and selling (4 wheelers/cars/boats etc) with my father. Fast forward he told me he needed money for a deal of a life time. He needed 67k and once the Buss sold I would get 90k back. Of course at the time I trusted my dad, figured It was a decent turn around and went through with it. 2 months later he disappeared. Took my money he couldn't be found. Shortly after I contacted a lawyer and with enough proof through text messages/emails we we're able to bring him to court on civil theft. He never showed and we got a PI involved. After enough digging around we found out he was involved in much worse crimes grand theft etc from a previous company long story short few months later he was arrested and charged and served 2 months in jail and got out on bail for the grand theft charge from the previous company but yet my civil theft is pretty much going no where...

So being out of work, needing to have knee surgery dealing with this drawn out legal issue with my father. I ended up with another injury from the gym. I tore my ecu tendon and needed another surgery. 6 month recovery. So at this point I was out 67grand + about 18k in medical bills. After recovering I had no idea what to do so I started up a pressure washing business after talking to a neighbor that was in the business for 25 years before retiring explaining to me 6 figures is very reasonable. At this point I'd be happy with 40k a year just to get above water. It was super low start up cost and figured I'd give it a shot.

Since starting I was able to land about 14 jobs in about 5 months. I've made about 7k to the date. Which is next to nothing. I've advertised in the city paper, craigslist, handed out 500 flyers by hand. Even tried Home advisor which did nothing but cause me a headache. Spent $250 up front and ended up getting charged additional $312.00 in bullshit lead fees from people that were just window shopping and not serious about getting work done. More or less I stopped there service and fought for a refund for over a month and luckily I won.

At this point I have no idea how to generate more leads. I've called around to different HOA's to get my foot in the door and I just get put on a vendor list. (not guaranteed work.) I don't really enjoy labor work however I've always been a hustler and considering the turn around in pressure washing business I'm 100% into focusing on it to get me back on my feet for a few years then branch out. I'm just limited due the capital I lost so I can really pursue other business ideas.

It's been a rough year I went from little over 100k in the bank down to 11k I don't really feel depressed I'm active everyday. Going to the gym taking my dogs for walk trying to be the most positive I can. But I'm servery stressed out and just out of ideas... My house is paid for but I still have my monthly bills. Feel like I'm running out of time before I go broke. I can always sell my assets but I prefer not to go down that road. I was very ahead for most people my age till things blew up.

401,"So, there's three main people in this story

* My Fiancee
* My friend K
* The other girl, A

A few months ago, my fiancee cheated on me. As you can imagine, it created a lot of problems, both between us, but also between our friend group. See, I met all these people working retail, we all became close friends. Especially K and myself, who I considered one of my best friends. She took this really hard, because she was upset that my fiancee cheated, that she hurt me, and she was concerned for me.

But things got worse, because the guy I got cheated on with, was a temp dude at the store, during the time he was flirting with and  managing to convince her to do this, he was also flirting with just about every other chick he could, including A. K and A are best friends, really close, working together, living together, hanging out all the time outside of work, etc, etc. 

A quickly falls for the guy, who, while yes my feelings are a bit biased, I feel has some red flags and is a piece of work. I mean, he knew about our engagement, yet, still decided to try and get into my fiancee's pants, which he succeeded. K and A, people I considered friends, clearly showed no real remorse or concern, not just for our relationship, but moving forward with him dating A and becoming part of their friend circle. 

Maybe I'm not in the right here, but that hurt me deep. Things really took a turn for the worse, because I believe that he was spreading lies and twisting words, playing them against me and my fiancee. It all came to a head, when K messaged both of us, basically saying that she couldn't handle being a part of this, that I shouldn't be upset about this, because he makes A happy and that's all that matters, and more. She threatened my fiancee with violence, which despite what happened, I wouldn't want her to be beat up or hurt. Especially considering that, I do want to try to work things out.

I feel like they turned their backs on us, but yet, I'm really upset that my friendship with K pretty much has fallen apart. We had similar interests, we got a long great, and I just really enjoyed being around her. When I quit the store, she was the only person who truly made me feel like I was gonna be missed. She broke down and it touched me to know that I meant so much to someone. I've been debating on reaching out and trying to rebuild our friendship.

But of course, I know the problems and issues that would arise. First off, if I did, I know this would make its way back to my fiancee and that would be a big issue, considering how she feels about all them. Second, despite those feelings of wanting to rekindle and rebuild the friendship, I'm still hurt and really angry with them about how this whole situation unfolded.  

Again, maybe I'm wrong, but I wouldn't want to be friends with someone who hurt someone I cared about. Especially in a situation like this, if I were in her shoes, personally, I would have stated my concerns for A and him dating, I would have said that I feel there's some red flags, and that I'm not comfortable with it. I wouldn't let it slide, just because he makes her happy. Lots of things make people happy, but sometimes they aren't what's best for them.

I think the biggest moment for me during all this was, I was out at the mall with my brother, I ended up spotting them all there. I swear, they avoided me like the plague and I got some death glares, especially from K. That hurt, you don't want to talk to me? Fine, but I wasn't gonna start something, besides, my beef is more so with him, more than anybody else. So why not just break off from the group and say hi? Or again, just walk on by me, like I didn't exist. I'd rather be ignored, than to be made to feel like I was public enemy number one.

I miss her friendship and what she meant to me, but I'll never get over how she so quickly and without any sort of remorse or hesitation, took A's side in all this and was just okay with him becoming so close to them. 

I just need some perspective here. Is it best if I just keep my distance and let time heal all wounds, if that's what is meant to happen? Should I extend the olive branch and try to patch things up between us? Or should I just cut all ties with them and accept that this is how it is?

And for the record, I'm not here to talk about being cheated on or anything that happened with that matter. It is my decision to work through our issues, I do blame her and I'm not saying she's completely innocent. I just feel that he had a role in this and he should shoulder some of the blame himself. So if we could just refrain from that subject matter, that would be great.

Thanks for reading and thanks for any and all advice you give.",11Nov2018,1
402,"I recently lost a friend for a number of reasons. I was going through a super rough time due to depression and acted in a way that wasn’t myself towards the end of our relationship. I wasn’t mean or anything, I was just a bit timid and uncomfortable. And by being in that place I made my friend uncomfortable. When we stopped being friends, they told me directly that our relationship wasn’t working out, both because we had grown apart and because of the way I was acting. And she was right, I was closer to her than she was to me towards the end of things and I wasn’t a very fun person to be around. So right now I’m trying to fix myself as a person, to be happier without her and to be better socially. But my question is, once I get over everything and I change a bit, and I give things time, at least five months, is there a possibility she’ll be my friend again? I realize that’s a super speculative question but any input would be appreciated :)",11Nov2018,1
403,"My twin sister and I are 16 and my sister has become a monster over the past year or so. She constantly yells and swears at me and my parents despite all attempts to be nice. For example, yesterday my mom bought her a bunch of new bras and when she knocked on her door to ask her if she wanted to see them/try them on, she yelled ""fuck off"". We all think that she is fueled up on hormones or angry that we have different political opinions or tired from going to sleep too late every night or overwhelmed from homework but it's gotten to a point where that is an explanation rather than an excuse for her behavior. I try my hardest to respect my parents and not perpetuate arguments so they see me as someone they can talk to and kind of as a mediator to my sister. I have tried to talk to her on several occasions and she has said she is aware and is willing to change but then nothing happens. As of the most recent ""fuck off"" incident my parents have told me that they are planning on sending her to boarding school and that I could try to talk to her to give her one last chance. As of the past month, every time I've talked to her she says she acts the way she does because she ""refuses to become a docile doll"".

What can I tell her to get her to understand that we don't hate her and just want her to treat everyone with respect (I've used those exact words and got told ""I don't give a shit"")? Is it better if I let her get sent to boarding school for the good of the rest of the family? If anything else needs to be clarified let me know and thanks for any advice",11Nov2018,1
404," Hello everyone, ill try to keep this as short as possible

Im a 21 (M) nurse, currently i have been unemployed for a year for a very understandable reason, my mother is sick and she is in bed and im the only one who is able to take care of her for diferent factors: first is my career choice, second is that since i was just starting i didnt had a good salary compared to my father or my brothers (im the youngest son) and third is that employing someone to take care for a person is expensive and its always a risk, so who better to take care of my mom than myself.

Some days are good where she is able to eat without any problem, to walk without my help and she being generally happy or atleast not stressed about her disease, other days are not so good where she has told me ''whats the case of me taking my medicine if im going to die anyway'' while crying and that bummers me out but i try to have a positive actitude towars her since the least thing she needs is a ungrateful son making her feel like shit, we have cried together and we have laughed together.

I take care of the whole house, i cook, i do the laundry, i clean the floor, take care of the pets, whats done in a household i do it and thats been good for me since before all of this i honestly lacked in certain areas and now i have learned, hell even my mom has told me that i wouldnt have problems living on my own if something happened to her

my family and i have been talking about what the next step is, she needs a liver trasplant and we are in the process of getting it but it will take a while before she actually gets it, i have told my parents my wish to continue studying since this was something temporal but i honestly dont see an end to this anytime soon since my father has expressed his feelings all my life that he doesnt want to stop working, that once he stops he fears he will stop working as a human being but lately he has been open to the option of being retired (he is 66 years old) so he can take care of my mom and i can do my thing in life.

I want to continue studying in a university but its in another state, the state where my mom goes to get checked for her liver trasplant and its the same city where my Sweetheart lives (24F) we really love eachother and we plan in living together once i move but since currently its a long distance relationship it has been hard for both of us, one day i thought we were going to break up for that reason but we talked it and we came to an understanding, we see eachother every 2 months since those are the times where my mom, my dad and i fly to another state for the studies of my mom and i use that chance to see my girlfriend but i dont want to take too long to move out since i fear something will happen between us, i know she will wait for me but i dont want to keep her waiting more time.

I have been thinking for some weeks that i should save some money in the case where i decide to move on my own, i have been selling some stuff that i dont use like my xbox one, books and usually items that i wont be able to take with me if i leave and i treat that money as emergency money but i honestly dont know what to do, i basically have 2 choices:

Should i stay and wait some more time with the risk of hurting my future (laboral wise and love wise) or should i leave on my own and hurt my family and specially my mother, i honestly dont know what to choose and im so scared for my future.

 i want to hear your stories and advice for this young man that feels lost",11Nov2018,1

409,"26M here. I feel as though feeling connected with someone romantically is a scarce thing for me to genuinely feel, so that when I do, I get very excited about it and it makes me fixate on the feeling that I get from it. In the past, this has put me in situations where I am more invested in the other person than they are in me. The girl will pick up on it and become uncomfortable, feeling rushed or that she is leading me on because her level of interest isn't where mine is at that time. It's caused me to sabotage some potential romantic connections in the past and further reinforces some negative thoughts, leaving me feeling lonely, and then more inclined to react strongly to another opportunity should one come around. It also has me doubting my feelings and unsure of whether I should trust myself because it has gotten me burned time and again.

I got my cert and worked for a private ambulance service for about three years.

412,"I don’t know if my girlfriend is right for me. I (m22) care so much about my girlfriend (f22) of 5 years. We’ve broken up before, for about a four month stretch, but found our way back together when we decided to be fuck buddies(yes I realize this way really stupid). Anyways, I would really appreciate people’s advice on how they decided to stay or break up with a significant other they may have had similar problems with?

My girlfriend ignores my texts. She will be active on Facebook several times and sometimes even post, but she won’t text me back for 3-4 hours. I call her out on it when I see it (I don’t check constantly so I’m sure it happens more than I notice, which is still a lot) and she comes up with an excuse. “I’m out” “sorry I’m talking with my mom” or just something... but she can go on Facebook? 

She HATES talking about issues in our relationship. If anything is going wrong, she prefers to acknowledge it and then just move on. She once said “well either we are gunna get over it or we are not. I wanna fix it so let’s stop talking about it”. These issues tend to happen over and over again. The main issue being when she goes out she doesn’t text me for like 3-4 hours. 

I’m not asking to be in constant contact, as I know I lose track of my phone when out too. However, I feel it’s reasonable to expect a text at least once every hour or so. Especially when she’s out with a bunch of single guy friends. 

We are a long distance relationship, about three hours away. We haven’t had sex in 1.5 months and have seen each other 4 times during that... and she never wants to have sex. I have my needs but I’m not going to force her obviously, and when I bring it up she says she’s just not in mood. That’s also really hard. 

To be honest this post is kind of a shit show.. but I don’t have many friends and I really need someone for advice. Part of me thinks these things can’t be fixed because she won’t cooperate, but the other half just wants to try harder. I feel like the relationship is one sided most of the time. If some kind stranger would help me out in any way, I would appreciate it so much.

416,"My little brother “Ben” has never had any trouble getting girls. He’s athletic, pretty handsome and has loads of friends. I’m honestly really proud of him despite our parents putting him on a pedestal and thinking that he can make no mistakes. Because of this, he never goes to them when he makes a mistake, he comes to me. 

I’ve fucked up a lot in my life, got addicted to drugs, got sober, got my life together and now I live a pretty comfortable life. Because of this, he feels like he can come to me because I don’t judge him. 

Three days ago he came over to mine and my girlfriend’s place and said that he needed my help. He said that he got his girlfriend “Taylor” pregnant. He said that I’m the first one that he has told. 

Honestly, I kind of laid into him at first, asking him how fucking stupid can he be, and what the fuck he expects me to do about it. 

He says that him and Taylor have talked about getting an abortion but she doesn’t want to tell her super religious family because they would force her to have the baby and he won’t tell my parents because they would either blame her or they will freak out more than normal because of his perfect image. 

She wasn’t there when he told me this but he also asked if she could stay here a few days after the abortion so she could recover and not be around her parents. 

He asked me if I would be willing to take him and her for the abortion and to pay for it. Honestly I am at a loss for what to do. I’m pretty broke and I’m not sure how much an abortion would cost me and I’m not sure if I should just tell my parents? I feel like they would either not believe me or blame me for being a bad influence on him because of my history. I haven’t been close to my parents ever since I got sober. They don’t trust me anymore and my brother comes to see me behind their backs. 

I really don’t want to be blamed if our parents found out and further blamed for “being a bad influence” on him. But if she needs an abortion I want to be there for them. They don’t really have anyone else. 

What should I do? Should I take them for the abortion and pay for it or should I just tell our parents and let them handle it? I really don’t want to just hang them out to dry but I’m kind of freaking out about what to do here.

My brother has been depending on me financially since I was 8. I'm female (24) and he's 36. Through the age of 8 - 11, I had to give him my lunch money(for school)everyday for him to transport to work or whatever. I had to sit hungry and stare at other people while they ate  or beg for food sometimes. At the age of 11, I had to go to boarding school thus I stopped giving him money. 

When I finished (the equivalent of high school), it started again. I was 17 when it started again and I have been supporting him financially till now. I didn't have a lot of money so any money I had each day, I give to him for his feeding. I like with my dad so I don't have to worry about food. The older I got, the more money I had through work and other things, the more money I had to give to him. He somehow needed more money when I started working and about half my salary goes to him each money. The rest goes to transport and other stuff. 

Last week, I lent him money which he promised to pay back on Friday. I needed this money urgently to pay for some stuff. Keep in mind never pays back what I give him. Ever. I agreed and lent him the money on Tuesday. On Friday, he called and said he doesn't have the complete amount and I lost it. I told him if he doesn't pay back, I'm done supporting him. I barely have shit in savings and still live with my dad because all money goes to his feeding, clothing and stuff like that. He is a healthy guy, fully capable of working but he doesn't have degree so he cant get a decent job. 

A part of me wants to keep my word and not help him. I feel withdrawing my help will force him to think and do something for himself. I want to be able to save some money and live the life I always dreamed of but I feel selfish and guilty for considering keeping all my money to myself when my brother can barely feed without my financial assistance. He is making me feel guilty, saying that I didn't get to where I am now on my own, I had help. Why am I refusing to help someone else (him)? And I feel so bad. But I can't keep supporting him. I can't save enough to move out of my dad's house or do anything else if I keep giving him money everyday. What do I do? I need to end this. ",11Nov2018,1
420,"Hello,  


Today was the tipping point - the relationship I have had with my mother has been rocky for a few years now, but today I believe was the tipping point when she uninvited me from Thanksgiving Dinner.   


For as long as I can remember my mom has shown - questionable - behavior issues... when she got stressed out when me and my similar age brother would argue and fight when we were about 10 years old  I remember she would angrily storm out of the house and ""run away"" as I remember crying on the phone telling my father when he was at work. To this day when something upset her she would take things out of closets and cupboards and legitimately just throw them on the floor - things that have nothing to do with the present (trivial?) arguments - for absolutely no reason except to cause damage and hurt things. I remember once when I was little my brother and I fought, she took a chefs knife and slammed it down inches from my face threatening to chop my fingers off, if I touched my brother again... she chopped so hard she left permanent slices in the Corian (stone) counter top. 

&amp;#x200B;

Beginning in about high school, but still up to (legitimately today) she would comment things like ""I feel bad for your girlfriend"" and ""you're in for a long lonely life"" and ""I love you but I don't like you.""  


When I went off to college things weren't great... when I returned home she would comment how nice it was when I was not home, and during the summers would count down the weeks until I was returning to school whenever I did something trivial to anger her. After college, I took a job across the country and she counted down the weeks until I left saying things like ""I can't wait until you move to XXXXXX"".   


My brother was in town for a sports tournament so she came to watch him - she essentially invited herself to stay in my home - which was fine but from the second I picked her up at the airport she took a defensive tone claiming ""I knew I should have stayed at a hotel"".  I took her home, and offered her my bed to sleep in, but she refused and asked to sleep on the couch - I gave her blankets, pillows, and sheets. I offered her a shower and she said no - entering into a martyrdom mode and asking if she could use my sink to brush her teeth - of course I obliged. She then informed me I had to wake up at 6:45 A.M. to drive her across town to my brothers sporting event. I of course obliged, but obviously complained in the morning. After that morning, we visited some local attractions and had a nice day. She asked for me to book her a hotel for the next night, as my brother would be staying with her - I of course obliged.  


The next day (today) I woke up bright and early to drive her again to the field and she seemed miserable like always. When I texted her to ask what was wrong she said I'm not welcoming her and making her feel like an intruder because I didn't offer her a towel so I must not have wanted her to use my shower -  I simply forgot to offer her a towel. All is well and good, and my brother lost his sports tournament - she asked me to not mention it to him on the 30 minute drive to go pick him up. I of course oblige and don't mention it to him when we pick him up. After we drive back to my house, I notice my brother has found some of the crackers I keep in my car to give homeless people when I see them (we are originally from a small suburban neighborhood with no homeless people, but in my new city it is a serious problem). I told my brother they are for the homeless and he whines like ""but im so hungry"", I argue back and offer him any food in my apartment steps away, he angrily hands them back and my mom sees this and claims ""are you kidding me??? Taking food out of your brothers hands? Bring me my bag, I don't want to be with you any more - and I think you need to find new plans for Thanksgiving"". I bring her her bags, and angrily return to my apartment. Realizing the hotel reservation for tonight is in my name, I try to make amends and return outside, I take my mothers bags and begin loading them into my car, she then (screams) for me to return her bags, and when I say ""let me drive you to the hotel"" she begins (legitimately) screaming ""Somebody help me! Somebody call the police! Call the police!"" Obviously I have no choice but to unload the bags (I throw them at the ground intentionally... I won't lie) and I returned to my apartment. It appears she has blocked me on iMessage, and I don't know what to do? I don't want my mother and I to become one of those families that don't talk. I made myself as open and inviting to her as I possibly could have.

Dad says no, brother gets upset and says he'll do it when hes 18 to which my dad replies ""not while living with me"". Brother is overly confident that he will be fine and nothing bad will happen but obviously that's just not true.

So my problem is:

*  Do you really think a 17yo in his situation should travel that far by himself? 
* Do you think my family and myself are being too protective?
*  What can/cant we do to keep him from possibly ruining his life by getting this chick pregnant or getting stuck up there?

426,"Tl;dr - swearing, drug selling, racist 14 - year old cousin.  Do I get him a Christmas gift, or does it send a bigger message to  not get him anything?

My 14 year old cousin is out of control.  He's a hoodlum; selling drugs, smoking, being expelled from schools, and I just found out he's been calling his teacher the N word on a regular basis. I've decided I'm buying for his 3 siblings, but I honestly don't know if I want to buy anything for him.  He needs a wake up call.  

Everyone else in the family has tried to talk to him and he literally cusses us out and tells us to leave him alone, while his parents do nothing about it.  I know that this isn't totally his fault, his parents and grandparents (who live with them) let him do whatever he wants.  It's recently caused a huge blowup in my family.  In fact, I decided that I'm not going to Christmas with them this year.  It's a decision I've been leaning towards for a few years now.  

Holidays with them are nothing but stress filled and panic attack inducing.  My grandmother constantly yells at everyone, my grandfather starts fights with people. The house is a disgusting, foul smelling pig sty.  I'm over it.  

So, does it send a bigger message to not get him anything, or does anyone have suggestions on something that might teach him how to quit being a hoodlum?",11Nov2018,1

- I moved about 6 months ago
- Got a job for a big and well respected company in my new town. Which opens up for a lot of opportunities in the future.
- also work weekend at a job in my old hometown

The problem itself:
I pretty lonely in my new city. I only know a few people here. Of which I only speak with one of them regularly, and he's moving away soon.
So I have been thinking about moving back to my old hometown, where I know more people. Where all my friends live. Where I have a network. I'm terrible at meeting new people, and making friends. Even if I try.
Im thinking about moving back, but if I do I have to spend a lot of time driving to work every day. Maybe 2.5/3 hours each way. Which I also don't want to do.
I just miss being back home, where i know everyone, where its easy to hang out with friends.

I have also started talking with a girl who lives in my old hometown, but I don't know how to advance it. I mean she lives 3 hours away... We can't hang out on weekdays, because of the travel time, you know.
Which also adds to the main problem.

Any advice? Am I just like homesick? Or should I move closer to home if its financially possible? ",11Nov2018,1

430,"First, I'm not going to kill myself. But I definitely think about overdosing on my iron pills (I'm anemic) when I realize how my father, who has always had a temper, is a public embarassment. I am afraid to go anywhere with him and I am afraid to bring my boyfriend around him (the few times that I have done this, it has gone bad and my bf nearly left me over it). Ever since I can remember, my dad has been absolutely angry over the smallest things and always easily upset. I am pretty sure he has a  mental illness, but I'm afraid to share this with my bf because he would see me as trying to ""take sides"" although I am already on my bf's side. I have dreamed of romance for life since I was a child. I have already endured rape and assault and heartbreak, and I think my current bf is my true love since we have discussed a serious future together. However, my dad is enough to make my bf reconsider and this brings so much pain to me. Unfortunately, it's not my bf because my past two bf's have also really disliked my father (a lot of people do). I have been known to be one of the sweetest people ever many say, and I think part of the reason this is has to do with the fact my dad is always uptight and angry and I've wanted to neutralise this. 

I'm afraid to come home for the holidays. I don't want to explain all of this to my bf's family (who is pretty much the perfect family and will just make this a culture thing because my bf is an expat living in my home country). My mom won't divorce my dad for whatever reason although she always considers doing it aloud. I don't know what to do. I absolutely cannot allow myself to not have love and a family later bc my dad is so terribly unpleasant to be around. He doesn't physically abuse me, so he can't go to jail or anything, but my sisters and I think he has all done severe emotional damage to us. He has been a good father in that he worked hard to support a large family, but I just can't take how he is around other people (it's esp. worse when non family is around).

432,"This last summer my husband and I noticed a VERY skinny/malnourished cat had started hanging out on our lawn. It was very skittish and wouldn’t let us near him, or we probably would have brought him in the house right then to care for. Anyway, we noticed how thin it was and decided to put out a bowl of food on our front porch. Over the last 4-5 months it has gotten less and less afraid of people and started letting us pet it. When we did finally get near it we noticed that it had an ear docked, which is a sign that this cat was caught, fixed, and released as a feral cat. Over time the food was doing wonders for it, and it gained quite a bit of weight, and also brought about 6 other underweight feral kitties with it to get food too. The last two months this cat has been living almost exclusively on out patio furniture by our front door. We discussed bringing it in as soon as it lost it’s fear of us, but we have several other indoor cats and were worried that maybe that would just be too many cats in a small space. In fairness, we did notice that all the cats we’ve been feeding usually approached us from the direction of our neighbor’s property, however it’s a very rural area and that could have been a coincidence. Besides, they were all so skinny, and they all had their ears docked as being feral. 

Well it all came to a head last week. I came home and noticed the kitty was limping terribly. I called my husband and asked him if he thought we should take him to the vet to see if it was broken. He suggested that we wait because it was possibly the neighbor’s cat. So, we waited. For a WEEK. We watched the poor thing suffer and limp, and I felt like the worst animal abuser. Finally we decided that it was clear that no one in the area cared/owned him, and took him to the vet. $300 later, he is resting comfortably in our guest room (separated from our main cats for recovery) and we’ve discovered that he is the BEST indoor kitty ever. Perfect with the litter box. Fantastic with kids. After some discussion we decided to bite the bullet and keep him even though we already have other cats too. We are afraid that’d he goes back outside he will be unable to get away from predators (lots of coyotes and unleashed pet dogs here) and will injure his leg again/aggravate the old injury.  Plus how he got injured in the first place is still a mystery, was he kicked? Run over? 

Well. We decided to keep him as an indoor pet last night...... this morning my husband gets asked by our neighbor if we have seen their white and orange cat : ( 

I don’t know what to do. The cat was clearly malnourished when we began caring for it. Then it was injured so long they couldn’t have not noticed. Plus, if we give it back they will most likely just put it back outside where it will be in danger due to the injury. On top of all that, $300 is a LOT of money for us. We aren’t well off, Christmas is coming and we have four small kids to buy for. We chose to do it for -our- cat, but to just give him back is now just money thrown away. 

So.... what should we do?

437," 

Longest of long stories short, how would you deal with a classmate's constant competitive and one-upping behavior in a way that would end peacefully and reduce tension?

**Backstory:** I'm a second year female medical student and this year my school breaks us up into pairs to work on clinical skills. Basically, we practice seeing standardized patients.

Lucky me, I'm paired with a classmate who has been projecting her feelings of jealousy at me since last year. Last year, I confronted her on her disruptive/disrespectful behavior towards me and asked if there was anything I could do to help our relationship since I knew we would have to work together for the next several years. Although that conversation went well and she confessed to her jealousy and wanting to improve her behavior towards me, shortly thereafter her behavior went back to the way it had been (rude comments, yelling at me at school, talking behind my back, spreading rumors, just overall pettiness). When she had confessed to being jealous, she stated that she hated that I got as much attention as I did from men, that I was better at school than her, that I was more confident in life than her etc etc. I had such a hard time not rolling my eyes at it because it was the most stereotypical superficial drivel I had ever heard. She knows literally nothing about my life but had decided to bully me ***all year*** because of such immature, insecure things. However, I swallowed that and was kind and gracious and forgave her for how mean she'd been to me all year. Which is why, when she went right back to that behavior, I decided I had had enough. It was dumb, and I'm not trying to let little girl games distract me from learning to be a good physician.

At first this worked really well, but with our new clinical skills arrangement, I find myself in a close quarters situation with her again and I hate how much anxiety it is giving me. I just don't want to deal with the yelling at me, or the constant petty passive aggressiveness. I walk on eggshells around her and I'm worried about how to approach the situation in order to avoid a repeat of last year.

**Current dilemma:** We watch each other perform physical exams/take history from our standardized patients. Then we give each other feedback and the three of us (me, her, and the standardized patient- I'll call them SP from here on out) discuss. The first session, I watched her take history and gave feedback. She didn't do so hot, but I was definitely more interested in learning from the standardized patient and did not in anyway use the opportunity of my role as ""feedback-giver"" to shit on her performance in anyway. We have a checklist and I sandwiched every missed check mark she had with a compliment. I asked the SP general questions and was overall more interested in learning from the experience for myself than I was in her performance. I feel NO desire to compete with her. I'm truly there to learn and I could care less which of us looks better. I want to do the best I can for future patients and for my education, and that is it.

Following this, we had a break where she spent the full five minutes rationalizing her patient visit and how ""she wasn't usually that bad, she knew the things, she just got nervous blah blah blah"" I just smiled and nodded and did a lot of ""What are you talking about? You did great!""

The second half of the day was a physical exam which we both performed. She spent my time with the SP interrupting and trying to correct me. Thankfully, an attending physician was there who would interrupt her to tell me that I was correct and to proceed. Unfortunately, this won't always be the case- most of the time it will be just her and I.

During her part of the physical exam, she did fine but when she messed up, I waited for the physician to correct her and did not offer any commentary or feedback unless she specifically asked me for it. It didn't help that the SP gave me more attention/formed a stronger bond with me than with her. Honestly, she wasn't very nice to him and I was. That's all that it came down to but I have no idea what crazy story she twisted that into in her head.

This is less important for me to find a strategy for but more to demonstrate her competitiveness: my group of friends and I always sit together and in a certain area of the room. She kept trying to get them (everyone but me) to join her the first few sessions, but when they didn't, she's now started plopping herself down right in the middle of our group and trying to disrupt all of our conversations with one another. Its so uncomfortable and cringey and very clearly directed at me that I'm just sad for her that she cares so much about me and what I'm doing or feeling.

In every conversation I ever have with her, I'm kind and gracious and try to play like I'm oblivious to her attempts to be passive aggressive etc etc.

**Goals**: Frankly, I'm done with being hurt by how mean she is to me because of her own insecurities so I'm not trying to ""teach her to be a better person/grow"" whatever. (I admit I did a little bit of that when I tried to confront her last year).

Ideally, I want to

A) get through this without triggering her insecurities so she isn't passive aggressive and/or aggressive towards me again.

B) want her to understand that I don't care how she does or doesn't do and that I'm not trying to compete with her in anyway.

Can I do this without confrontation? I know there isn't much here, but is there anything from my description that strikes you as something I should stop doing/change because it isn't helping? I'm completely over putting myself out there with this person and don't want to cause anymore trouble for myself. How can I get her to just leave me alone?

Disclaimer: I've talked to my SO about this and he thinks it comes down to my inability to play what he calls ""girl games."" I think girl games is a phrase used for childish little kids male and female, but I do admit that I'm horrible at them and also flat out refuse to play when I do recognize them happening. If this situation boils down to the fact that I need to be better at them though, let me know please and tell me how to play them better lol",11Nov2018,1

So, my life has been extremely hard recently and I don't know exactly what it is but i'm probably gonna talk about a few things in this post. I'm beginning to be suicidal because of whats been happening, recently, I have been starting to lose friends as I started highschool (in Scotland) not that long ago and have been feeling fucked up for ages too. I am starting to fall behind in most of my classes and have been doing everything wrong; I have been making other people feel bad which in return makes me feel bad, I have terrible handwriting and no one can read it (it looks like a 7 year olds handwriting), I have been saying bad stuff about people, I have been arguing with tons of people, I always mess up in classes and not do what I am meant to do. I also feel I have nothing to live for as I am not interested in anything and have no hobbies either, and I don't know anything at home and just stay bored most of the time. Everything I do makes me feel anxious, especially talking to people. And I have a solo talk and another big project coming up which I have no idea what to do them on since i'm not interested in **anything** interesting (to other people at least) **at ALL**. This has made me feel even more terrible about life since whatever I do it on, if I even get to that day alive, it is probably going to be shit and people are going to laugh at me. And everything I have done in the past and all the times I have tried to ask for help I just pretty much keep getting rejected and told that I am just attention seeking, all my opinions were also laughed at in the past making me extremely kept to myself; I rarely show emotion and I just about never share my opinion. This is what makes me unwilling to go ask for help as I will probably get laughed at anyway. My brother also got diagnosed with depression earlier this year which makes me even more likely to be depressed. I have tried a whole ton of stuff to try and make me feel better, like exercising, attempting to talk to people more, fixing my sleep schedule (since I usually only get about 6-7 hours of sleep. I also have a fuck ton of weird habits and things about me like being a furry, no one apart from people online know about these things, people online probably know more about me than my family and friends. Another thing that is weird about me is that I probably masturbate way too much and leaves me fucked up in the brain. I feel like I have nothing to live for and have started to think about suicide, the only thing that has stopped from doing it so far is my family, even though they are terrible a lot of the time. I wish I didn't care so much about other peoples emotions so I can just end it all right now easily without feeling guilty about it. I have nothing to do anymore, nothing to pursue, nothing to keep me from thinking about killing myself, not many people to care about, almost nothing left in my life, it all just feels hollow.

I joined the church band and the church social media team. But as I got older (I'm 20 now) I started questioning everything about religion. I started to hate going to church every Friday and Sunday. And then having bible study at my house on Wednesdays. It took up too much time. And I pretty much didn't have a life because of it. I'm lucky I even have friends and a girlfriend. So I started to renounce my religion. And now I don't know what I am. But it's definitely not Christian anymore.

451,"Hello,  


I have a friend who I have talked to for many years, but whenever he talks to me he always leaves out so much information when he says things to me that I have to spend so much effort asking him questions to figure out what the hell he's talking about and it annoys me so much. I've brought it up to him and he still doesn't do anything about it. (I think he's just really dumb so he can't help it)  


Examples:  
He randomly messaged me what's your address I'm going to stop by after work. So I ask him what do you mean? Why so suddenly, are you going to come right now or something and what for? He then replies it's\* near where we're going to eat. I then have to assume he means where we are going to eat KBBQ in a 7, I'm assuming, but am unsure because he didn't specify crap and literally saying as little as possible. He then replies after next week, I'll stop by. It's really frustrating to talk to him because he always does this no matter the situation.  


Another example is when we play League of Legends (pc game for those who don't know) There are a lot of characters you can use and he's played for years so you'd think he  would know the names of the characters, but he doesn't so when he talked to me he says. The person who shoots arrows is op\* (overpowered). I have to ask him who are you talking about? He doesn't know and I have to keep asking him questions because there are multiple characters that shoot arrows. I finally figure out he's talking about Varus. So I mention to him oh yea he's pretty good, but Vayne(another marksman in the game) is more annoying to play against. He then says who's vayne? So I have to spend even more effort explaining to him because he doesn't know the names of characters even though he's played for several years now.  


TLDR I have to spend so much effort to have a normal conversation with him and it really annoys me.  


Should I be annoyed with him or not because he is clearly not going to change the way he talks. He's done it for years.",11Nov2018,1

456,"Okay guys. I'm desperate, I've hit rock bottom. I never had a problem with being alone. After years of intense therapy I've finally started becoming more connected with how I feel again. That's been great! A real life saver honestly.

*The only thing is, I've come to realise the pain of feeling utterly alone.*

Since I was a kid I was involved in taking care of my dad who I lived alone with. He was an addict and he relied heavily on me to be around for him. I feared if left him to live my own life, then I would risk losing him to drugs entirely. 

*This left me with almost no social interaction growing up, now aged 26 and feeling as if I dont have a friend  in the world, I want to change that!*

For context I spend a lot of my time alone, isolated and dull my loneliness with video games. Overwatch is life for me when I'm not at work. I'm afraid of people and afraid that I'm never going to get free from this isolation. The only socialising I've been capable of thus far is long distance. (Texting, letter writing, Skype etc) 

When I'm forced to interact with others at work or therapy groups, I find myself never really being able to open up wholeheartedly and I avoid contact at all costs. I put up a front and dont let people really know me if possible.

I'm miserable, I can't even imagine what it's like to have a friend or be surrounded by people who admire, love, care about me. I often watch YouTube videos of people having fun together with friends and family and wonder what that must be like.

Reddit, I can't talk to anyone about this. I'm desperate, if you have any advice. No matter how small. Please help. Where should I begin? ",11Nov2018,1
457,"Please note I don't think I have great social intelligence. To the point where I show almost all symptoms of Asperger's, but I actually couldn't get a diagnosis for that, since it developed over my life rather than being something I was born with. I also zone out all the time.  


The result of this is that I end up doing things that some people who are more social find very uncomfortable. They then start talking about me behind my back, even though in the moment I don't actually notice there is a problem. If I go to these people and ask them what I did that made them uncomfortable in the most respectful way I can, they have given me answers that are too general for me to understand. Or have completely ignored me. When I ask for an example they say that there is no problem and that asking for the specifics is the problem. So I can't do that. But then if I am in a social situation again I feel like they treat me with an apparent neutrality and behind my back talk about things I've done that they won't even describe to me. I don't know what the rules are. These people are seemingly among the most popular in my community partially because of their social skills. It's very hard for me to make new friends and I have some good ones in this community, but I feel like I have to leave them behind because they're better friends with the more social people. I don't want to leave this entire community behind because of a few toxic people. But I can't really enjoy myself anymore in any social situation knowing/ not knowing fully what is happening behind the scenes. I feel like any move is the wrong move. Any suggestions?",11Nov2018,1
458,"I just started Uni in September and I’m... not sure. 

I like the people in my course, my flat, the social life and all that. I just don’t feel like course is doing anything for me and I don’t feel motivated or interested in work. I basically procrastinate and put off the work. I don’t want to waste money for the next three years. 

For context my parents didn’t go to uni and my older brother is doing engineering and they are so proud of him for it. I don’t want to let them down. My course is more in Media which sort of speaks for itself.

459,"So, this is more of an advice post, rather than an Answer post. I work at a special care unit, tending to mentally unstable patients. Basically an adult babysitter. However, my hours are usually quite sporadic. One day i may have fewer than a 4-hour shift. Others, I work 24+. I've only worked there for, around 4 months. But my longest shift has been 29 hours.

7 A.M. - 12 P.M the following day. That was my only shift that week. It's not rare for me to work 24-hour shifts. Actually, it's pretty common. I'd say I'm forced to do it 1-2 a month. But in the 4 months I've worked here, I've never gotten over 40 hours a week. My employer will only schedule us for around 39 hours. **NEVER** 40. I don't think an employee has ever been given overtime at this job. And before you say, you're getting paid to sleep. During ""sleep hours"" as management calls it. We are paid minimum wage. Every other time, our pay is 14.50 USD an hour. And my employer uses this sleep time, as a means to pay workers less. For every 24 hour shift, 11 hours fall under the sleep hours category. When in reality, most of us only get 3-4 hours of sleep anyway. Since we've got a ton of responsibilities.

I guess I'm just asking if this is even legal, or if there is anything I can do here. These hours are brutal, and I'm not sure how much longer I can put up with it...",11Nov2018,1
460,"So here’s the thing Reddit, as usual I don’t know what to do and I’m hoping one of you shiny repositories of knowledge is ahead of the game and can catch me up. I don’t know a better way to explain this than a wall of text, so for that I apologize. And thanks in advance for any and all recommendations.

***tl;dr:*** ***Should I start a GoFundMe? Is there a better alternative site? Is the begging for crowdsourced handouts after a tragedy shitty? I don’t know what to do.***

The best person I’ve ever known just lost everything in the Camp Fire as it destroyed Paradise, California. I’ve been reading “what to do when someone loses everything” type results from Google today. The general consensus seems to be to send money if you can, send gift cards if you can’t send cash or transfer funds, and then offer and follow through on actual physical help like watching kids and cooking meals and cleaning up after disasters, helping move things et cetera.

I’m over 1,700 miles away and crawling out of debt with my VA disability income. I feel like I’m failing the one person that I should never be unable to help, not that she would ever ask for it. Do I just see if USAA will loan me money even though I’m already in debt? I make my payments and I’m making progress, does that matter though? Or do I do the whole “*Hey internet can you please be cool and throw some coin at someone truly deserving?*” thing with like GoFundMe? What can I actually realistically do to get her access to funds for underwear and clothes for herself and her family, food, toiletries, hotel and into a rental or something? My brain just goes straight to reddit and all the posts of people being bros and offering to get in touch and help with things, and I imagine all these GoFundMe pages I’ve seen for other families and tragedies. But I’m worried I’m just being naïve, and I’m too uncomfortable with asking people for money to know how to go about doing exactly that. I just don’t know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Not that this part really matters, I just don’t know what else to say, so I figured I’d tell anyone interested about the greatest person they’ve never met. I met her at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California. By this point she had already studied abroad in high school, and volunteered for service in the Army to learn yet another language and help others. She is the mythical person that completely encompasses the best virtues and is incapable of wavering on them. She is the embodiment of integrity. She exceeded the scoring metrics to graduate from DLI with gold stickers and all that jazz. She learned all the facets of the signals intelligence positions and excelled in her work in Iraq. She is the kind of person you wish all TS//SCI clearance holders actually were. She married her college sweetheart and they moved back to the Chico area where they grew up, settling down in Paradise, CA. They have two young children. She’s never mean, never thoughtless or callous, has no ill will or selfish intent in her nature. She deserves more than she’s got from life, and now she’s lost everything in a fire. This isn’t right, and I’m afraid I’m in no position to right it.",11Nov2018,1
461,"//TDLR at the bottom//

Okay, so, I'm a sophomore in high school. I transferred to a new high school at the beginning of the school year and developed a stupid crush two weeks into the first quarter. I thought I'd get over it or get the guts to just approach the guy, but it hasn't happened. It's November, almost Thanksgiving break, and I will be so mad at myself if I get to the beginning of the next semester and haven't talked to him. So, my goal is to at least make friends with him before Christmas break.

Some background; we have a ridiculously abrasive fourth hour teacher who constantly insults and yells at all the students and almost no one will stand up to her. I actually got into an argument with her on the first day of class. First week or second week of school, the guy I like- we'll call him Jay- is getting bitched at by her and he actually stands up and calls her out for being as disrespectful as she is. Against my better judgement, I was like, huh, that's kinda hot. So I pay more attention to him. I don't go as far as to note everything he does or constantly look for him, but I do spare him a glance or two whenever we're in class. Sometimes, I think he's looking back at me, but I doubt that's true. 

There's honestly... Something about him, you know? Like, hear me out. He's energetic and magnetic in this way that I've never seem before, it's like he's drawing people in. Whenever he's smiling or talking, people can't help but pay attention. He's just bright and interesting, loud and outgoing, smart and opinionated, open and outspoken. 

I just don't see it happening. I'm not unattractive, don't get me wrong. I'm no model, but I like to think I'm pretty and have a decent fashion sense- I'm nothing special in that aspect, I basically just happen to wear what a lot of other people are wearing. I think he's the most gorgeous person I've ever seen, but all of my friends think he's unattractive and say he looks scary. In fact, one friend says ""he looks like he listens to death metal, mugs freshmen for lunch money, and smokes weed"". Jay does smoke weed, BTW. Him and his friends started sitting at the table next to mine during lunch, let's just say he talks very loudly. Anyways. It's not about the looks. 

See, although he seems approachable and like a genuinely nice guy, something about him makes me... Afraid. I'm probably just afraid of rejection. I'm actually friends with some of his friends and I'm still afraid to approach him. Another thing, I've never seen him with a girl. Ever. Not even a friend. His lunch group is literally him and like, 8-12 other guys. He honestly gives off straight vibes, though, I don't really know about his relationship situation. I'm not into his personal business like that LMFAO. I just kinda assume he's single.

So. I need help approaching him. Even if it's just for a friendship. He seems like a great guy and I admire him a lot, even in a non romantic way. He's just super awesome. I just... Never talk to him. I've never really felt this way before. How would you suggest I go about it?

TLDR; I like this cool guy in my science class who we'll call Jay and want to talk to him and become friends before the end of the semester, but I'm a transfer student who hangs out in a different crowd. I usually never have trouble making friends, but I'm inexperienced when it comes to talking to people I'm interested in and don't wanna seem weird but don't really know what I'm doing. How should I go about at least becoming friends with this dude before the end of the semester?

466,"This is probably not a question that will get much better attention, either because it's too generic or too not interesting enough. But if I'm lost enough to seen the help of complete strangers then at the very least I hope someone can give me some insight. 

I'm sorry if this is an overly long story, but I feel that all of it is important for context. 

I attended college around 4 hours from my hometown, so when I left town my girlfriend and I agreed to make long distance work as she was still in highschool. Obviously long distance relationships suck, but we did just fine during my first year. I was an active member of the marching band and did well in my classes. 

At the beginning of my sophomore year I met a freshman (I guess I'll call her Liz for the purposes of this post) who played the same instrument as me during our pre-season practices and had grown up in the same town as me although we'd somehow never met. I don't necessarily believe in ""love at first sight,"" but the first time I saw her I felt something. We went on to become friends and even worked together in a market on campus (a job that we both agreed was truly awful but that we stayed at almost exclusively because of the one day er week that we got to work together).

By this point I knew that I had feelings for her (which I know makes me a shitty person), but I was committed to my girlfriend (see my previous comment about shittyness) and I knew that she felt the same about her boyfriend. 

Things came to a head when our band went to perform in Paris, France. The whole group stayed in a hotel in the city for about one week and was given plenty of free time to explore the city when not performing. 

One night (and I realize this sounds like a cheesy scene from some movie) we we're sitting at the top of the Arc de Triomphe, and we finally admitted that we had feelings for each other. We both had since the beginning. We were both happy and terrified at the same time, and agreed after a long talk back at the hotel that we'd make it back home and decide what to do from there. 

It took me next to no time to realize that I wanted to be with her enough to leave my girlfriend, and that it would be unfair to stay with her while having these kind of feelings for someone else. She deserved better than that. 

The day after I got home we broke up, and she put everything I'd ever given her in a pile on her front porch. I deserved that. The next day, Liz told me she wasn't going to leave her boyfriend. 

Naturally, I was heartbroken. I spent that summer working a far better job at the University, and after I learned that she wasn't planning on returning to school in the same city as me, I tried to move on. Still, I never stopped wanting to be with her. 

I'll skip over a meat chunk of the story for the sake of brevity, but there were two or three times I thought be were finally close to being together, especially after she and her boyfriend broke up. I do know that she was struggling with some personal issues and I can't possibly blame her for not wanting to just right into a new relationship. 

We stopped talking for a while, and I started a new relationship with a classmate at school (May, for the purposes of this story). Because I'm apparently on a mission to inform Reddit that I'm an awful person, it's important to say that she was in a long distance relationship at the time, but she wanted out and we jumped the gun. 

May isn't a person who does well with conflict, even if it means being dishonest. This being the case, she dragged out the process of breaking up with her boyfriend for about a year, and like a moron and a terrible person I stuck around for the whole thing. Eventually, after I finally gave her a two week deadline (which she beat by about 1 hour), she broke up with him.   

I loved her, and I'm really stupid, so I treated all of this as something in the past, and believed that the rest of our relationship would be smoother. 

A few weeks later Liz texted me, having recently left an abusive relationship. She finally wanted to be with me. I couldn't believe it, and it couldn't have come at a worse time. I wanted her, but I felt that I needed to give me and May a genuine chance at having a real relationship. So I said no, and we didn't talk again for months. 

Since then May and I have both graduated and are living in our respective hometowns, roughly 3 hours apart. We've had some honestly issues. Nothing like cheating, but more of her not telling me important things or her trying to be kind to others who had feelings for her from feeling rejected by saying ""if things were different then maybe..."" for extended periods of time time without telling me anything about the situation. I never felt good about these issues, but I believed that the rest of our relationship was solid enough that things would get better so long as we could improve our communication. 

After reconnecting several months ago, Liz asked me if I wanted to go out with her and some of her friends for a couple of drinks. I'm still with May, and she's dating someone new and has been for a few months.

This is the part where the advice comes in. It also happened two days ago. 

I'm a terrible person, and even though I'm with May, I've never stopped loving Liz. After a few drinks, she said that we needed to talk about what was going on between us, and I agreed. We stepped away from the group around the corner, and started talking. I told her that I still had feelings for her, and she said she felt the same. We both agreed that the timing couldn't have been worse, but that that had been a trend with us since the beginning. 

Then she kissed me. A minute later I kissed her back. It felt like something out of a dream, and not just because I had actually dreamed of it before. 

She asked me if I was ready to break up with May, and I said that I didn't want to hurt her, but I knew that I would regret not taking the leap for the rest of my life with. Not long after she went home with her friend and I left as well. 

The next morning (yesterday) we had a sober conversation about what would happen next between us. I said, not wanting to pressure her in any way, that we would need to either stay platonic friends or take steps to be together for real. 

I didn't want to put any pressure on her, but I wrote out an embarrassingly long message telling her that I wanted to be with her, even if it meant abandoning a relationship with a person I cared about deeply and had put nearly two years into. I chickened out, though, and didn't send it.

A few hours later she told me she didn't want to end things with her boyfriend. I said I understood, because I did. We talked a bit more, and agreed that we'd been in love for nearly four years, but the timing just never worked out. 

I'm determined to respect her relationship and give her whatever space she might need, but I've been shaking for two days. Food isn't appealing. I want to drink. I want to rip out the part of me that feels. 

Alongside coming closer than I've ever been to being with Liz, I betrayed May. I kissed someone else, and I've fully admitted both to Liz and myself that I'm in love with someone who isn't my girlfriend. I feel like every shitty guy in every story about pieces of shit who do this kind of thing. 

I say all of that to ask this: what do I do?

I want to be honest with May, but to be honest with her I'll need to destroy her heart and not only damn her with the knowledge of my shitty actions, but also the fact that as little as one day ago I had one foot out the door. She's a wonderful person and deserves to be with someone who can be 100% invested in a relationship. Not someone who feels like he's waiting for someone else. I'm horrible, but I know that's wrong. 

On the other hand, I love May too, and we've been happy together despite the bumpy path we took. I don't want to remove Liz from my life entirely, but if I made it impossible for us to be together maybe I could learn to get over her. But a huge part of me doesn't want to. 

If doing the right thing means I'm miserable and alone then so be it. I know I've done so much wrong.  I just don't want to hurt anyone else. Do I stay with May and hope my feelings for Liz disappear? Do I break up with May for her own sake and try to move on with my life? Do I make 100% sure that Liz knows how I feel instead of chickening out? Do I just move across the fucking country and try to forget about the whole thing?

If you've managed to make it through this novella I sincerely appreciate it. Any advice you can give me will mean more than you could imagine. I don't have anyone else to turn to. 

Also I'm so sorry for what I'm assuming are the dozens of typos in this text. Like I said, I've been shaking and my heart has been racing for the last two days. 

Sincerely, if nothing else, thank you for listening. Just getting this shit out of me has been the closest thing I've found to catharsis.

469,"Firstly, a disclaimer, I'm not implying that being a parent isn't mentally stimulating in itself-I'm very aware that it's very challenging at times, and does require a lot of careful thought and attention. She's doing an amazing job as a mum.

However, my wife is quite used to thinking complicated things through (before having our baby she was in healthcare, and pretty good at it), but now that she's given up her job to be a mum (and is very unlikely to go back to work for a good number of years), she's noticed that she misses the problem solving and intense thought that she was used to nearly every day.

I'm working full time, so care of our child mainly falls on my wife during the week, so she's certainly busy enough that she's not bored (what with feeding, playing, napping, cleaning, etc.), and I try my best to do as much as possible when I'm not at work so that she can have time to get stuck into other things, but very little of the day to day stuff really requires a lot of mental effort.

She's very creative, and for as long as I've known her, she's always had a number of projects on the go (from knitting, sewing, making cards, etc. to designing new patterns), and she does manage to get a little bit of time in the week to work on these (not as much as before our baby, but a bit of time here and there, and she still rattles out a constant supply of jumpers, socks and scarfs!), but again these rarely really stimulate her mentally, since I think they've mainly been an 'easy' thing to do to relax from her work (not that I would find it easy, but she's been doing this sort of thing since she was a child). She's also an avid reader, and is now getting through an average of one book a week.

In terms of practicalities, anything I suggest would have to be something she can dip in and out of, to work around the needs of our baby (coming up to 1 year old), and be something she can do from home.

I'm just coming up short on ideas of things to suggest that she could do to stretch herself mentally again, so I wondered if anyone here has any ideas?

TL;DR: What can my wife do to keep herself mentally stimulated, in the same way a complicated healthcare job did, whilst at the same time looking after a baby?

Some back story, I'm 20 (F) and I've never dated anyone.  It's always been a mix of a lack of interest and a complete fear of it. As someone who managed to not even make a single friend till I was 17, it's fair to say I am socially inept.

- He's bi.
- He's objectively out of my league. (I.e. I'm fuck ugly lmao)
- We hang out all the time, spending hours and hours talking constantly, and I always look forward to seeing him, he's told me he feels the same way. 

But here's the important one. 
- Due to having little to no social skills, I am completely unable to read the situation. 

We are really good friends, however, I don't know what to do.  What if he sees me as a friend and I'm falling for someone who doesn't feel the same? What if my feeling this way impacts the friendship group negatively? Shit, what if there is something there?

I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't, because if he likes me, I'm terrified, and if he doesn't (far more likely) then why tf am I doing this to myself? 

How do I stop this nonsense because honestly fuck this whole feeling, I hate it. Help me.

I have applied for various courses for university, however, I still don’t know if I’m actually interested in doing such courses or would I be bored of them in one year and it’ll just be waste of money. 

I really don’t know what to do and I know that it is normal to feel lost after high school but what if I don’t find something that I actually like and enjoy for the rest my life. I know that with time I would be able to figure everything out and positivity is the key but would love any advice. Thank you",11Nov2018,1
476,"lly like this guy. We get along so well and have major chemistry, we are usually challenging with each other and share a lot of laughs. Can someone help me come up with a good response to this message he sent me?? Maybe I am over thinking it but I want to get him thinking too lol

We were talking about how similar our languages both are, he’s Greek and I’m Lebanese. He told me he was Greek/Macedonian, so I said aren’t they the same? Macedonia is in Greece if I’m not mistaken.
Then he said it is the same, but they would never admit that lol so I said it’s like being Chaldean! Chaldeans where I’m from are always ashamed to say they are Chaldean for some reason. I told him I think that’s stupid and everyone should be Their self :)
His response? : I’m Nigerian.

What’s a good response to this? He’s not Nigerian, just joking with me lol but what’s something I can say to keep the shock value?


Thanks in advance! :)",11Nov2018,1
477,"I'm a bit of a reserved person, there are only a handful of people that I consider my true friends. I completely trust my small circle close friends and I love spending time with them even if it means just sitting in the same room as we do different things. They don't seem to feel the same. I feel like everyone I truly like a lot does not have the same reciprocate emotions towards me and it kinda hurts my feelings...how do I deal with that?",11Nov2018,1
478,"My mom was an abusive, selfish, and narcissistic psychopath. An adulterer, at one point an independent prostitute. She was never home when it was her turn to take care of us. She came home drunk a lot. She’s a compulsive liar who never takes any blame. She physically and emotionally abused my dad. Constantly manipulating him and threatening to kill herself if she didn’t get a dress or something. I left her house when I was 12 after she punched my younger brother in the throat so hard he couldn’t swallow solid food and was on the brink of death for 6 months. I haven’t seen her for 6 years since I walked out that door and ran to my dad’s. Due to complications and my dad having financial issues she still got child support after we left and used it to get breast implants.  She’s remarried( she was still a prostitute during their relationship and I don’t think he knows). She recently gave birth to my half sister about a year and a half ago. Sometimes I wanna just tell her how terrible a person she is, but I know she’ll be in denial. Today I unblocked her from Facebook and was tempted to write a letter. She is unaware that I actually understood the stuff she was doing and sees me as a misguided kid brainwashed by my dad. What are some options I could take?",11Nov2018,1
479,"I’m taking a chemistry class as part of an engineering degree. My understanding at this point (about three quarters through the semester) is very weak and my final grade will likely fall very close to the pass/fail line. This is mostly due to difficulty trying to get a severe case of ADHD and a suspected learning disability under control.

If this were a history or English class, I’d probably just take the hit to my GPA. But given that I’ll actually need this at some point (and that I’m genuinely interested in it) I feel the need to do it over.

Couple of by-the-ways:
I’ve thought about just trying to learn all of it on Khan academy later but the lack of structure is extremely difficult with all my learning issues.
The reason I’m not just dropping the class is because I’d like to at least be exposed to the material before taking it again. Helps out with the attention stuff I talked about.

TL;DR:
Need chemistry for engineering.
Very weak understanding.
Could pass but with a bad grade and no opportunity to take it again.",11Nov2018,1
