1,"I don t know exactly where to post this, but maybe you guys can help me. 
So I just moved today to this new appartement and I m sharing it with two other flatmates.
Everything was good and all, at first the house cat they have seemed friendly enough so i didnt think twice about it.

Unfortunately today when one of my flatmates left, and left me alone, I tried to bond with the fucker and pet him. Huge fucking mistake, after trying to pet him two times it started scratching me, I thought it was just rough playing, but the little fucker made me bleed. And to make things worse it keeps following me arround the house hissing and what not. 
It ambushes me when I m least expecting and fucking attacks my ankles.
I really feel uncomfortable with this fucking pet constantly stalking me competing for territory.
I have no idea what to do. I tried imposing myself and make some noise ( didn't work, he only came after me more aggressively )
Tried to leave him alone
(i tricked him into thinking I was in the living room and quickly came running to my bed room to lock the door, cause he keeps fucking following me), but he still ambushes me when I leave the room.
I m honestly becoming terrified of this animal. I have a bunch of scratches on my ankles and arms, and he hisses so loud when he attacks me that it downright scares me.
As I m typing this on my phone he s scratching the door hoping I let him in so he can attack me. 
Do you guys have any advice? 
Plz help me :(",27May2018,2

I have a very good friend who i have been friends with for over 3 coming on 4 years. They have had a very very hard life. So all the time i hoped good things would come to them, and was there when things were hard. We have talked everyday for the last 3 years since we have become friends. even if its just a few moments to say i am doing ok i hope you are too. about a month ago, they got a girlfriend. words cant begin to describe how happy i was for them because he really has liked her for while, and needed something good. but since hes been with her we haven't talked since the day they got together. but one time in the past month and it was me texting them asking how are you, i got ok back. i wanna be happy and i am happy for my friend. but i feel so bad that i am lonely now. i don't know what to do. i do not have many friends at all, and i haven't had a friend for as long as i have had him. i feel selfish and bad for missing our friendship, i want good things for him, but i am so lonely now and i don't know what to do. I feel so sick and gross for being upset about this.  I've been busy this month doing stuff, its not the time we sent together i miss, its someone to talk to. that i know i can trust to not judge and help me.

4,"been doing a bunch of personality tests and I've got a picture of what personality type I have.

It's not something I have a problem with having because at the end it feels like me and that's what's important but then when I think about it more it feels like if I will have this personality type forever I might get hindered from doing things like progressing in careers.  

Is every personality type uiltimately capable of being able to have very well careers or leading positions or are there only the few personality types that can do this?

I live in a very small rural Alaskan town. Keep in mind, everyone knows everyone and I’ve known these coworkers who are harassing him for years and years, and even worked in this same store for many years myself. 
So, my little brother works at 1 of the 2 grocery stores in my town. He messaged me today saying how he gets harassed at work by his coworkers. He’s a nice, quiet guy and just wants to keep to himself all the time. He is the only one in his department (produce) for pretty much the entire day. He works in close proximity to the meat and bakery departments. The guys from there are losers I’ve gone to school with/worked with and generally like to goof off and do immature shit instead of work.
My brother said they like to throw things like biscuit dough at him, until he finally yells at them to stop and they all just laugh at him and do whatever. The store manager, of course, is never too worried about this behavior and just brushes it off because the harassers are people who have been at the store for years, which is hard to come by with the high turnover rate. 
What should I do to help him, other than offer advice on how to deal with bullies, and telling him to go to HR headquarters if our store manager won’t do anything? Should I go to these people myself, and ask them to stop treating my brother this way? Or to the manager? I know them all well, my bro just isn’t one to stand up for himself. How can I help him?

10,"Hiya r/Advice,

I'm feeling quite conflicted at the moment and would really appreciate some help.

To provide a bit of backstory,  I'm a 16-year-old guy from London that is struggling with trying to date girls I go to an all boys school that lets girls in the sixth form. I'm currently about halfway through my first year in a mixed-sex year, and things are going pretty well on the whole -- although I still have off days, these are getting rarer and rarer and my social anxiety (which was high in the first two weeks) has almost disappeared. I've recently started going to the gym, which has really helped my mood and confidence, and feel content with myself as a whole. Except, that is, in one department. The dating department.

Where I struggle is asking a girl out and approaching them. I've reached the stage whereby I can fairly comfortably talk to both girls and guys I know with minimal problems on a friendly level. However, I really find it difficult to escalate a conversation past this point. I'm a big overthinker, and in trying to work up the courage my brain decides to spiral into thinking of every possible negative outcome and pulling up any time I've ever been rejected in the past. Worse still, I've had girls openly say that they'd date me or find me attractive, but I rationalise it away by saying that they're just being friendly or they don't mean it. While this may be true, I end up never knowing because I never actually follow up on anything due to fears of rejection, making the girl uncomfortable, and being gossiped about, in any order you like.

This has meant that, while most of my mates are regularly going to parties, losing their virginity, or at least trying to message a girl in a non-platonic way, my social media is barely active. There's one girl that I talk to regularly, who's one of my best mates and an absolute lovely girl (let's call her Amy). All of my mates say that me and her as their top ship, but because I don't want to ask her if she likes me I've got no idea how she feels. I'm not even particularly attracted to her sexually, but have started to develop feelings for her and cannot express these without my brain rationalising it away.  It's really frustrating when other guys seem to just have this ability to ask girls out, and live fulfilling romantic lives as a result.

I'm a very empathic person (I want to be a psychologist when I'm older) and would hate to make a girl uncomfortable by being awkward - it cringes me out thinking about it. At the same time, I'm not ready to lose my virginity yet, but would like to at least get past this mental hurdle, as I want to keep building myself as a person and not be scared for the future.

What should I do? There are plenty of girls I find attractive; should I try and talk to them more on a friendly level? Does that address the problem? Or should I ask Amy if she likes me, even though we've known each other for nearly six months now? I'm at a crossroads, and would really appreciate your advice, whatever it is.

Finally, thank you, whoever you are, for taking the time to read this. I'm sure in 10 years I'll look back at this pouring-out of emotions as a much wiser person and laugh, but in the meantime it feels a bit demeaning.

TL:DR Struggling with trying to ask girls out and romantic life in general, could really use some guidance.

11,"Okay, so I've been tutoring/babysitting for this family for about four years -- a mom, dad, and three boys. The oldest son (15) is totally whack. His mom has told me that he mild tourettes and I know he's super neurotic, but he's also just a huge asshole. Like says racist things, homophobic things, lies, gaslights his parents and also says super inappropriate, sexual things to me. It got so bad that his parents put him in therapy and removed me from having to work with him -- I only work with the other two boys now (13 + 9) who, while not angels, are nowhere near as awful as their older brother. Anyways, about a week ago, I was with the 13 year old, who was on a break and playing fortnite. The 15 year old comes in, and watching his brother, who is about to win, goes ""If you win this game, _________, I'll jerk you off,"" and makes the jerking off hand gesture in front of his brother. WTF? I was so shocked I couldn't even react, and the brother didn't react either so I was kinda like ......? Then, today, the 15 year old said to the 13 year old ""Want me to suck your dick, ____________?"" It was like totally random, the other brother had just come into the room to get something. Is this normal between brothers?? The younger brother isn't even reacting it...I asked my friend who has four brothers and she says she's never heard them saying anything like that. Should I tell their parents? Should I ask the younger brother how he feels about it??",27May2018,2
12,"Hello, I need some advice.
I am working on a project but work full time as a lyft driver. I’ve worked corporate jobs but needed flexibility so I could just focus and take the time I need. (I wasn’t at the top of the food chain in my 9-5 lifestyle) but I am able to usually network with ease... it’s really just a mix of serendipity and a numbers game. 

I’ve been driving for lyft for 7 months. The networking Is not totally intentional I’ve been blessed with the gift of gab and people will give me there number or biz card. I’ll follow up and it’s even lead to some good networking meetings.

On one occasion about 4 months ago I met a really cool contact. He is a physicist in a certain area of the tech sector. I don’t have a science background but I have scientist in my family and physicist are like celebrities to me. I had a fantastic conversation and I really wanted to pick up the conversation again. He even said he might have usage for the project I’m developing.

A few days after I met this physicist I emailed and didn’t get response, a week later I sent an email follow up with casual enthusiastic style, (clearly I’m crushing out)

Confessional part: I neurotically try to call him with an anonymous number, he’s out of the country on business and he ask me to send a calendar invite for coffee when he’s back... he never responds. I felt lame for my approach... usually I’m pretty good about this stuff.

Finally I let it go but a few months later I realize his company is one of the best at what I need. 

The questions is, I know where he works and I have this thought that as a lyft driver he doesn’t know my level of professionalism. I didn’t look my best and I’m wearing shlumpy clothes. I would like to casually drop by his office dressed up very nicely and snag ten minutes of his time. I’ll have other meetings to drop by on that day as well.

Please give advice on this situation? Also when I snag that ten minute of time it would be to quickly pitch my project and also apologize for the obnoxious call and email. If then this person is like I don’t need you as a contact I’ll have my answer.

Thank You in advance!! If you need any other detail let me know.

13,"Ok, so hopefully this doesn't turn into a wall of text \(lol yeah right\).  Throwaway because my main has too many details about my life. 

So here it is.  I'm 23, F, living in my hometown but independent from my parents.  I graduated from a good university two years ago, and have been working in my current position for the past year.  

**Education/Career**

I do not enjoy what I'm in 100k of debt to practice.  I joined the environmental field \(environmental health and safety to be specific\) because I wanted to help people, make a difference, etc.  I was super excited to land a job at our local branch of \*global environmental firm\*.  I've gotten to learn how a business like this works and how the regulatory world looks for large businesses. That's all well and good, but the work both sucks and I see a ton of burnout in our upper level project managers.  Since I'm a junior staff my work is often repetitive and when it does get challenging, it's far beyond my scope so I have to ask for help, and that person just takes care of it.  Additionally, we as a company don't discriminate who we do work with.  So if \*evil multinational\* needs permitting help, we will gladly take their money and help them. 

* I think it would be nice to do non\-profit work \(Nature Conservancy, Sierra Club\) but those jobs are few and far between. 
* I don't want to go back to school as I've just been scratching the surface of my loans and do not want to add to it.
* I saw a job posting for a college tutoring center coordinator.  That and other higher\-ed jobs seem interesting and fulfilling but have a high barrier to entry for someone with such a left\-field degree. 
* I also don't want to not use this 100k piece of paper 

**Personal/Friendships**

I was never super social in college \(same city as hometown\) and while I did go to parties, join clubs, nobody really stuck with me.  I didn't live in dorms and commuted all 4 years so I imagine that was a huge factor in my social life.  Anyway. 

This past weekend has solidified how shitty my few friends are in this city. 

* Asked friend A what she was doing this weekend.  She, her brother and our other mutual friend and her boyfriend are going camping. I'm super outdoorsy, she knows this, everyone knows this.  I wasn't invited until I asked \- I don't wish to be an afterthought / subject to a pity invite. 
* Met up with friend B. I brought my dogs over to her house for a playdate, and a few of her friends came by too \(no dogs with them\).  Her friend was asking me about the dogs, making conversation, whatever. Then friend B leans over and mutters to her ""she got her from a breeder"" as if it's a dirty thing.  God forbid I choose where I get a dog  and give it a good life.   The dog in question isn't even my dog it's my boyfriends and her breeder is fantastic. It was super uncomfortable feeling so judged for something so silly. I'm all for rescuing dogs.  If i'm in the position to get another I'll check the pounds first.  Geeze. 

**Overall**

I'm just kind of stuck. I don't know how to make friends outside of school, and how to find ones that aren't lowkey shitty.  I don't know what I should do in terms of career trajectory.  I need help with some concrete steps to take so I can stop feeling like I'm treading water. ",27May2018,1

15,"Parents of Reddit:

My husband and I have a 7 week old and a 5 year old. I am currently still at home full-time with the baby and pick up our 5 year old after pre-k every day and tuck into bed every night. My husband takes her to school in the mornings, but has been having to work late a lot the past few weeks (getting home at 1:30am most nights) so it’s mostly just me with the kids.

Since he’s hardly home, I am finding it difficult to divide my time and include the 5yo. I don’t want her to feel left out or replaced. She has a nasty attitude most days and has been starting to act up in school. She’s never behaved like this before.

I’m sure she’s just jealous of the new baby, but I try to include her by letting her help me change diapers and hold the baby if I need to do something.

16,"I don't know where to start so I'm sorry if this is all over the place.

It's very hard for me to go through life without being in contact with any of my family members on my dads side. My grma , great grma , auntie .

My dad texts me every year on my birthday, says "" happy birthday "" and that's all until my next birthday.

I wanna ask him why he never tried to have a relationship with me, How bad it's hurt me and all the times I wanted to text him but was told by mom "" I don't want you begging to text him, a child shouldn't have to reach out to a grown man "" so I still stand by this today. But I really wanna text him and ask him why he never wanted to have a relationship with me? 

I already know he is gonna try to blame my mom, "" oh she was too complicated and made it to hard "" ..

But I was already made aware that he doesn't have to deal with my mother to deal with me which she has stated many times, so don't think my mom is keeping him from me. He has a wife and she has 2 kids around my age and he does all for them and nothing for me, besides child support. But why child support when I actually rather have a father figure? 

It hurts to see everyone with there fathers and I'm over here telling myself "" it's ok , he just never wanted me "" so basically my question is how should I ask him? Should I ask him? And what should I say exactly?

19,"Okay, this will be long. The basics: 3.5 year relationship. About a year in, he goes to college. Next year, I go to college. Typical long distance college relationship. I just broke it off for reasons to be described below. My previous relationship was verbally and sexually abusive, which leads to trust issues and very low sex drive. Current relationship has been very supportive and helpful in regards to that.
So, the issues: a yearish ago, he started trading nudes on Kik. Never his own, but nudes of girls from the internet. I found out and was angry and betrayed, he said he didn't know why he did it and knew it was stupid. He's proven by this point that he would never try to hurt me and would do anything for me, so I give him a second chance and he promises he'll never do it again. He grew up Catholic and without a father, so I feel like he never had a chance to be ""educated"" in sex and porn and stuff (we both grew up in the country with strict parent(s) and we're kind of just told don't do it until you're married/dated for a while and out of high school).
For the next year, our relationship is great. It's long distance and we're both broke college kids, so we don't see each other much outside of breaks. But we cherish every moment together. Sex is rocky because we're each others' first (not counting my first because it was once and involuntary), not to mention he can be a typical male and I don't enjoy sex (for many reasons that we've both talked about and have been trying to work around and get ob/gyn advice for). Other than that, everything is fine.
Very recently, I discover he's selling nude galleries of random strangers on Kik. I literally have no idea where he would get that idea and why he would think it's okay. I don't think it'd been very long and he deleted it before I confronted him about it (he didn't know that I found out, so I think he felt bad about it or realized how fucked up it is and stopped). He owned up to it and said he knows it was stupid and being broke isn't an excuse and that he's sorry he did it but he understands why I'm breaking up with him. We agree to give it space, and I'm not even going to consider thinking about talking to each other for at least a couple months.
So, is it worth saving? I'd give anything to trust him again, and I know he would do literally anything for another chance. But I don't know if I can do that, if there's anything either of us can do, or if our relationship is lost.
Tl;dr bf fucked up once relatively harmlessly, I give him a second chance. After a year, he sells nudes (of strangers) to get money because he's young, dumb, and broke. Is the relationship salvageable; will I be able to trust him again? Or is it lost forever?

20,"As reference we ended our relationship in her senior year of highschool as she is one year older than I am. Soon afterwards she begins dating another guy and they quickly get enganged. Not too long after she cheats on him with me, not my proudest moment but was just a teenager. 

It used to be a joke among friends that the kid looked a lot like me. We lose contact, a few years later she tries to cheat on with him again with me but I refused. A few more years and she gets a divorce, and reaches back out to me just to reconnect as people who used to be very close. The other day I received a message from her stating that she is quite sure that the child was mine, asked if I wanted to check and see.

I state that no I do not, the girl is now 7 years old and I am not in a place to want that. Admitidelly she only looks like me because her mother and I looked like siblings when we were dating. But the child does not look like the ""father"" at all. 

Either way I have concerns both legally, I assume she couldn't come at me nor would she for monetary gain. As a large time has passed without my knowledge of these facts. Is it important for someone to know who their birth parent is? Aren't your parents the people who raise you. 

Just need general advise. ",27May2018,1
21,"Posted in r/friendshipadvice but thought I'd post here too. Sorry this is so long.

So I (19F) have a friend, let's just call him Tim (22M), who I met in January of this year in one of my classes in college. We, along with another friend, let's call him Jack (22M), became very close over the course of 5ish months. By this quarter, we had a tightknit group of friends, including myself, Tim, Jack, Jack's fiancee, and Jack's fiancee's roommates/friends. Tim has been going to college for a long time, he's only technically a sophomore at this school but has been going to college for 5 years. He's kind of spoiled, his parents are paying for him to go to college completely, offered to buy him a brand new car, etc.

This quarter in particular, Tim and I spent a lot of time together, just as friends, but nearly every day we would hang out in some way shape or form (Jack works so there was a lot of time he was either working or spending time with his fiancee). Over these past months, Tim, Jack, and I decided we were going to move into an apartment together and it became pretty concrete over these past few weeks specifically as we looked at numerous places, applied for a place, and eventually got accepted at said place.

Now, Tim had a running joke that he was going to ""drop out"" or ""change his major"" or just ""go to tech school after he graduated here."" It became kind of annoying after a while so it became something we all kind of brushed off. He also is someone who often wants attention and pity for problems that really aren't problems, and would like to throw himself little pity parties whenever things were a little hard. Not to mention, he does have some commitment issues, seeing as he's changed majors and schools 3 different times, as well as some other things which I won't mention.

Anyways, now, this past Sunday we were all working together on projects and Tim and Jack were getting on me for not finishing my rental application for the place we were looking at, which I then finished right there. The next day, Jack and I receive a group text from Tim saying he's ""not coming back to school in the fall"" and that he ""wanted to give us a heads up, but we can talk about it later."" This is coming from someone who has as long as I've known him, been very adamant about hating texting because if you really want to talk to someone, you can call or talk to them in person. Needless to say, Jack and I were in shock and disbelief.

The next day is when we all had class together, and was also the morning we got the acceptance email for our new apartment, and neither Jack or I had replied to him because we were so taken aback. In class, we didn't initiate any conversation because we felt that he was the one who had explaining to do. He didn't say a word to us, except when Jack, out of anger, asked him if he was for sure fucking us over, and he replied with a kind of smug ""yep."" As of the past two days, he's been hanging out with two of our other friends, one who is his current roommate and one who is one of Jack's fiancee's friends. I understand his roommate hanging out with him because he wasn't a part of the situation, and understand the other friend because she's kind of in love with him. But now, the whole dichotomy of our group has changed and none of us have gotten together as a group like we usually do because no one really wants to say who they think deserves to be invited with all the tension between us. To this day he still has not talked to either of us and avoids eye contact if we ever see him. He stopped coming to class and is not on the roster for next quarter. An important detail to note is that Tim sent the original text this past Monday, which is 2 weeks before school lets out for the summer and Jack and I are left to find a place without him.

I don't want to initiate conversation with him because I feel like he's just waiting for us to grovel and beg him to come back. Also, I feel like he's the one who's in the wrong and owes us an apology or at the least an explanation. At the same time, however, I'm really getting depressed because I haven't been able to hang out with him at all and probably won't see him again after the quarter ends next week and don't really want to end this on such a bitter note. How do I handle this situation without making him think he didn't do anything wrong and that I'm apologizing?",27May2018,2

She's shown some affection towards me but never anything romantic. Anyways, she's blocked me from her instagram story for some reason and she's told a friend already that she doesn't like me in the same way that I do.

26,"I have school Tuesday - Thursday (end of May), with the exams on Wednesday and Thursday (each day has 2 exams and it's a half day, released before 12, maybe around 10 or 11:30).  On Wednesday I have the Ancient World History exam (with lots of units from the beginning of January) and the English exam (basically grammar codes and correcting errors since early January).  On Thursday I have the Biology exam (lots of info, like the AWH, since the beginning of January) and the math exam (I struggle in math, but I have a journal with math rules in it to help jog my memory, been getting help every day after school).  I'm mainly concerned about the Biology and AWH exams, as on Tuesday after school, I'll attend the 2 hour English study jam to prepare.

I was planning to alternate between studying one chapter of Biology than of AWH so I wouldn't get bored and tired of each subject, and to increase my chances of success (rather be mediocrely prepared for each one than really good in one yet totally unprepared for another one).

To prevent frying my brain, I'll study half an hour then take a bathroom break before resuming again.  Been keeping track of how long it takes to eat, not watching or reading anything.  

When I'm done studying each subject, I'll brush up quickly with Biology Kahoots the teacher made (to study I deeply read the powerpoints the teacher made), and rereading the history notes.

I'll get 10 hours of sleep, and wake up early enough to maximize use of the whole day.

I sound all set, but any tips would be appreciated.  Thanks!",27May2018,1

28,"i dunno, just what it says on the tin. i'm terrified of dying and leaving my affairs to be sorted by my immediate family. i'm terrified of leaving my friends to wonder what happened, forever. i don't want my social media to be a sad shrine \(and jesus, certainly not available to some people in my extended family\), i don't want to be a sad inspirational story for my school, i don't want to just die unprepared. and if, y'know, i do succumb to my depression \(unlikely, in all probability, but still not out of the range of possibility\) and quietly remove myself from the equation, i don't know what i can do to let everyone know that they did their best, that this was on me. all that.  


i'm barely 18, so i don't have any financial affairs to sort out. i'm an artist, but uh, i mostly just draw digital fanart of ladies smooching for extremely low rates. i've already taken the step of throwing out or donating almost every nonessential possession i could bear to remove \- not to the extent of my discomfort or hygiene, of course. \(this isn't as worrying as it sounds, i promise; it honestly started as part of an effort to cleanse myself of the habits my hoarder dad impressed on me.\) i've considered laying out a few things so my friends could inherit them \- a drawing tablet, an original merch item that's hard to come by these days, etc. \- but i just feel like it'd be kind of weird and creepy.  


as for the ""quietly"" part, if my mom discovers a bunch of letters talking about my will after death or something, she's going to \(understandably\) panic and have me in a psych ward for a 1:1 within the half hour. discreet is the operative word of the day.  


sorry for the sad subject matter, it's just something that's been bothering me for a while and i don't know where to look for help or advice. here's a quick sum\-up of provisions i'm looking for help with:  
\- a simple program that would automatically release a nondescript public statement to my 'clean' \(read: would not mind my extended family being nosy on\) facebook after a period of nonactivity  
\- exactly what a letter should consist of. i'm planning on writing one for all my close friends, and one to address all my acquaintances in a group. should i go for video or is that too personal?  
\- a simple program that would automatically password\-lock \+ archive my personal social media accounts after the same period of inactivity as above. deletion is not my goal, because as much as i hate the idea, i can imagine that my mom would like to read through my posts and stuff. i don't think she'd get it, but i think she'd like the idea of me laughing at a silly joke, like bibme a chegg or whatever. that's a classic.   
\- similarly, something that would automatically send out a message to all of my friends with a link to the message i want them to receive \- i would be happy to place the public acquaintance' address on my public facebook post, but i would feel weird about having everyone's personal letter being available for anyone to see.  
\- informally name my brother as the deciding force in any funeral proceedings. my twin brother and i have mutually and in no uncertain terms come to a civil tolerance policy for the sake of my mom. he couldn't give less of a flying fuck about me, but i'm 100&amp;#37; that he shares my sentiment that my mom shouldn't have to pick out my casket.  
\- what can i do to make sure my mom gets a playlist every birthday and christmas? we have the same birthday, and i'm ashamed to say that some years she didn't get any presents at all. i can't afford to take out a lifelong policy for flowers and chocolate, but i can sit down and make 50\-60 little playlists that automatically post themselves on the clean facebook for her to listen to. would that be cruel? i just want to make sure someone always tells her happy birthday, and merry christmas, and i love you. that would be a big load off my mind.

29,"Hey everyone. Just wanted to get some advice from here...I’m a 23 year old female and looking to go into adult entertainment (i.e. stripping). The reason for this is I love dancing and it is my passion. I have practiced it since I was a young teenager. 

I also would like to be able to make more money on the side from my regular job, to be able to travel the world. It is one of my dreams. This is something my regular, professional job can’t afford me. 

Should I go for it? Some concerns I have are coworkers/family members figuring out and my personal/professional life ruined. And I do come from a conservative family.

30,"Last night me (F16) and a group of others went iceskating. Amongst this group was my ex (M16) and his very recent ex girlfriend. His ex girlfriend and I have become close when they were dating so we’re very good friends. My ex and I are extremely close and still talk almost everyday. So last night when we were iceskating, it was very obvious to see that she was upset with the breakup; but he’d told me that he didn’t want anything to do with her and didn’t feel anything towards the breakup. So for most of the night they ignored each other and he was talking to me and we skated together. And ohmygawsh 
The chemistry for me was insane.
And the conversations were great and we took photos together with one of our friends.
All of the old feelings came back like a wildfire and I was so happy I found the feelings I used to feel, and my best friend noticed it too.
And when we were skating the couples pair up came on and we started skating. Thankfully, I didn’t see his ex and neither did he and she knows we’re really close what’s good, and nothing was forced. It was just steady and felt so right. 
Now I’m just not sure what to do because I’m not sure if he had the same feelings as I did last night, and I’m not sure what to do.",27May2018,1

Some information beforehand, we’re both 18, I was a virgin and she isn’t.
Now for what happened and why I’m super confused, she came round mine and we were making out, one thing turned to another and we were naked and doing foreplay+oral she was super easy, everything was pretty easy and came naturally and we both enjoyed it but when we came to me I first struggled getting it up and then struggled to cum, we soon moved to sex and again it felt great, but I couldn’t cum, it was like my body was confused or something.
Soon enough we stopped after she came twice, we went back to oral to try to finish me off but again my body couldn’t (wouldn’t?) finish. We ended up having me jack off until I got close (which was like 5 seconds of beating off?) then she finished me off.

32,"&gt;so to be honest I was friend with this girl for a few years and she is a drama queen. I finally ended my friendship with her . of course Although I tried to end it quietly it didn't work and she got really angry. I thought it finally ended when she texted me again. She told me she loved me and that she was LGBT. This made me feel extremely uncomfortable and I avoided her till I could get my thoughts together. then she texted me more. I talked with one of our mutual friends and she said the exact same thing. then I asked another friend and she said that she hadn't texted her that but said it in person.

36,"So a little background information: I(17/F) hate my sister(21/F). Like seriously hate her. If I could make her disappear, I'd give anything in order to make that happen. She made my life and my mom's life hell. She's extremely aggressive (or tries to be), if things don't go her way she just snaps and starts talking super loud. And if someone does the same back at her, she starts screaming and claiming that someone's hitting her for the neighbours to hear that ""she's the victim"" (this isn't very well explained but you get the picture). 

And a little background info about me: I don't pay much attention to school, my grades are just what I need to not flunk (that's a word right?). But since this is my last year, I have my finals and I am kinda flunking (same question?) history. I spend most of my time playing LoL and watching movies and TV shows.

Why is this revelant you may ask? Well, my sister's number one entertainment is picking on me about those 2 things. While having dinner, I eat as fast as I can because I already know what waits for me at the dinner table. Ongoing ""jokes"" about how I spend most of my time on the computer and about how I'm going to be a janitor in the future, and so on. And I ignore this 100% of the time, cause really I already know what I want to do. And no, it's not being a fucking janitor. What I want to do only requires that I complete the twelfth grade (basically I wanna be a cop) but I haven't told this to my mom so really they're just thinking that I still don't know what I wanna do with my life, and that opens the door to her little jokes.

But that's not why I snapped. Although, it helped a lot too. She also has the habit of taking things that aren't hers. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those people that doesn't borrow or give anything to other people. Quite the contrary, among my friends I'm the first one to offer my cookies or borrow my headphones. But not to my sister. For a few simple reasons. First of all, I fucking hate her and can't even stand to see her. Secondly, everytime she uses my headphones they end up not working after, so why  the fuck would I borrow her anything? It's not like she's gonna give me the money to buy new ones after they're broken. Secondly, she doesn't borrow me anything either, and I'm all up for justice. You do this and I'll do the same. So if you don't give me anything, I'm not gonna give you anything either.

So this headphone thing is why I snapped. I realize that my reaction was way too aggressive for this simple thing, but it's just so much rage that I have towards her that I just simply snapped. It was around 1:15 am, I had my headphones on top of the bed and I went to the kitchen to drink some water. I go back to my room and she's on the bed playing with our dog, and as soon as I enter she leaves. It didn't really hit me at the time. But after one minute I look over my bed and they're gone. So I waltz out of my bedroom, I find her on the hallway and I put my hands on her throat and against the wall and ask for my headphones. I wasn't even pressing too hard. But only this time, she didn't actually take em. She just threw them off the bed to a place that wasn't really visible. 

Anyway, my reaction started world War 3 in my house. Since then she has threatened me of calling some gypsies to rape me while I take the train to school. She has spat on me countless of times. She even spat the pear she was eating on my bed. And she also threatened me with a lighter. (after all of this she called me a psychopath, I've admitted that my reaction wasn't the greatest but it's one thing vs four things, so that makes her a bigger psychoooo) 

And now you ask, am I living in the guetto or something? Last time I checked I wasn't but it looks like my sister came from it. Even in the way she talks. 

I'm not sure if I'm really seeking any advice, there's nothing in this world that's gonna make me hate her less, I guess this is more like a rant or something. 

Not sure if I'm missing anything cause it's around 3 am, but yea I think this is it. Sorry for the long post.

I’ve made several friends with employees, customers, and managers, though in my recent weeks it’s becoming more clear the managers are corrupted and unprofessional. A few days ago an old, nasty man who is a regular came into the store and invaded my personal space, began touching my back even though I was visibly uncomfortable, and proceeded to touch the small of my back before finally grabbing my butt. I’m a MINOR and have NEVER been in this situation before, so I retreated to the back of the store where I hid until my supervisor came back and scolded me for not working. When I explained what happened she replied with, “He is harmless. Why didn’t you get the cashier call?” I was kinda offended and just assumed that it wasn’t a big deal but also confused because it DEFINITELY felt wrong and disgusting. After telling a co-worker I discovered this same man had done the same thing to her in the same manner, and after she reported it to the supervisor she got the same, “He’s harmless” response. Her being older and more courageous decided to take it to a higher manager with another co-worker, and the managers response was “This is retail. That’s going to happen and you just have to deal with it.” And that, “He’s come in for years and hasn’t done much worse than that.” And, “Any other workplace wouldn’t do much about it either.”  For obvious reasons we were all outraged and called the store owner, who said this was unacceptable of both the managers and the customer. Today is Saturday, he plans on handling the issue tomorrow and talking to me Tuesday when I work next. I plan on putting in my two weeks notice depending on his explanation of what’s happened and how he’s gonna handle it. My question is how should I feel about this since I’m getting such conflicting responses? How should a workplace handle inappropriate touching of a minor? Are we over reacting by filing a police report or by quitting our jobs?

Nothing ever works. 

I’m not suicidal, but I’m deeply dissatisfied. Every day seems like a waste of time. Any motivation I can scrounge up is dead on arrival. My sleeping habits have gone to dogshit. It is an immense effort for me to fall asleep before 1 am, and I really am constantly putting in the effort. I often am able to have a streak of four or five days where I sleep a full eight hours, waking up around 9 am. - mostly with the assistance of things like Benadryl or Melatonin. But without fail I’ll eventually run into a night where whatever I do I can’t sleep. I’ll lay for hours. I won’t be able to lose consciousness until around sunrise. I wake up late in the afternoon feeling absolutely miserable. Absolutely drained. It takes weeks of effort after this to get back to one of those 4-5 normality streaks. 

In the past I would self medicate with alcohol, and it would offer a temporary reprieve from the anxiety &amp; self loathing. But I’ve drank for so long (although in much lower quantities in the past year) that even that no longer offers reprieve. It becomes simply another burden of the night, weighing on my brain. 

I went for a five mile hike yesterday and felt nothing. The fresh air &amp; sunlight did nothing for me. I just felt disappointed. 

I don’t cry, I don’t feel joy, I don’t feel any extremes. I just shuffle here and there. The only thing that makes me feel anything is the first four minutes of Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concert No. 1. - Specifically, some recording with “Yevgeny Kissin” and the Berliner Philharmoniker. 

I cling to that recording daily just to remember what emotion feels like. That may be a bit silly to mention, but it’s just to highlight that I scarcely feel anything emotive heights through any typical means. 

I don’t know what to do and I’m close to not caring anymore. My depression is a constant uphill battle &amp; I can only have the will to keep walking for so long. Eventually I’m afraid I’ll just stop entirely and simply sit on the hill. While enveloping myself in cheap entertainment &amp; booze. ",27May2018,1

Me: Yeah pretty shitty

Jay: Yeah bro, you don't give a fuck cause you're a temp, you'll be off in 3 months but this is our 2nd home right? And the cleaning lady bro she's like our mom man think about it.

Me: Hah yeah

At this point, the toilet topic breaks off and they (mostly Jay) start asking me things like where I'm from, what I do, where I go to school, how I get to work, all this stuff in a very artificial way. People don't talk like this at all, moreso Jay who speaks VERY different than this. He also asked me to ""go places"" as I won't have many ""chances"".

I am sort of worried because this dude spoke like that and you could tell everyone knew it was me because he said so. I didn't clog it, but they 100% had a convo on this before. 

Can someone advise on what someone should do in this case? I think just talking back and forth is a bad idea eso it being work, but are there other methods that would tell them to fuck off?",27May2018,1
54,"I didn’t know where to put this, so I’m putting it here. I have severe depression  and anxiety, and have been smoking pot for about a year to try to help with that. I can say that it 100% is helping, and I feel monumentally better since I started. There weren’t any problems until about a day ago, when a friend of mine told his parents that I sold him some weed. I didn’t sell him or give him any, but I do use it myself. My parents are definitely not okay with me doing so, but a year ago I was an inch away from killing myself. I’m tired of hiding it from them, and can’t move out as I’d have nowhere to go. I’ve denied any involvement with weed, but I think I’m going to have to come clean soon, and I want to know what the people here think I should do. Thanks in advance.

I am quite tempted to forgo my notice and just not go back for the rest of my time, but I would feel terrible doing that to the other employees there.

58,"Today something horrible happened and I reacted in a way I'm really embarrassed and shocked about.

A really big dog attacked my little dog and tried to tear his head off/crush his throat. The owners were there. I just sort of froze and turned away screaming. I couldn't look. I didn't try and fight for my little dog and I just wanted it all to be over. It seemed to go on sooo long. My dog was limp and just being pulled apart. It was so violent I didn't think my dog could survive so I was hoping it was quick. I kept apologising to my dog over and over while screaming with my face turned away because he is already old and sick and this was a dog I allowed in our yard to visit and I feel like it's my fault.

After a few seconds I managed to turn on a hose and try and wet them while still screaming and turned away. The owners tried to open the dogs jaws and it took a long time it seemed like. I asked them to drive me to the vet and when we got there the vet was closed. I hadn't grabbed a phone or even shoes but luckily some vet neighbours phoned for me while I was rocking back and forward just a mess crying and saying goodbye as the dog was obviously in so much shock. I was soaking wet from the hose and had blood all over me from my puppa and I was screaming in public. No it's over I'm so embarassed. So far he's fighting and it's a miracle. He is tiny and has multiple wounds including a five cm tear that exposed his jugular but he is still alive for now.

I guess I just need advice on how to process this or accept that in an emergency I really just froze and am no good to anyone and didn't protect my dog. I didn't try any first aid even when the owners handed him to me except to wrap him in a towel. I just thought I was a better person than this. I always thought in a bad situation I'd be able to react. Assumed I was the type of person who's run to a accident to do first aid or whatever. ",27May2018,10
59,"I'm an 18F and I'm about 5'6"". I currently wear size 10 shoes and I have some relatively tall family members. 

I wouldn't question my height if it wasn't for the size of my shoes and the fact that I have very stiff legs. I used to be a gymnast in elementary school and was very flexible then but I decided to stop participating in that sport. I am wondering if my abrupt end to gymnastics may have stunted or locked up some mobility in my legs?

I can barely touch my toes, for reference. And my hamstrings feel very stiff. Could this be a reason that I am not taller?  

Are there certain exercises that could loosen up some of those muscle groups that could potentially add an inch or so to my height?

I don’t want any part of this and my plan has always been to join the military and not even tell them about it and never look back.

Today I got an envelope the size of Texas with more papers inside than I’ve ever seen before In one place at a time lmfao 

Like dude? LEAVE ME ALONE LMFAO I’ve already had appointments with every branch and currently going to the marines to get ready to officially enlist and nope still getting mail. 

Like I’m so fucking surprised they haven’t asked wtf is going on lmfao

The messages are all exactly 3:00 long \(I assume that's the time limit on the messages\) and aren't super clear but they're all from a man who seems to be schizophrenic and looking for a female named Ally \(like short for Allison\). The *entire* first message is him saying a lot of sexual stuff like ""do you like to fuck black guys"" or ""I wanna fuck your pussy"" whilst probably masturbating. The second 2 messages sound like he's very confused, like he doesn't know there's no one on the other end of the line and he's trying to talk to Ally. Repeatedly asking her if she's married and waiting for long pauses as if giving her to answer. Googling the phone number brings up a page from a real estate website \([rehold.com](https://rehold.com)\) that shows a house in West Chester, PA \(I don't live in PA\) with a residence history of 4 people, 2 male and 2 female, with one of the males having the phone number that I received the voicemail from.

My friends all just tell me to block the number and move on but I listened to all the messages carefully \(ew\) to make sure there weren't obvious signs of stalking and to see if he reveals any information about himself or Ally. I didn't notice any obvious signs that this man was a danger to himself or others. It's likely that he lives with and is also financially dependent on family and that Ally may only exist in his head or is a stranger that just gave him a made up number that just happens to be mine.

She's constantly tired but when we stay home she sleeps all day and she gets extremely upset whenever I wake her up or disagree with her.

It all began when one day she lashed out at me, being really cruel, knowingly saying things to hurt me, just because I woke her up for a few minutes.

82,"A bit of backstory:
I've dealt with depression on my own, mostly, since I was a preteen. It manifested itself into self hatred and self destruction. I'm not sure how it turned into that, but it did. Eventually at the end of high school, I managed to quit the self harming. Anyone who knows a self harmer, knows it's a hard mentality to shake - it's a way we've learned to cope with our issues. 
Another quality I've recognized is that over years of dealing with abandonment issues, shitty friendships, and shitty people, I've become very restrictive about what type of people stay in my life. I'm quick to cut people out if I can't trust them, or, if they hurt me.
On a similar note, I quit jobs too easily, blame myself or others, internally, for my lack of ability to endure my surroundings. 
Lastly, anytime I try to discuss issues with my s.o. or others, I internalize. It gets to a point where I blame myself for my situation, my happiness and my reactions and start to believe I'll never be strong enough, stable enough, etc. In those moments, I spiral back into self hatred and envision old memories of self harming.

I don't want these old coping mentalities and destructive behaviors to keep ruining my life, what is something I can do to begin helping?

There isn't much hope for advancement though because it's a small club and his direct supervisor has been there for over ten years. They don't really give raises regularly. His supervisor is a total asshole, imo, who often pawns parts of his own job off on my husband, or randomly takes days off/claims he has to leave early without notice, forcing my husband to stay in his place. He's done it like ten times in the last couple months. Husband is salaried so he gets nothing extra for the extra hours and extra work this jerk leaves him to do. But on the plus side, they basically never fire anyone so he has complete job security there (of course that also means his subordinates are total slackers because they know they'll never be replaced).

He was just offered a position by a longtime acquaintance of his. This guy has partnered with an investor and purchased a reasonably successful, long standing restaurant in the area. He wants my husband to come in and act as the executive chef and general manager of the place. He also intends to open other locations in the future. The pros here are, he knows this guy and they get along, the guy is very hardworking and not a selfish, slacking asshole, he would be making probably about $20k more than he does where he is now, and there's a chance he could wind up managing more than one store and making significantly more. He was also offered a partnership in the business if he wants to pursue that as well. The cons are, we have two kids and own a home that isn't paid for so he is worried about the new business tanking and leaving us high and dry. He also knows that taking over the place will require him to work longer hours than he does now, and he hates to be gone a lot since we have a small toddler who's growing up fast and he doesn't want to miss it because he's working all the time. However, that won't be a permanent thing if the business is successful, but he doesn't know if it will, or how long it might take. Advice?

Since then, we've watched movies and shared playlists, talked and laughed about almost everything, and studied and worked on projects together... There were alot of small, precious moments. It's been a little more than a year since I told him, &amp; I wanna know how he feels, now that we are a little more mature, and especially after all this quality time we've spent together. And apparently, he doesn't text other people as often as he texts me, and he told me this. He doesn't show or express his emotions often, so it's hard for me to pick up signals. He's the only person I've felt this strongly about. Every time he looks at me, it's like his freaking eyes are peering into my soul, and HE NEVER FREAKING BREAKS EYE CONTACT. I'm constantly looking at the ground when I talk to him. Normally, I'm really confident and a wonderful conversationalist. But, when I'm with him, I start babbling or giggling like I have no knowledge of language/communication. My heart rate goes through the roof. I become a whole different person. I find myself thinking of him wherever I am... &amp; I'm not even exaggerating, his existence occupies my every thought. When I think about the future, I just see us living in a suburban house and our children, with his beady eyes and my chubby cheeks, running around while I make pancakes. 

Anyways...

Should I try my luck once more by asking him how he feels since I told him or should I wait for him to say something or should I forget about it all together ? ",27May2018,2
90,"I live next door to a three person family, a mother, father, and kid. The kid has several health issues including autism so it’s hard for me to guess his age, but I’d guess he’s around 12 years old.

I’ve been aware for a while now that my neighbors are neglectful dog owners. They own over 5 chihuahuas that they literally never take outside their backyard ever. I’ve dogsat for them and when I look into their house from the glass backyard door, I can see that the inside of the house is extremely messy. On a scale from 1 (just a little dirty) to 10 (hoarders level) I’d say it’s about an 8. I don’t think they ever clean their house. Occasionally they open their garage and... god. There’s literally just piles of garbage, clothes, and random junk. I’m sure they can barely walk through it.

The event that triggered me to write this post happened a few minutes ago. I just got home from giving my friend a ride somewhere and decided to sit in my car in the dark, scrolling through Reddit for a while. The front door to their house opened and the kid came out.

The dad came out shortly after him and yelled at his kid for “leaving his fucking ____ out”, and the kid went back inside to put whatever it was away without saying anything. The dad yelled and sweared at him some more, then went around the corner of the house. He took his glasses off and rubbed his eyes, like maybe he was crying? Then they both got in a car and left.

Normally I’d brush this off as a bad day for the father or something like that, but this isn’t the first time I’ve seen the parents swear and yell at the kid for just doing... kid stuff. The other time I saw it was through the window as the whole family was coming home from somewhere.

Today I checked my wait time and it looks like I still will have another 11 months to go and I am totally lost and depressed with what to do.. All of my family lives in the states so I do not want to leave and void my current status.

I do not know what to do for the next year. I cannot work \- all internships I apply to ask if I am legally allowed to work \(I say no and they move on\). I enrolled again for community college for this coming semester as I missed deadlines for graduate school admissions \(plus I have only $1,000 in my bank account so that probably isn't an option\).

This being the case, my school is incredibly competitive, and I often find myself overshadowed by others.

For little background around 7 years ago my dad cheated on my mother with her sister. About 2 years ago my mom finally kicked my dad out of the house, and I just learned to live with it. I tried and visited my dad every weekend I could. But other than that my mom refused to allow me to associate with my father at all. However my dad has always expressed that if I was ever in need of any aid, he would gladly help, and to this day he has helped me anytime I needed it.

The straw that broke the metaphorical camel's back happened today. My high-school graduation, and my dad arrived to see me get my diploma and walk on the stage and all. He sat through entire ceremony and was the first of my parents to spot me afterwards. (I haven't seen my father for a couple of months, so I was more than happy to see him.)  After about 10 minutes my mom finally spots me and refuses to talk to me until my father leaves. She then proceeded to lecture me about how my father doesn't care about me or my sister, and that he only came because I forced him to. (Not true btw, he asked me yesterday what time the ceremony began, where, and genuinely just came by his lonesome to see me graduate). And I have no idea what to do, I completely understand why my mom doesn't like my dad, he did do an absolutely abhorrent thing. But the fact that she couldn't put her anger aside for 15 minures and allow a picture of my dad makes me honestly absolutely livid. I don't know what to do, and I'm trying to think of a reasonable way to approach this, but I just can't think of anything. Any help would honestly be appreciated.",27May2018,1

So back in November I broke my foot in 3 places and didnt have insurance or medi-cal. I went to the ER and then went to the county hospital the next day. I was told that I was signed up for ""Temporary Medi-Cal"" which would cover my medical bills..

So a few months later I got billed for the emergency room ($3.5k) because I hadn't been covered by medical for that visit.

So imagine my surprise when I get a bill telling me I owe county hospital $3k leftover from my medi-cal not covering my entire bill.... even though i was told I would not need to pay ANYTHING..

102,"I recently started a new job and at first things were great, my manager was really friendly and nice, she always replied to my emails and texts but recently she's been acting odd. She started being very ""professional"" around me and by that I mean mean\-spirited and speaking only about work. 

* I thanked her for letting me take a sick day when I was feeling bad and I got no reply
* I say good morning to her she ignores me

And now she is setting me up to fail. I work on various projects at my company and I have specific deadlines. I was brought in because my manager thought third party contractors were taking too long to complete the work and were driving up the bill by doing so. Now after being here for five months I can say that those third party contractors weren't taking too long, if it takes them 5 days to finish a project that's how long it takes me. Now my boss will budget me out for 5 days but then she'll tell me \(in person\) that I need to be done in 3. I've told her this is impossible and her reply has always been ""I'm disappointed,"" or ""I expected better from someone with your experience."" 

There's only so much I can do in the hours I work. So I tried working exta hours, since I'm salaried, but was told my work time is from 8 to 5 and I'll get in trouble if I work longer. I really feel like she's setting me up to fail here; She found out that she can't save the company money by hiring someone to do this in\-house so now she's trying to make it seem like I'm just bad at my job so it doesn't look like she made a mistake. 

I'm trying extremely hard to keep this job, this entire week I worked close to 12 hours per day for 5 days. I even doubled my Adderall dose just to stay up late so I can work more. I normally have to take Adderall for ADHD but now I have to take it just to survive long shifts. Friday I came into work so pale from working myself to the bone that I was just sent home cuz everyone thought I had the flu. In truth I was just exhausted and slept for nearly 30 hours after that. I've had hallucinations and vertigo all day because of my intense exhaustion. If I keep this up I'll end up with brain damage in a matter of months but if I get fired I'll most likely end up homeless. Personally, I'd rather have brain damage than be homeless.

**TL:DR\-\&gt;** My boss is setting unrealistic deadlines for me in order to set me up to fail.

103,"About a year ago, I purchased a house and invited my best friend to rent one of the rooms, directly across the hall from me. We’ve lived together a few times before, but always gone our separate ways due to jobs, relationships etc, so moving in to this house didn’t seem like a big deal. This was about 6 years ago, though. 

For the last few months, things have not been great. She has somehow developed a case of terrible personal hygiene. And I mean TERRIBLE. She reeks of body odor (showers once a fortnight, never washes her clothes or bedding), doesn’t brush her teeth, and lives/eats/sleeps like a hermit in her room for days on end. The smell permeates the house daily, and my partner has often made comments on how disgusting it is, and how he doesn’t like walking past her room or coming over sometimes. I often wonder if our third and fourth roommates have the same opinion, but are too polite to say.

On top of all that, she has been a pretty poor friend/flatmate in general lately - she’s unsupportive, she’s antisocial (none of my other friends, or my partner, like her) and she never wants to hang out anymore - she only wants to sleep and stream movies in bed. There’s always mess around the house that she doesn’t own up to, she borrows money and doesn’t pay it back, and she never pulls her weight around the place. 

I’ve tried dropping hints: I got her some lovely body washes as a gift (they didn’t get used), I’ve nicely pointed out she may want to brush her teeth/clean her room/stop leaving trash around etc, but she denies it’s a problem every time. 

I also considered she may be depressed so I have had heart-to-hearts with her, but she’s assured me she is ok and doesn’t seem to think anything is wrong with her behaviour and hygiene. 

What do I do? I’ve tried tiptoeing around things, and I’ve tried being a bit more blunt, but I don’t want to lose my best friend of 12 years if I’m really forward, or ask her to move out. And she has no friends of her own, so I don’t want to desert her, too!

When telling people about our breakup, I was very respectful and said nothing bad about her,  I made sure to keep it professional and respectful. 3 weeks later, I find out that she went to a guy that hates me since he’s been I love with her for a year and she talked a bunch of shit about me to him and basically told him a bunch of shitty stuff about me(ie, she broke up with me cuz she couldn’t put in the time and effort, told him I didn’t put in any effort). So I know she talked shit about me and lied to me when we broke up. Now it gets tricky since I can’t just ignore her since we’re in the same friend group but everyone is fighting so it’s kind of divided. I was thinking of talking to her to find out if she said what I heard she did(went through 4 people before me) so I know if it’s even true and I should just end our friendship or try and figure it out.

105,"Good Evening, advisors of Reddit.
I recently started out as an already experience line cook at a new job. I asked for 20-30hrs due to school and other things and after the interview, on my first day it became apparent (from Boss #1, Head Chef) I was needed to work the first two weeks, no days off, for 8hr shifts. I attempted to tell him that couldn't work but received a sugar-coated answer which was pretty much ""too bad"". They are willing to work with my college schedule, though being unemployed for a few months and diving into a new kitchen for 45+hrs/week would take it's toll on me.

On the 3rd day I told Boss #2(Scheduler, Payroll Manager), while #1 had the day off, this isn't working out and I'm going to be done after this shift. Upon leaving we sat down and he told me how the bottom line was how they needed someone for Sundays and that's all I needed to work and have six other days off.

However, a job I left back in February called me the same day and asked me to return, with better pay (I left due to my current semester taking too much of my time). I know that job very well and am very comfortable there and currently this place has no system to follow and everything is free-handed and they even encourage us to NOT wear gloves!

Anyways, thanks for reading this far. I do appreciate it. I'm worried about the potential consequence I'll face for emailing them my resignation right now, six hours before I'm to clock in... I'm in CT, which I've heard is an at-will state. I'm just concerned these people won't pay me the $300+ I've earned and/or whatever else they can do.
I really appreciate any point if views anyone can give.

Side note to those interested: I've recently been getting out of a long term depression and been trying to put my health above all else. I've been told I'm a ""people pleaser"" and that's where I think all this is confusion is coming from. I'm just trying to do right by myself and Reddit has always shown me inspiration in logic (kinda :p) and creativity.

Hey y'all, so in not too long I will be leaving for a week long summer camp, at which there will be a talent show. I want to put on an act that will be so awful that it will be beautiful and memorable, but I need ideas. The camp is a writing, literature, and philosophy camp, so keep that in mind.

**Interpretative eating**
Walk up, pull out a gross banana, eat it in silence, including the little strings, keep a straight face, and sit back down.
**Song poetry**
Read a song (preferably stupid and meaningless) as if it was a serious poem

113,"So I never really post on reddit or anything, and I don’t know if this post will get any real responses or whatever, but I seriously need some advice on the matter. 

Okay so I’m gonna try my best to explain what’s going on. 

I have a little cousin. He’s currently 9, in the 4th grade in middle school. And we don’t know what’s wrong with him. 

He was fine up till the 3rd grade. Then he began changing. Diabetes runs in our family, and he was seriously borderline diabetic when he was 7.

My cousin over uses jokes, like he says something stupid, and then he’ll continue to elaborate on it. It drives me and my family crazy. He has a little sister, a girl, that’s younger than him- and she’s way smarter than him.

Here is a few things he does.

- tries to be overly funny in class, or with the family in general, even during serious events. 
- walks around during class, shouting things at random moments.
- constantly disrespects his mother and father. Called his mother “ugly” and even cursed at his sister, calling her a “fucking bitch” (he was “joking”)
- can’t use scissors correctly, or know how to run right, know how to eat with a fork, spoon, etc. 
- gets very mad when he plays his game on his iPad, and I mean VERY mad(yes I know he is young, but I’m not the one responsible)

I feel like my aunt(his mother) knows what is going on, she knows there is something wrong with him, but feels like she has no control. but my uncle uses jokes to cover it up. 

My other aunt and I were discussing what it could be. He recently started going to a psychiatrist and they diagnosed him with ADHD and anxiety- and we know it’s evident in his issues. 

But I feel.. I don’t know, there’s something else? Like he’s special ed? He cannot talk correctly, he stutters a lot, it takes him 3 hours to memorize vocabulary even though he studied the night before, etc. And his younger sister is, im sorry to say, probably more intelligent then him. 

And it’s not like he’s completely bad. When he’s playing a game with my older cousin, one and one, he’s perfectly fine. 

Again, maybe it is just his ADHD- maybe he is spoiled, but if you know anything that might be useful, feedback is always appreciated. 

My family is seriously worried, we don’t know what to do. We don’t know what he will do when he goes to middle school- he is already getting bullied by the other kids- and middle school is a nightmare.

114,"gonna try and keep this vague for discretion.

a month ago my ex broke up with me. i loved him a lot and it's been pretty hard. there was no big fight or inciting incident for our breakup, he decided he wanted to give things with his ex another shot. obviously, that broke my heart, but outside of that, our relationship really had no problems and our breakup went okay.

outside circumstances have made it impossible for me to properly go no contact, but in a little bit that won't be the case anymore. these past few days have been really hard. i do plan on going full no contact as soon as possible no matter what but my brain is nagging at me to tell him a few things i never have before i finally do.

i really want to tell him that i wish the best for him, hope that he finds happiness and his ex treats him the way he deserves to be treated, and that i'm thankful for the time we spent together. i also want to tell him that if he ever wanted for us to try again, i would be okay with that.

is this ever a good idea? is it ever worth it for me to say these things? will it just push him away more? will it just make it worse for myself? i wouldn't spell it out so plainly, usually, but he's the type of guy who needs to be told things to understand it. if i didn't say anything i'm not sure he'd ever know.

117,"Hello reddit! This is my throwaway account. 

I am a 23 year old female. For as long as I can remember, I have always had a gut feeling that something relating to sexual abuse happened to me, but I have never known for sure, because if something did happen - I blocked it and have no memory of it. I have no idea who could've done something to me or what the severity of it could have been. 

These are a few reasons why I have felt this way. I began masturbating at a young age, around 8 I believe. I was very very hyper-sexual from 8 until 20, and now since 20 my sex drive has turned to almost nothing. I feel disgusted at the thought of being touched and the idea of sex makes me feel anxious and panicked. Around the same time that I started masturbating, I would draw erotic pictures. I would draw pictures of people performing sex acts that I had never heard of or seen (I started drawing before I discovered porn) and I have no memory of how I learned those sex acts. But the biggest reason is just a gut feeling. 

However, there are also reasons making me feel like I'm over exaggerating. I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and I have had it since a very young age. Anxiety tends to convince me of outrageous things, so that makes me believe I'm grasping at straws to try to explain why I am the way that I am. (Although, maybe I've had anxiety for so long is because of possible childhood trauma?) I'm afraid I'm trying to make myself feel ""special"". I want sympathy from people, so maybe I'm trying to convince myself of some horrible past to invoke that from others? Even though I have told VERY few people of this, out of fear of judgement. 

Most of the time I don't think about this or worry over it. If something did happen, why not just be thankful that I can't remember? For the most part, it hasn't significantly affected me. But as of recently, it's been hurting my sex drive and my sex life with my long term partner (23M, been with for 5 years). I have 0 libido to the point of thinking I'm actually asexual and I'm disgusted at the thought of being touched. I digress. 

Reddit, am I crazy? Is it even possible to block this amount of trauma? Am I making all of this up? Please help me, I feel like I'm going crazy. 

**tl;dr:** For as long as I can remember, I have always had a gut feeling that I was sexually abused when I was very young, but I have no memory of anything happening. Is it possible to block trauma? To only feel like something happened, but have no recollection of it? ",27May2018,2
118,"Okay my fellow redittors, so I'm 22, and recently had a baby with my long time girlfriend. Things didn't work out, unfortunately, despite our best efforts we decided it was best if we split up for us and our daughter (now a year and a half old.) This all went down approximately a month ago. I shouldn't probably even be thinking about other women at this time, but my attraction to my now-ex has been dull/non-existent for a very long time. Today, at the place I work, I had a really deep conversation with a co-worker that I had found attractive in the past but never got to know (didn't try to hard given that I was in a relationship either.) Turns out we're very alike on alot of things, and I know it's not just a facade because she was very knowledgeable about these topics and was bringing them up to me. I never really let on that I was getting hit pretty hard in the feelings for her but at one point I did say I was happier but that i was worried I wouldn't be able to get a girl in the future because of my current situation, and also mentioned that I didn't want to drag anyone else into my messy situation. She then says to me ""You'd be a real catch""....so now I'm falling some, and granted alot of it is probably newness from vibing with a new person but I can't help but wonder if she feels the same way? I'm guessing that since she said what she did and invited me to hang out with her and a friend whom I also know well sometime, she feeling the same way but I just wanna know do I have a chance here? And am I a terrible person for wanting to pursue this? I don't want to let her slip by if she's the 'one'

Sidenote: also freaking out a little because I work at a fitness center so there's alot of top notch competition, and alot of co-workers find her attractive too. ",27May2018,1
120,"So my mom works at a condo resort and since I just finished school, she thought she would be kind enough to get me my own room for 4 days all by myself.

To get into the resort room, you need a room key to get through one door which leads to a room that can either go to the A Side (which is the fancy side I’m in) or the B Side (the guest room almost). 

I had hid a key outside my room just in case I got locked out with the key inside.

I’m getting ready to go to bed and being the paranoid kid that I am, I go outside to grab the key just in case some creeper might come by and try to find a key. 

As I go outside, all I hear are the words “Boy...” in an old, raggy, creepy sounding voice. Followed by random rustling below me (I’m on second floor)

I quickly lock both doors, lock the door to my maim room 2 times (1 chain lock and a regular lock).

I’m trying to lay in bed but I keep hearing noises and I’m afraid somebody is either A. Trying to get inside my condo or B. I’m f’ing crazy

I kind of got pressured into saying yes to this transaction but I'm having second thoughts and I'm scared that if I do just block this person then I'll get bad karma. halp.,27May2018,1

127,"I’m short on time and stressed, so my apologies if this read is a bit scattered. Here’s the situation:

My sister has been an addict for a couple years now. She’s been to rehab, and it’s cost my mother thousands of dollars. Nothing has changed. She’s twenty, lives with mom, goes to college, works a lot. But she’s an addict, and it it’s fucking with my mother’s well-being. My sister is taking advantage of her. More recently, my mother has been contacting me late at night crying, and she worries about my sister 24/7.  My mother, like a broken record, exclaims she can’t sleep, her heart is racing, and she’s worried my sister will OD/end up in jail if she kicks her out. She doesn’t want to send her to rehab again, as it hasn’t been effective in the past. My sister fails to reach out to her counselors for options.

I undoubtedly love my sister, ever so dearly. But her addiction is toxic. I feel bad for believing kicking her out is the only option, but my sister has never had a taste of reality before. My mother has always been a pushover, and my sister has been taking full advantage of the situation. Sure, we grew up in a broken family, and that impacts us all in both positive and negative ways, and to various extents. But something has to change!

130,"This might be a bit of a long post. I can already tell. But it's the only shot I've got and I'm kind of new to the whole reddit thing.

Not a throwaway account but I'll hide names so it won't leak out too much to people I know. 

My boyfriend is in a state of near homelessness. His mother never really loved him and convinced him to leave his abusive ex girlfriend and move down to this part of the state over 9 hours away before stripping him of all his money and stealing his belongings before ultimately kicking him out. Without anywhere to go he became homeless since his father abandoned him at a young age and his sister was way more than apathetic to the situation. For awhile, he laid low at a local state park and hid out in his car until I came to go get him and we pieced together enough money to find a couch for rent on a local ad on Craigslist. I know it wasn't the safest option but it was what we had at the time. That new living situation horrified him since there were constant drug dealers going in and out of the house banging the girl he lived with that she so happened to pick up from their release from jail. 

Time passes and  we so happen to find another place that charged more but it was a decent roof over his head \(so we thought\). The new room has countless cockroaches and rats sprawling in and out of the property. Mold sprouts were everywhere and I developed respiratory problems whenever I came to see him. 

Eventually in October we managed to find the place he lives in now. It's not horrible and it is quite the blessing we have prayed for. There is a clean bathroom, a clean bedroom and kind individuals renting out the room inside of the house in a live in community. 

However, here is the problem. We feel as through we are stuck. 

We have been in this current situation in his life and it is as though we are not progressing forward as fast as we used to be. 

He is pushing 30 years old and this is what his life has come to. Living out of a rented room in the middle of nowhere town just gaining money and living with individuals he doesn't know taking turns using the bathroom and kitchen like its college. 

I feel as if we are perpetually stuck. I do not know how to move him up in life at the time being since I am living with horrifically conservative parents I cannot take him in as much as I would love to and I do not know what more I can do for him since I have never been in a situation like his. He has a decent paying job outside of town that generates a good $800\+ per bi\-weekly paycheck. The commute is 40 minutes away but what can we do?

How do we begin even the basics of independent life with such a check? How can we balance everything out? How can he shift through a car payment \(which he is not doing at the time since he cannot get ahold of the ex\-girlfriend who loaned him her name to sign for the car in order to get a better APR\), health/car/dental insurance \(which he does not have a single one of these\), finding a place to stay that isn't out the ass in rent alone \(which is difficult in a town like this\) and to continue to progress in life?  

We tried very hard to get him employed for a cruise line doing what he does as a living \(in the salon and spa business\) however it seems with things of that nature and traveling jobs they want someone with good health and without a disability \(he has nocturnal epilepsy.\) 

Anyone that has any advice in anything like this please let me know. I do not know the first thing about going through homelessness alone and rebuilding a life that has been shattered whilst holding down a disability and I just feel hopeless because it seems like most doors are shut and all of it is a dead end. 

Thank you for reading this rambling post. I look forward to hearing some answers. Please any help; and if anyone can tell me some words of encouragement or what to tell him because I feel as if our spirits are at an all time low right now. I would really appreciate someone saying anything that I could tell him so as not to dampen his spirits even more. ",27May2018,1

I’m a sophomore in college right now, just a normal girl with no experience about dating.
After 2 weeks of talking, he said that he liked me. Right after he confessed, he hugged and kisses me a lot. Please don’t blame me for being easy. I was freezing and I did not know what to do... I told him that I needed time as this is too fast and I don’t trust him right now.
Few days later, we met again and still kissed. He also showed that he wanted to sleep with me (his hands kept moving around my body and he wanted me to come over). Of course I freaked out inside, and I made excuses to leave.
It’s summer break right now so I’m not going to see him for the next 3 months. I do like him a lot. I’m not a social person, I have my own comfortable zone with only a few people in it, but I feel that I can share with him anything. I have no doubt that he is a good man, not only with the girls but to everyone else, I mean in the way that he really cares for other people. But my friends told me that although he is really nice, he is the kind that always needs a girl around. I mean, I want to give him a chance and understand him more, but on the other hand, I’m really scared that everything is fake.
I haven’t dated anyone before because I was rapped when I was a child. I always stressed out when a boy gets near to me, even imagine of holding hand another guy would make me feel disgusted. But I didn’t scare when I kiss him though.

I normally don't envolve myself with Reddit, but I'll give it a shot.

Currently 17, I wasn't all that interested in dating because to be honest most men are childish at 17 and I wasn't having any of it. Well, there is this guy at the facility that I work at (19) that is almost 3 years older than me. I really like him. He is down to earth like myself and has his bearings on life. I have talk to him a couple times and he said that he is only going to be at the facility about through summer. (Co-worker rule is not a huge problem it's more of a waiting game).

They all read the message and hasn't gotten back to me, then the girl arrives at home and I ask her about the hole. She says she will fix it so I tell her to reply if thata the case so i can process with secueity deposit. She replies the group chat that she will fix it I processed the security deposit to my roommate that left.

Then a few minutes later, I was followed with a group chat message from the roommate saying that that was not cool as it is his security deposit and none of his gf's, but to be fair the guy and the girl give me rent separately. And at this point he's calling me an asshole. He then writes me a paragraph about this thing that I'm shady that I'm being like a ""lawyer"" and that he doesn't like these things about me because I'm being an asshole.

Fast forward a couple of days ago. I'm at work and this guy Craig waves me over to him. He tells me that the Catfish came to our store looking for him over the weekend and noticed ME. Craig says that the Catfish asks me for my contact info because she thinks that I'm cute. I reluctantly give him my phone number just out of curiosity in the situation. 

Later that night I begin speaking with this Catfish and she asks for my social media. The convo naturally changes in a different direction and she never gets any of my social media info. 

We talk for another day and the next day (third day) she sends me a good morning text then immediately asks for my FB account. I give her my FB name but I never get a friend request.

Later that day I'm at work and I'm trying to get as much info as I can from Craig but I'm not getting much. The day goes on and another coworker of mine who we'll call ""Harold"" non-chalantly asks me what my last name is. I tell him what it is and then continue what I'm doing. Later on he asks me how exactly my first name is pronounced since it can be pronounced different ways depending on the language. Even later on in the day he asks me what my mother's nickname for me is. Someone interrupts us and I dont get to tell him, but now that I think about it I think two co-workers are working together to get access to my social media somehow - slowly fishing for information in order to find something out.

I just wanted to hear from your guys perspective if y'all think I'm being overly paranoid or not.

I finally noticed when I wanted to take photos and there were stripes down the screen. I rushed in to rinse it in fresh water and then got it in rice quickly. This means from the moment I noticed to the moment it was in rice was about a total of 10 minutes. After a day of the rice treatment the phone is dry and will not start up.

I have tried everything online and nothing has worked. A friend left hers on the car dashboard for a couple of days by accident and then it worked again - it isn’t hot at the moment here and I suspect the problem is not the water it is the salt crystals.

My defense mechanism is to pretend not to care(like loads of people I’m sure). That makes it worse because I physically and mentally perform even worse. How do I overcome this mental obstacle?

158,"A little background to my relationship with her: I'm fifteen. She cannot provide for me materially or emotionally as she is unemployed and possibly mental disordered. It is hard to have a stable conversation without her twisting it into an argument which ends up with me wanting to die. I've been told by a counsellor that her words are extremely abusive, which was a shock to me as I'm used to it despite still getting angry and depressed over her behaviour.

She cannot keep a job for more than four months, thus I have gotten a job as soon as I turned 14 and have made money to buy my daily meals and other things for school\- basically I can live fine without her, apart from her paying to put a roof over my head. 

My trust in her isn't stable. I will often ask her to assist me in some school or food needs and she will always say 'yes' but never keep her word. I'm naive and I fall for it every time and my trust in her is broken time and time again. I can't have a connection with her like a normal mother and daughter would\- whenever she rarely displays affection to me, such as sudden hugging and kissing, it weirds me out and I begin to wonder what ulterior motives she has for doing so.

I want to somehow make myself become passive to anything she does or says. I don't have an option to live away from her, so I imagine the scenario would just be me ignoring her. I just want to stop getting myself hurt by her. Literally anything will help me at this point, I'm willing to consider anything at all. I've had enough of this.

I'm currently hiding out in a coffee shop because at my flat our smoke alarm has been beeping every 30 seconds for 2 days.  I know it needs new batteries but we have very high ceilings and i cant reach it. I can't afford a ladder. 

My landlady said it was my responsibility so she wont help, and my roommate is gone until tomorrow night. Ive tried all i can think of: pressing the reset button with a long pole (just made it stop for 5 minutes before starting again), trying to turn off a switch in the fuse box to it (They weren't labelled and i didnt want to just switch things off randomly), just whacking it with the pole (mothers idea, did not help).

Sometimes it stops for an hour and i think its fixed but it just starts again. 

This feels like such a basic issue but i have no idea what to do and am going to go insane having to sit with it beeping again all evening.  Any advice would be welcomed, thank you.

160,"So this week my friend, (we’ll call him Dave), invited me to go to his to watch the Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid. He asked me if I wanted to go on a night out to get drunk after and I said I’m too poor for a haircut (I’m a student) let alone more nights out, but I was up for watching the game and it was perfect because I was going back to my hometown anyway for a barbecue the next day, and he said he’d pick me up from the train station. 

He picked me up from the train station with my other friend, (who we’ll call Steve). Dave dropped me and Steve at one of Steve’s friends house, who happens to sell weed every now and then, I haven’t seen the guy since I was about 16 so it was interesting to see how much he had changed. Dave drove back to his house because he had another friend coming to watch the game.

Me and Steve smoked a joint and walked over to Dave’s house and that’s where it went downhill. All he did was take the piss out of us. There he was, shouting at the telly every time someone touched the ball, but every time me or Steve spoke he’d snap with something like “pipe down, who said you could talk?” And constantly commenting to his other friend and dad that I look homeless because of my mop hair and the fact I’ve grown a beard, other “banter” talk like that went around the room. He also mentioned that he’s already had 5 cans of cider, which actually put me on edge a little bit because I don’t see how he had time to drink 5 cans between picking me up from the station and then. I really hope he wasn’t drink driving. 

Later into the game he started really ripping us both, and brought up Steve’s ex girlfriend. I did say to Steve later that it was probably just shanter (shit banter) and he said that he could see it in Dave’s eyes that he meant it. I should also mention that Steve has been really depressed about it and had been cutting himself because of it. Steve’s a pretty weird guy though and he’s into some crazy shit so to be honest him cutting himself is probably less extreme than some of the sexual fantasies he’s told me he has. 

Now I’m terrible in social situations, even when they’re my friends, if I’m in a group of more 3+ including myself, I really struggle to form sentences clearly and stutter a lot. He started ripping me. 

“I’m the only person that’s come to visit you at uni” It’s not true, I’ve had 2 or 3 people come and visit me.

“I’m the only friend that gives a shit about you” Steve is sat right next to me

“Yeah you’re friends with Steve but all he does is give you weed every now and then” he’s given me weed once in my life, and he’s done loads of stuff for me, we had been playing football together since we were about 8, until we were 16.

He also brought up the holiday he paid for me to go on a few years ago. He didn’t really pay for the holiday, he paid for 1/4 of the price, and to be honest it was horrible for me having to spend 2 weeks with him, hearing him bitch his mum around, saying stuff like “iron my shirt bitch”. Although this did sound VERY jokey, and I think his mum was playing along a bit.

This really pisses me off, because he always brings up the “I’m a good friend because of it, aren’t I” which I think he always brings up that line because he’s insecure or something about losing his friends, just needs conformation. I keep telling him that I’d pay for him to go on holiday one day, but like I said, I can’t even afford a haircut at the moment.

Half time comes, finally, and me and Steve leave to go to the shops. Dave is going on and on saying “I hope you don’t come back”, “I don’t want you to come back”, “I won’t be surprised if you don’t come back”, and I kept reassuring him we were coming back, as I did genuinely think we were going back. Steve didn’t say anything until we were past the high street, which confused me a lot because I kept asking which shop we were going to and we walked past all of them.

Anyway me Steve watched the football at his and shared our opinions on the matter, I told him to message Dave the next day to tell him why we left and that it upset him, and I said I’ll message him that day, which I forgot to do until this morning. I sent:

“Can I get my bag from your car? Forgot I left it in there. The only reason we didn’t come back was because you kept coming out with personal stuff and Steve got pissed when you brought up his ex. I did genuinely think we were just going to the shops at half time but tbh it did feel a bit shit turning up at your house and basically being told to leave the entire time, being told to pipe down every time we spoke, and you going at me about not having other friends and shit. Just think you need to calm down with that sort of banter sometimes. Also I dunno how you managed to have 5 cans between picking me up from the station and us getting to yours but idk”

His reply?

“(Laughing face x2)”

“Perhaps I wouldn't be such a cunt if you were a better friend”

“Didn't even get a fucking thanks for picking you up either”

We use the word ‘cunt’ quite a lot when the banters good, I think because when we were younger we didn’t have a clue what it meant and made up our own meaning, and it kind of stuck. Also he didn’t even say hi to me when he picked me up.

I told Steve that he said this, and Steve said he’s probably not going to message him for about a week. This post may sound like he’s just a shitty person that doesn’t need to be in our lives, but the thing with him is that he’s fine to be with when you’re alone with him, he’s actually pretty great to be around and just chill with, or go on nights out with just him. 

I think the advice I’m asking for here is simply what can we do about it? He’s VERY stubborn and there’s no way to form an argument he’d accept, but I feel like I need to tell him that it’s not okay to bring up our personal problems in front of his friends that we’ve never even met (Steve and I still don’t even know his name).

Also, again, terrible in social situations and I left my suitcase in his car. The suitcase is only full of a change of clothes for the weekend and a bin bag full of washing so it’s not the most important thing in the world.

TLDR: friends shitty banter is always taken too far or too personal and he won’t accept that he’s wrong. Also he has a suitcase of mine that I forgot I left in his car.",27May2018,2

So I used to work in a videogame retail store 2 years ago from February 2016 to May the same year, fairly short time. But there I got in this interesting dynamic with my ex-manager where it all started in this sort of rivalry to an ever increasing sexual tension between both us to some sort of emotional bonding. We started hanging out together, he would gift me stuff, walk me to the bus stop after work, talked about our personal stuff etcetera.

The thing is that after I left I haven't been able to stop thinking about him, I already fantasized about him when I worked there but the urge I had felt stronger after I left. It's been 2 years and he's still the first thing I think of when I'm ""blowing off some steam"" 

I've been trying to reach him after I left but he's ever so hard to chat online with, and I used to pay him visits on the retail store but he doesn't work there either anymore.

For the record we are not married but are in our respective relationships and were already by the time I was working there, but also at that time we were both having issues in our relationships, and been both cheated on.

I have thought about asking him out or just being straight about my feelings for him but right now I'm in a very happy point in my relationship and I don't really want to change that...but I can't still get him outta my Head, some part of me is still longing to have him as close as my boyfriend is

His dad wasn’t very involved until he was about a year old and he only saw him sporadically up until he was about 3. He then started seeing him every other weekend regularly till this day. We just went through a custody battle where he was trying to get full custody of him because he doesn’t believe that I am a good enough parent to raise him since I don’t have a lot of money and I live in a trailer (his words). He has a house, a decent job, and a fiancée (who she’s actually the one that takes care of the child when he is there, my son tells me that himself.) but anyways since my was about 4 years old he’s had a very hard time with listening to women specifically. It seems that when a male figure would tell him something, he would listen, but if I was there he would throw a huge fit, and act out 1000 times worse. I’m usually pretty calm when it comes to his meltdowns but recently I’ve been yelling a lot more and just been so frustrated because I just don’t understand what I’m doing wrong. 

I do understand that he is just a child, but I think that there is a point of him being a child and not listening, and deliberately not listening to me but listening to someone who is a male. 

I feel like this does sound petty and stupid, but I’m just at my wits end. I feel like it’s hard for me to have a relationship with a child who is constantly disrespecting me, purposely acting out in public and not listening, not being able to see doctors or dentists  because if he knows I’m there he will act out, but if someone else takes him there he will do whatever the doctor/dentist says.

179,"Hello peeps of Reddit. 

So I have an issue I need some help with, any ideas, advice or experiences would be greatly appreciated. 

It all started about a year ago when I went to a friend's house who had used a Ouija board about 2 weeks before the first time I went there. I'm not very religious but I've always been in the state of mind that, although I didnt know whether spirits are real, I wouldn't wanna fuck with one just in case they were. 

So anyways, the night after the first time I stayed they, I was going to bed in my own home and I could hear what sounded like a woman being raped. And I mean I could hear every word of it. The man screaming, the woman pleading for help etc. I was so sure of what I was hearing I went into my roommates room on 4 different occasions that night to get him to hear it because I believed it was a neighbor and I couldn't morally go to sleep knowing what I was hearing. 

Each time we checked it out he couldn't hear anything and it seemed to stop. We even walked around the neighborhood and it wasn't there anymore. But every time I tried to go back to sleep it started again. 

So I eventually put on a podcast, blocked it out and went to sleep. But I would hear it from time to time when going to sleep after this. 

A few weeks passed and I was in my friends house where it started and the situation was occuring again as I was trying to go to sleep. But this time, I could hear her, her husband, and her son. And I could hear every word of it. Them screaming for help, her husband screaming ""is this what you want!?"" And ""if you try help her I'm gonna kill her"" and the woman repeatedly saying to herself ""I've had a good life"" and the situation reached it's end.

It was absolutely terrifying. But then, after it ended, I heard the woman say my name. I almost cried in fear. She told me she's talking to me, and not to be afraid, which as a 20 year old man, boy, whatever, isn't gonna help in that situation. 

She told me she wasn't going to hurt me and to go into a quieter room so I could hear her clearly. I said fuck that \(she replies to my thoughts\), but eventually went in with a friend at the house. She told me her name was Alexa, and that she needed help, but could only be helped by me living a fulfilled life. 

I had something on my mind that the friend in the room had told me, won't get into it but as a man, it was VERY UNETHICAL. So she basically told me I had to come clean. So I did. I explained the voice too but they didn't believe me, so I asked her to tell me something about them that no one else knows, and she did. 

It was right, but one said ""that could be about anyone"". The situation ended inconclusively, but the voice persisted. 

I asked her another time to tell me something about my roommate in the same manner and when I told him, he had goosebumps because again, it was true and shocked him with the accuracy. 

Anyways, in the last year the voice hasn't stopped, and haa kept asking for help but I ignore it out of fear, and I desperately want it to stop. Everytime I'm in silence I can hear her. It's like an echo, sorta like a concert you can hear in the distance but just her voice. Since I've been ignoring her she conveyed the initial murder again, along with begging me for help, but I never get a straight answer when asking how can I help her so she stops. 

So my question is, has anyone experienced something similar to this. I can't talk to many people close to me about this since they usually respond with either uncertainty of what I should do or thinking that I'm schizophrenic. But I do feel crazy and like that at times, but I've looked into what those voices are like and it's not similar in any way. She's not hostile, she usually wants me to do better at things and it's not in my head, it orginates from whatever is in my environment, particularly when I'm not preoccupied. 

I miss the sound of silence, I haven't heard it in almost a year now, and I feel trapped. I want this to end but I can't control it. I have to go to sleep listening to podcasts every night, and when I start hearing her my heart rate picks up and it scares me. 

I'm planning on visiting a priest and then a medium if the former doesn't help. But has anyone else experienced anything like this? And if so how did you deal with it, how did you get it to stop if you did? Or is it just something I have to live with and I'm going to half to engage with her?

Again, any help is greatly appreciated and thanks for reading this big essay. ",27May2018,1

184,"On mobile so format and stuff.

Now before anyone really says to let my dad divorce, I'm can say with utmost certainty that my dad has considered that idea. But he wouldn't have done so because of my sisters and I.

Moving on, my mum has terrible spending habits, which I unfortunately took a habit of. I very much hate it but nothing can't be fixed. My dad used to be an engine checker at the airport before meeting my mum. Back then airport stuff got ridiculous benefits and as much as he would hate to admit, I was sure that my mum was catfishing him so that she could experience the wonders of the world. Of course luck would have it he changed jobs because he wanted ro get back to his usual food industry buisness. Before moving to caterer, then private hirer driver, taxi driver and now grab driver. 

Recently he got into an accident (minor no injuries) which got him a couple thousand dollars. He's pretty thrilled about it saying that he'll be able to bring our family on a short family trip. But my mum took it all. Every cent. Now my dad can't even top up his cash card or fuel. Its freakin tragic and I'm pretty much powerless to stop her and unable to help my own dad. She says she'll use it for paying the bills but she has also been taking money from my sister saying the same thing. Just today she brought us to a restaurant which i found mighty suspicious (cough). 

Whenever she takes money from my sister ana dad she'll say its because my dad didn't give her money for the day(to sister) or she doesnt have money (to dad). She has her own job too. Its frustrating seeing her prancing around with money. Its so bad to the point where my dad's sis just gives him money because she knows the predicament we're in. Yet my mum still has the gull to criticise my dad to my sister about what a terrible husband he is. My dad cant even save money without it being taken immediately away.

I wanted to ask for advice on how my dad can save money without the paranoid mother I have to live with finding out and how my dad and I can live with as little tension as possible. My mum has access to my dad's accounts Usually the tension that I accidentally exurt is so obvious that my mum just writes it off as a typical teen. What are we to do. 

Even if you all dont have much advice I just really needed a listening ear. Thanks for stopping by.",27May2018,2

My parents constantly tell me low marks = failure of the family, and I've been getting it day after day after day. They keep telling me the very same sentence ""I am warning you, one more bad grade and you will fail for life"", Don't they think I know that already? I am already trying my best to at least get by, but all I ever get is ""You could've done better."" I know they only want the best out of me, but sometimes it's so unreasonable...",27May2018,1
186,"I'm a little past 20 years old and all my life, I've done nothing but play video games and procrastinate on important things. 

When I was in high school (we call it college in my country) I had a very hard time making friends partly because I couldn't (and still can't) hold a conversation with someone for more than 2 minutes. This meant that I would turn to online  video games when I got home from school. I had a lot of acquaintances there but no real friends . Online video games gave me a place to be social when everyone else chose to mark me as an outcast. This is when I started to become increasingly lazy and started to focus less and less on my future.

When my parents noticed that my grades were failing (I used to hide my test scores from them), they started enrolling me in private tuitions. Needless to say, this was a waste of time and money. Having no friends and no other interest in other things, I started ditching school &amp; my private lessons to play video games. When I did go to school I never listened to the lectures and as a result, everyone at my school thought I was an idiot (which I am). During lunch breaks, I used to sit alone in class and read comic books. This went on for 5 years and to this day, I still don't know how I survived there.

5 years have passed and I still play video games all day everyday. Currently, I'm doing a degree in Information technology at a mediocre uni/college (2nd year). The worst part,  I have no work experience and no desire to pursue a career in IT. I still have no real friends and still procrastinate on important matters, like completing my assignments at the very last minute and what not. I have no talents, ZERO social skills and I strongly believe that I'm a slow learner. Basically, I'm a complete failure.

I can't break the cycle. My mental health has deteriorated along with my physical health. I've no desire to do anything but play video games because I suck at everything else. It's basically a disease at this point. Recently, I've come to the realization that I have social anxiety. Going outside can be incredibly hard for me. When I walk on the streets, I feel that people are judging me. At uni, group assignments are incredibly stressful because I have to interact with my group members. I'm scared of saying stupid things so I just don't talk at all. People must be making fun of me inside their heads. With this mindset and personality, I don't know how I'll ever get a job.

My parents did everything they could to give me a proper future but I failed them. My dad recently passed away and I'm living alone with my mother. My elder sister and elder brother are doing great abroad. Both of them have well paying jobs and are already way ahead of me socially. My sister is getting married this year while my brother is currently dating a successful woman. My siblings always encouraged me to work harder but I always though they were annoyances. I have nothing but myself to blame.

At the moment I have zero motivation. I wish I could turn away from video games and doing nothing but everytime I try to I realize just how lonely my life is and how little I have achieved. That only throws me back into the game and doing jackshit.

What should I do to remedy my situation?

187,"19M and I just finished my first year of college. I should probably start from the beginning of the year so you guys get the whole picture, so just bare with me for a moment. Things were going alright, made some good friends, had some alright grades, and so on. There was this one girl; however, that I felt like I really clicked with, let’s call her Hannah.

Me and Hannah had a class together first semester and we talked a little, but it was usually just class talk. There was this other girl in the class though that had a crush on me and made it very clear, I’ll call her Amy. Amy was kind of cute, but if I’m being totally honest, she was a little weird. During the last day of class Amy wanted to grab some lunch with me, and considering we were just going over a study guide in my next class, I agreed. Amy was almost adamant that this was, in-fact, a date (it was lunch in the student center) and let me know, in probably the most awkward way possible, that she was legal. I can’t really blame her for being awkward, I’m always stumbling over my words, but there was just something unsettling about the whole thing. 

Anyway, on our way to the table we ran into Hannah who was just leaving, we chatted for a little and, then parted ways and me and Amy sat down. Lunch was alright for the most part although it mostly consisted of her talking about a situation involving car insurance that she was in the middle of. After we finished eating we said our“see you laters” and that was the last time I saw Amy.

Fast forward to the beginning of next semester and I’m in a class that consists of mostly the same people minus Amy. Me and Hannah sort of just gravitated towards each other and spent the rest of the semester talking. She was smart, cute, funny, nice, thinking back I don’t know why I didn’t try to work up the courage to ask her out, even when all the signs were pointing towards it. There was one instance where we were talking about the week and she asked about why my plans were. I told her I had some family visiting from out of town and asked about what she had going on. She replied with something along the lines of “Nothing really, I hardly ever have plans”.

I know, you don’t have to say it, I’m an oblivious idiot, nothing I can do about that now. But despite all this, I never got her number (probably still on me for not asking). Anyway fast forward, it’s now the day of the class final and I’ve worked up the courage to ask her out, the only thing standing in my way was the final. This was predominately a writing class, and despite what this post may lead you to believe, I’m a pretty decent writer. The class had to write an in class essay on one of a variety of prompts. I got done with my essay in pretty good time, but Hannah was still only like halfway through from what I could tell. I knew if I was going to wait, it could have been another 30 minutes. My mom needed my car for something pretty urgent.

Would 30 more minutes really matter? Would I look creepy if I had waited for her to finish? Deciding not to risk it, I left.

Did I make a mistake in not waiting? Would it look creepy if I made an account and followed her on Instagram? (I have a Facebook account, just never got into Instagram) Do you think she was off put by me and Amy? 

And the biggest question of all. Am I over thinking this? I have a really bad habit of worrying about stuff that doesn’t matter and vice versa.

189,"Well, the thing is rather complex so I'll give you all the details \(there is a TD;LR at the end of the post\).

First,   I need to say I'm a 19yo French male and still leave with my parents.   So yesterday night I was in the streets, heading to a park with a  friend  to drink and have a good time. I was having fun asking random  people if  they were kind to prove to my friend that people were kind  \(most of the  time\)... I am aware this is no proof but whatever, it was  fun. So we  stumbled upon this Asian girl who didn't understand us when  we asked her  if ""elle était gentille"". So we asked her in English but  she didn't  understand well either.

The  thing is,  this started a conversation and she toughed us she was  Japanese and had  no place to sleep tonight. My friend then offered her  to stay at his  place for a night  and she said yes. We than drank a bit  in the park  \(she didn't though\), listened to music and spoke about who  she was. So  she told us :

1. Her name was Marie but she chose it because she didn't know what her Japanese name was \(wtf ?\)
2. She was 36
3. She used to live in Korea but people there tried to kill her
4. She was looking for a job \(preferably in a Japanese restaurant\)
5. She liked classical and French music

So   when she got tired we headed back at my friend's. The problem is my   friend's mother didn't agree to let a 36 yo stranger in her house... So I   told both Marie and my friend they could come at my place. It was past   midnight and we were 1h30 by foot away from home.

Well   we walked all the way to my place. On the way she told us that her   suitcase was stolen from her when she was in Paris. We then went to bed   in my room at 02:14 am \(she slept in my bed, I slept on a sofa and my   friend slept on an inflatable mattress\).

This   morning I let her use the shower and all, then we had breakfast and my   mother asked her a lot of question before offering her to stay longer.   Marie said yes and thanks us. With thiese questions, we learned that :

1. She had a European residency authorization
2. She tried to go to the  Japanese embassy to look for help but got refused
3. She had Korean  papers \(passport, license\)

Then my friend  had to go so I accompanied him to the train station with Marie who  wanted to keep on looking for a job.

We spoke again waiting for the  train and we learned more :

1. She was born in Japan and was kidnapped
2. She ended up in Korea and was adopted there
3. People in Korea  abused her and ""put medicine in \[her\] body"" as she said imitating a  syringe in her arm
4. She has a Korean name but didn't want to use it  \(I saw it but didn't memorized it well... something like Eunjin I think\)
5. She went to Germany \(and got her European papers there\)
6. She  went to Kosovo looking for work but realised it was a pretty dangerous  place to live in, then moved to France
7. She has been in France for 30  days
8. She  studied a bit in the University of Tokyo but her adoptive  father in  Korea told her to come back as he couldn't afford it anymore
9. Her adoptive sisters took her Japanese papers when she got back
10. She learned around that time that she was Japanese... because she didn't  know
11. She  showed us a photo of the baby version of her in Korea  \(there is  written ""MITSUBISHI"" and ""1984"" at the back and some kanjis  \(is it  called kanji ?\), characters I can't read.
12. She doesn't want to  speak Korean nor go to the Korean embassy
13. She is not allowed to  come back to Japan \(I didn't understand why\)

As I got back home, my father told me he didn't believe her at all.

This is all I know, but I'll keep you informed.

So here is my question : WTF SHOULD I DO ? Should I believe her ? Should I impose this to my family ?

I   don't want to just push her out of my house, I don't want her to sleep   in the street, she's a kind person and no one deserves to sleep in the   streets. I plan to help her create a Couchsurfing account and ask  people  on Facebook and Twitter for help to find her a job.

Do you have any advice ? I would muuuuch appreciate it ! Thank you for reading !

TD;LR   : I hosted a 36yo Japanese girl yesterday because she was about to   sleep in the street. She told me she was kidnapped when she was a baby   and brought to Korean where she was abused by her family. She has Korean   papers and a European residency authorization. What should I do ? How   can I help her ?",27May2018,7

When it comes to the excuse that I live too far, I would be fine with accepting that because I do live far. However, one of these friends live in my area and the other friends always seem fine making the trek to this neighbourhood to hang out with him without telling me.

196,"I was a recluse and depressed and suicidal through high school, college and mba and spent it playing vidyagames and eating cheetos and my self esteem was too low to even thinking of getting with someone. I also had 1 friend.

After college, I started a really challenging, well paid job, and really valued and enjoyed life for the first time(investment banking). I also found a group of really close friends from work (mainly female) who invited me to things and introduced me to a lot of people.

Because of my work persona, confidence and sexual jokes, they sorta assumed that I had experience. Initially I didn’t deny it and just didn’t say anything. After a while, I just started inventing random exes and stories of my escapades to match up with my image. This was a huge mistake. Soon I had a complex fabricated history of my past life with necessary consistency with my real past life tat I have to maintain with my close friends.

I’ve been hit on by girls in parties hosted by above friends and they offered to set me up with people a lot of times but I pretended like all the girls were not my type/was focusing on other things at the moment/had an fwb - because the girl would know my friends and would tell them I’m a virgin and blow the cover. One of my close friends actually suspects I’m gay.

I’m 25 and life is running out. I really like my friends but I’m sure they wouldn’t take it well if I told them and IB is a small world with the Chinese whispers of something like this could definitely fuck with my career.

I feel like a worthless joke I was in college who plays a charismatic, cool character at work and in social events.

Also getting experience on the sly with osts is not an option because I live in a society liberal enough that upper middle class people can get laid before marriage and people fuck on the 3rd date approx but not liberal enough that I can rock up at a bar and get laid unless I have crazy game. Also fwbs aren’t really an option.

I dunno if the solution is:

1. Find  a gf away from my social circle to get experience with, that I don’t introduce my friends to, break up with her after a few months. Keep story straight with social circle. Morally, this is very fucked up because I’m using someone as a means to an end. Pragmatically, girl will think I’m treating her like shit/cheating if I don’t introduce her to any of my friends. Not inclined.

2. Hookers. Get experience, keep story straight. I have zero idea how this works.

3.  Move to a new city, get a new job, don’t fabricate lies about my life, find a stable gf who I’m honest to. Stay in decent touch with old friends/meet in case paths cross. This sounds feasible but obv is expensive/risky

199,"My name's Seth, and I'm a computer science honors major at a state university. I am prefacing this by saying that I won't complete college in 4 years most likely. My first year I tried to eat a gun and ended up in the hospital. I managed to make up all the finals I missed, and get full credit for both semesters, but I believe that a 5 year will be more accommodating and less pressure for me. 

Socially I'm what would be defined as a failure, but I don't mind it. I have one friend, no friends on campus, and I rarely leave my dorm room. Every year I lose about 20lbs from not wanting to have to go to the cafeteria caus it involves contact with another individual. At 6 foot 1 I drop down to 130lbs. I see my friend probably once every week or two, and spend most of my time working on my fishtanks. I personally enjoy this lifestyle, and I'm not incapable of socialization, I just dislike the type of people around me on campus. I don't drink or smoke, and parties just aren't my scene, so meeting people is hard. My personality can be pretty abrasive, I was raised with a cop/military father who frequently took on fatal accidents. Pair his morbitity with 8 years of depression, and you get a sense of humor so dark cops try and beat it up for walking down the street. As a result, friends tend to be few and far between. After my lil breakdown freshman year I got treated and now I'm A-OK. Haven't had any issues since. I'm now a sophomore. 

My major puts me two classes away from a math minor. I enjoy math, and was debating just going balls deep and pulling a double major in computer science &amp; mathmatics. A master's degree in computer science is also not out of the question for me. I don't struggle with the work, however I have a difficult time motivating myself to do it until the last second. If procrasturbating was an Olympic sport, I'd gold metal. Id be double majoring with the intent of getting a leg up on the competition, I'm hunting internships for CS, but I feel like a better understanding of math would enable me to go a lot further in my career  So the advice I'm looking for is:

How does having a double major impact my marketability in the job market

Is having a bachelor's degree and a masters valuable if they are both in STEM

How rough would a mathmatics major be if I have no issue with memorizing and studying over the summer and breaks to prepare myself for the coming courses

How does just having two bachelors degrees compare to a bachelor's and a masters. 

Is it ok to have very few friends and focus more on my studies?

200,"Okay first things first this might be the wrong place to post this, but I just wanted to share one of my experiences as a straight but slightly camp male that has been regularly called gay (in a negative way) from a very young age. 

Hi, so I have a few friends who will constantly give me ‘personally sensitive’ banter but can’t seem to take it back. So I mainly get banter for being gay and being socially awkward.

Bit of a background, I am: getting good grades, 6ft2, athletic build, good looking and a starter on the most successful sports team at the university. That wasn’t me boasting, this is the reason I think people give me shit all the time. I will openly admit I can be a bit camp and a bit feminine at times (spent a lot of time with just my mum and sister). I also have had a lot of guys interested in me and have also made one close gay friend who was originally hitting on me and helped me with a paper. I was also teased massively at school for being gay and even questioned it myself because of all the bullying. Ive told all of my close friends about what happened at school and how it made me go through a bad period. I don’t go out partying as much as my other friends because of sports/studying and have less close friends than most of my friends (hence the socially awkward banter).

The gay banter does annoy me more for two reasons, sexuality should not be used as an insult whether the person is of that sexuality or not and the second reason is I feel it’s the constant stereotype I’ve had my whole life of there’s a pretty boy who looks after himself let’s call him gay (so they can make me look inferior in front of girls). Btw I don’t think being gay is inferior in a masculine way, but clearly a lot of people do.

So just now I had one of my female flat mates call me gay for washing my hands after taking the bins out and socially awkward with no friends (as that’s the first time I’ve gone out of the house today, but that’s because I’m studying for finals). In response I said you might want to cover up your thunder thighs while we’re out here (she’s actually in good shape, not athletic but good shape). Shit hit the fan, she and her friends are now giving me the silent treatment. They have said how you should never talk about a girls weight (which I agree with, but if you want to give it out take it?) and giving me constant insults.

This also happens with some male friends they’ll call me gay, and I’ll say something along the lines of most girls don’t like men that have bigger tits than them or insult something about their physical appearance. Some of my friends will laugh it off but some get all shitty like I was the dick. I think my male friends do it because some of them are immature and think it’s a constant dick comparing competition especially when girls are around. 

All my friends know about the above insecurities and like to give me banter for it. I’ve learnt to live with this banter over the years and believe it’s probably helped me overcome the underlying issues. I honestly don’t care if someone insults me or gives me banter, however I do expect them to be able to take some back. I think this is because I see it as them trying to dominate or make themselves feel superior to me (as if they’re too good for criticism).

I seem to be very good at finding someone’s insecurities and normally target this when giving banter back. Which obviously hurts them if they haven’t accepted/resolved their insecurity.

So my question is am I going too far and just shouldn’t respond? (The thing is I enjoy the banter with my friends that can take it, just hate the idiots who cry when you give it back). Or should they get a grip and not take life so serious especially if they want to give others shit?",27May2018,1

I'm 19 in June and I really have no goals. Don't get me wrong I'm a well mannered kid and performed well in high school. but starting at around Junior year I just stopped caring. About everything. I let my grades fall in college (I'm going reluctantly on scholarship), I'm always bored and never want to do anything. I usually lay on my bed and watch youtube. When I run out of things to watch I close my phone, lay on my bed for some time, and watch youtube again. 

Nothing is fun to me nothing is interesting. I'm so bored all the time that I'm borderline depressed...So I tried self improvement.

I read books and I've looked it up but all these things seem to have an unattainable pre-requisite: Having a ""passion."" 

I don't have a passion. Seems like the foundation to building relationships, a meaningful life, *anything* requires a passion for something. A purpose. Well I don't really have... anything evidently. I have such a nihilistic view on things. I feel like I'm not actively participating in life but merely spectating from the stands.

210,"This is my first reddit post so bear with me. Last night was the banquet for one of my high school activities and I left it feeling heartbroken and insulted. 

A little bit of backstory, I️ have been the captain of this team for over a year now and have spent the past two years doing everything for this team. I️ would stay way to late after school, sometimes not getting home until 9. I would help the coach in every way possible and I️ believe that we have cultivated a very personal relationship. On the other hand, there was another individual who I️ worked alongside with in this activity and while I️ don’t believe that he does much, everyone fawns over him. He purposely does not communicate with me on decisions that I️ need to make and operates completely by himself without asking anyone for help just so when it is said and done, he can get all the recognition. 

And that’s exactly what happened last night. After a year of sacrificing every part of myself to this team, I️ got little to no recognition, and the recognition I️ did get was overshadowed by him. For instance, after not being awarded any of the other awards, the coach came up with some plaque to give me, gave me a 15 second speech, and then moved on to give a 2 minute speech about how fantastic the other person is and was sobbing the entire time. This hurt so bad and this was the point in the night when I️ realized that everything I️ did for two years was for nothing. This activity was never about trophies for me, but the least I️ wanted at the end of this long journey was some recognition. 

So, I️ don’t know what to do now. My coach wants me to come back throughout the summer before I️ leave for college but honestly, I’m considering completely breaking all ties with her because of the lack of appreciation I’ve received. The only thing holding me back from this i️s that I️ know that the team will not function without me there, which has been proven on numerous occasions. 

What do I️ do? Cut ties? Swallow my pride?

TL;DR: I️ feel spited by the coach for whom I️ sacrificed a lot of personal time to support. I️ want to cut them off but I️ don’t know if I️ should or how.

The thing is that these are both things I've always seen myself having, both kids and marriage, since I can really remember.

 I'm trying to reconcile this but I am not sure that I can, and since we had this discussion things don't feel the same between us, (at least from my end I'm not sure if it's changed things for her).

I looked at my universities job openings and they have a library assistant type job where I would be working 11PM-8AM, Sunday through Thursday monitoring the library and making sure everything is running smoothly. The pay is not listed however so I have no idea how much I'd make. I also spoke to my best friend and he told me ""No. More. Third. Shift. Jobs."" I am considering applying for the job, despite this, because it means I can still work on my school work and pay my bills.

I would be able to get my school work done, study, and be able to go home and sleep a proper amount. I am currently staying up all night anyways because being unemployed has messed up my ""sleep schedule.""

I feel like since I'm essentially a night owl now along with the benefits of getting my school work done while at school could help me get through the next 7 months until I graduate.

Let me start of by giving some background information. I come from an Indian background and grew up Canada. After graduating high school 8 years ago, I headed to India to pursue medical school. Throughout middle school and high school, my parents never allowed me to have a girlfriend because they wanted me to focus on my academics (I'm a national scholar). When I began medical school, the same rule applied. I didn't argue because it really helped me score very good marks in medical school.

I am currently in Vancouver doing a residency program in pathology. I am earning a decent income (for now, once I finish residency and start working full time, I'll make a lot more) and live in an apartment. I should also mention that I'm an introvert. I've been playing the guitar since I was 9 so I'm very skilled at it. I also like to read and draw so there's no shortage of hobbies. My family is in Ontario so that leaves me with plenty of freedom and time to date. As I mentioned, I've never had a girlfriend. I'm also still a virgin because I'm not into casual sex of any kind (hooking up, FWB). What advice do you have for me? Will my lack of experience repel girls?

222,"So, hello. I'm almost 17 and I've had acne for 10/11 years. No one ever understood why I started having acne, the only thing we can think about is bad eating.

Yeah, I'm a picky eater. I eat lots of meat/potatoes/carbs/sugar/fried stuff (chocolate) and almost no sea food/veggies and poor fruit. I've been working to eat almost everything. The reason why I don't eat much it's because of a (well at least it's what the doc said) psychological situation where I deny a lot of food since I get nausea just by almost eat them.

I've made myself eat a type of fish (even tho, fried) new typed of pasta and I eat lentils with some spices and carrots, like of they were meatballs. Do you have any other picky eater tips?

Another reason of my acne is my laziness. Honestly, I'm very lazy, I don't know if it's because of my probable depression/anxiety but heck when I need to do my skin care I always post pone it. Even because I only cleanse it. What should I do? Like I mean, exfoliate, tone it(?)

Again, I suffer from anxiety, probably depression and I'm going through a lot of stress. I've recently broke up with a boy younger than me because it was an abusive relationship and he still tries to get me, then there is my school problem where and I'm near my monthly hell.

I went to a dermatologist and she said that I might have too many hormones (?) But till now I never was put under a cure or something like that. I also don't wear anymore foundation and I actually drink quite a lot. I always get my Vitam D by walking from home to school and school to home, plus hanging out with my mom doing shopping. All this walking is also my physical exercise.

My acne is not that severe but it's annoying, I have it all over my cheeks, chin, cheek bones and some on my forehead. I have them on shoulders, back, chest and arms.

I have contacted the police about this and first they told me to wait. After a few more accounts were made I called again. I told them that I know who it is because I recognize the way he talks and the things he does. They contacted him but he of course denies it. For a few days after that nothing happened.

I'm a college student, studying engineering at a highly ranked school. I didn't get an internship this summer because I didn't try very hard and I hadn't taken any major related classes. I'm very confidant I can get one next summer.

Currently, I am working a customer service job at an entertainment place(no relation to my future, just trying to make some cash). I've worked for about 40 hours so far, and it sucks. I can't stand my manager. When they hired me, they told me that the mechanic position was open, and that they'd move me there in about a month. A few days after I started, they began training someone else for the mechanic position. So I'm not getting it. So all around, the job sucks.

But more importantly, it sucks because it's very physically taxing(on feet all day for 10 hour shifts) and I'm trying to make my college's cross country team. Running is *everything* to me, and I know for a fact that if I stay with the job, I have no chance of making the team.

I was upset but realized I had to move on and went no contact since the breakup. I have not spoken to him or texted him since then and he hasn't either.

Unfortunately, I see him around where I study pretty frequently. In the beginning, he would try to wave/smile at me but if I saw him I would ignore him or give a forced smile because it wasn't easy. Then eventually I would nod or be more pleasant once I got over him. 

However, he began acting weird months ago. He went from smiling to downright staring me down when I was talking to other people, staring at me when he thinks I'm not looking and then when I turn around quickly looking away or maintaining eye contact, or very obviously avoiding eye contact when we pass by one another. 

The behavior is so weird and it's different all the time. A few days ago I turned around and he's staring at me from a staircase while walking up. Then later I pass by him, I try giving him a smile thinking it might make it less awkward and he completely shoves his phone in his face. 

I'm not sure what to do. I will be here for a few more months and I can't keep feeling anxious or like I did something wrong anymore. I treated him really well and it took me a very long time to understand that I didn't do anything wrong in that relationship. He pretty much gave me the cold shoulder for weeks after he officially ended it and I was too stupid to break it off. I kept thinking being more patient and caring would keep it going but he was super selfish. And this is just making me feel like I did something wrong all over again. It's been a freaking year of no contact. 

Please help? I try to avoid being in his way as much as possible but I still see  him in passing sometimes. ",27May2018,1
237,"So there’s this girl that I have been friends with now for a couple years. Originally, we both liked each other, but we were co workers so nothing ever happened and never made a move. She had been dating someone for a while and recently-ish became single. I want to tell her how I feel, and want to make a move on her this time. Any advice on what I should say or what I should do?

http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/31195/1/what-life-is-like-when-you-don-t-feel-real

It started last friday, I took half a ecstasy (240 mg). also I was drinking much and smoking weed. I was with a guy from a nearby town, who I find very weird and I just hung out with him because I had nothing else to do, well he was kind to me paying me shit but he is just a weird guy, i dont wanna explain it. So idk why but he started making friends with some guy who seemed to be homeless or idk, this new guy (30 yo) was that type of guy who did every drug, you know what I mean, he lost at life. Well I was somewhere in a city, in a park, it was dark, I was drinking and listening to music. Next thing I know: 7~ hours later: I am at the trainstation and I have no idea how I got here. I am arguing with a junky and  it was like my entire person was on auto-pilot the entire time because I just realised everything around me including myself and I took control over my body and my thoughts again, because I couldn't even remember what I did 5 minutes ago. Last thing that I could remember was as I said about 7 hours before that, the moment in a park somewhere in the city. It was REALLY REALLY scary. 
So I noticed: Housekeys missing, money missing, phone missing, headphones missing, powerbank broken, boombox (for music) broken, my clothes and shoes very dirty and I had scratches all over my arms, legs and back. I tried to figure out what was going on and I just had mental breakdown. 
I called my phone from another phone and a kind old man found it at the stairs of a church and we met and he handed it over to me, god bless him.

I could not believe what just happened. You know I had bad drug abuse before, I was about 3 years ago hospitalized because I had over 3 promille (alcohol level, promille is in german i cant find a translation?). But this right here changed my life I have NEVER felt so lost before.

So yesterday and today were just like weird as fuck because I don't feel like I am real, I feel like I am in a dream. It is a very very very weird feeling I have never had before and I am so fucking scared, I started crying regularly randomly because I can't take it.
But this morning everything peeked: My steepfather came into my room complaining about a friend I had over at my house yesterday some hours, because he thought I am dealing and giving him hashish because we talked about that (he is very anti weed) .. and other things but I can't recall the details because even the memories from this morning or yesterday are blurred. So I started screaming at him because this was the last thing I needed and one thing I can remember for sure is this feeling when I was screaming when he kept talking about this shit over and over in this very moment I just wanted to cut myself in the arm with a knife because I felt like every single part of my mind and body was exploding. This feeling went away after some time, when he went away and I was alone and slept again. Do not think I am suicidal now the whole time but I had this very feeling this morning in this situation.

Also it is very good possible that I took cocaine or amphetamine yesterday (had it before) because my throat was hurting bad yesterday.. as I said, idk what I did for some hours.

I literally can't stand reality right now because It's too much, I can't even listen to my favourite music or whatever. 
You know how you can remember a dream better when you wake up, sleep again and then wake up again? So yeah I was able to remember most of my dreams today and It was like a relief while I was dreaming, because everytime I woke up I felt the whole weight of the entire world, of everything on top of me again and I just tried to escape into sleep. I am not feeling real it's really like I am in a movie right now and I'm just watching..

I made about 16 instagram stories yesterday short explaining what happened to me and while I know it was a bit cringy, I just had to express this and let everyone know what happened to me (it was not as detailed as now ofc).. about 200 people saw it but i realized that I don't (or atleast almost don't) have any real friends who care how I feel.. you know some people asked whats up but i am just feeling lonely right now because I know that I am.

I know that this is all my fault I just need any kind of advice.. I have no energy.. no idea what to do ... Maybe I missed some important parts or I really dont know my mind is a mess rn .. ",27May2018,0

For example, if a girl were to get raped and she wore provocative clothing, was incredibly drunk and high, and was at a party she shouldn't have gone to, I can't help but wish that girl wouldn't have done those things she may not have been raped. I had to pause several times while typing that out, because I realise how fucking disgusting I am for not placing the entire blame of the rapist. I just can't help it.

247,"Hey everyone, I’m posting here (On a throwaway) seeking some serious advice. Now I’ve got two best friends, for the sake of the post we’ll call them John and Clare.

Well I’ve know John for about 3 years we were best friends about 2 years ago then we argued and drifted, now we’re close again. I’ve know Clare since November last year, we started talking in a friendly way then she told me she liked me and wanted to be more than friends, I politely refused the offer as I wasn’t ready for a relationship at that time. Time went on we argued but we’ve been friends since February now and ever since then she’s been helping me and I’ve been helping her, I’ve helped her a lot, she used to do drugs, I helped her and motivated her now she doesn’t do drugs she’s even cut right down on smoking, she’s helped me with my depression and things I’ve done during it. So overall we’ve helped each other a lot.

Now on Friday Clare messaged me saying she liked me and that I make her really happy and was wondering if we could be together, so I ask John for advice, which in turn was a big mistake. Johns liked Clare supposedly for ages according to him, but in that time he said he ‘liked’ her he had one girlfriend and talked to about 2 girls, and when he’s around Clare in person apparently he always compliments her body and records her ass and said to her “I’d do anything to spend one night with you in a room” but he denied all this and Clare and John now hate each other cause of it. Idk who to believe but he told me if I get with Clare me and him are over and he’ll block me out of his life, then after some coaxing he said we could still be friends but he’d lose a lot of respect for me, and I asked him earlier and he said he don’t care anymore and doesn’t want a part of it and who’s he to stop us. So who do I go for? The girl that helped me a lot and has been like a best friend for these months or the best friend I’ve know for years that I’ve drifted from a bit?

249,"Okay so I feel like a 14 year old again but here’s the deal. I started talking to this girl I knew through friends for a few months. Started off as us talking eachother through the break ups we coincidentally just had prior to texting one another and eventually we hung out, etc. Over the last 2 months we’ve gotten really serious and in my mind we are dating. I’ve had 2 gf’s before this and both of them just sort of assumed the role of being my girlfriend. There was no formal date or event of me asking them to be my gf, it just happened and we both knew it. But with this girl she told me the other day that we are not dating yet and won’t be official until I ask. We’ve always been very open with eachother and we are exclusive and are very serious about eachother and our future and everything so we are basically 99% together except for the fact that I haven’t offically asked. Now the part where I get to sound like an idiot. How do I even ask this without sounding like an 8th grader? “Will you be my girlfriend” sounds like an actual joke. Not only do I not want to sound stupid but I also don’t want to over do it. Like if I buy her something along with asking her will it be perceived wrong? We’ve talked about it and she seems pretty set on me asking her so it’s not something that will be resolved by talking it over. What’re your experiences with this stuff? I’m about to turn 20 and I feel like an awkward kid with this situation.",27May2018,1
250,"Hi,

I (23m) am a college student from a South Asian family living in South Africa with my parents and brother for the past 9 years. We come from a tightly knit family background of uncles and aunts and cousins. We believe in a joint family system and I stay in the same house ad my parents. We also believe in arranged marriages as we trust our parents to know what is best. My parents are the centre of my universe and I have never let them down. I love them dearly, more than myself. To see them smile is everything. They have sacrificed so much to give me a good life and I know that. I want to spend my life appreciating that and bringing them joy. I have never done anything that would bring them shame or disappointment. If I did do something like drink or smoke I made sure they never found out.

Three years ago I met this amazing girl at college from a slightly different cultural background same age as me. She follows the same religion and is more similar to the real me (the one my parents aren't aware of) and shares similar values. We were best friends for two years (my parents didn't know much) and then love developed between us.

A year ago I tried to convince my parents to let me marry her at a later stage because I want her and will be really happy. They were adamantly against it citing cultural differences as a reason. It is true that she comes from a family that's not very tight knit or joint as opposed to us. I set up a meeting between them and they didn't like her and the girl felt that. She didn't want to see them again after she put in effort to adopt part of my culture when she saw them (wore traditional attire and had traditional food).

A few months after that me and her decided to have a wedding in secrecy. I decided I will take my time to become more independent and slowly convince my parents to accept her but for now I'll make my relationship legitimate. We are Muslim and for our relationship to be legitimate in the eyes of God we went ahead with it. The wedding turned into a small ceremony with inclusion from her family as they were on board with it. I left my house that morning to marry someone without my parents knowing. I dressed up and had cake without my parents knowing.

For the next 8 months I made an excuse to stay at college residence, two weeks at a time for studies but I was actually spending that time with her at her home. She lives with her mom. All this time I would come home and smile and laugh and go back and enjoy my life with her. I was slowly becoming more independent but my parents hadn't budged from their reasons.

Two days ago I once again broached the subject that I want to marry the girl. They again refused saying we'll find you a nice girl from our home country that will be everything you want. You don't need to settle for this here. After much talk I couldn't bear it and told them I married her 8 months ago. They were heartbroken.  More than the choice I made they were upset about the way I didn't involve them. And I truly feel devastated because that surely was my mistake. I could have can't forced and convinced them. My mother said you could have atleast taken your dad to the wedding. She was right. I deprived my parents the right to celebrate with their son such a big chapter in their life. And now I feel horrible. It went to a point that I actually considered getting a divorce so that my parents could go back to normal. This is so bad for the girl, I understand. I love her and it will break me to divorce her. But it breaks me also to see my parents battle with this. They've been crying sporadically for the past 2 days. I can't bear it any longer. I don't even know what will happen now in the future. After loads of talks they agreed that okay we'll go ahead with making your marriage public by redoing it but the damage is done. I let them down. I let them down so badly with something so big. I want to refresh everything. I've created in them a fear and distrust. But now what. I'm sorry This was so long.

My question is, how do I deal with this huge disappointment that I am responsible for. This pain and hurt I caused them. This ungratefulness and disrespect. How do I deal with knowing I've done that and maybe will have to do it again when the girl doesnt wanna live with them in a joint system or my kids will not be loved by them cause this isn't what they wanted. Please help. Anything.",27May2018,1
251,"Or perhaps it's a mix of both.I just need help in terms of interpersonal relationships because I feel that I am stuck in a cycle of the same patterns in many human interactions that I can't unsee.

Of course the sage reddit advice is to believe ""if you smell crap everywhere then you should check under your own shoe"" but I honestly can't tell what I'm doing wrong or what I'm doing to be deserving of any of this and would like some help from any wise people on where I can improve on. Or any clear judgment in terms of whether I am just having bad luck and am seen as a meek person to walk all over.I've been meeting a constant stream of people who treat me poorly and don't really acknowledge my feelings when they do things that are shitty.Whether its past friends, coworkers, people I've met in college, roommates, even with family, and even my most relationship I can't unsee the pattern. I'm not trying to be a shit person to them at all, and try to think of myself as fair but when I try to bring up problems they act as if I'm rocking the boat and asking them for the world and seem to detonate at the idea of compromise and can't seem to SEE that they aren't being fair.  
If in the case that there are problems on both sides ,then doesn't it make sense to work on it? If you really cared about the person doesn't it make sense to apologize? Or to be more considerate?I will give examples if asked, but I'm just confused at people who act as if I'm the one to blame for bringing it up at all for asking them to be more considerate of my feelings.  
Do you have experience with such things in your life?   How do you handle it?Are better people in your life willing to compromise if you bring up problems? I never had anyone who is willing to do that so I don't know what normal human relations look like.  
Sorry if this is not the right sub, I don't know where to ask.

  
But my most recent example is with my last relationship where I simply asked him to spend more time with me because he was clearly spending a lot more time being with friends. I don't have a problem with that and am happy for him when he did and wasn't asking him to make that less, but he would barely even make plans to be with me once a week \(unless there were his friends or games involved\). I bring it up to him and rather than compromising or working on it he just stops communicating and gives excuses and ultimately breaks up.  I'm left feeling like I'm the one who did something wrong, when in reality I probably shouldn't have to be pulling teeth to get him to just hang around me right?

  
Or in past coworker situations I've asked someone fairly to do their share of work \(which is assigned and clearly stated what their share and my share are\) and they would ""forget"" time and time again. I posted reminders, and was kind about it and ultimately they made it sound like I was being ""mean"" for reminding them to do their job. When really they didn't have many other responsibility to begin with and didn't make sense to leave that ONE thing they were responsible onto someone else. This same girl would constantly talk crap and try to make up rumors and act as if I'm the one in the wrong.

  
Or past friend I simply asked if they would just listen more because i was feeling like they were always talking about themselves and putting everything onto me. I didn't mind for a long time, but at some point it just felt like an uneven consideration where I was expected to be more understanding of their feelings while putting mine aside.  
Or when I told family I have depression and need help they acted as if I didn't have it and constantly tried to invalidate and push aside my feelings and put their stress onto me.  

  
Or past roommates who were fun at first and then eventually would do shitty things like bang on my door while I'm trying to take a shower, and go through my stuff when I'm not there, and leave stuff I let them borrow in worse conditions than when I first gave to them. I've helped them with homework, would share food with them, and was generally more considerate.    
It feels shitty because people like that act ""charismatic"" and have a lot of friends or are liked by others, but they seem to think they are allowed to treat me with less consideration and get away with because of that facade.I don't know, but it doesn't make me feel good especially because I don't have a lot of people in my life to count on and the few that do have constantly made me feel like I am to blame or don't even treat me like a person.  
I'm just tired of dealing with people like that and am not having a good time with life because those are the type of people I only seem to meet. When I hear about people who have fun with their relationships, fun with their coworkers, and fun with other people I get so jealous because it's like why is every human interaction for me just stressful and NOT FUN at all? And if it is, it's always temporary until they start doing something shitty and I have to draw my boundaries and they act up.  Life feels quite dull when I feel like I'm constantly fighting against people instead of being able to have a good time with them.",27May2018,1
252,"Now, before I begin, I really want you guys to look at this from *their* perspective, not just mine.

About three years ago, my friend invited me to move in with him and his newly-wed wife, because they'd just bought a house. They allowed me to stay rent-free until I was able to get on my feet, and my friend even helped me get into one decent job, and then just last year, join the current company he's at, which is amazing.

I lived with them for almost two years, before they asked me to move out (her more than him). Their house is only two bedroom, and they wanted the other room for his daughter, and I think just wanted to be more ""grown up"" by having the house to themselves. Totally understandable.

Well a few months ago, he said they were looking to buy a second house, but they wouldn't be able to afford it on their own. So, he asked me if I would be willing to move back in. I would be paying more in rent, but they'd make it up in other ways, like making extra dinner a few nights a week, so that I could join them. I said I'd be happy to, if only to help them in a way like they'd helped me.

About a month ago, they just found out that they're pregnant, so that has sort of shaken things up, making them wonder if they want  to take ok the risk of a second house, or if they want to buy it and sell the current one.

Well, now here's the issue...

My friend has been sort of a dick about the whole thing, or at least seems like it sometimes. It's been about six months I've been saying that I would be moving in in May, asking what their plans were, if I should paint their room (since it is now a bright, flamboyant shade of blue because it was his daughters room), and could never get an answer. He'd even say he just didn't want to think about it right now.

When the time comes for me to actually move in, they hadn't done anything to the room. I had to help them clear out what we coupd, we had to leave her bed in there, and then I had to move all of my stuff completely by myself. Oh, and the day I told them I was owing in, they planned a ""get together"" with some of their other friends AT THEIR PLACE, so I wound up having to stop moving at 5pm, and pick back up the next day.

As of right now, I'm on a work-paid vacation, and my ""room"" is a mess. It's small, an obnoxious shade of blue, his daughters bed is still there, I have no furniture and no place to put my stuff.

Okay...

So, if they buy this new house, and try to keep both of them, I'm obligated to stay and pay rent, because the expectation of my rent is the only reason they decided to reach out and buy it to begin  with.

But I'm also 30 years old, and I feel like moving back in with them is not just a step backwards, but also making me sort of ""less date-able"". I mean, he's my best friend, but because we generally have mostly the same friends, I feel like no woman would ever want to stay the night, because she'd also have to see him and his wife in the morning, which is sort of intimidating, right?

Assuming they decide to only get one house, I feel like it would be totally reasonable for me to say I want to have my own place, right? Rent would be quite a bit higher (1k a month with them, versus 1500 plus utilities for an apartment), but I feel like I'd be happier with my own space.

Assuming they do try to get both places, though, and just rent one of them out... I'm really not sure how to proceed, other than just brace myself.",27May2018,1

The next day he also was on the street and was clearly bothered by me but I shrugged it off and kept walking even though the man would not take his eyes off me.

I didn't see him yesterday, but I was walking back to the apartments with my mom and he saw me from across the street and began to yell and threaten me. I did not completely understand what he was saying, but I know he is only out to get me because he was calm before he saw me and a lot of people have passed him.

He knows where I live, but our apartments do not have a lift, so he cant get to my room. I am scared however that he will hurt me or shoot me when he sees me again. He clearly is extremely angry towards me. I told my mom about this and she said not to worry about him. I also can't go to the police, our system is extremely corrupt \(I live in Ukraine\) and in know for a fact they won't do anything. Am I being paranoid?",27May2018,2

263,"Hi Guys, I'll keep this easy to digest and if you need more details I'll provide em. 22/M. UK. 

I've been offered a summer job in England where I've lived in the past, have some distant family, great friends and actually like the town itself on the whole but it involves moving away from Ireland where I live and go to university. I've just finished second year and have one more to do starting in September.

 The past few months have been dull but getting better following a breakup with a long term gf, but she's still in my life and due to having nothing better to do I tend to buy into the things she says and we've hung out a lot. Despite knowing almost for a fact she'll continue to lie and cheat on me if we were to get into another relationship, I've still been her 'friend with benefits' and she keeps getting emotional saying she wants more. Though she still talks to guys constantly and cannot be trusted! Being in England keeps me away from her, even though we email... so it's a way to cut her off though I don't really have the guts to or even know how to be sure if I should. 

Moving away brings so many benefits: career benefits, change of scenery, some money, experience, seeing old friends  etc. I can bring my car to England and go on an adventure but I have two problems: 

**Anxiety** and **Loneliness** 

I'm scared of having a panic attack when everybody I know is busy or unavailable.  I'm also scared of getting sick whilst away from home and my comfort zone. I'm scared of being alone and bored and having nobody there to keep me sane! Also things like my car breaking down. It's only for **three months** before going back to Ireland and finishing university. 

There's honestly so many positives to sticking this out, but I doubt myself, whether I *can* do it, whether I *want* to do it and I have the guilty feeling of if I take the job, let them down and run home in a moment of weakness. There's not much back in Ireland really, it's home but the only jobs I can get there currently are retail jobs that are lousy and be so bored I continue to waste so much time with my ex who is pretty much using me and controlling me to ensure I meet nobody else.  I know I'll be bored and unfulfilled back home. Yet here I'm so scared of being alone and not knowing what to do with my time, right now I'm just at my friends place where I'd be living, with nothing to do.. 

I'm currently in England now, two days in. My interview is on Tuesday and after it I fly back to Ireland \- the idea is, if I get the job, I pack my stuff and drive here ready for the 3 months. I have this sentimental longing to be where I'm from and 'home' where I belong, but this mentality does nothing but bring on depression like symptoms and spur anxiety attacks, making me think negatively about everything else. Then when I go home, to my comfort zone, I feel unfulfilled as I said. 

I'd be staying at a friends place. There's no shower facility and it's a typical guy place so not as nice as the home I'm used to. I'd have to use the gym I'm a member of \(national chain\). 

I'm unsure inside myself what I truly want. If I go home, is it running from my fears? Just typing this makes me realise how irrational it is. Sure you guys will say DO IT! and I know that's what I should do, but there's so many doubts. 

It's scary and hard to know what to do. What I think I want to do is just go home, learn to be happy there and when I finish university just get a half decent job \(hard where I live in Ireland\) above retail and get a place of my own in a place I'm comfortable in. I don't know why I feel so uncomfortable being away from home. 

My friends and family tell me my ex is emotionally manipulating and controlling me and I'm making a mistake even seeing or talking to her. Truth is, though I know she's a liar and can't be trusted she's actually nice to hang out with. I don't think it's related to her why I want to go back to my hometown in Ireland so much. But what do you think? Is it related? If so maybe I can make a post in a relationship reddit. ",27May2018,1
264,"I have a friend that has been drinking and taking drugs every weekend for the past 3 years.

267,"Hello, I need some advice. Sorry in advance for long post... but it needs context.
I am working on a project but work full time as a lyft driver. I’ve worked corporate jobs but needed flexibility so I could just focus and take the time I need. (I wasn’t at the top of the food chain in my 9-5 lifestyle) but I am able to usually network with ease... it’s really just a mix of serendipity and a numbers game. 

I’ve been driving for lyft for 7 months. The networking Is not totally intentional I’ve been blessed with the gift of gab and people will give me there number or biz card. I’ll follow up and it’s even lead to some good networking meetings.

On one occasion about 4 months ago I met a really cool contact. He is a physicist in a certain area of the tech sector. I don’t have a science background but I have scientist in my family and physicist are like celebrities to me. I had a fantastic conversation and I really wanted to pick up the conversation again. He even said he might have usage for the project I’m developing.

A few days after I met this physicist I emailed and didn’t get response, a week later I sent an email follow up with casual enthusiastic style, (clearly I’m crushing out)

Confessional part: I neurotically try to call him with an anonymous number, he’s out of the country on business and he ask me to send a calendar invite for coffee when he’s back... he never responds. I felt lame for my approach... usually I’m pretty good about this stuff.

Finally I let it go but a few months later I realize his company is one of the best at what I need. 

The questions is, I know where he works and I have this thought that as a lyft driver he doesn’t know my level of professionalism. I didn’t look my best and I’m wearing shlumpy clothes. I would like to casually drop by his office dressed up very nicely and snag ten minutes of his time. I’ll have other meetings to drop by on that day as well.

Please give advice on this situation? Also when I snag that ten minute of time it would be to quickly pitch my project and also apologize for the obnoxious call and email. If then this person is like I don’t need you as a contact I’ll have my answer.

268,"Every once in a while I randomly think about past drunken texts I’ve sent and I get incredibly embarrassed. One in particular was when I was a junior in college. I went to a good friends 21st birthday party, and later that night after I went home I sent her a drunk text thanking her for inviting me and I said she looked “so sexy”. 

I apologized the next day, but I am embarrassed that I called one of my good friends “sexy” and might have made her feel uncomfortable. Should I apologize again to try and clear my conscious again or should I just let it go? Am I being paranoid?",27May2018,1

She ended up asking him about it and he said it's just friendly. I don't know what this meant, and neither does she. Does this mean he thinks of us as friends or isn't sure or maybe is scared to say?

274,"Hello Reddit!

Happy Sunday to everyone here. I am in a very down state at the moment after a month and a half long experience with a girl I used to work with. Here’s the story and I’ll give the TLDR at the bottom.

Back in April, I was starting to hangout with a girl more that I work with. Me and her have been friends since September, since we both share an office together at our college radio station. We got along really well, even when she had a boyfriend. She dated another co-worker (who is also a good friend of mine) for a few months, before they broke it off in late February. 

Me and her started talking a lot more and hanging out frequently during the second week of April. It was pretty clear where things were going. A few weeks later, she came over and told me that she is not emotionally ready for a relationship and it is best for us to go back to being friends. Two days later, she changed her mind. She was openly flirting with me at work, putting me in a confused state. The following day we talked in person about what we down and she said that she has been confusing herself on what she wants, has concerns, and family issues. We talked through all of this and we both decided to be exclusive since this appeared to be what she wanted. A week following that (two days before my graduation) she said she’s still not emotionally ready since stuff with her family got worse and she needs to handle that. I told her we should cut things off until she figures everything out.

Two days following that, we returned to talking like normal. It was like no matter what we did we  couldn’t stay away from each other. So for a little over a week, we talked everyday, being flirty and just being there for each other. This past Monday, we hung out and talked about everything. Her family has concerns about me even though they don’t know me. The girl was homeschooled most of her life and her family is very important in the decisions she makes in life. She told them that she is grown and can make her own decisions.

I asked her if she wanted to make us official, since we continue to have this up and down roller coaster and it’s clear that we want each other. She says yes. 

Two days later, she changed her mind. Again. She felt it wasn’t right and that her concerns are still there and she’s conflicted. This time, things were cut off for good. But now I’m left feeling empty, hurt, and confused. I have this hope that she will come back again and realize this is what she wants. How does one get out of this situation in an “almost” relationship? ",27May2018,1
275,"So I've been friends with this girl \(we will call her M\) since first grade. I only realized I liked her when we were freshman in high school, but she had a boyfriend. When I got a girlfriend and her and s/o ended she told me she liked me, and I admired I liked her, but as I would get out of a relationship, she would get into one. Over these 4 years, even though we had these understated feelings, we still stayed at the very least best friends, and into the summer before college. Over the first year of college \(went to separate colleges about an hour away\) we talked on the phone about once a week, about everything, including relationships. At that point I made the decision that I wanted her to be happy, so I would always stand behind her in every relationship she went through. After the first year of college we both came home for the summer and for some reason we both got really interested in each other. So, we dated; for the whole summer. We deceided from the start, to end it at the end of the summer because we weren't the type to date long term, and we didn't make it that public for that reason. Then sophomore year comes around. As usual we both rooted for each other to be happy and get into relationships and both of us got into them and got out. So here we are at this summer. She's studying abroad, and I'm home working. I decided a little while back that I really do want a relationship with her, a lasting one, that will go past the summer and withstand long distance. Neither of us are over attached, or moody, so I feel like we could withstand a lot of the growing pains of a relationship. I wanted to ask her in person when she comes back in about 2 weeks. Today I was talking to her and she brought up a new guy she has interest in, as usual, I rooted for her, but I know I want to date her. I'm not sure what I should do from here, when she gets back. I feel like telling her to not date that guy in order to date me is directly going against what I have been trying to do this whole time. Any advice would be appreciated.  ",27May2018,2
276,"So my friend is dating this guy. They’ve been together about six months now and just signed a year lease to rent an apartment together. So they’re pretty serious. However, early on in their relationship a few things stuck out to me. Some background: He is 21 and she is 19. She is in school, he is not. She comes from a wealthy family and he has no family, or friends really.

Basically he...
&gt; got his license suspended for 8 outstanding parking tickets
&gt; she paid for his tickets
&gt; her dad (an attorney) had a friend represent him in court
&gt;she paid for that
&gt; she paid half his rent last month
&gt; she buys all of his food
&gt; he literally speaks like two words every time we hang out
&gt; when they got the attorney bill he exclaimed to her “why didn’t you tell me I would have to pay for this, now I won’t be able to eat this week” (it was $400 that could be paid off over a year) 
&gt; he won $20,000 a few years ago on sports gambling, he has since spent it all but continues to gamble and lose money
&gt; his car broke down so she is letting him drive her sisters old car until he gets a new one (it’s been months) 

He works a 9-5 mon-fri job where he is paid $13/hour. His rent is $400/month. I know all of this because I keep asking questions and she’s been my best friend for ten years now so she’s honest with me. 

Should I keep my mouth shut? They’ve already signed the lease and move in next month, would talking to her about my concerns just cause a rift between us?

Another one is im going to have no friends these kids would have grown up with each other from since they were born and in just moving in here like hey I'm new be my friend.


And just so you know we are moving here cuase my parents work from home and they want to move to small town where they can settle down and our my older sister is buying a house with her boyfriend and they also work from home as a  online teachers for my moms company and my other 2 sisters live at home cuase we are in school still.

278,"This has weighed on me for a long time.  I suffered at the hands of my ex husband for years and have come to peace with it, but I can’t seem to shake this.  When he was a teenager, he molested his much, much younger cousin.  She was an infant.  He told me it was one time but for years after, he babysat her and I know from personal experience that he has zero self control or boundaries when it comes to sex.  

The issue recently came back up again when my kids’ court ordered therapist reported my ex husband to CPS for suspected sexual abuse.  My ex husband made excuses for his prior behavior, calling it “normal and exploratory” and told me the CPS caseworker agreed.  She said she absolutely did not say that.  (He does not have access to our children right now and no evidence was found that he has molested them, I always kept a very close eye out.)  

Should I tell the cousin?  Would you want to know?  
",27May2018,5
279,"He’s had paranoid schizophrenia for around 5 years. It has been a living hell, and we are making no progress with him at all.

Some background:

His delusions revolve around a lot of things, a lot of times some random girl he becomes fixated upon, which has happened 3 times now and have ended in a restraining order on more than one occasion. Right now he is desperate to be in a relationship with someone from a few towns older who is only 17, even though she doesn’t like him or anything. There’s a ton of backlash from that of course and he’s been called a pedophile by the kids from that school, and is known by almost all of my friends in my school because he posts stuff on Instagram for everyone to see. 

He does not believe he is sick, which is the worst part. He believes that any medications we try to get him on are going to harm him, and refuses to take meds in any way. We had basically an intervention for him to get help, and he agreed to take meds since we basically forced him to. But he found ways around it by making himself throw up and hiding the pill. 

He does not have a full time job, he’s fixated essentially on the idea that he’s still in high school. (Which explains why he likes younger girls, thinks that some of the jocks in my grade who know him are his friends, and still lives at home).

He heavily relies on weed and smokes it constantly, and he gets the money for that and food from us, and when he wants more than his daily allowance he gets violent, his psychosis acts up, and it all goes downhill yet again. When he gets drunk it’s worse (like right now, I’ll get to that). 

We’re trying to get social security for him, but even if we do, he cannot function in society with his illness. He’s unable to save money or do anything involving planning from the future. 

My parents still haven’t given up on him though. They have been going to see counselors, reading books, doing hours on top of hours of research and they refuse to give up on him, which I really do respect and admire to some degree, as frustrating as being around him is. I can understand how from a parents point of view, they can’t just kick him out to force him to live on his own when he is simply unable to do so. Yet they can’t bring themselves to send him to a mental hospital for the rest of his life to simply watch life pass by. 

I am the youngest of 3, the middle brother is in college but home for the summer. I am a junior in high school and soon we are going to have to downsize our house for financial reasons, and we aren’t going to be able to afford a house that he can live in with us, which is essentially the source of urgency for our situation. 

We don’t know what we can do with him, I don’t even know if the brother I grew up with is still in him somewhere, but I am really getting hopeless. I cannot stand being around him, along with the paranoia and delusions he has a massive sense of grandiosity and self entitlement which just makes everything horrible.

Right now, he is drunk from 7-8 beers he drank before breakfast, and is live streaming himself attempting to cut himself with a broken beer bottle on instagram. The police are on their way and I’m just hiding in my room, waiting for this episode to pass, yet again. I have become horribly desensitized to all this which is also really disconcerting. 

My daily life has become miserable, whether it’s the screaming matches between him and my parents, or the multiple times we have to call the police, or when I get sent to the office at school for smelling of weed because he is constantly smoking in our driveway and I have to walk by him on my way to the car. 

So I am at a loss for hope. I don’t know where we can go from here. He’s reached rock bottom on multiple occasions and he hasn’t been able to recover as we hoped could possibly happen. So really, I am just wondering if any of you have any advice. I’d love to find any options that we haven’t considered, if there are any. Maybe by some miracle there’s something obvious we haven’t tried. But I just don’t understand what we are supposed to do. And I don’t have any idea how I can stand another moment of this",27May2018,35
280,"I have a student who has dyslexia. He came in to have the extra time for the exam but was only allowed to finish off selected questions. After I marked his work he snuck into the class and gave himself extra marks on questions he wasn't allowed to finish off. He is a very nice kid, so i was surprised. He then later sent this apology email which is quite sad.

His apology:
""I'm sorry for betraying your trust. You have always been good to me and treated me well, you were there for me when I have a problem yet I have betrayed you. You were the closest father figure I could look up to and trust.
Sorry is not ok because I am such a screw up but  Sorry that I am so difficult. Instead of opening up about my problems i disgracefully went back and added marks to the questions I wasn't allowed to write on.

I was so insecure about my true ability that I made the wrong decision and acted irrationaly, I am so sorry. This is the worst moment to tell you about my problems but I guess I have no choice now.
I have a horrible relationship with my dad. This is one example: A Few days before my stats exam I didn't get a haircut as I wanted to study so my dad beat me up badly and choked me. My nose was bleeding alot and i had bruises on my face and neck . I used ice for hours just so bruises fade away.( Swear to god i am not making this up). I couldn't think straight so i lost alot of study time.  But  seriously don't worry about that, I analysed this issue and know that the best solution is to just deal with it until I leave to university. It hurts...but it's ok im used to it. I always pretended to others everything in my life is fine since I did it my whole life. I Should have spoke up about it and asked to retake the test with a different paper but i was so scared of what could happen.

My anxiety of  my university predicted grades, insecurity of not doing well and thought of not leaving home made me act disgracefully. My personal problems are NOT an excuse to behave this way. I am so sorry for everything. I know Sorry is not ok because I am such a screw up but I'm extremely sorry and I would do anything to make up for the loss in trust and for you to forgive me.
I beg for your forgiveness. Please give me another chance to show I truly am a good person. I'm sorry and will never dare to even lie to anyone again. I am sorry for being a disgrace and letting my bottled up emotions take the best of me. I'm sorry it has come to this. I didn't mean to ruin everything. I am so sorry i let you down. I am a Total mental wreck. My life will be 10 times worse now and i won't be able to cope anymore. I'm so sorry :(""

People tell me to not think about money as a key factor and focus on my interests. But when i try to look for something i might be interested in i automatically think about the salary and the social standing of that occupation.

283,I really can't take it anymore I'm 16 and I have only kissed one girl 4 years ago and that was the closest thing I've ever had to a girlfriend. I know I'm young but everybody my age is always in a relationship and always seeing people around me that are happy being with someone else just makes me jealous and depressed. I cry at night because I know that no one loves me and no one has ever loved me. I just want to know what it feels like to love someone and have them love you back. I just want to be held and loved. And the worst part is that it's nobody else's fault but mine. Because I'm an idiotic pathetic failure that gets crazy anxiety whenever I'm around any girl and the very few times I've ever had a chance with a girl I've always messed it up. I do not know of a single girl that has truly ever liked me and it just makes me so sad. My anxiety and awkwardness is always holding me back. What can I do to overcome this? I'm so lonely I can't bear it anymore. How can I get into a relationship? I just want to overcome this and be happy ,27May2018,4

286,"Ok cool so me and this girl started talking like Christmas time I've known her for years (I'm 17 now) but never really talked to her until now, she message me first and we would talk now and then about little stuff and got some inside jokes etc, all Snapchat done btw. So now we have a streak and we would talk all day everyday but it's kinda slowed down. She's friends with my friends and knows them all quite well ( definitely friends only nothing would happen between them), she's said things like ""Can I tell you a secret, you're my favourite out of all of them"" despite me barely knowing her when compared to them, and much more but I can't tell if she likes me or if she's just being a friend at this point, maybe I'm taking too long I have no idea, there's more but I'll leave it there for now thanks.",27May2018,1

I don’t ask for anything, I’m not the type of teen to go drinking or run off with friends. I do have piercings, some were gifts and others I paid for. I’ve always been enclosed, with my dolls or computer. 

My parents, well I don’t know about them. I mean they way they should love doesn’t feel real, feels fake. They could be saying how much they love me one minute, then next minute yelling at me for almost no reason. I won’t lie they have lowered my self esteem that last couple of years, they don’t quite understand my mental illness. I have OCD and depression. You might say “why don’t you sit down and tell them about it?” Because I feel like I’m gonna be mocked.

My family not only my parents, have mad fun of or brought up my self harm. They’ve mocked me before, then goes and tell their friends or other family members. The big reason why I’m writing this is because of the consent “other moms wouldn’t let they’re kid get piercings” “are you happy?” “Other dads wouldn’t even by you a phone” “why are you a brat”.

289,"Summary is in the title.. it's at a desperate point. It's moved from 'temporary situation' to a 'long-term' one. My main concern is that the problem is fundamental and I've already implemented that best possible solution. I've optimized everything. If I wasn't qualified, experienced, or educated enough for a job, I could fix that. If there was another career track that was more disability friendly, I could fix that (and I did, actually--I'm in the most disability-friendly track there is already). But it's HR, or the CEO objecting on purely liability grounds. The people who interview and would (or have) worked with me have fought for me. I can not ""fix"" my disabilities; this is the one thing NOT in my control. Yet it also seems to be the one and ONLY thing that's been holding me back, and now has me desperate. I can physically only 'sit' up for maybe a few hours a day, at most. 

At this point, the situation is twofold:

1. How do I get out of 'desperate'? How do I pay rent in 4 days? How do I get medical care and avoid a deathly flareup with no money or insurance from highly specialized (and expensive!) doctors? How do I emotionally get back?

2. How do I fix the fundamental problem, given that the fundamental problem (disabilities + discrimination) is not something I have control over.

Looking for 'creative' solutions. They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results -- and I've been at it a long time. I considered graduate school (would be fun, fellowships in my field pay $$$$, good insurance, would give me time to emotionally recover, work on my own business, etc. even if the degree itself wouldn't help long-term) but deadlines (for funding especially) have passed and next year is too far away. Also considered starting my own business, but I'm not financially stable, am in debt, and need insurance and traditionally it takes years (+?) to be profitable.",27May2018,6

I have a friend who supplied me with this info \- when I mentioned the high probability of being caught.......

False.  You can get a fake degree from a legit looking online school. They are  not an actual school \(no classes\). If you pay them a certain amount of  money they will mail you a fake diploma and transcripts. The school  websites looks like a real college. They have a navigation saying  ""Financial Aid Help"" ""College Info"" ""Faculty"" ""Students"". Pictures and  looks completely legit.

As far as your  employer calling the school \- well no big deal! They will call the  school and ask for your information. The person on the phone will say  ""Yes James Lee did attend her from 2006\-2010 and graduated with a BA in  Business"".

From my understanding some of  these online schools also have a database they put your name into. So  when employers or hr managers try other ways of getting your info you  will be legit in the different databases they check.

Of  course these online fake universities may not be accredited by the  correct bodies \- but nonetheless doing this is way better then just  going to the fake diploma websites that make a diploma for you based on a  real university like university of southern California. They make the  logo different then the real school so it's not fraud \- but they often  don't have a database.

So.........my  problem is that I can't find these sites. I have found sites that offer  fake diplomas. But they use a real university , change the logo  slightly. The problem is that when your employer contacts \(for example:  University of South Carolina\) they will have no record of you. I have  found many of these sites but have not been able to find fake diploma  mills that advertise as an actual university.

In my paper I need to include examples of both types of fake diploma businesses.

295,"I was on an livestream with my friend and we were just having fun and for most of the stream we were just talking with our friends who were watching. We did demonstrate how to do some makeup during the stream (one of the reasons for the stream) but spent most of the time just talking to our friends. 

My friend who I was livestreaming with suggested that we pose and show off the makeup that we’ve done so we did. And on this one pose I subtly pulled down on my top from below the view of the camera to reveal a little bit of cleavage. I didn’t notice how far I had pulled it down until the top went past my boobs and accidental revealed everything as I was wearing nothing underneath. And for a couple of seconds the stream was still on so trust me, people got a good look. 

I noticed almost instantly as it happened but still have people brought time to get a good look and it took us a couple of seconds before my friend realized and we stopped it. Luckily it was just our friends watching the video. Who knows how many guys and/or girls have this. Either way, I don’t know if anyone has screenshotted it or taken a recording of it but luckily, whether I knew them well or if I just knew who they were but not well, at least it’s people I know and that’s probably the only good that’s happened in this scenario. The thing is, there is one disadvantage of having this happen in front of friend, if it’s strangers, although they could share your pictures, they don’t know you and as long as the pictures don’t spread, it’s fine, but friends will remember, I hope this doesn’t turn into something that people will taunt me about forever because as I said before they got a good look and behind friends they probably screenshotted it so they have proof that this happened. 

Is there any way you would go about telling people it was a mistake and do you think people would forget about this? I’m pretty sure multiple people would’ve taken a pic, many guys for sure and who what they’re gonna do with the pictures. How do I go about dealing with this?

299,"This will take a while to explain, but I really need advice right now. 

For nearly a year, my ex best friend, who I will call X, has been in a relationship with a guy who is... seventeen I think. He's in my school year though (I don't know why). He's manipulative, rude, and controlling. He's a medically diagnosed psychopath, has multiple serious mental conditions, and apparently a criminal record. Chill. I'm all for not judging people. But I've had run ins with him before, he's rude, he's been really hurtful, and has basically pushed me out of this friendship; at least in my opinion. He's changed her to the point she isn't the person I originally became friends with, and I really didn't like her. She stopped talking to me as much; any conversations online are onesided, she replies usually with one word or a phrase. She's always online though, so I know she's busy talking to him. She's also stopped talking to me as much in real life. Before I walked away, she would only talk to me in real life if he wasn't around. This one time we were going to Birmingham to have a ""girls day out"". I usually don't do that, but we were just going to have fun outside, something which neither of us do often. We'd planned for weeks. A few days before she asked if it was okay to meet up with her boyfriend for a little while, as he was getting out of the gym. I need to make it clear now: I've never liked him. I've had to put up with him. I didn't want to be rude, so I said sure. I thought we'd meet up for lunch or something. The day before she asked if he could stay a little longer, I thought she meant for like an hour. She never stated how long. He also asked. I said sure. I asked if we could take the bus with some male friends, as they were going into the city the same day as us. She had the audacity to complain for them the ten minutes we had alone, after our hour long bus ride. Fine. Cool. We spent the entire day with her boyfriend, going into stores he liked. I got to go to two shops I like. And we only went to one because we met up outside it. So a few hours. Fine. I wasn't going to complain; we had the bus journey home. He said he was going elsewhere. No. As we were sat, waiting for it to go, he got on. I spent our entire day with him. He regularly told me to fuck off, that my ""contribution wasn't necessary"" and to shut up. He was vile. This one time there was a massive drama because he was seen cheating by multiple people, including his girlfriend. He was kissing his ex behind her back. She's over that. He also talks to her like an adult, and her as a baby. She used to be anti PDA, and now they French kiss in class. She used to say that she didn't need a boyfriend, and now she relies on him, and they're always together. So that's a little background infomation. As I said, she is X, and I will call her boyfriend Y. 

So she's been ignoring me for a while. Two weeks ago (I think), I had an argument. Completely stupid, we'd get over it that day, maybe the next. My other friend got involved when arguing, and I asked him for help during the argument but he didn't help. So that break, he apologised to me, and I said it was fine, and I just explained it'd all be fine later. Simple talk. No slagging off, nothing. I don't like doing that to friends. Of course, Y, he turned to me and told me to stop as it was petty. No one else. Just me. So I tried to explain and he told me to hush. Two guys agreed with Y. I like them (as friends). So I did. That lunch, I heard him talking about a different friend, and all of them were slagging him off, the two previously mentioned guys included. I usually wouldn't do this, but I turned to him and asked him how it was any different to what happened that break time. He said it was different to that because mine was a ""continuation"" not a one off event. I know for a fact he, and that group, slags this kid of constantly. The kid is aware as well. I got annoyed and walked off. His girlfriend, X was present. I went to a different group, and sat with them, and have since. That day, after school, we had in school revision. I was sat at the back, alone. X stood behind me and, loud enough for me to hear, asked another girl (who she hates and talks shit about constantly) to sit with her. So I assumed naturally that she was ignoring me. 

Last Saturday I was at school revising (GCSE's) and Y's best friend came over and asked why I was ignoring his girlfriend, so I explained. Things made sense to Y's best friend after I explained things. The whole story wasn't told, apparently. I also recieved a message off of X, asking why I wasn't talking to her. I was pissed off as it seemed like I was being blamed, though in my eyes I didn't do anything wrong. It wasn't any different to our usual life anyway. 

So today I get home from work, and find she'd text me a paragraph basically asking why I wasn't talking to her, and avoiding her. So I explained that I was sick of being the third wheel, and that I thought she was ignoring me. She messaged back saying that I was avoiding her. She told me she tries to divide her time equally, and I'm the one who isolates myself, and that I overthink things. This pissed me off more. I explained that I was avoiding her boyfriend (but they're always together) and that she's aware I have anxiety and aspergers,  that I have problems functioning in social situations, and that I felt that actually, she wasn't dividing her time equally. She then messaged me asking why I was talking to a girl who we hadn't spoken to in ages (she started ignoring us because it turns out she didn't like the way X was acting; I had no idea what actually was going on at the time as I only knew what X told me. I was not told a lot). It was at this point I started losing my temper. I explained that I was talking to this girl and her friends because they actually talked to me, and that our conversations weren't always interrupted by their boyfriends. I also said that it was rude to say I overthink things as, if it were Y, she wouldn't say these things. She blocked me. Throughout this, my mother was helping me word messages so I didn't insult them; or sound disrespectful. 

So I ended up telling one of my friends. We had a group chat with me, her, and X ages ago. I'm sure you can see where this is going. So I ended up messaging this accidentally (must have been a glitch, I haven't messaged this in ages yet it was the second in my recent messages, which I believed to be my friend). As it had my friends profile picture, I didn't check the name. I made a joke about destroying X in the argument (she was aware X text me before) and that I won, but my mother helped. Now, I worded it how I would to a friend. No, not the best wording. Yes, childish. But I didn't care; I though it was just my friend. There must have been a glitch because the message also sent to the friend. X saw, and went ""oh wow I can't trust anyone"".

I proceeded to get three long paragraphs from her boyfriend. I was called disgusting, deluded, jealous, that kind of thing. Apparently I ""think I'm the shit"" and that I'm ""slowly losing friends"" and that people ""tall shit about me behind my back"", amongst other things. He also insulted my mother. He went on about how she splits time fairly, and that I'm a toxic bitch that is slowly going to lose everything. Apparently it's going to be my biggest downfall (but what actually will cause the downfall is unclear). That kind of thing. So I calmly explained that my mother helped me word things so I didn't insult either party, and that he only knew her side of the story, and that she would be the one with no friends because in reality he was describing X (he's completely isolated her; I was her last friend, no one likes him, or what he's done to her).

So I talk to the people he sits with, and my friend (who is involved with my ""friends""). I don't really have too many, calling this girl a friend is odd. So anyway, no one talks about me. I trust the boys, as none of them are the sort to lie (I've known one since year five, and these other kids either don't like him or don't talk about people maliciously). So I've come to the conclusion he's trying to fuck with my head. 

And he has. I'm terrified to go into school next week, (we have the week off). Apparently he's going to ruin me. I'm not sure how. He's also blocked me. It's pathetic that she had to get her boyfriend to fight her battles, but the truth is she only blocked me because she knows I'm right. When I've spoken about her behind her back (to explain the situation or to give updates) I've never called her names. I've never been intentionally malicious. ""Destroying"" her in the argument was merely me showing her my point was correct, and that statement is the worst I've said about her. Before this, I have been told by multiple completely different people her boyfriend calls me a bitch behind my back. 

I don't know what I truly did wrong. As I said, I even had my mother check to make sure I wasn't mean. I'm terrified of him, and whether he is being truthful or he's just playing games. I'm so confused as to what happened; she also talks about me behind my back, and so does he. So why are they acting like they're better than me? I feel really lonely; I don't have friends, mostly because I stuck by her when no one else did, so I didn't have the chance to make new friends and anyone she didn't like she'd slag off. I joined in because I didn't want to upset her. I feel awful about everything. People understand; I explained. But I'm so fucking lonely because I don't know how to make friends. And everyone who talks to me (my current ""friends"") are leaving next year, leaving me with her and him. Please can someone explain what happened, and what I should do if he tries to hurt me? I know he's been violent before. I have to share a seperate exam room with him (Aspergers, anxiety, SPD), and I'm scared he's going to try something there too. 

TL;DR My fex best friends boyfriend is mean. My ex friend and I argued, I accidently revealed that a girl and myself were talking about the argument and I used poor phrasing as I thought it was just my friend. She sent her boyfriend to deal with me over text, he played mind games and was rude. I'm confused as I initially did nothing wrong, but he does not see that. I'm scared to go into school in case he tries something.",27May2018,1
300,"Okay so here is the story. For a few months now my husband and I have been going through some tough times. Well in the last month he has joined a online game and that's where things have gotten worse. First I find out he was role playing sex with other people online. I told him to stop and he got super mad. Changed his passwords and started locking everything (which normally we know each others passwords and share everything). So I tried to figure it out. Well anyways he was being very distant and secretly hiding the fact that he was still having online sex. So I gave in and told him that if he wants to do it with ONE of the characters fine cause I have confirmed proof that character is actually a male so it wont go anywhere. Anyways well once again he ignored me and was doing all this role play sex with at least 4 people. So I looked at his messages ( I know I'm pathetic) well turns out he's been telling them he is a woman. And that I am an abusive, cheating and controlling husband. When I asked him about it he said ""its a made up life"" and that he was taught to lie online. But it really hurt my feelings. So anyways I once again just gave up the argument against it. Which was stupid cause then I found he was getting half nude pictures from a woman in his clan. When I told him that needed to stop he had all kinds of excuses not to. But I gave him my ring and told him I was done. Well he decided to tell her to stop. But has been really mad at me for it. Well once again he's been telling them all this bad stuff about me and I finally told him that I am just done. I packed my bag and messaged a friend to stay with them. He doesn't want me to but honestly I'm so emotionally drained. I work 40hrs a week and go to school full time. I barely get time off from them and when I do he ignores me to play this game. I'm tired of feeling like I'm not important. He straight up said when I told him to not get pictures from that girl anymore ""I cant hurt her feelings"" when I asked in tears about my feelings he said ""I don't want to talk about that right now just go to bed."" What am I to do? We have two kids and I really do love him but...I literally go every day wanting to killl myself cause I feel like he wouldn't even notice.  ",27May2018,1

I’m okay with trying something and failing privately, but the idea of people being able to see me fail and judge me for it, especially people I know, is what stops me. I can’t handle people looking down on me. I treat people as equals, and I want to be treated that way too. 

I can’t stand the idea of putting my all into something, giving it everything I’ve got, and failing. It could be asking a girl out, playing a video game competitively, running a marathon, anything where you have to go all out. I’ve accomplished a lot of impressive things but they were always things I believed I could definitely do, so I wasn’t afraid of failing. 

How do people get past this fear of being ridiculed by others? I was bullied a lot as a kid and never had any friends. My siblings and cousins did it too. Im a bit older now and have friends and don’t get “bullied” but I still have that residual fear of being attacked and bullied for failing at things, so much so that I don’t even attempt lofty long term goals anymore where I might fail. 

I think it boils down to me being afraid that if I fail, people will make fun of me or look down on me, and I’ll lose my friends and/or happiness, and I’ll feel all alone again. ",27May2018,2

My best friend is very similar to me, as he has the same interests, hobbies, fashion sense, opinions and all that stuff. It's crazy how similar we are. However, he is better than me in almost every way.

My brother hates my father's girlfriend, and recently moved out to get away from the situation, now only speaking to me after sending our dad a text last night that he was done trying to have a relationship with him because he felt like he'd been stabbed in the back.

With regards to my friends, I find that weirdly, I have this thing where I push them away because I just want to be alone but when I want to go out and do something, I realise that I have no friends and it just becomes quite depressing. I currently have no friends and truth be told a lot of them are cases where it was because I pushed them out of my life ( I'm very stubborn and will not open up nearly as much as I should in fear that the very rare occasions where I do open up, I always say too much and scare people away.) I wouldn't say that I'm shy but I'm not a very confident person and I have a horrible resting b face which makes it hard for me to make friends. I've been told many times by people that they just can't deal with me to which I just stop speaking with them as I wouldn't want to burden anyone else if that's how they feel.

With relationships, I've only ever been in one and it was long distance and honestly I think she only did it because she wanted to get at her parents as they wanted her to go with another guy. That being said, it's not like I don't try talk to girls. I've been turned down probably about 14 times and it hasn't demotivated me or anything as I keep trying but I do feel like maybe there's something wrong with me. I've never kissed nor hugged a girl (surely this is not normal for my age) and naturally I'm still a virgin too. I don't even care that I'm a virgin because I'd love to find a girl who likes me as much as I like her back but the fact that I've never hugged/kissed a girl upsets me.

If anyone reading this has some advice that they could give me then I'd be grateful, thanks.

316,"Im basically having more and more enough about my (best) friend freakin whiny nature. Im sensitive one too but he is constantly whiny or critical and i honestly have enough.

So he had a crush from ten years now but he whiny about her since then and mentiones her name. Back when the crush was relevant i CONSTANTLY listened his crying. Im a good friend there was time when i immediatelly jumped to listen his best of whines series. I thought through years he forgets her but now he is a creep. The story is. We three of us where buddies but this dude tried to make something but ended in the friend zone..for years... They dated two weeks i think but thats the ultimate finisher to this. They didnt even talked for 3 years i think, but he still likes her facebook profile pics and thats saaad. I think the girl liked me more but because he is my friend didnt wanted to ruin it. And i think she still likes me i dont know, i dont care.

The twist: my friend still talkes about her. Since know him (decade now) he cryes, moans, critiques what is not done by him and so on. He moan onl, to me because he has a ton of friends and everybody likes him. Getting to my nerves with this style, that emotional trash what i became to him. He loves to suffer. (My problems never cared him, i rather keep it into me, always he is the topic even what he eats or has a mental breakdown. Im just listening and i dont really want to meet him) and i said: ten years you did nothing or you didnt even tried to consume, solve your situations (we are adults, and he is not even try to date other girls). Speak with her or never mention this to me because i had enough. He flipped out and said im like 1984 and he ""glad"" he can tell me thing. Its my chance to say i only know him from his moaning whiny stuffs but i dont have other friends. So i think i just leave this. I had 2 ""i dont speak with you phase"" with him but i didnt found my place, my group...friends...

317,"I get it, I'm a teenager, I don't know everything and I'm not always right, but I'm genuinely completely confused by the events in my family, it's about 10 and my mum came home about 5 hours ago, I've just made myself tea and my brother went to shops to fetch something for my mum, as I'm clearing up for tea he tells me I can't have any of the stuff in the bag until pancakes are made, taking in mind it's nearly 11 now and I've spent the last hour or so clearing,I'm  quite a neat person and get stressed easily if things looks a mess, not OCD, don't care about specs of dust or the odd dish in the sink but when people leave everything out I just become uncomfortable, so I said you can't do pancakes now, there was ice cream and stuff in the bag which you don't need pancakes for, the thing is, I wouldn't care if it was my mum or me doing it but my brother never clears up, and as soon as i say this he runs to my mum (who's on the phone with her boyfriend) saying I want an argument?! I just become more frustrated but explain my reasoning but instead of understanding or coming to a compromise he throws flour on the stove and says ""look, the mess is made""I get really pissed of start putting the cooking stuff away and he runs of again and calls my mum, she's annoyed because he makes her leave the phone but instead of looking at the stove and seeing the effort I've put in the kitchen she starts yelling, spitting and pushing me and I'm so confused as she whacks me because it's just such a complete melt down over me trying to keep a nice environment, or at least trying to find some middle point to retain some of the effort I've put in, am I wrong, what should I say because I'm at loss.

318,"I'm 25 and I'm starting to wake up a bit. I've been mentally ill for about 5 years and I've bullshitted and wasted a lot of time letting it get the best of me. Well now at 25 i feel like I'm ready to start working towards something so I cam be in a better place in the future. I feel like it's going to take a while to dig myself out of this hole im in and need a little input to make sure I get there.

So basically I'm a 25 yo male. I'm 5'9 300lbs, unemployed, social anxiety, bad work history, no relationships, and some skills. I'm not really starting from scratch though. I've had good relationships, a job, and been in shape. I just fell off hard as hell.

So my plan was to lose weight which will take about a year and a half. I've already started eating better and exercising(i lost 5 lbs). I just want to be more confident so I can approach life in a more positive way. I also am studying digital marketing so I can have some type of skills that can get me a decent income. I like it but idk if a job in the industry would be too hard for me. But I guess there is only one way to find out. I'm also working on my social anxiety. If someone comes around I force my self to stay there for an extra 5 to 10 minutes just to get used to someone being around. Basically I'm guessing fixing these issues will lead to a better self esteem and help with my relationships?

So basically I just want to be able to live especially while I'm young. I have places I want go and people I want to meet. I really feel like I can do this but it does feel like I'm putting life on paper. Idk. What do you guys think? I just want my shit together so it won't be such a pain later in life.

319,"I worked at a major retail store for a couple of months, but I ended up quitting because of some big issues with the managers and because it wasn't the right fit for me at all. I was one of the younger employees, and there were only a few other employees who I hit it off with. ""Bill"", ""Karl"", and ""Skip."" (why those names, I don't know)

Bill and Karl are the same age as me, and they've known each other for a long time. I talked to Bill the most and he's really funny and we joked around a lot, and he helped me out sometimes. Joked around with Karl too, plus they said they play DnD and I'm looking for a group to join so I thought about asking them. Skip's a bit older but we talked about music a lot and he's also very nice and funny. 

They don't know that I quit. Or at least I don't think they do, I didn't tell them. We did talk and joke around, but only for short periods of time because the managers didn't want us ""fraternizing"" too much.

I have the worst case of life FOMO

I'm 27 and wish I was 17 again because I feel like I've wasted the last 10 years. 

Basically I can't really choose a passion or career to pursue. At the moment I'm into fitness and thought about becoming a personal trainer, then I watched a great Bowie documentary and that awoke my musical passion I have.

I'm scared to make any big life choices for fear of missing out on the ""alternate"" choice. 
Also now I'm 27 I feel like I wasted so much time already and I should have been starting my passion 10 years ago. I feel like I only have 13 good years left

322,"My whole life I've had lots of potential and talent\-\-I got great grades, I was good at drawing, I played sports, etc.  I suppose I still do have these talents, and I know for a fact that I have tons of potential.  But I have absolutely no motivation to use that potential.  It feels like for my whole life I've been pulled in so many directions that I never got to hone into one particular skill.  As a result, I feel like a slightly above average jack of all trades, but master of none.  

This year was my junior year in high school, and I took a bunch of super challenging classes because that's just what's expected of a ""smart"" kid like me.  Anyways, I feel like more than ever my passion for everything has died this year.  I do my homework and when I don't have schoolwork I just waste time on the Internet and sleep.  Nothing particularly interests me enough to make me explore it more.  I used to be so curious about the world, but I feel like school, and maybe partially depression, has killed that.  Part of me wants to indulge myself in something, anything, and find a passion again, but the other part of me gets overwhelmed and lazy and turns to my usual coping mechanism, which is to care less about things that are upsetting.  Instead of working harder, I give up.

Has anyone ever felt this way before?  Does anyone have any advice or motivational words of wisdom?  I know I'm so young but this evil part of me feels like its too late to use my potential, and is telling me to just succumb to the life of average, of floating through everyday as a worthless contributor to society.

323,"Alright here it goes...so many years ago my brother and my cousin started a secret relationship. My brother was 17 and my cousin was 23. My aunt found out about the relationship during that time and decided not to tell anyone. My parents learned about the relationship  last october that they were seeing each other. My parents told my brother that they would tell myself and my third brother of the relationship when my older brother felt more comfortable. That however never happened. Instead I received a direct text from my older brother that he asked my cousin to marry him and she said yes. My older brother is now the age of 24 and my cousin is 30. I do not support this type of behaviour and I think its immoral and socially unacceptable. Geographically, the law does not say it is illegal but this behaviour is quite taboo. I'm not a religious person it's just my view on this topic. I want my brother to be happy but I just have a tough time finding support for him in this scenario.  My brother has been a very independent and financially successful person but never really had a path with strong social skills growing up. He spent a lot of time with my cousins family when possible at the lake because that's where he felt most comfortable. He didn't have lots of friends or just a few close friends in middle / high school. I feel like he may have been manipulated at the age of 17 but i could be wrong. I know if make a big stink about this whole scenario it will just push my brother away for good.

He said he's really looking into hiring me but he just wants to make sure I guess? The in store manager told him that there's potential in me but he wasn't quite sure. He was mentioning how they have a high turnover rate so they makes me think he's going to ask about my past history. I graduated four years ago and have only had two jobs for a combined 14 months.

In my drivers i have the intel sst and “realtek l2s audio codec” both are up to date and enabled.

My volume is at all 100%, i updated my computer as well to no avail. I even tried opening services and restarting windows audio. 

I think the problem is, is that i am using the intel sst rather than realtek however i have no idea to change that as i see no options.

Also i did notice my enhancement tab is gone in my audio options as well as the option to change my format out of 16bit,48000hz as it is grey out and unclickable.

327,"This is extremely difficult for me to write and it is LONGGG. Please be gentle. I know I'm a disaster but i want to change. I am just in so much pain. 

Where to start?? - I am a 29 year old male who moved across to north america a few years ago on my own to seek work. I am now a citizen. 


People all my life have told me i have it all. The funny guy,the height, the looks, personality . 

Today i sit here considering suicide and i mean it. I have always bounced back from hardship, I've had it lucky in my life, easy at times but when faced with hardship I've always bounced back. 

Ill get straight to the point- I have always been in relationships my whole life. . I am a self described hopeless romantic. I've always said ""she's the one"" when really i knew she wasn't after only a few months of dating. I had a 2 year relationship end when my girlfriend at the time in my new country broke up with me. It hurt but i got over it. I said to myself after that id take a break from dating. literally the next day I met a girl after i had attempted to hit on the ""typical"" hot chick and failed miserably. I was trying to get back in the game. The new girl iI met  , maxine, spoke to me and we chatted, the entire night. I remember my stomach growling I was so hungry but wanted to stay talking to her.

We exchanged numbers and she kept it cool at the beginning -she was older and I at the time was very immature but with a heart of gold from what I've been told. (its why she  eventually fell in love with me and gave me a chance) 

She was so kind, sweet, like a baby deer with big blue eyes, adorable. Like a little kid . Barely 5feet but a heart 100 feet tall

We dated and i brought her to my country after 6 months. (i was supposed to take my ex)

ill never forget her excitement. 

- we had said I love you after about 3 months, but it came out by mistake, i meant it but it was early and I was a bit unsure. 


ill never forget it, when lying in bed during her visit of my country, she said something and hit it me like a wall. I honestly can't remember what it was to this day but it was something serious, about us, the future, marriage maybe, but it hit me. 

I went down to breakfast pail faced. I tried to convince myself what she had said wasn't affecting me, it was, i tried to make excuses. I remember meeting one of my friends and he just said"" is this the one?ie wife- I said no. 


The sex in our relationship had never been great- it was decent at times, a handful of  really good times but only when put in serious effort (make up, sexy lingerie, toys  etc)

i found her beautiful but we didn't click sexually, i just didn't “want her “as much as you would think you should in a relationship 

The issue was  never on her side, she adored me and thought i was the sexiest man alive. I just felt we didn't connect sexually. We did have an issue down there during sex with oder that killed the mood regularly, the doctor said it was something about something connection between my penis and her V- we aint animals, we washed our selves regularly. We tried things to fix it, we had never had that issue with our previous relationships. It killed her confidence too as she saw it affected us and I felt terrible, i tried to convince her it would be ok. 

I have always struggled with confidence, always looking for the next best thing. What you read below may cause you to hate me but I did treat her well. I surprised her regularly not just with gifts, I cleaned and tried to cook and learned new skills around the house and tried to ""become a man "" for her as i knew she wanted me to grow up and I wanted to make her happy as she was so good to me. As  I said I had very little to no ""living skills"" - it was all a big jump for me.

I was coddled my whole life and its one of the reasons I chose to move abroad. However, I have to be the most sensitive man you'll ever meet. The pain I feel for others, I love loyalty, trust etc. I  hate seeing others in pain. I don't mind crying, I connect with people who struggle to talk about feelings because they ""are too manly enough""

I enjoy it and she adored me for it.

She used to look at me with goggles eyes regularly and I felt guilty, because i just didn't give her them. I didn't look at her the way she looked at me. But I loved her and cared for her -There was one time when she was sleeping one night and I watched her with love in my eyes and she was so beautiful. But that was the only time i felt it. 
 
I had never lied to Maxine- it was the thing I loved about us. I trusted her and she trusted me. The loyalty and bond was what kept me in the relationship- I had a successful, beautiful, caring and perfect girlfriend who just wanted me to love her. She fed me, took care of me, everything. I had it made. Set for life. 

the conversation had never been there with her, the flow,  I wouldn't say it was boring, she had a wilder side to her than my wild side , she just wasn't at that age anymore where it happened regularly and I was a stoner. I always felt like the conversation was forced,even at the beginning of our relationship except the first night.  We laughed at times but not histerically. Like my best friend quoted perfectly "" I thought she was great for you , but not necessarily what you wanted or what you're into""

We would just plan things, or discuss things we had already discussed . not boring, just not I dunno, it?? always had to think of things to talk about it felt. 


We had a good few things in common. But I had 4 or 5 occasions where I really came close to ending it. I would contemplate it in my head for days- mostly when on trips abroad for some reason. 

We moved in together after 8 months(kind of forced on us due to a friend leaving). very small apartment, very small. We didn't fight. She was very patient with me despite my immaturity and lack of house skills.I did try though- she let me do what I want 99% of the time. 

Whenever I had doubts about us it was in part at times due to a girl at my work called claire. Claire was stunning, hilarious , 100% my type of personality and she seemed like a good person. We were the talk of the office. Everyone saw the connection as she had me in tears daily . My girlfriend was more reserved, how she dressed, make up etc. Claire, i loved her style , how she carried herself, (i love clothes etc), she killed me with laughter and her jokes and she seemed much more adventurous than my gf in personality etc.

My girlfriend did like to do cool things though and has done way more cool things than me. i don't want to me her out like a nun 


 she actually told me she had feelings for me but I had just started dating Maxine at the time and didn't want a work relationship ( we dint know eacohter then as we do now )




I had always been nervous about Claire as she has said one or two things that ""scared me""  and made me nervous - I found out later i was being dramatic and she is a good person. She had been hurt in the past by many guys so had a bit of bitterness but after hearing the stories it was hard not to be. this had held me back in the past


I started fantasizing  about going to claire with flowers and declaring my love for her-all the time. 

one morning I decided to end it with my gf. I couldn't do it any more. I couldn't convince myself i would think and act like this with Claire if i truly was in love with my gf.

I wasn't cheating so what was the point of me doing all this?we never kissed, had sex.  I was going to do the right thing and end it first and then tell Claire what she knew- we were meant to be

due to stress, lack of sleep and anxiety (I deal with insane anxiety as I'm not good at dealing with stress) I stupidly told Claire how I felt. She knew but was taken back-This wasn't how it was supposed to go- it was so blurry-I panicked and ran home immediately to tell my gf. 

She forgave me after a few days as i told her everything immediately and the whole truth and I got counselling for my abuse of weed (I smoked nearly every day ) and lack of confidence. 

The next fee months went well, there was still times I felt like ending it with maxine but after my sessions I felt better and happy to be with her and clearer. I shut down Claire, saying it was a mistake and i didnt mean it. I didn't know how I felt tbh. Maybe I did but didn't want to admit. It went back and forth like this for months. 

It was my fault also being the stoner I am that everything just went boring- we’d eat food, get high, some wine, go out once in while for drinks etc- rince  and  repeat and have sex maybe twice a month?we were together 2 years.

We had maybe no issues for  around 3 months after ""the incident"" - i felt it actually helped us- it made me care and love her more- her heart, so beautiful, she believed in me like no one had - she knew what i said that night to claire was true to a certain degree but she believed in my heart and forgave me. Maybe she thought she had no other options- she had never met someone who was so honest to her even when i fucked up at times. I just always told the truth immediately and she had such a bad past too in dating. 


And then it would start again.The doubts- Ill never forget saying ""maybe i love her but maybe I'm not in love with her"" when at a counselling session. I expected my counsellor to say youre right but I was warned they don't give advise. 

There was a time my dad was visiting and things were going well- 
I had decided i was going to propose in a few months- i loved her and wanted to be with her- but a week later i would change my mind...this would happen regularly-

as time went by i got back to connecting with the Claire, i tried to keep it pg etc but we were back to our ways of joking and flirting- she never pushed it and never asked me about that night-not once- she knew I was avoiding the truth or at least thought that. One night before me and maxine were suppose to go away I had one of my""doubts about maxine moments""- maxine and I were back together but claire got nothing- not even an explanation from me about what was said that night and she was a good friend to me regardless. she never brought it up again or attacked me as i had basically got her hopes up and immediately took it all back- I felt like shit but had to be loyal to maxine. . 

Out of nowhere, I told her I meant what i said ""that night"", I hadn't been happy for a while and was scared to leave  my gf because I knew I had it good- I couldn't fault much in my gf and as i said, with her job, house etc, i was set and i loved her.

All it took from Claire that night was "" i would treat you just as good if not better"" and the decision had been made ( she didn't mean it in a mean way, just stating she had always been a good gf)

The way i looked at it at THE LEAST was, my gf deserved to be with someone who was in it 100% and I was never going to lie to her face and pretend this didn't happen again and go on with our days.honesty was the key to our relationship. The trust had been broken, even it wasnt intentional or malicious. She didn't deserve that pain again. Along with my number of doubts and feelings for Clair, I had said to myself this wasn't going to last- maybe 5 years , ten but it wouldn't last forever I thought. i was nervous wed become one of those “pretending to be happy couples” with a kid and cant leave couples. At her age, i didn't want to risk it and decided to let her go and find someone who treated her how she deserved to be- it was hands down the most difficult decision I've ever made and probably will make. 

The next few days on our trip were brutal - i didn't eat, couldn't sleep. i knew it was over.it was the worst few days of my life. Being with someone you care about and knowing its over its the pit of all pitts in the stomach. 

I lost twelve pounds in 4 weeks after I ended it- to my surprise she wasn't suprised- she knew something was up on the trip and as i said we ad issues.

I thought about taking time to myself to have some space but the hopeless romantic in me JUST  couldn't wait. I ended it with maxine as best i could and went immediately to declare my love to Claire- WHAT THE FUCK WAS I THINKING?

Sorry it just hurts reading that- i feel like it ws so disrespectful to my ex. 

Me and Claire got together but i warned her i had to go slow- i thought because ""she was the one for me"" i could move on easily- anyone else- no chance but for claire, given evething, I thought it would work-

Boy was I wrong.
It was going well, the sex was the best I had by  a mile,the connection was unreal, never felt like this before with someone in bed, we laughed and it was just fun- but after a few days it hit me- i was alone in this country, no friends, no family nearby. Maxine was my crutch 100% of my time here. I ad no1 but Claire and that was so new- I went into shock. even when I ended it with maxine ,at the time asked she where I would go and what I would.

Thanks to Clair I survived- she put me up and did everything or me.cooked, cleaned, took care of me,  I was numb - anything small thing claire would do would begin to annoy me, i was so sensitive to everything, “maxine wouldn't say that or do that” 

i would think even though Claire was being amazing to me- anything she did wrong or not like Maxine - i wold immediately to myself think i made the wrong decision. 


it was obvious to meIi had jumped in way too quick and wasn't ready


I eventually found accommodation that is ok but worse than where i was and more expensive obviously ,, and have I been abusing weed since- in the late morning, when I get home from work and I AM REALLY REALLY finding it hard to keep my shit together- I'm scared work will fire me.

I have contemplated going home, going on stress leave or going home for a few months and returning

I haven't been able to enjoy myself around Claire. I feel physically ill, depressed and all i do is smoke- there is NOTHING wrong with Claire- she is kind, beautiful, a big heart and has been nothing short of amazing to me for the last two months even though she knows I'm dying inside with guilt and regret. I honestly don't know why she is still with me tbh. 

I can't get over my ex,the guilt i feel, i have nightmares, she was so good to me, so kind so beautiful and i left her for better sex and a better laugh? I keep thinking of her in her most vulnerable moments ,

I let her go, but now i regret it. Im so lonely here, i have no1 but Claire but that connection cant be the same as me and maxine. Its been two months. 

what is wrong with me?i can never get her back- i can never tell her what happened and i will most likely break claire  heart too- Even if got maxine back, would it work?I don't know- I don't  think i could put her through another relationship unless sober and all my mental health issues are gone and that may never be the case. Or am i just lonely and want my comforts back? I didn't act on a whim- i honestly thought it was the right decision. One ting i have learned is i am not ready for kids , nowhere near and that would have been expected in the next 2 years or max 3 with Maxine .

I just want to be happy, yet I legitimately have contemplated suicide to the point of research etc but I know I'm not too chicken and I can't do that to my parents - i know I'm addcited to weed- i have half a joint left and I'm terrified to sleep tonight because i know for me to get better i need to drop the weed. this will be my first night, no weed, alone in my head. 

I can't stop smoking despite telling my loved ones and gf id stop- 


did I  do the right thing?I never wanted to hurt anybody- I just don't know what to do. I am 100% depressed,i know that,  i am numb most of the time- it doesn't help that maxine looks like a child and it feels like i crushed a mouse when ending it with her-she did talk to my parents and said she's been hurt before and would be fine (shes ridiculously independent )

I see my counsellor but she is so expensive and i feel like i am draining my parents- i can't tell my friends at home as i don't want my ex to here about this (she wouldn't but i have to be careful)

when i do talk to people i do feel a good bit better- i just don't have any fiends here- they are back home

im sorry for the length but my heart and soul feels like it is truly broken and it has been 2 months, i don't know where to turn or what to do. I feel like I have made the worst decision ever- the pain of guilt and pain i caused to her literally hurts my stomach

my dad tells me i did the right thing, my mum says i made a mistake (shes old school and loved maxine)

I have mental health problems and  live in my head 100% which makes everything worse, I feel so drained mentally, I keep beating myself up and cant forgive myself. I want to die. I never wanted to hurt Maxine.

We managed to hang in there awhile, I got an amazing job, but will not be paid until June 15th. I have court for my eviction on Tuesday. I will then have to figure out what my plan is. I don't have family or friends who can accommodate us locally, so a shelter will probably be my best bet, when I can find space in one.

With two small kids, I am looking to arm myself with information and knowledge going into it, so that I can do my best to protect and nurture and comfort them while navigating a really uncertain and painful situation myself.

330,"Hi all,

I'm really attempting to avoid sounding like a jealous boyfriend but I don't know if I'm the one being out of line. My girlfriend and I share \(we're all 17/18\) a mutual friend, lets call him Hank. Hank has a girlfriend of his own \(lets call her Liv\)  but still remains very close to my girlfriend \(who I have just decided to call Lara\). Hank was at a party with Liv, but she left and Hank got drunk and then proceeded to send Lara numerous videos of himself drunk talking. It's this along with a bunch of other things but it just makes me slightly uncomfortable that when he is drunk he chooses to message Lara as opposed to Liv \(I'm sure he didn't message Liv as Lara asked him what happened to Liv and he replied he didn't know as she had left and they hadn't spoken since\) and whilst I'm sure it was all just in good fun it bothers me greatly.

Another occurrence is that Lara, Liv and Hank along with a whole host of people were at a party I was unable to attend as I was working. Lara got upset over something and so Hank left Liv's side to go and hug her back into happiness, I know all this as Lara told me the following morning. I haven't said anything yet but some of the little signs bother me.

Am I being unreasonably jealous and stupid or should I bring it up with her?",27May2018,1
331,"I am subleasing an apartment for a few months owned by a university. The sublease is technically illegal, just an agreement between the subleaser and I; I would have to be a student at the university (which I am not) to legally lease the apartment and pay a releasing fee. Before I knew about their package policy I had something shipped to my apartment, but it goes to the front desk first. The package has my name on it and the apartment I'm living in. To get the package I provide my ID card for the apartment building that has a magnetic swipe, which proves that I live there. Unfortunately that ID card has the name and picture of the subleaser and not me. I already approached the front desk once and asked for the package, but they figured out that I was using something else's ID and was probably illegally subleasing, so I shimmied out of there before I was reported. Is there any way to recover this package? It's worth a little under $100.

334,"I’m searching for advice regarding a close friend I’ve known all my life who seems set on ending her life. She does not have a relationship with anyone in her family and only occasionally sees her few friends. 

She has been medicated for depression for decades. A few years ago she had an event which she describes as a seizure mixed with hallucinations and trouble breathing. She experienced something similar about once a year for the last three years. In the meantime, she believes she has been having symptoms of dementia, saw a doctor to do cognitive testing and perhaps get some form of diagnosis, but the results were inconclusive. Her symptoms made it impossible for her to continue working \(she was self\-employed\) so she hasn’t had any income for years. She is living off her savings but now she’s gotten to the point where she can’t afford health insurance so her medical care is sporadic. Her doctor sees her on occasion free of charge and she is still taking some medications, though based on her deteriorating condition, it doesn’t seem to be the right mix or the right dosage.

She has been alluding to planning her suicide for a while now \(more than a year\) and giving away her belongings. She moved out of her condo and couldn’t sell it and ended up giving it to the bank. She’s been renting an apartment the past couple of years but again, isn’t working, so she’s using her savings to pay for it. Her car got stolen a few months ago so she only leaves the house every couple of weeks to run errands when she can borrow a car. She used to do art and get pleasure from that but she has tremors that make her unable to work with her hands so she no longer does this either. She is very low on money at this point and her desire to end her life seems imminent. I am not sure what to do. She is afraid of losing control of herself with her dementia and she does not have the funds or access to adequate care. Her father passed away from Alzheimer’s and she has expressed her desire to never live in that state. 

I don’t know what to do at this point. If I could pay for her care I would but I don’t have the ability. If anyone has any advice I would love to hear it. ",27May2018,1

They talked to my uncle who talked to me, the only person in my family who seems actually interested in what I want rather than just trying to live their life through me. I was going to back in the fall with the major I wanted and was actually ready to start again but my dad got in a wreck in a company car and they kicked us out of the house they were letting us live in and docked his pay in half.

338,"My mother and father broke up before I was born; she never went after him for child support, he’s not on my birth certificate, and we’ve never had any contact with each other whatsoever. Though, he does know that I exist. My mother never married and never had any other children so it was just the two of us growing up. 

My mother died about four years ago and since her death I have become interested in meeting my biological father. I do know his name and with a little help from White Pages and People Finders I discovered that he lives about an hour and a half away from me. 
I turned to my godfather for a little advice and he does not think that contacting him out of the blue (i.e. writing a letter, calling him on the phone, etc) is a good idea. He suggested that I find an organization or family service that can initiate contact and explain my situation to him before having us meet one another (if that’s the route we decide to take). 

I have done a bit of searching on my own and every service I have found that specializes in reuniting biological families seems to be for people who were adopted. Which I was not. Does anyone know of a service that might be able to help me? Or know if one of those services that’s actually for adoptees would be willing to help?

My best friend has had a pretty shit life. His dad beat him, his parents got divorced, his mom is an alcoholic, brother is a crackhead, sister is never home, etc etc. Well for a while now I’ve known of his drug habits. He smokes cigs, drinks, smokes weed, and the sorts. He has also been diagnosed with several mental disorders ranging from severe anger issues, ptsd, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, mood swings, and a few others (I can’t remember). I should also mention we’re in high school. He’s always been pretty bad with regulating these things, but as of lately it’s gotten much worse. His girlfriend of 11 months broke up with him and he didn’t handle it well. I tried explaining high school relationships don’t mean much, but he won’t listen. He’s began to snort adderall  and going to any random party to get high/drunk. He won’t stop talking about “making memories” and how he “doesn’t have much time left”. He’s attempted suicide in the past and I’m afraid he might try it again. There’s not much I think I can do for him. He’s been to the psych ward twice and every time he goes he never comes out alright. I just need someone to help me.

343,"I have a girlfriend who I love very much, but recently I’ve been having thoughts that maybe I’d be happier if I was alone.

I’ve had these type of thoughts quite a few times in my life starting quite early. I remember very clearly being about 10 or 11 at school, and envying a kid who always sat on a bench on his own every break time (while I played with my group of friends).

When I was around 18 or so I just felt like I wanted to ditch my entire group of friends and just have no social life.

For the past year I’ve had a beautiful and loving girlfriend, but now I’m having the feeling again, contemplating life as a loner and only having to worry about myself.

During the periods where I have been a loner, the couple of years prior to meeting my girlfriend for example, I was *very* unhappy with my situation of having no friends or a girlfriend so I don’t really know why I think it’d be different if I were to be in that situation again...

344,"Before anyone tells me it’s bad to like a psychopath and it’s not healthy, I know this. The worse part about it, is it doesn’t bother me. I’ve been through a lot in life and I’ve developed quite a thick skin because of it. I can handle peoples skeletons in their closet.

I actually find the human mind very fascinating and I enjoy learning what makes people behave the way they do. So, in a sense, I do not fear people who have mental illnesses and the like. 

Anyway, I’ll cut to the chase with the advice I’m seeking. 

I developed an attraction towards this person who considers themselves as a psychopath. They told me this themselves, and I do believe them because there are a few things I know about them that could very well be indications towards the behaviour of one. One example being that they like to sleep around with other women which doesn’t bother me. 

I really like the way this mans mind works, he’s very intelligent and that’s a huge turn on for me. He had displayed quite a bit of interest in me, especially lately in a sexual way. We didn’t have sex, but we got pretty close to it. We stopped for reasons that are too complicated to explain in this post. I have conveyed to him that I want to be with him physically next time in that regard, but the next day he tells me he is annoyed with me and doesn’t think it’s a good idea.

I really don’t know what to do anymore. I told him I’d stop talking to him and that I respect his decision. I even told him I’d remove his number from my phone so I don’t try and get back in contact with him.

My mom doesn’t even want to hang out with me. I’m not even mean. Im so nice to people. I’m the kind of person that will pay for someone else’s meal or movie ticket just because i can.

Me and my boyfriend are in a long distance relationship; I moved away a while ago, but we still meet when we can and if not we text, call or FaceTime each other.

So yeah... His father, when drunk, is usually very volatile. My boyfriend usually goes downstairs to take away his alcohol when he notices him drinking, but that causes his father to yell at him, call him a bad son, useless, etc. There's been times where he's threatened to beat him. His father also tries to drive drunk, and my boyfriend hides the car keys; which leads to him getting yelled at some more, or if he finds the keys, drive away to who knows where. 

His father also yells at his mother if she's home while he's drunk; he tries to defend her, but it usually ends up escalating the situation and sometimes, both parents yell at him for making things worse. 

His father torments the cat while drunk as well, threatening to cut off it's fur or whiskers, feeding it too much, generally groping and grabbing at it, which results in the cat running away or scratching him, and generally avoiding him. 

His father also has a tendency to threaten suicide as well as yell about how much he hates his life.

My boyfriend is already very anxious usually, and these situations drive up his anxiety. There's been occasions where I've heard them fight over the phone, and he usually ends up texting or calling me during them so that he can vent and ask for advice/consolation. 

He's tried talking to his dad about it, joining AA or seeing a therapist, but he usually avoids the question and promised to not drink again, and the cycle continues once more. Doesn't help that his father refuses to take medication for his bipolar disorder.

Is there anything I can do to help him? I usually end up feeling very helpless in these situations -while my parents have abused me before, none of them have been drunk- and I'm scared something bad will happen to him. What should I do?

363,"So, serious question here. The past few years have been particularly rough as far as race relations go. I've seen plenty of articles about what white people should stop doing, or how white men in general are oppressing anyone who isn't a a white man, cultural appropriation, etc. I feel like every time I have a conversation with someone about this it boils down to accepting white privilege and not supporting an establishment that systematically oppressed our fellow citizens. 

Most of the white people I've associated with throughout my life have been a part of the counter culture and in most ways against the establishment. Therefore, we know that the system has been designed to hold certain people down. Also, a very large percentage of white people I know are against racism, homophobia, transphobia, sexism, etc. So, seeing these posts and videos about what we as white people need to stop doing to offend or oppress, it doesn't really give me an idea of things we SHOULD be doing.

However, what has not changed is my love of learning, people, and helping. Although I still have a great interest in healthcare, I am not sure what occupation is in the cards for me now. That is why I would like to explore new interestest and or careers. I am book smart and learn best by reading and writing. I have an above par memory. I like to be challenged, I am very extroverted, fascinated by science and medicine, and have strong opinions and great compassion for social issues. I like debating for fun. My main hobbies are listening to music, singing, painting/drawing, and learning.  Any advice on how I should go about exploring different passions and careers? Or any career suggestions?",27May2018,1
368,"I'm dealing with a particular situation that is infuriating me, particularly because I can't do anything about it. Me and my girlfriend recently broke up, she won't talk to me, and when I tell her how I feel, she says it's not that I don't care, it's that I want you to move on. Regardless what she meant, you Don't tell someone that you care about, that. How can I move forward from this, I want to make it work but she doesn't want to, and I assume, because I'm too much to handle, or whatever, but I'm not animal, I have feelings, I'm just so frustrated about it, and not knowing what to do is enough to start tearing my house apart, regardless if it's that deep or not.",27May2018,3
369,"So, let’s call her Mary. Mary is my best friend and I’ve known her since I was little. Not only is she my best friend, but she’s also one of my only friends and the last friend I have that I feel close to after moving schools last year.

Here’s my problem. Recently she’s been blaming me for everything, nitpicking every single thing I do and finding ways to shift the blame for her fuck ups on me, regardless of how irreverent I might be in the equation. 

Here are some examples:

• Mary has an important exam coming up next week, so I advised her to study. When I said that, it just so happened that her mom walked into the room and got mad at her for forgetting to do her chores and then for not studying. When her mom left, Mary yelled at me for saying that she doesn’t study while her mom was there, even though I never said she doesn’t study, just suggested she studied more and even though her mom wasn’t in the room when I said that. She entered after I said it, the odds of her hearing me are pretty low.

• We wanted to go to the beach and Mary and I bought tickets to take the train there. When we got to our platform, we were unsure if the train coming was right. Mary said that the ticket said that it should be the right one and I said that maybe it’ll pass our stop along the way. It turned out that it was the wrong train. When we got off, she got mad at me for making her take the wrong train, even though I didn’t make her and she was just as fault as I was since we both agreed if was the right train.

• Every time her dog does something and she wasn’t looking, she blames me for not paying attention. Again, it’s her dog.

• I tried to apply for a job in a café and the lady asked me a question I didn’t quite understand. Mary did happen to know (she was with me when I handed in my CV) and kept trying to interrupt me. When we left, she yelled at me for not letting her talk in my place and started accusing me, saying that I treated her like an idiot (which is kinda ironic, actually). It was me that was applying though! I didn’t want to seem unprofessional.

Maybe it really is all my fault but this really is upsetting me. I love hanging out with her but every time I try nowadays, I keep ending up taking the blame for everything. The only times she lays off a bit is when I wait for her to invite me out or message me. 

Please help, I don’t want to lose this friendship. We’re extremely close.",27May2018,1
370,"I have several questions:

\-What kind of schools should I avoid \(for like debt reasons, malpractices, ect.\)? 

\-Am I supposed to go straight into college after I graduate or should I wait for a little while?

\-Should i get the more 'basic' classes out of the way at a community college and then transfer to a university or should I go straight to uni?

\- Is it even worth going to college at all \(like is it worth getting a degree or is a trade school more viable\) ? 

\-How do I avoid incredible amounts of debt?

\-What kinds of degrees should I avoid getting, and vice versa, what degrees are in high\-demand right now?",27May2018,1
371,"Hi,

I'm currently in college and interning away from home over the summer and don't have much time to catch up with things going on at home. I've recently came home for about a week. My mom has been telling me that my dad (age 70), has been falling for a lot of phone and online scams. One day he fell for that obvious IRS scam, where they ask you to wire money and go to a local drug to give them money. My mom told me he left at 2 in the morning to drop it off. He lost 500 dollars from this. Recently I caught a glimpse on his laptop as he sat on the couch. He was completing one of those spam emails where you are offered a tax reward, and he got to the end where it asks for credit card information. I walked by and he quickly closed the tab. 

My mom and I have tried to confront him about it but he gets defensive an angry, and says ""don't worry about it I'm doing something important"". When I know for a fact he's falling for scam.

I don't know how I can prevent this,and I wont be home much longer to help. I don't know how many he's fallen for but I'm sure there are more. He's not good with technology and the more emails/spam he gets the more he will believe them. 

Just to show how bad he is with tech, he is still paying for an AOL/dialup/email account that has Autosubscriptions on that I've told him to cancel because emailis free.",27May2018,1
372,"( Sorry for the long post!)
I've been eating a dairy, meat and egg free diet for about 2 years now. It started off with the intention of losing weight (which happened soon after starting), then I just became comfortable with the way I was eating so I decided to stick to it. Ive had thoughts of changing back after losing the weight but I feel like I've been doing really well to stick to it, and I feel like I don't want to 'ruin' the progress I've made by going back to eating meat, dairy or eggs again.

The thing is, I may have to go back to it. I think it was 2 months in that my hair started thinning (other things were going on at the time so I'm not sure if it was the actual cause), then after the 1st year I developed a bald patch on the crown of my head. I started off by eating poorly, not knowing a thing about nutrition nor balance, leaving me deficient in many things ( I just ate plain fruit and vegetables because I liked them..). I sorted it out by fixing what I ate, making sure I had a variety of foods and hitting the nutrient requirements. After a year of making sure all these needs were met, my hair didn't grow back nor become thicker - it managed to help me out in other areas which I was struggling in, but not for this.

I thought that I could wait it out or just carry on with the way it is, but it's taken a bigger hit on my confidence than I initially thought and now I'm becoming unsure if it's a good idea to continue. I've been thinking, what if I leave it for a couple of months and see if my hair grows back, and if it does then I could try it out again (being more careful with the way I eat, making sure I'm looking after my health). 

Ahh I'm not sure what I should do.. it just seems wrong for me to eat the things I avoided for so long but then again it could really help me out.
( again, sorry for the long post. And thank you if you read all of it :)  )

373,"My boyfriend and I have been together unofficially for 2 and half years. We’ve been official one and a half.

He has always had trouble with flirting, texting, and even sexting other girls (I even found text messages between him and one of his cousins…. o_O) Each time I have found out through other people and he gets mad about it, saying it happened and he didn’t actually do anything with them. Then he gets mad that I find out because he didn’t want to tell me because he “knew I would get mad and it would create unnecessary problems.”

The last time I found out about anything was a year ago. We’ve worked through it, I’ve tried to forgive and forget completely and just trust him. After some hard conversations about 2 weeks ago we decided that we were moving forward and just leaving everything in the past. He even showed me the engagement ring he had bought. Fast forward to literally a week later and I found out that he had asked one of my “friends” for nudes about mid-March. She said no, but I don’t think it was really out of kindness for me, although that is a different story. Anyways I found out about it and asked him.

Like always he got mad and said that was in the past, we had already worked through everything, and it would have been better if I had not found out because he was over it and wouldn’t do it again.

My question is, is it possible that he was really trying to work through it this past time and it really is in the past? Yes, I am asking a bunch of internet strangers in the hopes that you will be able to give me insight into male thoughts that will help me understand if he will keep doing this. Any thoughts are welcome.",27May2018,2
374,"We've been dating for a week or two, and live in the same student accomodation. I'm still getting to know him but we really like each other. I'll call him Joseph.

Today I was wearing an old band shirt of the band Burzum. The guy behind Burzum is a famous white nationalist on Youtube (look up Varg Vikernes), and so Joseph starts talking to me about him.  Joseph discusses how Varg inspired him to stop watching porn and start working out, and how he used to trawl far-right forums. He was weirdly knowledgable about all these different varieties of alt-right stuff. He talked about Count Dankula which seems to be a popular figure among those types.

Joseph comes from a rural area, votes for libertarian right wing parties, and always seemed a little old fashioned. He likes to talk about his Celtic heritage and makes some racist jokes sometimes. I've heard him talk about soy boys (that's pretty mainstream now though) as well.

I'm a leftist who doesn't feel that great about dating an alt-right person. He knows my politics and hasn't said anything, but I don't want this to be a rift. Is it wrong of me to break up over politics? I really, really like him.

**TLDR: My new boyfriend seems to be alt-right, but I'm a leftist. How do I tell if he's alt-right? And what should I do?**",27May2018,0
375,"As of this month I have dropped out college for the 2nd time in my life and find myself wondering what to do now. I just didn't like college at all to be honest, I'm not one for studying and I found the whole experience of college depressing and at times just awful, I never truly was happy with even though I tried to tell myself it will benefit my future and I won't get anywhere without it. As of now however I'm back at home about to start my summer job that I have done for the last 4 years and to be honest it's quite daunting to think I have no real plan to follow and just find myself stuck. Despite not enjoyng my college experience on both occasion I still feel that without some type of degree I may be limiting myself in the future with job opportunities and that and that scares the hell out of me. I dont want to be stuck in some dead end job with no progression just getting by, I would like to be able to have a good career path that I can get the most out of. Any body who has been in this situation or something similar, what did you do despite not having any college degree and do you regret not going to college or going back for that matter if you did leave. I'm interested to hear if you think college is really necessary to have a successful life?",27May2018,1
376,"This is probably the most awkward thing that has happened to me for a long time, and I don't know how to go about or forget it.
Basically, yesterday night I got very drunk with 2 good friends I have known since I was born. One of them, (the girl,) had always had a sort of crush on me, as they admitted it in the past multiple times since we were kids. For some reason, I was feeling really horny and somehow ended up asking for or suggesting a blow job from her, after I was told I could crash at her place that night. (The other friend is actually her brother, but he was passed out at the time.) I can remember the way I said it was in a really drunk, and strange way. I think I got a grunt back, and then I soon fell asleep on the floor. (I can't really remember much so this probably won't make much sense.)
Flash forward to today, I'm regretting everything. I can't stop worrying and thinking about what I said, because I know that she will remember it forever, and I will see her again soon at some point. The worst is that she's a childhood friend, and I feel that now everything between us is going to be awkward as shit, all because I asked for a blow job out of nowhere. 
Definitely not planning on getting that drunk any time soon.
I don't really know what to do. Any advice would help so much. Sorry for the strange story.",27May2018,1
