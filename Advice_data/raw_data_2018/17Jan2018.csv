0,"So this is a really mundane problem and so I hope I don't come off sounding too pathetic, but I really would like an outside perspective on my situation. So basically, a few weeks ago two of my friends told me that two of my other friends were talking about me behind my back (calling me annoying, gross, saying I don't deserve any of my academic success, and trying to think of ways to tear me down). Let's call these two people X and Y. X has always been terrible to me. (S)he has done things like enable drug rumors about me (I'm scared shitless of drugs and wouldn't think of doing them) and then rub that fact in my face in a really passive aggressive way. One of my other friends, who I care about dearly but have learned to never trust with any sensitive information, accidentally revealed my crush to him/her and (s)he promptly disseminated that information to others as well, and then tried to defend what (s)he did. I don't like X as a person and think (s)he's cruel and manipulative. I also knew that X was friends with Y, but I was shocked to hear that Y was engaged in this too. But the friends that told me about this asked me not to reveal that I know what they have been doing because it might put them in a difficult place too. The other issue is that they are extremely concerned with some of the academic success I've had recently (which isn't even that big of a deal, it's just really minor things), and in the weeks leading up to this revelation, I had taken note that more people in my friend group were asking me for my academic information (class rank, GPA, colleges I'm applying to next year, etc.) than before and after I learned this, I couldn't help but feel that more people than them are involved in this. I also know that my friend group values the friendship of these two people more than they value my friendship. So I want to make it clear to X that I know what s(he)'s playing at and would like him/her to stop and I want to make it clear to Y that I know what (s)he has said about me, but that I would like to talk it out. I'm a very non-confrontational person, but I'm tired of feeling like I have no friends and can't trust anyone and I'm tired of acting like everything is okay just for the sake of these people. I don't know if I should confront them, even though I was asked not to by the people who told me this information, or if I should just bottle it up inside. I know that confronting these people will likely incur the wrath of my other friends, but if it does, I'll know they just weren't friends, to begin with. I'd just like some advice because I'm at an impasse here and I'm afraid one day I'm going to flip out at everyone if all this weird manipulation continues. 

TL;DR Have no idea whether or not to confront fake friends. ",17Jan2018,5
4,"So I made a new friend a few months ago, he's a really good guy and, today he told me that he's moving to Mexico cause his dad is directing a movie so, pretty much he told me he's leaving next month on his Birthday. When I herd this, it got me really sad because one we started a friendship a few months ago so, I won't know him really well, and two, cause he's going to be leaving all of his friends behind (which includes me). 

What can I do to get this sadness off me and get with it when he leaves? ",17Jan2018,6

9,"So when I mean bids, I'm talking about this concept by John Gottman: https://www.gottman.com/blog/turn-toward-instead-of-away/

For the last week or so my partner has sort of brushed off almost all of my efforts to connect. We had our first real dust up (we've been together about 1.5 years) a bit before that, so I'm extra worried. When I asked him what's up, he says nothing, that he's being less social, and that it's not us and not his depression (which is typically bad this time of year). I don't want to hound him about it, but this is leaving me sad and anxious. We don't live together, so most of these interactions happen online over messaging, etc. I know it happens that people distance themselves in relationships. How have you dealt with that?",17Jan2018,5
10,"There are many sexual misconduct stories in the news these day. I believe all the stories are true, and I don't think the women are exaggerating. Quite frankly, I have also been through a similar experience. I never reported it, I haven't really told people either.


But, I want to know why men do it. Is it thrilling? Is it for the excitement? Is it because they are attracted to the women they grope or even in some cases rape?

Some of these men are very successful in their career. Or they are married Don't they put their career or marriage in jeopardy?",17Jan2018,1
11,"There is this girl that I really liked in high school and still do. We use to talk only because we sat next to each other in a class and that was for like a quarter. I hadnt talk to her since then because I graduated that year and she was only a freshman. 2 years later I happen to go into this restaurant and I see that shes working there as a hostess so I figure why not ask her for her number well she was busy that day so I didnt want to bother her so I was going to ask next time. Me and my friends eat there one day so I was going make my move. I see she is cleaning a table by herself with no one around so that was the perfect time. I go up and start talking to her and she remembered me, well in the middle of talking to her I ran out of **** to say and I panicked, I literally had a panic attack in front of her and blurted out nevermind and walked away back to my friends. I was so pissed at myself it made me look like I had no confidence when really I was just really nervous. As we were walking out I just asked if she wanted to hangout sometime and I got it. The next day I go to text her and I get no reply, so I wait the next day to text her again and I ask if this was her and she replies back ""I think you have the wrong number"" and I knew it was right in the first place. Its been 2 months since that happened and I havent talked to her since and I cant stop thinking about her. I feel like if I didnt have the panic attack she might be talking to me.

13,"My boyfriend has been an adjunct art professor for 10 years and absolutely hates it. He’s looking to get out and is really passionate about stock trading and economics. However he has no professional experience in that field so is disheartened and unsure of how to start.

He had looked into a sales development training program through Fidelity Investments but slept on it too long and the opportunity passed. We have talked about him going back to school, but he is leery of investing in more school to ultimately be unsuccessful finding a job. We are in Rhode Island, so it’s not exactly a hotbed for these sorts of opportunities.

I am not savvy with stocks or finances and while I want more than anything to help him, I am also unsure of where to start. So I look to you, dear reddit. Is there any way for him to do this without school? Are there any companies that are known for hiring people from unrelated fields? Are there any shady schemes he should look out for to avoid getting duped?",17Jan2018,1
14,"The question is pretty simple but there's a bit of a back story, I say ""a bit"" w a deep breath.

So I worked at a vape shop for 3 years, small, local business. They've taken REALLY good care of me there, I had a really good salary ($14/hr, started at $9.50/hr). They even kept my name on the schedule when I went away for college for about a year and let me work when I would come down for breaks. Anyways, as time went on, I started realizing that I felt a bit stagnant and that this job didn't really have much to do with what I want in life. I want to be a music producer and travel the world.

As time went on, up came a new job offer/opportunity. My girlfriends brother in law offered me a starting position at this warehouse he works in for a speaker company. It sounded nice, but I liked where I was so at first I turned it down. I brought it up to my mom and a good friend of mine. They both, along w my girlfriend and her family, continued to push me to take the job. They thought it was a better job overall, due to the benefits of working for a big name company and having 3 days off a week. They also felt that I wasn't being taken care of w my current job at the vape store, because we would not get overtime and hours weren't ""clocked"" so you worked whatever was scheduled for you (no pay for showing up early/staying 10-30 minutes after closing) So with enough convincing, I said ok. I didn't really mind my current situation because my boss worked w me, giving me the hours/days I wanted as well as side jobs (my favorite part was that we opened at 10).

After going in for an ""interview"" at this new speaker company, I was told I just needed to take a drug test and I would start asap. I went ahead and took the urinalysis test, got a call 2 days later asking me to come in the start of the upcoming week (I started in 4 days).

I made things complicated (because I'm stupid) by not notifying my boss I was even thinking about leaving. When I finally told her, it backfired in my face, my boss had a lot going on in her personal life on the moment so I was the cherry on top of her shit sundae. Anyways..

I start my new job, I managed to keep my job at the vape shop on the weekend (Friday/Saturday) the first week was tough but I was liking it so far. I had to change my entire lifestyle though, I was not used to waking up @5am to be at my job by 6:45am and clock in before 7am. I started to slowly but surely realize how robotic and dull of a lifestyle this job was. Im working almost 60 hours a week w one day off. And I have no excitement for any of the benefits this company offers.

I guess I ignored the part where I was repeatedly reminded that the starting wage at this new job is $9/hr and after 3 months I'd get an ""evaluation"" just to see if I earned a raise. I also ignored when my gf's brother in law kept telling me it was a repetitive/tedious job. I am currently all the way at the bottom of the chain, standing up 10 hours a day, for $9/hr, folding hundreds and hundreds of boxes and packing speakers in them. There is no music being played anywhere in this entire warehouse of 400+employees, and no cells phones means no personal music. No food, no drinks, no vaping, which is a big deal to me as it replaced cigarettes. And no socialization for me because I work w mid 40-year old Hispanic people and even though I speak Spanish, I relate to nobody in the entire warehouse and I don't feel comfortable speaking Spanish.

I've now been working here for a little over a month and I am not proud to say that I HATE my job and that I'm not doing what I want w my life. I would like some advice on how to bring up to my supervisor (gf's brother in law) that I want to leave. The tough part is that he pulled strings, moved people around in departments and held the spot for me to get this job. He also talks as if I'll be working at this warehouse for a long-term, I don't want to upset him and I really don't want to work there any longer.

I also don't know if I should just quit or give a one or two week notice. I live in Florida so some of the employment work laws are different. 

The main reason I am posting this today and not later or sooner is because today at work I asked a woman that was working w me if she liked working here, as I've done w a few of the people in the warehouse. Her answer shocked me. She said she hated it, she feels the exact same way as I do. She's been working there for a year and is now up to $9.25. She told me there's been times where she leaves work crying and saying she's not coming back but still for some reason comes back to work the next day. She also told me that Obamacare is cheaper for her and better quality insurance than what's offered from the company. To top it all off she told me the story of an elderly woman, maybe mid-60s who's worked for the company for 18 years and is currently getting paid $13.50.... this was the biggest shocker and what really is influencing me wanting to leave. I want nothing less than to feel trapped in a prison-like job for 18 years to be almost making as much money as I made 18 years ago.


Sorry for the long post. It's turned into a life advice post almost lol. All I want is to work at the vape shop again and pursue my music career at the same time, then eventually branch off and do bigger things (leave all my jobs).  

What I'm getting at is I want to leave, and I want to know the best way to do it. 

Thank you.",17Jan2018,1
17,"Around two weeks ago, I decided to go out and make some money by shoveling snow. While doing this, three ghetto kids from the apartment complex came up to me and they jumped me for my headphones and my money. This isn't the first time they've jumped me (over the summer, I got jumped for $50 and nearly my phone). I filed the police report, and they've already arrested one of the bastards. One of them goes to my school, and today, an officer came by my house, and he had a clear picture of the main one who got me jumped (the one who goes to my school). I signed off on the information, but I still feel really unsafe. They're in a gang, and when I got jumped last time, there were at least 8 of them after me. I understand a restraining order is already against him, but they don't care about that crap. He can always send his friends after me, they know where I live, and where I like to hang out. I'm also really scared that they're gonna break into my house and do something when his restraining order is off. What should I do? I'm honestly panicking at this point.",17Jan2018,0

19,"A few months ago I was travelling with my boyfriend of 2 years and my luggage got stolen. The airline granted compensation but because my boyfriend bought the tickets they sent the money to his account. I owed him money already for flights/food/general stuff so we both used the compensation money; me to replace my stolen stuff and him to get himself some new stuff he wanted/needed. 

I asked him to see the bank statement so I  knew how much of this money we’d actually spent and he said he’d sort it for me but never did. I planned to use the remainder of it to go overseas to see a friend for her birthday and when I was talking to him about it he seemed discouraging because I don’t have a lot of money for myself and he questioned how I was going to afford it. I said about the money he still had in his account and he told me there was barely any left. 

I still haven’t seen a bank statement and feel awkward asking him about it because he already pays for a lot of things for me. He’s quite well off and money isn’t a worry for him. Before we went travelling ‘we’ also bought a camera which he was supposed to go halves with me on but I ended up paying it all and I don’t know how to ask if he’s going to give me the money for that either. 

I’m really struggling at the minute and need the  remainder of the compensation money but don’t know how to go about asking him for it or to see the statement again without him getting angry. I’ve never had to deal with money issues in a relationship before so I’m a bit apprehensive. Am I wrong for asking him for it? Any advice would be appreciated, thx Reddit.

28,"So today I received a message  from a former best friend asking about an apprenticeship that I was offered last year. I haven't talked to her in a couple years. Our friendship ended when she stopped talking to me after she found new friends. 

I have yet to actually read her message (it'll notify her if I read it) but she basically said she had heard about my interest in [job title] (that was the preview). From this I can only assume she wants to ask me if I can help her get an apprenticeship as well. 

She had heard it from a mutual friend of ours so I am not sure how much she knows about my situation. I had declined the apprenticeship because I could not afford the fee at the time so there's a possibility that she might want me to help her get it instead. Though this is all speculation since I haven't read the full message.

So I guess what I really want advice on is whether I should just ignore her, as my cousin suggested I do, or help her with whatever she needs because I don't want to take away from her future/possible career. 

Side note: I'm also still really bitter about her finding new friends. 

Edit:

Thank you everyone for your advice. I gave in and read her message and it turns out she just wanted to know if I had taken the apprenticeship and other questions relating to an apprenticeship. I was wrong to assume she just wanted something from me. Thank you once again! ",17Jan2018,3

31,"Hello world so i write this not knowing if anyone will see. However, this doesnt concern me moreover its my sister. She has just recently gotten married and now has a child. Now they are living with us for the moment. Getting on to the topic, I have noticed a couple times that my brother in law seems to be rude to her? Maybe im overthinking the situaiton but what led me to think he is bad for my sister . First, after giving birth to my neice as some mothers know they need rest and also they have to start walking back on their feet like the hospital has a walking trail where new mothers use. As my sister was was laying on the bed. My brother in law goes "" Aye lets go you need to start walking'. The way he expressed it sounded forceful like my sister just gave birth and had a c section calm down man but anyways. He adds,' Lets walk further today'. He makes it sound easy but hello she just got her stomach cut up : ).  Another situation, so not too long ago my sister informed us she is probably gunna have to sell her car so they can be able to buy a house.Now she has had this beautiful big white car for about 2 years. Yet her husband just bought a car like a month ago and its small unlike hers where its more baby friendly when my mom asked her why she just says "" "" has a plan. But can she not give her opinion to this plan?? . Another situation, now they have a dog and i get it dogs need to be discipline for the normal sit stay lay down stuff. Their dog has all those simple things but he is a goofy sweet dog who loves to lick people stare at people while they eating their food a typical dog right? I have noticed with my brother in lay can be stressed with their dog? Whenever the dog licks him cause who doesnt love their owner. He says STOP IT! AYE! GO AWAY! IMA KICK YOU! Its very awkward hearing that. When there dog licks or pet me i allow it cause hes very sweet and means no harm but hes get angry not at me but at the dog. He also i dont know why but he has their dog on a leash and i pass by he says 'Attack her go get her bite her' it doesnt even sound like a joke. He tries to egg their sweet dog on to come at me. I dont wanna say everything those ill lastly talk about their new baby. Every baby needs their mother ill give it that though i feel like he doesnt help my sister out when it comes to the baby. For the year they have lived with us ive never seen him cook anything maybe its because he is shy to use our resources but its always my sister making the food cleaning the baby hell she brings my brother in law food to him cant he not get it himself?? A Small thing he voices out that ""BABEE SHE TOOK A POO, BABBEE SHES HUNGRY, BABEE SHES FUSSY' Does he expect her to do everything for ""their' baby. Yes he holds their child every now and then. Though its almost like he doesnt put in all the effort my sister does. I would like some opinions on this matter if im wrong? should i say something?",17Jan2018,2
33,"I've always beena creative and sensitive artsy kinda kid, but that stuff doesn't make money, so I stopped spending time on that stuff and tried to do better at other classes in school.  Writing was the easiest, then learning different languages, history, and then biology-kinda science.  I was pretty bad at math.

Now I'm in college and I started with a bio major.  It was alright but then I learned I hated lab work, and am starting to get a little sick of bio (since biochem but I was also depressed, so that might have had something to do with it, BUT I still and always will hate chemistry the most out of every subject).  I started to look more into engineering-kind of stuff since I always thought it was cool but a very alien field.  I'm designing stuff in CAD to begin making a robot for school now, and I'm more excited about it than I was for my lab research so far.  I'm just afraid I'll start down engineering, get frustrated or burn out and end up like what happened with my bio degree.

I also don't really want to work for someone else forever and go to interviews.  I also am pretty sure I would hate sitting at a desk all day every day.  I think I'd like to go to different places occasionally.  Maybe work at a desk some days or half the day and then walk around and talk to people or go somewhere different for work, if that makes sense.  Or maybe work from home (I guess).

I thought about law because I'd like to learn how it all works, but I think the actual work would not be for me.  I'd either be stuck reading tedious documents all day or trying to convince someone (I suck at being persuasive).

I thought I'd do medicine while I was doing my bio degree because I like the cell stuff, the way things work in the body and on a cellular level (but not really biochemical, I just hate chemistry).  But I don't know if I have it in me, or if it's what's right for me.  I feel like the work would suit me more, but I don't know if I could handle the commitment.

I love the idea of making robots, but I'm pretty dumb when it comes to math, tech, basically the stuff engineers do.  I'd also probably work for someone else as an engineer, and work at a desk.  My dad is an engineer and his the company he works for drives him like a slave.  My mom does programming and she hates it and has warned me to not get a job in that area.  I believe her in that I wouldn't enjoy it because I like going out sometimes to work instead of staying in one place all the time.

I'm also squeamish and sensitive, so I dunno if I could handle the blood and guts of medicine.  I couldn't kill the fish we needed for research in lab.  But I kind of thought dissecting dead stuff was cool.  I guess I empathized too much with it since it was still alive.  I'm sensitive and emotional/neurotic (which I'm getting therapy for, but I'm naturally like this).

Maybe I should just get a degree in biomedical engineering at a high-ranked school for biomedical engineering since I already took the bio classes (even if it might be SUPER hard and ruin my GPA)?  Or get a mechanical or electrical engineering degree at an easier school?  Or just graduate where I am in bio :(?  Or just do psych since I like psych (though it won't pay much unless I apply to med school, and I might get sick of it like I did with bio).

I like variety and that's hard to get when trying to stick to one field.  I can't let myself pursue a path that isn't lucrative because I want dat monay.",17Jan2018,1

So I really wanted to go on this trip to Washington DC so that I could go to the March for Life. I usually go to through my school, but this year, I didn’t get my forms in on time. I tried going with my parish, but my mom said that she thought I wouldn’t like it then (?) even though I already go to a lot of anti-abortion events by myself that none of my classmates go to.

So yesterday, I get an email from my theology teacher (the trip is organized by her) saying that a new spot opened up. So I sign up and am super excited. But my math teacher says that instead of taking my test after the trip, I have to take it before. (I would be gone the day of the normal test date) Now, math is my worst grade (despite me being in a higher class than my older brother who is in his normal class) and I CONSISTENTLY get C’s on every test no matter how or how much I study.

So when I get home, my dad says that I can go on the trip, but if I get a C or lower on my test, he’ll get super mad at me. And when my dad gets mad, he gets super fucking mad. Like, more than you would believe.

So what do I do? Should I take the test and go on the trip, or not go, get an extra day to study, and still get a C on the test but my Dad doesn’t get mad at me?

37,"Hi!

I got my associates and did a year of software engineering before an opportunity out in LA came up, which led me to manage some musicians and make a small living while doing so. I have a part time job that gets me around 1.2k a month, and just got a desk job at an insurance company (not sales).

I'm planning on living with either family or friends while I'm getting situated and searching for a job. Ideally I'd like to use the experience i have (managing, interning at a music distributor) to get a job.

However I'm still interested in different career paths that would not require a degree. I'm interested in web design, and programming, but would be temporarily content with a job that I don't hate which paid 30k +. I really believe that I need to explore as many opportunities as possible to find my calling, rather than having blinders on and insisting that I work in music.

**Is this unrealistic?**

**What are some other areas that are worth looking into?**

I have no issue with starting at entry level and working my way up, I have a great work ethic and love work in general. I'd like to learn more about jobs that don't require a degree that pay moderately well (30-50k) that I could get, and have incessantly searched through reddit. Some of the recommendations I've seen on other subreddits that I'd prefer to avoid are the blue collar jobs, more of a office type of person.

Anyone have recommendations?

41,"My friend apparently witnessed a sexual attack. The problem being is that my friend is pretty Alt-Right and the both the  alleged victim and alleged perpetrator are black. He views the crime as despicable but says it is not his business.

My friend doesn't see why he should stick his neck out for the 'black community' as he refers to it when they would not do the same if he was a victim of mugging or something. He views the incident as blacks being savages and he has said that if he is asked he will refuse to testify, 'plead the fifth' and do whatever. 

He views his non-cooperation as a big fuck you to the black community for being a 'scourge'  in his area.

I partially understand where my friend is coming from (although I don't share his views), the area where he lives is an area populated by a lot of black gangs and he feels alienated from the whole area. However, I still feel he should do the right thing and that is to testify. 

Calling him a racist or insults won't work (he would just tell you to fuck off and that insulting him gives him an extra reason not to testify), asking him what it would be like if it was his daughter won't work either. 

Before people ask why I am friends with him. He looked after me when I was in a bad situation and I don't believe in abandoning friends. 

No virtue signalling please, it will get us no-where. I just need good arguments that I can use to help my friend do the right thing.

It has to be voluntary, attempts to co-erce him will not work well.

44,"I've been tutoring this freshman for a month or two in math and physics. I just heard that he got a C on his physics ""lab practical,"" but haven't tutored him since I heard (today), so the mom hasn't asked me about it yet.


Although I tutor him in physics, he specifically told me I couldn't help with the lab practical. Therefore, I didn't help him with it and we spent time learning other things. However, (since I heard all this information from another person who tutors him for a different subject,) he told his mom that I helped him with lab practical stuff. As you can see, the blame for his bad grade is going to fall on me even though it isn't my fault because he told me not to help him with it.


How should I approach this when the mom asks me? I'm assuming she will be upset about the grade and blame me. I don't want to be rude or act like they are in the wrong (because then they won't hire me anymore,) but I also want to make it clear that the bad grade isn't my fault. I don't want to call the kid forgetful/lying, but I can't have the mom thinking that I was supposed to help him with the ""lab practical.""


If anyone can help me draft a response to the mom for the inevitable confrontation I would really appreciate it. Thanks.

45,"So I'm the kind of person who can't care one iota for others, it's just not something I can do. I'd walk all over every single ""friend"" I keep if it got me a single step ahead. I've beat guy bloody, left him in a bush and was never caught just to get the asshole out of my hair.   
   
I keep an act of being a polite, caring, but strict person kind of like a teacher and have gotten very good at it, I keep the way I talk and dress matching too. People trust me a lot and I end up as an advisor or someone to consult and find comfort in, frankly I couldn't care less about their issues but I get to pick up a lot of dirt.    

No one has ever walked into my home, I consider it the only place I can drop the act. I can't have anyone find out about how I really am because it might completely ruin everything I worked for, though it's not something that preoccupies my mind.   
I have been in a few relationships, it's generally a tiring and one-sided love where I have to pretend that I have feelings for her. I generally go for a relationship once or twice a year and keep her for a month before dumping, just so it doesn't look like I'm in a dating rut to others.    
    
The more I go on the less I feel towards my goals, they seem vague and unclear to me. It's making me get tired of all this pretending I care and talking with people I don't give half a shit about and the act I've worked so hard on is slowly peeling away. Now I can just bs and say I was just feeling down and they'd believe my word like gospel but I can't be assed to.

46,"Hello, first time poster here

I am fond of dancing, I would the well choreographed and synchronized dances I find on Youtube and I am truly inspired to become a decent dancer.
At first I saw popping and robotics on a talent show, so I searched for tutorials and I got good at it, you know, Arm wave, body wave, head isolations, I got some of those moves but never went as much as stringing them together or learning something.
Yesterday I tried to actually dance, first time after seeing so many vids, but I failed, it was an old Elvis song (Rock around the clock), I looked the dancer on Youtube but it was almost impossible to mimic him, not only were my moves out of sync and not sharp, what pissed me off is that I couldnt move my limbs independantly, its like my brain couldnt send orders to arms alone and legs alone. Add to that my legs were kinda stiff and started hurting/getting uncomfortable soon.

Is dance really talent based? Or can one really learn and get good, not for a living/career but really good through practice? Where do I start if thats the case?

47,"I purchased a $1600 refurbished LG TV from NewEgg on 5/7/2017 that came DoA. Thats right, over 8 months ago. 

Lotus International is the company that I was told to contact for warranty and repair service. Which I did, because I wanted a working TV.

Lotus was, at first, fast to respond, and sent me a Fedex label to return the TV, which I did. When they received the TV, they informed me that they are unable to perform a repair, and instead, they will send me a new (refurbished) TV. 

The TV they sent me back was ALSO DoA (same issue), and was indeed a new TV (different serial number).

I called them back, and they told me that instead of doing another TV swap, they would instead send me a motherboard, so I could do the repair myself. They told me to wait for the tracking details in my email, once they ship it out to me.

I never got a the tracking number or part.

This is when they first became unresponsive. For over a month, I called and emailed them multiple times a week, inquiring about the status of the part. I received no replies, and my calls were forwarded to a voicemail (never returned), or told that the person I need to talk to is ""on lunch"".

Desperate, I reached out to LG, and told them of my troubles. Shocked, they immediately sent a local service tech to fix the TV on site. The tech told me, after being unable to repair the TV, that parts would have to be ordered for it. However, they were unable to order parts, because they did not have the original serial number. Lotus international replaces the original serial numbers with their own, for internal inventory. I would have to retrieve the number from them if I wanted a repair. 

Since Lotus International was still not responsive, and I was still desperate, I reached out to the original company of purchase (NewEgg), and told them everything that happened up to this point (months have passed by now). Appalled at the situation, they send a shipping company to pick up the TV. However, the returns department declined the the shipment, since the serial number on the TV was of course different than the one that was sold to me (I told them this would be the case). They sent me the TV back, and told me they can’t help.

However, after complaining more to them about the terrible situation I was in, I believe they reached out to Lotus for me, since within a couple days I finally received a call from them. 

They told me that they would send out the part for me to do the repair myself, which they did this time. After receiving the part, and carefully performing the repair myself, the TV STILL had the same issues. 

I called them back, and told them it didn’t work. At this point, they told me that they are unable to send me another TV because “The shipping was getting too expensive”, and that they would have to talk to higher management who is “currently on vacation”. I was told I would be called back the following Monday after this person in question was talked to. 

I received no phone call. The next Tuesday I called back, and they told me that they didn’t get a chance to talk to him yet. This is the last I heard from them, and its been about 3 months since then. I have called or emailed multiple times a week with the same results as before. No call backs, no emails, just told that the person I need to talk to is “on Lunch”.

I have since reached back out to LG and NewEgg on social media, but they both got back to me and told me they cannot help.

At the time of writing this, it has been over 8 months since I have had a working TV. During that time I have had to take multiple days off of work for shipping and reciving this TV. This issue has been a massive stress in my life, causing anxiety, and feelings of extreme helplessness.  

I have exhausted everything possible I can think of as a consumer, other than driving the TV to Lotus myself, or getting a lawyer.

What should I do?

tldr: I have been unable to get a repair done on my $1600 TV going on 8+ months now. They have been unable to repair, and have shipped a second defective TV as a replacement, as well as a motherboard to fix it myself. Now they are actively ignoring my calls/emails, which is multiple times a week. ",17Jan2018,2
48,"I'm really not sure why I feel this way. I used to love talking to people, and even though I was often shy, got excited at the opportunity to get to know someone new. 

Nowadays I really have no interest in making new friends, but in all honesty I'm pretty lonely. It's weird, like I'm always in constant battle with myself. I always hope people will invite me out, but usually flake last minute when they do because of fears I have that aren't even explainable. 

Most of the time I just find myself only wanting to spend time with my boyfriend, we've known each other for so long, but in all honesty I miss the thrill of getting to meet someone new. At the same time that idea exhausts me, and I'd much rather just only be with him since it's guaranteed happiness whenever we're together.

Don't get me wrong, I love my boyfriend, more than the world. I just don't think it's healthy he's my only friend. I don't have any friends other than him. Sure, there are the people I talk to here and there, but no one I could find myself spending the day with. Most people I know don't really interest me. I couldn't see myself hanging out with them outside of school, and it's nothing personal, I just find it hard to connect with people.

I guess my question is, has anyone felt like this? Is it natural to feel like this? What's the explanation? I guess there's more I could say, but I'm not sure if it would be a contributor to this.

50,"To start things off, im 18 and have above a 4.0 GPA at a private Christian school. I have already gotten accepted to a few decent colleges ranked in the top 60 in the nation. My school also drug tests.

Over the weekend, I drank with friends. I had (estimate) 6 shots and a beer on saturday night at 11PM. Then on Sunday night I had a few sips of Vodka. Then on Tuesday at 11:30AM I was called in for a random drug test.

No need for explanation, I am very worried this comes out as positive. I exercised a decent amount over the weekend and drank a decent amount of water. I also weigh 150lbs and this was the first time I have ever had more than a glass alcohol to drink. 

Now, my school MIGHT let me off without a suspension if I admit I did it before the results come back and if I do not admit it, and its positive, I will surely receive a suspension. However, since the test was more than 48 hours after my drinking, I have reason to believe it may come back negative. 

I am not sure whether I need to admit what I did, or risk the suspension. I also am not sure if I jeopardize my college decisions if I do get suspended. Please give advice on what needs to be done, I have fucked up.",17Jan2018,1
51,"A lot of this probably has to do with my emotionally traumatic upbringing, but when he’s gone I get depressed and bored and don’t feel like doing anything. Me and him have started on this ddlg relationship but I don’t know what to do when he’s gone. He knows that I still have growing up to do despite being 22, and he wants to help me get through my problems through any means. I know for sure that I’m clingy, and emotionally unstable, as I have never really had anyone that cared so much about me, not even my parents. The only thing I ever have on my mind is how to please him and what he wants me to do, and it has caused me to get up off my ass and do something, but I can’t help but get sad when he isn’t here. I’m already on plenty of meds, like for depression and ADHD. But sometimes I feel like the anti depressants don’t help, and the only benefit I’ve had is I’ve lost 35 pounds from the appetite loss side effect (hurray for not being overweight anymore!!!). 

I’m not sure how to get myself motivated to do something other than browse my phone mindlessly when he isn’t here. I used to play tons of video games, but I have completely lost interest because they aren’t fulfilling anymore, I have realized what a waste of time it is and it just endless grinding. I want to feel like I have another purpose but I don’t have very many skills, and I’m trying to learn Japanese because it seems to be the only thing I’m interested in but I get discouraged when I’m unable to remember anything. I have a bad memory and it takes way more effort than normal to remember things. I talk in basic sentences and have a hard time speaking my mind, I’m always scared of being judged even though I know he won’t judge me. I usually just go along with what happens and make little changes when I feel it’s absolutely necessary. I always feel like my opinion isn’t important, even though in our ddlg relationship one of the rules is “when kitten is feeling down, wants to do something, or just wants to talk to always come to master and express herself. He will not judge you or use it against you.” He really wants me to be more open but I’m not sure how, I have trouble making original thoughts.

I know for certain I need a counselor/psychiatrist but I don’t know of any that would take Medicaid, plus I have been through my share and I feel like they just get repetitive and use automated responses. I also don’t have money to pay out of pocket for it.

My emotions always come out and I am unable to control them. If I get sad, no matter the situation, I start crying, even if it’s not a big deal or unnecessary. I try to hold hem back as hard as I can but I feel like that only hurts me more. Such as right now, I’m tearing up just typing this, though I know i really shouldn’t. I feel I may be bipolar, I am adopted and my birth mom had plenty of mental issues, two of the strongest ones being bipolar disorder and depression. For certain smoking weed helps me control these negative emotions, but it’s extremely expensive (not a legal state unfortunately) and more than anything it just makes me ok with being bored and makes me not really wanting to do anything.

I feel really stupid spilling my guts but I’m not sure where else to go for help, and my boyfriend already knows how I feel, and I will be sending him this post as well because it seems I can get my emotions and thoughts out better on paper/typing.

I really want some friends but I don’t know how to make them, most people are always busy and I’m paranoid because I don’t trust anyone but those closest to me, so basically only him. I’m also bisexual and I’m afraid of being attracted to my female friend and ruining our friendship, I just want another person to talk to and do things with.

I’m always looking for confirmation, compliments, just need someone to tell me “good kitten” or something like that. I wanna feel like I did good, something important, but I’m always afraid of failing, and I feel like that keeps me from doing a lot.

Any and all advice will be taken in consideration.
 
TDLR: I’m very depressed and emotionally unstable, want to go to a psychiatrist but I don’t have enough money for such. I need another purpose other than just living for my boyfriend and I don’t know how because I may have a unknown mental block that’s causing me from being able to succeed and grow up.",17Jan2018,2

I'll have moments where I convince myself that I'm going to go home, sit my parents down, and tell them the truth, but my sense of self-confidence wavers as soon as I see them. 

This has been a source of great shame for me, especially over the last few months. I believe very strongly in the idea that an individual should not hide or change their identity in order to suit the needs of others, and that if anyone has a problem with who you are, that's their problem, not yours. I feel hypocritical for not being able to practice what I preach.      

Long story short, I feel this need to tell my family about my lack of belief, and to disregard their reactions as little more than a negative byproduct of an ultimately positive decision. Should I go through with it? How to I maintain the confidence to do so?

Last fall my fiancé (now wife) and I moved 3,000 miles for an outstanding job opportunity I was offered. At the time we were engaged with our wedding &amp; my bachelor party planned during the first few months of this new role. I let my future (now current) supervisor know about the wedding and that I would may need a little more time than was traditional in a new role to travel back to the wedding location, travel to the bachelor party location, and travel to a honeymoon. The travel for the bachelor party and wedding was only due to taking this new job; it had been planned where we lived and was too late to change. My supervisor let me know that they would be flexible with the dates and I wouldn’t have anything to worry about both in the interview and upon acceptance of the job. Before moving (and after accepting the offer) I even sent a written follow-up with the rough dates I’d need off - no reply but no issue. 

It’s now January and I found out that apparently the time I took for the bachelor party and the wedding was “borrowed” from next year’s vacation time and I didn’t have any time left for a honeymoon unless I took it a year from now. I have a meeting with my boss later this week and, aside from logically talking through the above, am not sure what the best approach is to take here. 

Some additional context: my supervisor is great in every other way... supportive, caring, helpful, etc. they’ve taken an interest in my wife and I and made many efforts to ensure we’re happy. The challenge is that they are a rule-follower and it’s an HR rule that vacation is earned during the year prior to taking it, so to them being “flexible” is allowing me to borrow time up until I run out from this year (2018) and to me being flexible was the ability to take the time I need without having to worry. 

More context: I was sent the HR policy on vacations (along with other policies and benefits) in my pre-offer packet and, given the nature of the field I work in which is typically much more laid back about flexible time off, simply did not think I’d need to negotiate or specifically add “two additional weeks of vacation” to the mix. I accept some responsibility for that and own that, in hindsight, this at least partially falls on me. Lastly, I am a professional over 10 years in my field with an advanced degree and significant supervisory experience - I note this because I think it may be relevant (in some fields the higher up you to, naturally, the more lenient things are around time off). I offered to take paid time off and it’s not an option; there’s also no comp time, and I’m unable to use sick time. 

Any advice or general thoughts on my situation? Am I completely in the wrong here? What would you recommend I bring to the table when I meet with my boss? We have been considering buying a house here - is this a huge red flag around my bosses approach and personality and perhaps we should rent instead? Any advice you can give would be much appreciated - I’m fully going through the stages of grief here (welcome to bargaining) and would love insight from folks who aren’t involved or adjacent to this in any way (I.E. my family and wife). PS: I live in the United States.

TL;DR - Thought I had an understanding with my supervisor about vacation time for wedding-related travel in new role and it turns out we were both way off. How can I maximize an in-person convo with them without being irrational or unreasonable?",17Jan2018,1

78,"I am a 19 y/o and I have been going to school to get my computer information systems associate degree at a local community college. I got an internship at the same company my father works doing IT. Basically, through the experience I realize I hate going in to work and think it is not the lifestyle for me. I am told I do good with computers by my boss and coworkers however, I just don’t think I could do it forever. Working in an office with minimal socialization doesn’t appeal to me. I’ve been offered a full time position this summer by my boss starting at 50k. I have a slight clue as to what I wanna do for a career and am stuck between either a chemistry, math, or physics high school teacher or an automotive engineer. Trouble is I don’t have much experience in the 3 previously mentioned subjects I took one year of each science and coasted through math so I do not know if I’ll truly like them. Basically, my fear is that I’ll switch careers and go to become either a teacher or engineer and hate it. How do I know if I’ll like them? This has been weighing on my mind for a couple of months now and is dragging me down. I really could use some help.

Scenario 1: I could either stay with computers where I’m not happy. Although, I could just be unhappy because I’m an intern and haven’t experienced the real work experience. In this scenario I would never have to worry about a job or finances. 

Scenario 2: I could chase either the dream of teaching or engineering, where I would temporarily struggle financially and would have more worry over finding a job. However, I think I would be happier, I just have no clue because I have no experience in either.",17Jan2018,1
79,"I’m wholeheartedly and completely in love with this boy. If I had multiple souls, I would give them all to him. He’s my person. Always has been. And I would do anything for him.

I don’t know if I’m asexual, but I don’t feel sexual attraction to anyone. I’ve tried to have sex and I felt nothing. Nothing. The sex was just as exciting as watching the Price is Right on television, or riding a fucking bike. My body reacts and I orgasm and it’s like my body knows what feels good but it doesn’t reach my brain. To someone who didn’t know me, it would probably be hard to tell how disinterested I am in the proceedings. I feel no pleasure at all.

I don’t think I’m capable of loving someone like that. Sexually. 

But if I were, I’m pretty sure he’s the person I would choose. I feel warmth and love and strong devotion towards him, but no passion. We kiss and I might as well have spent the last five minutes watching a rousing game of golf. 

I thought I could convince him to just be my friend because he deserves better, but I can’t do it. It just makes us both miserable. I don’t like other people touching him. I only want him to be mine. 

But we’ve kissed or made out and every time I can tell he’s disappointed because of my lack of sexual interest. I told him I’m willing to have sex anytime he wants (no way am I letting him go celibate) as long as he doesn’t expects me to enjoy it, I’m willing to do that for him. He feels strange about it though. He can’t do it. He keeps saying that my lack of enjoyment kills it and he doesn’t want to take advantage. He’s actually willing to give up sex for the rest of his life but fuck I don’t want that for him. 

I could be asexual, but I wasn’t always like this. I use to experience sexual attraction but I had a traumatic experience happen to me when I was sixteen. I blacked the whole thing out. I’m not sure if this is a post any of you can relate to but I figured I would post this anyway just to be sure. I’m sure there are plenty of asexual people who have a healthy and consensual sexual relationship with their sexual partner so I’m sure the both of us can do this. ",17Jan2018,1

I'm not sure if I was actually being used by her though, we used to be completely honest with each other and both of us were very very happy with each other. Then things started to change, she only ever really gave me attention when things got sexual, then the instant that it wasn't sexual she stopped giving me attention. Her responses got very short and she didn't text me very often unless it was night time, only when she was about to go to sleep. I don't know, everyday seemed to become worse and worse, she claims to always be busy but I'm not so sure of that, then when I finally tried to talk to her about whats going on she blocked me.

I just recently found out that my dad got a girl (around his age) pregnant when he was in his late teens (19 years). Keep in mind, this takes place in a pretty conservative country (India) during a pretty conservative time period. Pre-martial affairs are frowned down upon and pre-marital pregnancy is an absolute no-no. Luckily, before anything got out of control, my great-great grandmother (He lived with his grandmother at that time) stepped in and forced the girl to get an abortion (at least, according to the source I heard from).  My dad went to college following that and the girl 

My mom currently does not know about this and I don't intend to tell her about this (For obvious reasons). My parents have a pretty OK relationship. 

BUT after hearing this news, I am soo confused about how to feel about all this. I understand that someone's past is in their past, but I just cannot think about it without feeling a sense of betrayal and sadness.

Can someone please give me some advice and some remedy to deal with this? I greatly appreciate it!

Right before he passed away I was with him in the hospital laughing and talking like normal. It doesn’t feel real
My work is giving me unpaid time off for grieving and to attend the funeral. But I don’t wanna go to the funeral.. I went to 5 funerals last year. 5! Of people really close to me. Including my dog of 13 years who also passed away. I’m tired of death. I’m tired of funerals... I don’t know why this is happening. I will go visit his gravesite often but I think if I go to the funeral I will be so depressed I won’t be able to work or leave my room.

I’m mad at my work for not giving me more time to grieve. But I shouldnt be, they’re doing their job. I called in and the manager said that cousins don’t fall under bereavement policy and the days off will count against me just use pto to cover them. I was so sad at work it sucked but I gave the best retail voice and face I could. 

Then I called work today because I couldn’t make it there because all the ice on the roads I was scared I was going to crash but didn’t want to lose my job but I’ll walk to work. Another manager told me I was told misinformation and the days still won’t be paid but they won’t count against me. But I still need to work I need the money it’s how I pay my rent, my phone bill, buy food, my car insurance.. i have like no pto either. I don’t wanna be evicted on top of this so I’m gonna go to work like normal and explain to them why I’m going to work is because I am desperate for the money. I live alone and my family isn’t well off enough to help me. I make decent money but I just turned 20 and I used my money for my birthday and partying I wish I had that money back. If I didn’t work this week my paycheck will be too short. I’d feel guilty for not attending the funeral but I would understand him if he didn’t attend mine.. and I shouldn’t be mad at my job they’re just doing their job it’s just retail. I just need to breathe.

I was wondering if there are any fellow Redditors who may have recently moved to a new city like I did. Last January I made a move to Denver from Nashville for a new job. Moving back to Denver has been a dream of mine for years and I finally had a reason to go!

In December, I lost my job and hit a bit of a slump afterwards on what to do. It was a year well spent doing some amazing things that I couldn't have done in Tennessee, but I really had some difficulty building a friend group. This has led me to contemplate moving back to Nashville and job searching here for the lower cost of living, friend/family base and professional network. Am I making a mistake?!

I think being self-sufficient is good but it has gotten to the point where I don't want to go out with anyone anymore because it either annoys me or it absolutely drains me. I know I'm definitely outgrowing some friends but it is the case with people I love dearly as well. 

The thing is, the thought of making new friends or dating stresses me out as well. Just the thought of hanging out with someone regularly or having to check in with someone or have to sacrifice my alone time makes me feel like I'm suffocating.

I know there is nothing wrong with needing alone time but I feel like my situation is snowballing to the point of me isolating myself completely and I'm scared I may be on the verge of being depressed. I'm pretty content with most aspects of my life but I wonder if me losing interest in things means I'm depressed or I'm just changing as I get older. I guess I'm just nervous that everything that always interested me for the majority of my life does not interest me at all and I do not interact with people outside of what is necessary for my job.

93,"I'm the co-president of a fairly new dance organization at a small college, which makes it already hard to attract members and retain them throughout the semester. Last semester we had about 11 members that came regularly--and this is for the more popular dance style/session. And the dances that we're doing really only look good with at least 7 or so dancers. We also hold our own dance showcase at the end of each school year where we perform all the dances we've learned in that year and perform as guests at other groups' showcases, so imo it'd be really sad if we had very few members perform. 

So here's the problem: there is a new group that is forming on campus who say that they don't mean to ""steal the thunder"" from us, but they're planning on doing the same dance style as we are, accepting beginners and people with prior experience like we do, but instead of holding a showcase, they want to record dance videos for YouTube and enter competitions. This is their main point that they say differentiates them from us. So far 17 people have shown interest in this group (they'll probably gain more interest once the semester starts back up again) and they have already formed a private group chat to discuss what dances they're going to do (one of which is a dance we are planning on doing). 

I'm worried that with an already small pool of potential members, this group will draw members away from our already-established organization. Is there anything I can do to prevent this or reach a compromise somehow?

I'm sure some of you may think I'm being too petty and sensitive about this, but I really, really care about this organization and I'd love to see it grow and prosper. Advice on what actions to take, if any, or if you can change my views on this issue in some way, would be really appreciated.

First dream I don't remember much I just know I woke up feeling like I knew her and was sad she was gone. Second dream was we were both together inside an apt organizing things, she didn't speak but she was dressed exactly like one picture that I saw of her months before. THIRD dream was last night and this time I knew she was dead and she was laughing and spoke to me and told me to join her (as in go die with her). I usually get scared about everything but I was not scared of her, I feel some type of care for her and get burst of sadness moments and feel that I'm grieving also. I never cared to know her when she was alive but Im guessing it's just because I'm so in love with him that I actually do feel a little of his pain. 

We talk alot about her because at the end of the day I'm his friend and that's what he wants but I don't know if I should still tell him about my dreams.

I feel like I'm inferior, everyone has the perfect life, and knows perfectly what to say and interact with people, and then there is me.

I'll worry how I'm sitting. If I look feminine in this position, or if I look masculine in this position or nerdy in this one.

I'll worry if what I'm saying sounds good.

I'll worry If what I said is weird. Then I won't say that stuff. Then I'll worry if that stuff is actually weird or not.

I'll see someone on youtube being super weird, but I don't judge them for it, but I do for myself for the smallest things.

Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I can finally look in the mirror and say ""I'm stable"". As a sufferer from anxiety, depression, mood swings, and general teenage angst, I have done some pretty embarrassing things as a result of my emo years, which I will list. I'm 22 now.

Granted, these things occured as a result of some pretty horrific time periods in my life, such as after my friend hung herself, and when I had to drop years of athletic work due to my depression (I was a state ranked athlete), and other shitty shit that occurred, so I have forgiven myself *somewhat*...

Anyways... I,

-Cried in a bathtub full of everybody I had known for the past 5 years

-sent my ex girlfriend pictures of me crying after we broke up, then she sent me a cease and desist letter to stop contacting her (actually, this happened to two girls, the other one didn't send a letter though)

-had sex with girls who would have definitely not been on my bucket list as a preteen

-spent 5 years with the same nickname, acted like it was okay, then one day told everybody to ""stop calling me that""

-freaked out on social media and called out to fight an old buddy of mine

-posted some other cringeworthy, emo things on social media

Anyways...

Yeah, so as you can see, i walk around and cringe at everything I've done, every 0.5 microseconds, as if I have Parkinson's disease or something. **I know** that I was just a broken person crying for help, and didn't mean to freak out/hurt anybody, so I forgive myself somewhat, but **why the fuck can't I get over these things?**

I demonstrate 0 interest in doing medical school and have repeatedly expressed my ambivalence towards it whenever he brings it up. But I never flat out tell him no because I don't want to disappoint him. He knows my interest in becoming a doctor is low, but still wants me to do it even though you need to be really passionate about it to go through years and years of training + school. He's been asking me before the start of every semester to register for pre-med classes (I'm a junior right now), so I just lie and say yeah I did even though I have no pre-med classes on my schedule, because I don't wanna disappoint him. It's not even possible for me to go to medical school at this point because I've fulfilled none of the requisites but I can't tell him that. And now he wants me to take the MCAT during the summer like lol

He seems to think for some reason that it'll be hard to find a job as a CS major and that its easier to become a doctor. That's absurd on many levels but I don't wanna get into that. Even a former colleague of his who my dad wanted me to work for said to me Comp Sci is probably better than pre-med. I can't explain to him why CS is a great field because you can't explain something to someone who doesn't wanna listen.

Now, another facet of this issue is that my plan A is definitely not something he'll like. It's actually totally preposterous and crazy.

135,"I met my best friend for the first time in college. I had just gotten out of a toxic friendship that I had for over *9 years.* And let me tell you... this person was the absolute *worst.* I still have nightmares about them coming up to my doorstep and asking us to be friends again.

Anyways, it was the best time of my life as I was experiencing adulthood on my own. And for the first time in forever, I couldn't feel the depression I had been dealing with for the past 4 years prior. 

We became so close that people would ask us where the other was if not present. 

They know most of my important secrets and we share mutual empathy of having depression. 

Over the next two years things would start to slightly go downhill and just outright plummet. 

I noticed over these 2 years that they have sort of a superiority complex? I'm not sure if that's actually the right term but to explain it more clearly is that they're heavily opinionated on subjects and not easily moved to change their opinion on things. 

""I really liked that movie!"" 

""No it really sucked, you can just tell by x and x.""

""This is a thing I really like look at it!""

""I don't like this kind of thing no offense but it's stupid."" 

""Hey do you mind if I do this.""

(Completely unrelated to the topic) ""This is why I keep telling you that you need to do this and take more responsibility."" 

For the most part I found the relationship great and though not perfect... it was okay. But then I started to get hurt to a point I'd come back after a hangout and blubber in bed like never before. 

My depression's at a state where I can't feel anything and I'm just numb so everything feels emotionless. But I guess this doesn't include being hurt by them...

Something I found also just very shitty was that they're really just oblivious or a complete asshole. 

They have another friend (who I assume is the person they're currently replacing me with) that I'm actually fond of as well and am acquaintances with. We had planned to go out on a nightly outing together when suddenly we stopped in the middle of the road and informed me that the friend was joining us. Completely unannounced but I was cool with it. We sat at the hangout together and at first we were all mutually talking and then all of a sudden I was left out of the conversation. Feeling a bit irked, I decided to stand up and walk off and explore a bit. I sat on the other side of the place and balled my eyes out. They hadn't realized I had stood up and left for about 45+ minutes... They messaged me later saying that they didn't realize I left. They seemed a bit sorry when they caught up with me but I brushed it off and forgave the incident but I was hurt. It wasn't the only incident too. I've joined hangouts with them only to be left alone for an hour.

I'm starting to pick up this weird pattern. I feel that they have a lonely complex as well and they have admitted this to me as well. But it's in a way that I am contacted to fill that void when they need me. ""I miss when we did this, I miss when we'd do that, let's go have fun."" 

And then the hangout turns out to be dry and neither of us seem to be having any fun anymore. 

I feel like I'm in a one-sided friendship now because I'm trying so hard to be uplifting and excited when I see them, but I'm met with a dry nothing. 

At first I gave a benefit of the doubt because we're both depressed and sometimes life is shit and numb... but I can only take so much. 

I know people are going to tell me the end conclusion is to confront them about it but the purpose of this post was to get opinions on wether or not I'm overreacting or not. 

It feels so hopeless, but it happened in such a short amount of time I'm so confused. 

I've confronted them recently about a separate issue and they answered dryly to it which bothered my severely as it seemed they didn't really care what I was frustrated over. I can't imagine what they'd say after confronting them about this.

138,"
A little background of me, I’m a 2nd year student in a decent university. My grades are good and I have enough social connections with friends and all. So, it’s basically pretty normal and okay life except for the part that I just don't feel good about it. 

It’s just I find myself a little bit insecure, irresponsible and delusional about my life. 

I guess it started with how I was raised. My parents planted in me the perception that I will grow up becoming someone phenomenal for this world. Not their faults, I guess every parent wants their kids to be doing good in their lives. So most of the time I live with that perception ingrained in my mind. 
However, as I mentioned, I sometimes found myself really irresponsible with all my goals and aims. I recently studied Python by myself in hope of getting into writing stock trading algorithms with my friends (we intended to open a club about this). Then I just met with this algorithm from 1950 that I could only understand after spending a whole night reading it. And even now I couldn’t even recode it when I turn the solution off. So, I decided to just skip the problem and go to sleep.

This is not the first time this happens. When I meet with something hard, I leave it there and go to sleep. So this time I just feel really bad about it. It’s like I don’t take responsibility with my life and I just can’t cope with the possibility that I will live a life by doing normal routine of work-home-raising kids that till the end of my life. And I think that’s the problem too because basically that routine is how most people live by and it’s totally fine. 

So by now I just feel really unsettling that I couldn’t sleep and feel that I should write this out. So please, if by chance anyone with more life experience than me pass by, please help me out with some advices on how to become more responsible and less delusional.
Thank you.

140,"Just a little background for you: I'm 20 years old. I've been studying know for over 13 years. At the moment I'm going to university to study computer science. Also would like to point out, that my parents have always helped me, emotionally and financially as much as possible. So when I started, I was really pumped to study. The first semester was fine, I got fairly good grades and I was satisfied with myself and my studying.

When the exams of the 2nd semester came I got really bad grades.  I even failed one course. This was because I really hadn't done anything during the whole semester. I only went to school once or twice a week, although I had classes every day. Now, during the 3rd semster's exams, I'm exactly in the situtation as in the second semester. I have started to feel really bad, and can't find the motivation to even study for the exams.

I know, I like CS and would love to work in the field someday. But at the moment I can't find the motivation to study. I have to finish my exams, but after that I have 3 options.

1. I could quit and start over (I'd study CS again), because I'm worried about my grades (if I want to do a masters degree). But here, where I study, I can't start studying until 2 years have passed after the quitting. Also if I want to quit, I have to do it before 4th semester or I can't apply for the free spot(we don't have to pay for university if the grades from high school are good enough) again.
2. I could take a 1 year break to recollect my thoughts and maybe return to school again.
3. I could continue studying.

The 1st and 2nd option are difficult for me, because I don't want to tell my parents that, I don't go to school anymore. After all they have done for me. Also the 1st or 2nd option would mean that I'd have to get a job, since I don't want to live on my parent's money.

Could you give me advice what should I do, and how to find motivation (to keep studying for the exams and for upcoming semesters)?

Anyways after high school, I was invited to a cottage by the mutual friends that I wasn't really close with at the time to celebrate prom. She was also invited. At first I was nervous as hell being 2 hours away from home being with other people other than the ones in my original circle. But, it was probably the best 5 days I've spent ever in my life because it changed me. At the time I was going through some personal shit and some time off from reality was well needed.

Fast forward to September 2017, I've been talking to her a lot more and I noticed to feel some sort of feelings for her. It's weird because I was always the one to separate friends with relationships. She's basically part of my friend circle now. Sometimes she would drive me home and most of time ill be thinking of saying what I truly feel about her but the friendship will be ruined if shit doesn't work out or become awkward if she turns me down.

So that means him and my little sister has been alone for 4 years which isn't too crazy since when our mother was still here he was there since I was 13.

Never before has he been interested in me or hit on me or anything. But I feel like him and my sister may have something going on. So I decided to visit for a week for my dad's birthday and it has been a bit strange around here. First off my sister; it's freezing outside and she walks around in a sleeveless crop top and yoga shorts... I mean that would be fine if she wasn't around a man like that.

They get along well too, like really well, they act like they're a couple at times being extremely close and him joking at her to do stuff and her telling him to do it, then him actually doing what he told her to do. She does however cook for him while wearing barely anything... We watched a movies together on the couch and she had a cover over herself and him and she mentioned on this sex/kissing scene that she had a man like that. Our step-dad made a sound like he found that funny and they give each other grins like...?

The most suspect things though has to be, when I washed their clothes out of the bathroom hamper. I decided to put my sister's on her bed. It was something that told me I should go put my dad's in his room and out of extreme curoisity I looked in his clothes drawer and saw some of my sister's panties and more of her clothes. Now it wasn't like he was sniffing them, they were there as if they were actually dating and sharing a room.

Not only that but I just woke up, I noticed my sister was gone from her bed so I went to the bathroom and then I heard moaning from my step's room. I mean, I doubt he was watching porn and it sounded like a bed was squeaking so I doubt he had another girl over... my sister was gone and where else could she be?

Month later, this guy I work with started growing on me.. we went out for breakfast once while my bf and I had only broken up for a week &amp; everything was great.. we had sex after the third date.

Month later after hanging out, I text him telling him I don’t want to be someone to have around just for convenience. Then after work he knocks on my car window and says he wanted to talk and basically told me he was sorry and didn’t want me to feel like I was just a hook up.. short story, I told him we can’t hook up anymore and that I need to distance myself so I don’t get feelings.

Meanwhile, my ex boyfriend still tries to pursue me knowing about this coworker of mine, and just does a complete 360. Did the most. Became the sweetest thing. Gave me everything.

I cringed so hard, he probably sensed it before seeing I was in the room.

We talked about it and I got my point across about how it was messed up that she couldn't tell me that she had fully moved on. She says it's respect to her new friend, she doesn't feel comfortable being intimate with me and dating again. 

She also said that she didn't feel it to be necessary to tell me that she's dating because it's too recent with this guy. I explained that if she felt the need to do that to respect him, I also deserve respect being the ex-boyfriend/roommate and should have been told what the deal was. 

*end update*

So I live with my ex-girlfriend, we broke up after getting this place and we can't afford to live on our own as of now so we agreed to keep living together. It gets shifty though.. 

Here's some back story, she broke up with me because we argued a lot and she felt we needed to work on ourselves before being in a relationship. Even though we're broken up we still went out and had occasional sex and what not and did general things a couple would do. 

She would express that she had feelings and she would like for us to work on each other before we got into a relationship again. I'm all for it. But fast forward into today. I get home from work and there is a guy over our house and she tries to sneak him out of the back. I let him leave in peace because I'm a good man and in hope that she will explain. What I find out is that she's been talking to this person for a couple weeks and it seems like she's building towards a relationship with him.

Basically I'm blind sided into the fact that she is talking to another man and that she has given up on us as a couple. Before this I was being led on to the fact that she was working on herself and not focusing on other guys (her words) and that there was a chance for us in the future once we work out the kinks. 

She wants to be friends but I don't see her that way,. As selfish as it may sound, I can not be friends with her knowing that she will find someone to be with and essentially take the spot that I want.

We will most likely go our separate ways when the lease is up in July but what I ask from reddit is advice on how to get over the fact that she moved on without telling me. How do I move on when I have to see her everyday and we're bound by responsibility?

Any advice on the matter is great. Thank you.

170,"I've recently been forced into a situation where I'm living with my parents. I won't go into detail about what happened, but suffice it to say I committed an illegal act; I did not get in trouble with the law, but I did get kicked out of my apartment because of it. 

It's extremely clear that my parents mistrust me over what happened. The thing I did did not involve harming other people, but, given the circumstances and my past history, is likely to arouse suspicion that I will steal from them. Note: the act that I did was not actually theft, more in the realm of self-harm or self-destructive behavior, but a type of self-destructive behavior that is often associated with theft. 

That they mistrust me is evident. What I'm wondering twofold: is is there any way to determine the extent or severity of a person's mistrust?; and 2, what consequences might come from living with someone who clearly mistrusts you?

My parents clearly care about me, they paid a lot of money to fly me home after my 'episode.' But they severely mistrust me and they told most of my extended family about the incident that got me here; everybody knows, and while my PARENTS have not threatened me in any way, my brother, who still lives here half the time, has said ""if anything starts going missing around here I AM CALLING THE COPS ON YOU."" I have not stolen anything and do not plan to but I'm uncomfortable with him having this kind of leverage over me, and I don't really know him well, but I do know that if my parents ever suspected me of stealing something, they'd tell him, and if they did, I'd be in trouble. This much is certain, what I'm wondering is, is it possible that my parents would make something up about me if they felt threatened with me being in the house? Have trust issues been known to go that far? Like I said, they clearly do care about me but there's like this obvious undertone of mistrust to our relationship and it just has me feeling like I need to get the fuck outta here.",17Jan2018,3

I keep telling my parents that I would rather stay home and write my book, or little poems which I actually take some deep and considerable pleasure in. I know this might be mediocre of a question but it really has stuck on my mind. I know about grades and the importance of them. But, I just want to enjoy the thing I love and that is writing.

174,"Being on holiday (from Australia to Europe) at the age of 22 is supposed to be a really cool thing. My journey started out in Saarbrücken near the border of France, which was really cool, because it was near new years eve and we could travel over the border into France to collect some fireworks. At the time it was supposedly commonplace for a German new years eve to set off some fireworks... not so for Australian's. I suppose it was a little easier to obtain.

I then moved into Amsterdam for a couple of days... which felt a bit like a recovery from new years. Wonderful city. So pretty. Despite it offering/tempting me to smoke weed, I had tried it (for the first time at new years eve in Germany), and wasn't ready to go again. New years eve was a little hard for me - in fact, my German friend that night said that I had left an impression on the other patrons during that party, that Australian's can go pretty hard with the booze. Part of me feels pretty proud (as a typical young Australian) .. but also a little embarrassed.

After a brief stop in Paris, I moved down to Portugal (Porto and Lisbon). It was in Lisbon one night that I enjoyed some of the night life away from my sister (who was travelling with me at the time).  I had learnt that Portuguese night life only fired up at least 9-10pm... which was weird to me... but I was young and up for a late night. I found a bar with a DJ in it playing the kind of music I liked. What is forever trapped into my mind is the sounds of James Holden (who's production I was addicted to at the time)... in this case it was a close collaborator, Nathan Fake, and a track called ""The Sky Was Pink"". The exact remix I was listening to as I was about to be escorted to a place I wasn't prepared to be in was  [Nathan Fake - The Sky Was Pink - James Holden remix](https://youtu.be/6jmZTtFxcUg?t=2m15s).

While listening to that I remember being given a drink by the DJ... and feeling like I was really connecting with the venue, the music, and the DJ. I felt special. He even played some of my favorite tracks at the time. This wasn't by any means a vacant bar. There were at least another 30 people occupying the typically small Portuguese bar). 

Next thing I recollect after consuming tunes at the bar was that I was leaving for some reason... I had no idea why I was leaving with the DJ and felt very weak physically. It was still really dark.

Next thing I recollect was that some day light was creeping in and I was in the car with the DJ and had no idea where I was... my pants were down... and he was touching me. I must have passed out

Next thing I recollect was being in a house and even more things than I could imagine happen to me... I remember feeling his body over mine.. his persistence.. his curiosity.. his efforts to get the most out of me... despite my incapability. I wasn't drunk beyond the point of fending him off. I felt weak and as though I wasn't able to move. In hindsight. I was drugged.

Why is this all coming up now. Recently I watched a documentary called ""[The Hunting Ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunting_Ground)"" which set me right off in a bad way... the experiences conveyed were something I had simply not ever dealt with and had somehow managed to ignore for many years. The effect has been so severe that I have had to (for the first time ever) use synthetic medication for my own mental wellbeing... namely a benzodiazepine for my anxiety and an SSRI for my anxiety/depression that were now both immediately obvious in a heavy way.

I’ve scheduled a date with her in a couple days, we’re going to see a movie. 
I’ve only gone on one date with another girl off of tinder and it went pretty well but this is a little different setting. I flourish when I can talk to someone and I find the movie setting a bit restrictive, though it’s too late to change it.

This girl, aside from being substantively engaging, is actually very pretty. Almost intimidatingly pretty. She’s also nearly 2 years older than me.

I’m probably drastically underselling myself here, I definitely have a look and I’m definitely SOMEONES type. I’m just nervous as all hell. 
I’m wondering what the proper etiquette is for this sort of thing. I know to offer to pay for things, treat her right, don’t come on too strong. I’ve just never done a movie date before. Come to think of it I haven’t done that many “first dates” before because it wasn’t how High School worked. Do I do the typical “arm around her” thing? Would that be appropriate?

181,"I recently took an entrance exam to one of my dream schools for Senior High, but unfortunately I did not pass. However, this does not mean that I won't be able to get in the same school for college. 

Before the exam, I told myself that I will accept whatever the result may be, but I didn't know it would be as difficult as it is right now. I'm not usually an emotional person when it comes to things like these but this exam definitely marks a moment for me. I don't know why, I guess it's because I have not faced a failure as big as this before. 

Before the exam, my parents ( Especially my dad ) was so excited that I would finally get in a school they've always dreamed of me getting in, in fact, they were way more excited than I was. They've prepared everything for me and they've done so much, and to let them know that I failed makes me feel really really down.

If it was just me being concerned about the result, I would feel less down, but the fact that my parents are more affected than I am just brings tears to my eyes. I've always hated the feeling of them being sad because of me, I hate it so much. They weren't mad or upset or anything that is bad, they just felt down ( I asked them about it ). I see the frown in their eyes even if they try to hide it ( They pretend to be okay ). 

Just to clear out some things: If you think that they were forcing me to get in this school, then you're wrong, they just fully supported me because this was also their dream for me. They weren't mad that I didn't get it, they still do support me.

The next day i went to apologize because I knew I had been a little curt, but wanting to avoid future situation and clear it up, reiterated in a calmer manner that it was my call and my responsibility.  I have a cell phone on me always so call me next time.

Instead, she flipped out. Call me not a team player, and she was only helping, and I had a bug up my ass, and that I was threatened by her.  It came out of left field as this is all bullshit. 

I calmly did not escalate, and said I was sorry for yesterday's stuff and walked out of her office.  I was irate, but I am not going to get into office drama.

Fast forward 4 months, and she corners me in the kitchen one day offering me some old stuff for my kids - her kids are older and she wants to give me some used crap.  I kinda brushed it off saying we have so much stuff already, haha, that sorta thing.  She says ""I'll bring it anyway"".

For instance, he'll go out of his way to message me links to ridiculously racist or sexist articles (basically anything offensive or controversial) in a deliberate attempt to drag me into a debate with him that isn't meant to be productive or calm: in short, he wants an argument. I normally ignore these messages now. He's also quite critical of my personality and the way I look. For example, he'll say that I'm moody, argumentative (ironic), and very sensitive.

I was hired March 2017, in the midst of the acquisition process.  Came on board as an admin assistant in hopes of growing into an HR role (growth is what the hiring manager sold me on), but was told in August by the larger firm that it's never happening.  I help the company with proposals and RFPs, so I then hoped to transition to a marketing/junior proposal writer type role.  Was told that a) it won't happen for years, and that b) they currently have no office space for me.

It has nothing to do with my work quality either.  My manager has repeatedly told me that she and other executives are amazed by my work but now that our company was acquired, we have less autonomy on decision-making and budgeting.

My parents got upset over it, and somehow my dad managed to purchase a bottle of vodka, idk how I didn't see it when he came from the store on my bike, plus we could barely afford food at the time the only reason we had food was because my grandfather loaned us money. Anyways they got drunk on this bottle of vodka, they ended up fighting so badly my dad threw a folding chair at my stepmother (missed by a mile), dad threatened to burn our house down (my stepmothers ex threatened the same thing and my dad was yelling if my stepmother wanted him to burn down our house like her ex), stepmother smashed dad's phone because dad attempted to call grandfather to get ride away from house, stepmother tries calling the cops because dad is spouting suicidal shit and being aggressive as hell, dad smashed her phone and broke her nose in an attempt to stop her.

And based off my knowledge they drank a large amount in a short amount of time. My dad went to jail for a day. And they both had to go to court and they were LAUGHING about the situation afterwards, yeah nothing more funnier than watching your dad hold a knife to his own throat screaming ""IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT"" at my stepmother while she's crying with a bloody nose to a dispatch. They sat me down and promised to never drink again, which was a broken promise. My stepmother also said she's not an alcoholic, an alcoholic is apparently a person that has to have of a drink just because everyone else has one, and then contradicts herself next sentence saying she saw my dad having a drink and she just had to have one.

204,"Hello everyone I wanted to ask for some advice and help if possible. Am 21 years old have a HS diploma and I don't know what to do with my life. I got 1 year of college under my belt but I don't want to be in college for 3-4 years before I can become an engineer. 

Am a HVAC technician and make about 45k-50k a year before taxes. ( Pay is good but this is not where I want to be in life) 

Am married have and have a son.( 1 year old )

My end goal is to develop a couple apps. I have great ideas and one in particular that I believe will explode if marketed well. ( I have zero experience in app development and will most likely higher a local company to develop the app.)

Is my end goal far-fetched and a waste of time and money with all the competition already? 

Should I focus on going to college before focusing on my app ideas ?(even though school has never been for me.)

If anyone has any pointers on where to start that would be great I feel like this year I have to do something with my life because it feels like it's spiraling out of control even though am so young.

208,"Okay so, to explain:

I recently discovered that I may have some form of minor scoliosis, and as such am needing to replace furniture to make using my PC more comfortable and overall easier, as I need it for both my college course and my hobbies.

However, my PC's motherboard will short out when screwed into a case due to the screw-holes being damaged. It's been sitting on the side of my current desk for about 2-3months now, and I've already had to replace my 1Tb hard drive due to it dying (although I'm not 100% certain it correlates).

I don't want to have to buy new hardware for my PC, and I don't think I'd have the desk space on the new desk for it, however I need to improve my posturing habits before it gets too bad.

213,"I got black out drunk at a friends party; we're adult graduate students- so not teenagers or early college where that might be more appropriate.

216,"I really need some advice on this. Last year, my parents took out a loan in my name for the 2016 fall semester. They forged my signature and neglected to give me any information on the loan until payments were due. I feel like they took advantage of my lack of understanding on this topic. I used the loan for school not knowing the implications of the loan including the interest rate and for how much. I recently dropped out because I discovered college isn't the best thing for me right now. Later on, I found out that I owe the US Dept. Of education a little over $8,000 USD. I'm torn because this loan was taken out fraudulently  (as confirmed by the bank the loan is from) and I know they did this to try to break me away from my fiancé. However, should I report this loan as fraudulent, I would be potentially destroying the relationship I have with my parents  (which really isn't very good to begin with, especially with my mom) and there could even be jail time. In addition, my mom in particular, isn't in a very good place herself due to her record of fraud and poor spending, so I feel like I'm stealing from someone poorer than me to make myself rich, but I also feel like I deserve a fair chance to set up my credit and build my own future. I have dreams of owning a car, a house, and maybe even my own business. Bad credit will damper those dreams. I also have extreme pressure from my finacè to report it. Being that he's a police officer, he would naturally go to that option. I really don't know what to do or even how to figure out what's the right thing for me to do. I understand that I have obligations in both options. Please, if anyone can guide me, I would be so grateful. 

TL;DR my parents took out a loan in my name that I didn't approve of or sign for. I used it without understanding implications because they were left out and I wasn't apart of the process.

We had big plans for this year and just signed a year long lease 3 weeks ago.  My question is what do I do now?  What I wanted to do with my life were the plans we had laid out.  I live across the country from my family and have lived in this city 7 years.  I have about 3 really close/life long friends here and a handful of friends I’ve made over the years.  I also have no job anymore.  I’ve hated my job for awhile now and my ex had actually convinced me to quit and told me she would help support me.  So now I have next to nothing, no commitments,  nothing keeping me here so immediately first inclination is move all the way back home and restart at my parents place.  Now of course most of my family wants me to do this but my brother gave me some great advice.  He said this girl has been in the drivers seat of your life for too long and it’s time for you to take care of yourself and do what’s right for you,  move back home if that’s what u feel is right, but don’t do it without a plan,  don’t just do a huge move to get to your parents and then mope around there trying to figure it out.  He’s absolutely right,  but what I want were the plans I had laid out for this year,  so now I have no fucking idea what I want.  I find myself at this crossroads where I can do literally anything.  I have some money saved so I could go travel or move somewhere extreme.  I could go to school or look for new jobs all over the country or different countries.  Just like my friends and family, I know none of you will have the answer for me.  It’s something I have to figure out on my own.

227,"So, up front, I get it. The idea of a quarter life crisis sounds idiotic. How could I possibly have lived long enough, struggled long enough, or learned enough to be at this point? And that’s fair. I didn’t coin the phrase; I’m just using it. 

Depression and anxiety runs in my family and I am no stranger to it. I’ve been on and off medications for most of my adult life. I’m currently in the “best” place I’ve been in a while and decided I wanted to deal with my life off my meds. So far, nothing extreme. However, one thing I’ve struggled with as long as I can remember is: what do I want to be when I grow up? I’ve never come to a solid conclusion and I so envy those who feel that confidence of their choice and their direction. I eventually bounced around, convinced myself of a path, went to grad school, got my shit together, and here I am.  An “adult.” The problem is, I’ve come to learn, I really don’t like what I do. It doesn’t feed any of the check marks in a column of things I want from life and a job.

My anxiety in regards to this ebbs and flows. As natural, some days it’s fine and some days it’s overwhelming. When it’s overwhelming, my brain thinks I need a change NOW and I can settle, can’t relax, and can’t focus...at least until I’m in a safe space. The other part of me can’t ever imagine feeling settled, relaxed, or focused, for the years to come. It feels overwhelming. And so does the idea of making a switch. I don’t want to make the same mistakes I did before, something that makes sense on paper, gives me a direction, pays well, yadda yadda, but makes me depressed and anxious. On top of this, the idea of even knowing how, when, or where to switch careers and pivot feels equally daunting and impossible.

Now, I know this is a very common theme in my generation (almost 30). I know it gets made fun of and may seem ridiculous. I don’t need to know that you walked up hill both directions in the snow or that you accept something you hate because that is the reality. I get it. I get all of the criticism. But here I am.

I guess what I’m trying to ask is: how the hell do I find some peace? And if you want throw in a bonus about figuring out a new career, won’t say no!",17Jan2018,3

231,"Im just wondering if this is a common thing or if I should be worried. Tldr at the end.

Since my first part time job in high school (cashier) I've noticed that after standing for long periods of time, I get this burning sensation in my back right between my shoulder blades. For a long time I ignored it bc I could either work through it or it stopped completely for a couple weeks.

This year I noticed it while at the gym while sitting at a machine working my arms. I also just took a full time job and I get it everyday. Today I felt it at 8am. 

Ive told my primary care physician and she just said she wasn't sure and that it could be the muscles are overworked. I talked to my mom's massage therapist and she said it might be skeletal and I should go to a chiropractor. I didn't get a chance to go before my job started. Every employee has a physical on site, so I asked their physician and she said I should talk to the physical therapist at conditioning. So I did, and she said it could be that the muscle is both weak and overworked, so she offered to show me the foam roller to loosen up my back but she keeps forgetting and is busy so she said she would show me on Friday.

I even lowered my work table because we stand all day, but I'm worried that's not enough. I don't want to make a big deal out of it because I'm new but it's starting to really annoy me that after work I need to lay down and avoid doing anything else such as dishes or dinner, which I usually do anyway.

Tldr: Long story short. I'm wondering if anyone feels a burning sensation near their shoulder blades and if they know what it is or how they got it checked out. I'm worried that if this continues it could get worse. ",17Jan2018,9

* What I like: Late 20s married couple close to my age - possibility for friendships (I'm new in town), they are clean freaks
* What I don't like: House and area is kind of older/meh, don't want to be caught up in a married couples arguments, first time renters

* Price: $750

So this guy comes to our house every weekend. And we started talking one evening. We got to know each other and well we started talking from that night.

Fast forward at the moment we’re pretty close. We talk like 24/7. But I think that he is giving me mixed signals. Or whatever you would call this.

So whenever he’s over at our place he always asks me to come hang out with him, my brother and all the other friends. Which is fine by everyone, My brothers friends are my friends. We get along really well.

One night we were having like a party. drinking but only like one beer. And we started to get really close. 10 minutes in and we were just cuddling. Since then whenever we are together he always touches me a lot. Not in THAT way lol. But he just always hugs me, touches my legs alll the time, grabs my butt acutally often. He is always giving me compliments. Texts me all the time. I can tell he likes being around me you know.

But there’s other side to the story. While he is being all close and nice he is also talking about other girls too. He is always saying that my best friend is hot af. If he sees a girl he would tell me something like ‘Oh that girl is stunning’. And he neeever tried to kiss me.

So what’s happening? Does he like me or does he only want me for the body? I mean I asked him that before he said absolutely no and that he likes me cause I’m funny, kind etc…. Why hasn’t he made like bigger moves like kissing or asking out only two of us? What should I do?",17Jan2018,2
243,"I am 26 years old currently living with my partner of 2 years. He works full time and I am going to university, but I am not working. Right now seems like the perfect time to get a dog as I have ample time to be with the dog and train it. I've always wanted a dog, specifically a pug. My partner has given me his blessing and thinks it would be a good idea for us to own a dog, though technically the dog would be mine. I will be footing the bills when we make the purchase and if anything goes wrong with his health, but he is willing to help take care of the dog. I am in a stable financial position so paying for any unforeseen vet bills won't be debilitating. The problem is that we plan on moving in about 5 years time to another country, and spending about one year working and living in that new place. We probably would not be able to take the dog with us, though I haven't really looked into the specifics of that because so far this seems all very hypothetical. If we did get the dog I think we could probably find someone to take care of the dog in our absence, though neither of us have checked yet with our families. 

Part of the reason why I would love a dog so much is that it would be nice to have a certain level of responsibility and obligation to another living being. I could use the companionship and feel like connection to my future pug would add a deep richness to my life. I also worry about getting a dog after the trip because that far down the line, we will likely be in a place where were looking to start a family and buy a house. I am worried that throwing a dog into the mix at that point might overwhelm me, since I am not great with change, and especially a lot of change all at one point.

247,"Hi all, I'm really unsure of where to post this, but figured r/Advice would be a good starting point. 

I don't have too many details as I've only heard this from my mother who is witnessing this firsthand, but I'll try my best to describe the situation:

My step grandfather has been in and out of the hospital for the last four years due to multiple complications from surgery. The original surgery was to alleviate spinal pain in the area around his neck, which had to be done through his mouth. 

A cyst near the site of surgery developed and a feeding and drainage tube had to be put in. The doctor did not like the location of it, so he took it out and repositioned it, which wound up causing muscle and tissue damage of his larynx. My step grandfather did take that doctor to court and won, but little compensation was given.

Now, due to the scarring and damage, he has issues with clearing his lungs. He has been hospitalized for about two to three weeks now for issues with his kidneys, heart, and lungs. The hospital has recently set him up for dialysis, and are saying he may not have long to live. 

He has been having good days where he is 100% mentally there and capable, and bad days where he is a bit unsure and foggy-brained. The doctors and nurses have seemed to essentially written him off because they only witness his bad days and don't try to communicate with him. Treatment had been by trial and error with focus being on the negative. Without consent they have placed a DNR band on his wrist. 

The hospital has him on a machine the ""breathes"" for him and says that his heart may give out. They have said that he cannot leave because of this. From what I gather, this hospital staff does not really pay attention to the patient. They read his chart (which has been wrong more than once), observe him on his bad days (which means they can't talk with him), and are so quick to say that he is declining and may only have a couple of months to live.

I'm not close to my step grandfather at all, but I find it incredibly disheartening that a hospital would treat someone so carelessly. One cannot gather enough information to keep a person well through 20 rounds of ""telephone."" No one at this hospital is taking the time to check in with him regularly, being sure that they speak with him on a good day, and pursuing alternative approaches to bettering him. It feels very much like they've just decided that he won't live, so they'll keep him there on dialysis until his heart gives. 

Again, I'm not sure that this is the right place to post this, but I don't know where else to go. I know he isn't the first person to go through this, or the last, and that's what I find to be even more disturbing. 

Is there any kind of support group or center that helps patients in bad hospital treatment situations? Any advice or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

248,"For reference, I am 34/F and my mom is 69. I live in a different state than my mom.

I think my mom is a little addicted to Facebook, and she's always the first to like/comment/react to any post I make. She used to just tag me in everything she found interesting, so I turned on the feature to review visibility for tagged material. Her constant and immediate hovering over my Facebook posts are making me feel a little suffocated. I feel guilty because her life is kind of small right now, she doesn't have many social outlets and has always had a hard time maintaining friendships (my whole life) so she's really defined herself as a mother. 

I've gotten self-conscious about it enough that I excluded her from seeing my posts, then adding her back after a day or two. But she's still commenting and liking everything, and I'd prefer to keep my content public from the get-go.

Sometimes it feels like my life has been defined by her role in it, and I'm trying to break away from that now but I don't know how to explain that to her without hurting her feelings.",17Jan2018,8

I get that she doesn't want anythin to come out of this, but we were pretty good friends before and I don't want to lose her. How should I approach this?

250,"So back in 6th or 7th grade I scored the worst possible grade (in my country it's a 6) in a dictation. I was never really good with grammar and spelling but this honestly shocked me. My teacher was worried as well and decided to send me to a psychologist to check for dyslexia.

The result was .... well unexpected. Average intelligence overall except for my language skills. These were above average.

So, yeah, dyslexia was not my problem then. My teacher simply gave me an extra book for practicing grammar (never used it btw) but other than that nothing was done.

As a kid I didn't think much of it but in retrospect I always wondered what my actual issue was.

I looked up the symptoms of ADD just recently and honestly I found that a lot of these fit me.

Dozing off mid conversation or while reading, having troubles staying organized, procrastination, not paying attention to details (I guess that is the cause for my bad grammar?),skimming though things and the tendency to abandon long projects.

I always suspected my inability to concentrate was caused by my constant struggles with anemia, but thinking back I always had that lazy, daydreaming attitude about me.

I don't know, maybe I'm just grasping at straws here because there are times I can be super attentive. When I was reaching the final years in school, I suddenly improved in a lot of subjects I used to be very bad in. I did not learn outside of class, but it seemed that I started to actually pay attention and concentrate during class. Even tough subjects like math seemed so much easier suddenly. Don't know if this can apply to someone with ADD. ( Have to say though, some of that was due to my new teachers being really good and making class more fun.)

What do you think? Does this warrant a visit to the psychologist or can I fix this another way? 






For those that care some more info below on me trying to fight my bad habits.

Some time ago in university, I was getting fed up with my lazy attitude. Two semsters in and I had not passed a single exam. Granted, my subject was chemisty and not the easiest, but I still highly underpeformed.
So I started to work harder, like I never had before. Would still doze off during lectures and was still not as organized as I wish I was, but there was improvement. I would sit down, learn several hours, and repeat this process fairly often. Once I started to understand the excercies everything became much easier for me.

This didn't last for long though. I actually passed two exams (failed a third) and had one last one left. I just didn't learn for that. I knew I had to, but after trying to sit down to learn I just couldn't. I was wasting time daydreaming or getting distracted by the most random things. Doing several things at once, and procrastinating.

After a while I even had a full blown burnout and that is when I realized that I was never going to finish with a degree. 

Well, I don't know what that says about me. Could I have pulled through If I just tried harder or is there really more to it?

What do you guys think?

251,I want to be able to rent out a place that people would have to pay maybe to get in or maybe just serve drinks and have them pay there.

252,"Hello.


I have self-esteem problems that play out in a number of ways (e.g. rumination, low sense of self-efficacy, inferiority complex, etc.). This combined with my general emotional ineptitude combines in one of the biggest ways that I dislike myself: my obsession with others and with attention. I have this compulsion to be excessive, negative, and dramatic around people. I've gotten to where I process thoughts/feelings/plans of action in terms of how I would display them to others, to where I don't know what I'm actually feeling/thinking/etc and what is genuine to me. I know people are naturally social creatures, but this feels too weird for me to think that this is normal. (But if it is, let me know how it is not weird to you.)


I say all of this to ask how I can build emotional self-sufficiency, how to be able to handle stuff more on my own and without these external needs. I know how I can control behavior well enough (e.g. do not talk about my problems to others, isolate myself). But how do I handle the emotional and cognitive part? How do I stop having this emotional pang for attention and over-expression and this cognitive obsession with others and lacking insight? I ideally want to develop so, even if I am struggling, I can keep it more inside, ideally almost completely so.


And, while I know it is likely the case, please do not respond with something along the lines of just ""build confidence"". I do not work well with the abstract at all, and advice as broad as that is very frustrating. The more concrete the advice, the better. Even though I know the question is very abstract and broad, I apologize.

256,"So... My teacher had a bad day, and she sort of took it out on me.

I think it's uncalled for, since I always participate in class, answer questions, help other students.
Not that I'm flawless - I tend to laugh at a lot of things, and have really low standards for humor.

Well, I have this pillow I bring to class - really it's more of a stomach warmer - my stomach gets cold real quick and I usually get a stomach ache because of that so I bring a pillow to cover my stomach.

Well, while I was doing a question on the board, and lent my pillow to person X  - that person lent it to person y who started playing with it.

Well, person y started horsing around and threw the pillow (it's a arm pillow it's small and not the regular sized one - maybe 1/3rd the normal size just so you guys don't think I bring it around sleeping) at person G and it caused a commotion because it fell on the floor. The teacher finally irritated, confiscated the pillow and now I'm the one getting in trouble.

Okay, I get it - it's my fault for bringing it in the first place - but I'm not the one who lent it to person Y. So why do I have be the one who has to go to the disciplinary committee?

Now I'm considering two options - either give my teacher the cold shoulder because, well, for one of the most active students in class my teacher really treats me like I'm not or, act a NC to the teacher and suck it up to them and hope that they'll be nice enough to give it back.

I guess I'm somewhat tired of always trying to be nice to my teacher. Oh don't get me wrong, I also make fun of her but in a much more docile(?) manner?
I guess I'm close to the middle ground between good and bad but more to the good. Maybe chaotic good.

My teacher's class sucks so I get why they got mad.

Class Composition:
There's the noisy group on the left
 the slightly more quiet and doesn't pay attention on the right
the back left who makes noise, the back middle that's quiet
the back right that doesn't pay attention
and the middle group on the left who is rather quiet but also makes some noise (where I am) and is the most active in class participation
and the middle right, who has the most daring classmate that causes everyone in the class to laugh or make a commotion.

262,"We met when I was 14 and he was 19 over the internet. We were both role players and I think I responded to his post, but either way things kept going from there. We talked every night for almost two years, and I didn’t tell him how old I was until about two years in. He didn’t seem to care much, but we already had a vaguely sexual relationship then. (I confessed that I loved him after about a year, and he told me he loved me too the best he could, right up until the first cutoff, and I was pretty sure he was my soulmate for a while)

This continued as a secret I kept from my partners until my ex, who found the texts between him and I on my phone (about 3 years into this). Ex forced me to stop talking to him extremely abruptly. Of course I crawled back to him on all fours, apologizing profusely and begging for him to let me be with him again. He agreed. After some time, I stopped talking to him again, because of the Ex. The we broke up and I started dating my now fiancé, and I contacted him again, begging for forgiveness and telling the partner I needed closure. He let me come back, telling me that this was the last chance. Fiancé found out, told me he wasn’t good for me (because he’d groomed me into being a bdsm slave essentially and that he’d only been using me to get off) and I randomly blocked him on everything I could find, without saying a word. 

I’m still hurting because of this. I’m 17 now, and he’s about 22/23. I haven’t talked to him in about 2 months, and I know I still harbor feelings for the guy. It’s so fucking painful to think about him, but he still crosses my mind quite often.

264,"A very heartfelt and sincere thank-you in advance to anyone who reads all this and has any advice to share.

I currently work in marketing at a public relations agency. I don't love my job, but I suspect that has more to do with where I work than the work itself. Another agency in my area just posted a job opening that is perfect for me, and they have much better clients, better benefits and a better team.

This would be a no-brainer except that I recently applied to grad school with the intent to get my Master's degree in comm, in the hopes of becoming an adjunct professor. I stand a very good chance of getting into the program since I had strong test scores and good undergraduate performance, but I will not know whether I was accepted until March.

The problem with grad school is that they forbid any outside employment. Instead, you become a TA or a fellow and get paid a stipend, which can be anywhere from $15k to $30k (I won't know the specifics until I get accepted). As you can imagine, this is substantially less than I currently earn. I have an employed partner so I wouldn't starve to death, but it would still be a strain to take such a hit financially.

Again, that other agency job sounds like the obvious path to take. The only thing I'm struggling with is the meaningfulness/fulfillment aspect. I like marketing and PR, and this new agency works in fun industries (compared to my current position). But on a deeper level, marketing doesn't seem like a purposeful or meaningful job. And I can't decide whether I should be OK with that.

Becoming a professor would be meaningful; however, as I mentioned, it requires a serious pay cut while I'm in school for the next two years and even beyond, as adjuncts are not paid particularly well. And once I graduate, there's no guarantee of me finding an adjunct position. And even once I find one, adjuncts are contracted semester-to-semester so it's not necessarily reliable. And I'm definitely not making a difference in the world if I'm unemployed, lol.

I should note that I am religious to a degree so it matters to me if I'm doing what the universe/god wants and intends me to do. I am afraid of going down the wrong path and not fulfilling the purpose of my existence. But I also want to do what's best for my partner and (future) family, which points me towards getting a steady job.

**TL;DR: I could go after a good agency job in my field with solid job security or take a huge pay cut and pursue my MA to become an adjunct professor (bad job security). Agency sounds good, but worried that it's not meaningful like teaching would be.**",17Jan2018,2
265,"Hopefully this is the right place to post this. 

In November I ordered the IPhone X to treat myself. I did it via Tmobile's $300 trade in promotion through customer service. Somehow the CSA messed up and gave me a lease instead of the EIP, which I didn't realize until I got the bill in January. 

Now CS is telling me that they can't do anything to change the lease even though it was their fault. There is even a note that says that I requested the EIP/$300 promotion.
To make matters worse, they won't give me the $300 trade in promotion and they only gave me $82 dollars for the phone that i owned and traded in. 

They also told me that if I cancel the lease I have to pay the amount in full. At this point i'm beyond frustrated and CS is telling me the same old thing and that ""a lease is literally like the EIP"" you know except I still have to pay a lump sum and taxes at the end if I want to keep the phone.

Ok I've been with this girl for about 2 months now, and up until the past few weeks everything has been great.

I have to talk her out of suicide almost weekly and it takes a toll on me emotionally each time, I can feel it affecting my mental health already. She has also resorted back to self harming recently and it makes me feel as if I'm not enough for her, even though she says I'm the best thing she's ever had, which then contributes to the trapped feeling.

I receive messages saying she's going to kill herself and Snapchats of her self harming almost every week and they make me feel useless to her. When I'm with her she's fine and perfectly happy, but when I have to go away she instantly snaps back into these suicidal tendencies

I still wish I could be with her but I know in the long run it will drive my mental health into the ground, but on the other hand if I could help her then we could both be good together, just the way things are right now aren't sustainable for me.

267,"So I need some advice on how best to get on with my life.. here's my story (beware wall of text):

3 months ago my fiancee who I had been seeing for 8 years (engaged for 2) suddenly ended things. We had bought a house together and were building it up last year (2017). We were planning on getting married next year (2019). The reason she gave for calling everything off was that we grew apart, all we ever talked about was the house and we spent our weekends inside and barely going out. The reason for this was because I used to spend the weekend mornings at the house we bought (which is still not finished) fixing things up and would be super exhausted. I'm was also a bit self conscious about my hair since due to stress and approaching my 30's I was starting to go bald.

At this point I should give some further information about the house because it will help you understand the rest of the story. We bought the house together, took a bank loan together and agreed that the repayments for the loan would be taken from a joint account which we setup. We then agreed that due to me being the higher earner I would pay 2 thirds of the repayment and transfer them each month to our joint account and she would repay the remaining 1 third. I spent the all of last year putting all my energy into the house with the goal of completing it by this coming March (2018). In the meantime I rented a temporary apartment till March. We didn't live together since she's an only child and her parents are a bit over protective and traditional.

So back to the story. After she called things off I tried to fix things between us but was always met with a cold/bitchy attitude. I spent a month and a half trying to fix things until eventually Xmas week was approaching (xmas eve was our anniversary). I decided to do something spontaneous and book a trip to go abroad to get my mind of stuff and invited her to come along with me. At first she was thinking about it then came up with some shitty excuse that her passport was going to expire in April(wtf right ?). So yea I went abroad on my own. Xmas eve came and I sent her a text telling her happy anniversary/xmas and her only reply was Thanks. I'm going abroad next week. I was like wtf? You blew me off and now you're going abroad? Her reply was this is why I never come back to you because you keep giving me shit! It was at this point that I was so hurt I decided to not reply and cut off all contact. That was literally the last conversation we had.

A couple of days later I decided to get a notary to draft up a contract saying that if we sell the house she would be entitled to 1 third of any profits made given she only paid 1 third every month. I also told the notary to handle any contact with her. After a few days of the notary chasing her she replied to say that she does not accept and that the profits should be split in such a way that we each get anything we forked out so far and the rest of the profits are split equally. It was at this point that it occurred to me that should the house take long to get sold I would still end up paying 2 thirds of a repayment every month. I decided I wanted to stop this since I no longer had any obligation to her. Told the notary to write up a revised document saying that she should pay me the difference of her 1 third and my 2 thirds that way we would have forked out the same amount and to amend our bank repayments so they are half and half which would in turn entitle her to half the profits. 

So where are we at now you might ask? Well after an 8 year relationship I find that all my friends are either couples/have kids/have a partner and don't want to hangout anymore (understandable), I find myself turning 30 in a few months and everything I wanted in my life (house/family/kids) taken away from me. My ex is literally ignoring the notary and hasn't given any answer so bank repayments are still the same and house is in an unfinished limbo state. The notary has just told me that if she keeps on ignoring emails/calls we will need to get a lawyer to send an official letter which she cannot ignore.

Apart from all this shit I find myself in a constant depressed state, close to tears. Silly stuff triggers memories about the good times we had and I'm not concentrating at work which is making me fall back on my deadlines. I literally spent yesterday staring at the engagement ring which she gave me back wondering how we ended up here. I find myself thinking if I should just end it all at this point. I can't see myself rebuilding a new relationship, house , marriage the works again. I constantly think of trying to contact her because I think things have escalated way out of proportion.

Soo yea if you've got to this point after that wall of text... any advice?

282,"I’m 19 and have never been in an intimate/romantic relationship before. I wouldn’t say that I’m opposed to being in one in the slightest, but there is always just something holding me back from pursing love interests. I have a feeling it’s because of all of the abusive relationships I’ve witnessed throughout my life. Literally my mom, sister, aunts, family friends, I’ve seen too many people get hurt from the men that supposedly loved them, and I feel like that for me has subconsciously tainted the idea of actually ever pursing a romantic relationship. 

And it’s weird because I can see myself being with a guy and being happy in a relationship, but it’s just the initial fear of not knowing whether they’ll be abusive or eventually abusive that gets me feeling very scared/nervous. I know I sound like a paranoid person, but I can’t help the way I feel. And I hate it because it’s ruined a lot of chances for me in regards to dating guys I really liked in the past up until as recent as last month.

293,"If asked by someone ""How is your marriage"" I would probably come up with an answer that is pretty non committal. Something like ""it is pretty good"", or maybe I would just say ""good"", or ""ok"" or I might even go as far to say ""rough at times but overall good"". These statements are all true, rather boring but true.

If asked by someone ""How is your marriage"" I would really want to answer something like......""AWESOME"", ""I love my wife so much"", ""we are fantastic together"", ""we enjoy each other so much"", ""it is fun, empowering, supportive"", ""nothing is better than being married to your best friend"", ""we can sit together and talk for hours."" I would want to tell everyone how good it feels to be married. How great it feels to come home to someone who can't wait to see you. 

I think my wife and I are lonely! We are tired and worn down. We have heavy hearts that are further weighed down by the daily grind. We have tired minds and tired souls. We are doing our best with what we have right now. We seem to be two separate people living under the same roof getting through life trying to be married. We are not happy with one another,  one doesn't show enough affection, one doesn't give enough of their time. We are still trying!

What I could tell someone if they asked ""What is it like to be married?"" I could tell them that being married is hard! It is work, it is time consuming, and it requires ones full effort. It is both selfish and selfless. It can be thankless and can be taken for granted, it can be a rocky road to be travelled. It can also be fulfilling, full of laughter, joy, and excitement. It can feel comfortable. It can feel satisfying. It can feel supportive. It can be great!

So now what? How do I get that marriage back that makes me want to shout from the roof tops or at least makes me want to hug my wife and mean it? How do we stop being lonely? How do we have more good times than bad times? What can I do today to make tomorrow better? 

I have seen a quote that I have kept with me for some time.  I have actually seen it many times and maybe I just didn't believe it. However as time goes on I see how it is more and more fitting to life. Although not a direct quote the idea is if you want a different outcome a change needs to take place, and while you cannot change other people you do have the ability to change yourself. Your thoughts, your actions and your words.

So now what? I will be the change! 

I will be the one to stand up and not longer be weighed down by circumstances. I will speak up so I no longer feel lonely. I will give more hugs and say more supportive words. I will put in the work, even the hard work! Everyday I will be conscientious in the things I think, do and say. I will push through the feelings of defeat and failure until I get it right. 

So now what....now it starts with me!

297,"Due to my mother wishing to relocate I have had to find somewhere to live at very short notice. The best I could get was a 2 bed downstairs in a bad area but the rent is still pretty high.


I only had a very quick viewing and it seemed okay aside from a few little things, and the estate agent assured me it would all be alright for my moving in.


So today I signed the standard 6 month lease and got all my addresses changed (bank etc), and also arranged for a load of furniture to be delivered.


The problem. There was still small bits of damage, and there was a really powerful smell of rot and damp. At first I thought it was because it was cold and the property had been empty for a while but was I wrong about that.


The door leading into the kitchen is warped. The finish on the kitchen units has bubbled and cracked due to damp. The kitchen sink is broke. Instead of draining, it empties onto the kitchen floor. The unit.and door around the sink is rotten and warped. And mouldy, complete with fur.

Sis is going into wacko state, shouting down big daddio because he is using the tv, interrupting him every time he tries to speak calling him a liar. I find situation strange, and decide to video tape it. Point phone camera at her, she goes super saiyan. Tries physical assault but I am big stronk boi so just block her like a kungfu master. She says okay fine and walks into garage. Not sure if she's going to grab an axe or what weapon but I know it's going to be a weapon. Comes out with pepper spray and tries to moisturize me in face, ordering me to stop recording her because it's rude of me (lol). 
I use my secret weapon (hoodie) to protect my face and dad just kind of watches until I call him out like really nigga u gonna just watch this shet? He stands between us and she won't spray him cause he gives her the moneys. She goes on rant about how I've recorded her before and put it on my internet blog or on facebook. I've never done that. This post is a first of its kind for me. I tell her she's lost her gosh dang marbles. She keeps insisting until I tell her to prove it. She says fine, fuck you all, go burn in hell. Exit scene. Pops accepts it all. 
Okay then. All of this because somebody else was using the tv when she thought she was going to get it to herself. This is just the most recent example of her fun and quirky personality. The thing is, she never apologizes for any of this kind of shit. She never admits fault about it, and she never admits when she is being straight up delusional. Father dost not wish to punish her in any way ('bitch u move out now'), and so her delusions are allowed to fester within her. She is the dom in this bdsm household. So if she isn't ever going to face any consequences, even for literally assaulting me, this means if she chooses to punish me for filming her in the future, she will be allowed to. This means her actions will continue to escalate as they have for a long time now, while all the while she can excuse them with whatever delusion she comes up with, because there are 0 consequences to her actions.

301,"Hmmm where to begin... first of all an advanced thank you to those that read on and give some advice.

I have a dilemma, do I return to college or continue on with an apprenticeship.

If I return to college, after one more semester (spaced over one year as I will be doing it part time) I will be awarded a level 6 QQI higher cert in electronic engineering. If I take this route I will also take up smaller follow on courses to try become exceptional all round.

If I continue on in my apprenticeship (still only in phase one despite working full time in the trade for 20 months) I will be shipped to Donegal for 4 months training, which is undesirable. The apprenticeship is “electronic Security Systems” which includes CCTV, access control, intruder and fire alarms etc. After 4 years (one of which will be periodically spent in full time college) I will be arwarded a QQI level 6 degree in electronic Security Systems systems. 

I’ve spoke with a career guidance counsellor who told me they are both worth the same, however she didn’t seem to know a whole lot about engineering or trade. 

Realistically is there much of a difference? I fear the apprenticeship training will be rather uneducational for those 4 months as I’ve already completed 3 semesters in electronic engineering and I’ve almost two years hands on experience so I’m fairly up to speed. However I don’t want to do a year in part time college and not be as desirable as someone who did the apprenticeship. 

Can someone, especially someone in the trade give me some advice? Please",17Jan2018,2

307," I have always been intrigued by the lifestyle and work of a flight attendant and it is some what of a dream job for me. So, I would like your opinion and thoughts on the logistics side of things and give me any advice on which career would make me and my family happier in the long run. I can also see myself using my degree if I take my promotion and gaining good experience.

My background and current living situation:

Since I have graduated in May I have applied for 100+ jobs and have had 30+ interviews so I am very thankful that I am in the position I am in now to pick between two jobs that I could potentially be happy with. I am a 24 year old female with a marketing degree. I live with my boyfriend, roommate, and my cat and dog. Our lease ends in May but I do have roughly $25,000 in savings so it is not a huge concern but still something to consider since if I move I will have to be paying my own rent. My boyfriend will stay in our current state regardless of my choice until he graduates in may of 2019 and then due to his career interests will need to move out of state to find work meaning I would have to find new work at that time if I take the promotion. 

Option 1:

I have been offered a conditional job offer from a major airline. I will be given a training date soon which will require me to go to training for six weeks sometime between February and April without pay but they do pay for housing and food. As long as you graduate from training you are offered the job (training is difficult but almost a guarantee I will pass due to my educational background) Then you are assigned a base immediately after and have to move to your base (unless you choose to commute which is difficult). You do get to put down preferences but those preferences are not guaranteed and they can send you wherever they want and you can make a transfer request after your six months of probation. 
The pay starts out at $30/ flight hour and about $2/diem. This basically means I would be making around $24,000 my first year. However, after you gain seniority the pay gets better up to $60 per flight hour and you also have a better schedule. 

Option 2:

I have worked at a performing arts building for about four years while being enrolled in college. Since graduating I have been in the running for an assistant manager position that pays minimum of $40000 (dependent on negotiating). This job also has the benefit of me going to graduate school for free but obviously it would be only a couple of classes per semester since I would be working full time. I am also unsure what I would want to go to school for and have to take tests to get in. My place of work has new management and so there will be a lot of changes to the job description that are unknown to me now. This job is in my home state where my family lives and where I have lived my entire life.

308,"I'll start from the beginning. About 4 years ago, a woman moved into the condo next to mine. For the sake of this story I'll refer to her as Jane. We share a common wall. For the first 3 years or so, Jane was what I would call a pretty good neighbor. Didn't make much noise unless her young child was over (she has a younger child, but doesn't seem like she has full custody since he isn't always there with her) and mostly kept to herself. 

About a year ago, Jane got a boyfriend that lives with her in the condo full time who we'll just call Bob, and since that time, they have turned into the neighbors from hell. I found out from the neighbors on the other side of her (who are a husband and wife and also share a common wall) that they used to be friends with Jane, and ever since she got with Bob she hasn't been friendly and doesn't speak with them anymore. They also told us they heard through the grapevine that Bob has been arrested twice for domestic violence and has been to jail/prison.

The first thing that started to happen after Bob moved in is he started beating Jane's son, who looks to be maybe 7-9 years old. He beats the child for usually 1-2 hours at a time and we can hear every punch and the child screaming in horror. It's so disgusting to hear him because it sounds like he enjoys putting the child through hell. We usually hear this happen at least a couple times a month. Bob also beats Jane and gets into loud shouting arguments where he is using all kind of profanity that we can hear clear as day. We've heard Jane scream while taking punches from Bob.

We tried calling the police twice, but both times they took around an hour to show up. And by that time the fighting wasn't going on anymore. I could hear the police talking to them through my wall. Jane defended Bob and told the police that her child ""is just a screamer"" and everything is ok. Both times the police left in less than a couple minutes without doing anything. Then, during another beating of the child, our neighbors must have called the police. After the police left, again without doing anything, Bob (who must have assumed it was me who called the police) starts pounding on my wall calling me a pussy and to come fight him outside, and that he can do what he wants with his kid. I just yelled back at him that he has other neighbors and I wasn't even the one who called.

So that's the worst of it, but there is more. Ever since Jane got with Bob, they smoke weed all the time. And every time they smoke, my entire place fucking stinks. Usually after they have a violent fight, they light up.

Jane also recently got a dog too, which barks non stop when they aren't home. And she also must have upgraded her sound system because when she gets home from work I can hear constant bass until about midnight.

And even if it turns out to not be my passion, how does one even go about differentiating between a true hobby and just a waste of time? I know you could say that anything that one enjoys is a hobby, but I don't think that's true.

315,"Two years ago I moved into my boyfriends house along with my two dogs. At the time I crated both the dogs and didn't realize until our next door neighbor complained that one of them non-stop barked when we would leave. So the wife came over to complain. She said she was yelling in my window and hitting the side of the house trying to stop the dog from barking. She's an idiot - of course he barked even more. In any case, I told her I would figure something out to stop him from barking. I quit crating the barking dog and that was that - no more barking dogs. I followed up with the neighbor to ask if everything was good and she said it was.

GREAT!

Fast forward a year. The husband next door likes to play loud music in his garage. Only at night time. I'm not the type to complain so I dealt with it as it only happened once in a while. Over the past year though the frequency and volume of his night time concerts have increased to the point of being 2-3 times per week. Now, this man is in his mid 50's, both he and his wife work first shift and they have a high school aged boy. He starts his shenanigans anywhere from 9pm - 1am and sometimes doesn't stop until 3 or 4am. It's just too much. His stereo is in his garage which is about 4 feet from my bedroom. Both my fiance are being woken up by this so I decided it's time to stop being passive. 

I marched over there at 3:30am one night last month after listening to his music for two hours. I knocked on the door and got not answer. That didn't surprise me as he had it loud enough you could hear it two doors down in either direction. So I wrote a note and left it in his mailbox. It was pretty pleasant considering how irritated I was. I just told him I wasn't trying to harsh on his good time but that it was too loud for how close our houses were and that it is interfering with sleep on nights we go to bed for work. I told him I wasn't trying to be a problem - that I just wanted him to turn it down a bit. 

His response was completely unreasonable. I saw him take the note out of his mailbox. He promptly walked into his garage and turned the volume and bass up on his stereo and played it that way for 10 hours straight.... while he was blowing leaves in his backyard with noise cancelling headphones on. Clearly this guy is a DICK. 

The next day I filed a police report. They advised I call them next time it gets loud. Two nights later he cranked it up again so I called the police. They came and talked to him and he turned it off. Except that's when the harassment started. Nothing serious at all - just slamming car doors, garbage cans, flipping us off, peeling out on the road in front of our house... oh well though. The music stopped, at least at a loud volume, I figured the situation was done.

Boy, was I wrong. I started up again this weekend. I didn't hesitate and called the cops again. The cop I spoke to seemed less than happy to hear from me again. He asked what I wanted him to do (i.e. ask him to turn it down again or write the guy a ticket). To be honest, the husband next door scares me a little.... so I don't want to get him too mad... I just want him to STOP with his being inconsiderate. So the cop drove over and wouldn't you know that f**ker turned his music off right as the cop pulled up.

He's getting smart about it. I'm worried he's got a police scanner so will turn the music down every time I call the police. That leaves me looking like some kind of mental case.

Surely if it doesn't stop this is going to escalate. My fiance is about ready to go over there and whomp on him.... that's not going to end well for anyone. 

But I'm sitting over here like..... Two years ago you complained to me about my dog and I fixed it immediately. Now you want to play concerts at 2am and get aggressive when I ask you to stop? 

What to do?",17Jan2018,7
316,"Hi all,

Last year I was diagnosed with lymphoma. I have been through radiation once and so far it seems to have done a pretty good job. I need to get another PET scan soon to check that it isn't growing back, but so far I feel pretty good.

I understand that there are certain times that my health information needs to be shared, but is trying to sell me insurance one of those times? I am currently wondering whether to send a complaint to HHS or the hospital where I was treated.

318,"So i'm at a crossroads with my job at the moment. I've been working here for 3+ years (right out of college).

In short, i'm bored, there's very little advancement in this department, pay is OK, but i'm confident I can make more with my experience/education somewhere else. The benefits here are probably some of the best you'll find anywhere in the nation. Management here is extremely hard to follow. It's get with their program or get out. Turnover in this department has been about 60% this past year (terminations, people leaving, etc.)

With that said, I'm young in my career, and I know that I can do more. I'm just scared/too comfortable to leave. Should I stay at this job? Should I wait around to see if there's any advancement?

332,"I moved halfway across the country last year, and i'm not quite ready to go back yet.  But i worry about having less income, and less career prospects.

I got into commercial insurance about 3 years ago, I finished my Associate of Arts degree, stopped halfway through bachelors degree.  I'm 30 now. Spouse has no degrees.


I've been doing Account managing and marketing of commercial P&amp;C at an independent agency for two years. The entire commercial team is about 9 people. This is my only experience in the field.

Last year i moved from one of the major metropolitan areas in the U.S. to a smaller city several states away, the reason being family and personal. I have a spouse, pets, and no kids.

Was surprised when the company offered me to stay on the team and work remotely. I agreed to work remotely. At the time i had two good interviews out here in new state, but they didn't result in offers, then i stopped looking. Now i'm being told the agency i currently work for will be acquired by a larger multinational entity, which everyone has good feelings about. Am also told there will be lots of room for advancement.

I have Family on my side back in the first state where i grew up, and spouse has family in our present location. I have about 60 days from today to either move back to state 1 and take the gig, or stay here and find something else. I am the sole earner in our family. Housing out here costs less, and i still would like to explore the area more and have my spouse be near their family.

my current employers keeps reminding me that this is the best chance i will have in my life to get in with a good company with room for advancement, and i am sure that is true. I have applied for some positions out here in the meanwhile with no answers, but the commercial P&amp;C field is not as plentiful, and certainly will be paying lower with my experience. I am also looking into auditor or adjuster positions that would make sense as well.

At this point i see it as taking my current pay with probable career advancement if i move back to state 1, but rent will be 40% of my (our)income. Or take a possibly substantial pay cut with less room for advancement out here. I just hit age 30 and have no real assets to my name.

I quit and moved to a different company about 9 months ago. As soon as I left, an old co-worker from my first company started aggressively looking for new jobs to move away as well. 

Fast forward to now and a position opened up in my current company that my old co-worker would be good fit for. She didn't have much luck moving out as well from previous company. 

I talked to few people and said it'll be awkward to recruit from former employer into current company. Everyone told me it's not an issue since she's trying to move and I'm not poaching. 

My old co-worker got an offer in my new company. Suddenly old boss messages me and accused me of poaching and unprofessionalism. I reassured them I didn't ask them to join my new company and I can't be held responsible for their decisions. 

I am shareholder of previous company. My old boss rarely used to message/talk to me at old place even when we were in good terms.  I didn't sign any anti-solicit forms. 

Is there a chance I'll be taken to court? Is what I did wrong? I did put in a good word for the old co-worker as she's a good friend and we kept in touch.

342,"I'm posting this on a throwaway account, not that it would matter. Also, I apologize if this gets long winded, but I've made sure that every detail is at least somewhat important.

I'm a 24M and I'm still living at home with my parents. I don't have a driver's license and I've never had one. Also, I've never held a regular paying job in my life. In addition, but probably less important, I've also never had an SO in my life, and I've never been a ""friends person"". To top it all off, I'm also severely unmotivated. I feel all of that stems from a decision I made, which seemed reasonable for me at the time, but in reality just set me up for failure. As you'll see, my life to this point has been full of bad decisions and missed opportunities.

Let's start with high school. During high school, in my junior and senior years, I attended a technical school run by the school district. There, I studied architecture and engineering, two of my interests at the time. However, it was during that time that I developed an interest in radio broadcasting. As a result of online searching, I discovered a school in a major city a couple of hours drive from the town I lived in which offers a one-year program in broadcasting. Since my family was planning to move to that area shortly after I finished high school, I decided I could save money and time by jumping right in to a career. Another reason I decided this was due to some online videos I had watched which implied that college is a waste of time and money. Still a third reason for that decision was that even if I did go to college, my parents would insist on moving there with me and check on me every day. One of the elements of college is to get the experience of living away from home, and how could I possibly get that when my parents would want to move there with me? I should probably mention at this point that I have autism, but you wouldn't be able to tell unless I told you. So, going to that broadcasting program seemed like a good choice to me.

Three months after I graduated from high school, my family moved to the area of the school that I found. Shortly after we moved there, I enrolled at the school. The school was only a 20 minute drive away from where we lived, so my mom drove me to my classes. I started there in February 2014 and finished a year later. While at the school I met lots of nice people and got lots of hands-on experience in both TV and radio broadcasting. Up to this point, getting a driver's license was never a top priority of mine. However, after an instructor pointed out that having one is important to getting and keeping a job, it was a wake up call for me. But no matter how much I brought it up with my parents, nothing ever came of it.

The school I went to has career counseling services, so I felt I had a shot at a radio career. Unfortunately, the career counseling department only has connections in the state where it is located. About a month after I graduated from the school in April 2015, me and my family moved to where we live now, which is far away from the state we used to live in. Therefore, the career counselor couldn't help me much. In nearly three years of searching I have found no entry level broadcasting jobs in my area. Me, my mom, and a couple of people we know went to visit a radio station in a town about 15 minutes away. 

Shortly after we moved out here, considering I wasn't employed, my parents had me do volunteer work. Even though I was volunteering for free, something I didn't want to do, I had read that volunteer work looked good on a resume. I did that on and off for a couple of years until I got burned out late last year. Around that time, after no broadcasting jobs were to be found anywhere, I made the decision that my pursuit of a radio career was not working out. I then decided I needed to pursue a different career. I thought engineering or IT would be good. But I realized that you probably need to go to college to have any chance of landing a job in either field, and since I'm still paying off the student loans from the media school I went to, going into even more debt didn't seem like a good idea.

When the calendar flipped to 2018, things really started going downhill emotionally for me. This year will be the 5th anniversary of my graduation from high school, and if they decided to have a reunion I would probably find a way to go. For that reason, I decided to check on my high school friends on Facebook to see how they'd turned out. And boy, was I in for a massive wake up call. One is an engineer at a factory that make automotive parts. Another is a financial adviser at a financial planning institution. At least two are married. A few others work as nurses or medical technicians. A couple of others have joined the military. What all these people, except for the ones who joined the military, have in common is that they all went to some sort of college. It hit me like a ton of bricks. Just imagining having to go the class reunion, stare them all in the face, and telling them that I'm doing nothing was too much for me to bear. Lately, I've been crying myself to sleep pretty much every night, knowing that the people I graduated high school with have careers and lives of their own and I haven't even started mine yet.

So, here I sit at my computer, typing this. I feel that all that I wrote about above is all my fault. I should have gone to college. I shouldn't have tried to take a shortcut. And now, I'm paying for that decision every day. I'm doomed to live like this for the rest of my life unless something changes fast. I really have only four options; 1. Get a crappy dead-end fast food or retail job and waste away, 2. Join the military, 3. Go to college like I should have done and go into massive amounts of debt just for a piece of paper so that employers will like me more, or 4. Do nothing and waste away. I obviously don't want to take the fourth option.

I hate living like this, and I want out. How can I turn things around for the better for once?",17Jan2018,2
344,"I wrote a post about this a fortnight ago, and I will add the link at the. However, I will give you a short version here:

I probably haven't had a day where I've eaten properly since the summer of 2016. I started eating one meal every other day, and then I managed to increase to two meals per day. The summer of 2017 saw me going back to my old ways of eating only one meal per day. I December I went back to one meal every other day, but I also cut down on the size of meal; going from one proper meal to only a few sandwiches. At the beginning of the year, I decided that I had to go two days without eating food. I didn't manage to do this as I became dizzy and just didn't feel well at all. 

At this point, I now eat one normal meal every day. I drink cod liver oil every day, and I often eat bananas. 

Today, I told my psychologist all of this (in more details). I think she was shocked to hear how bad it was (I had informed her earlier that I don't eat much). She looked at me and just told me that she's worried about me. It felt good to hear her say that (again, she did seem a bit shocked to hear this)... but now I am thinking... Should I perhaps go see the doctor? I probably don't have to, but maybe I have deficiencies or something? I don't want to bug my doctor or go to her for something stupid. When writing this, it does seem sort of stupid to me. I mean, I'll notice if things get really bad. I haven't lost any weight. 

Ah... I guess I answered my question myself there at the end. I'll still share this, but will probably delete this soon.

I need some answers.

How can a 19 year old improve his life?

My life has been on a hold ever since I failed my final exams in June last year. I needed to get my shit together and pass the October resit, which I eventually did, but those 4 months in between have been very depressing, boring, repetitive and numbing to me and have given me a very grey view on life. I now wake up at 12PM and watch Netflix and Youtube, play games and repeat this the next day. I do go outside but don't really do much expect walk around in the city. I haven't seen most of my friends in a long time, haven't had any real female contact in over 3 months, haven't been to the gym since August and feel like I'm stuck in this feeling of constant boredom and numbness. I have been to a couple of parties and stuff but never felt any satisfaction from it.

I found out that I passed on 30 December and was relieved from the anxiety of my results, but now feel like there is no direction in my life until I start college in September. I know I am not depressed, because I can laugh and smile yet that ""feeling"" is always there and I don't know how to cure it without needing a girlfriend or material possessions. Even when I see others on social media it always leaves me feeling like something is missing, and I thought I had it until I failed my exams.

What can a guy like me do in these 8 months? Go back to the gym? Pick up a hobby? Get a job?
