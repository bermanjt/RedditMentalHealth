0,"I never drink, like ever, my buddies are drinking at a graduation party and everyone's having drinks but me, I'm the usual good boy who doesn't do anything. I never do because I've heard of people having health issues, and I've always steered clear of drugs/alcohol. I obviously know not to drive. Should I have some drinks or play it safe and not drink at all. What do you guys suggest?",08Jul2018,1
1,"I'm a 20 year old male. I just went out for a walk, and it's like almost every stranger I pass, they give me a funny look. Whether it's someone sitting on their porch, driving by, walking pass, etc. They look at me like something is wrong with me. It makes me extremely uncomfortable and ruins the walk for me. I don't know why people look at me like I have a problem. I struggle with social anxiety and am extremely self-conscious on how people look at me and what people think of me. I get nervous a lot when I'm out in public, but I'm trying to get over my anxiety.

I'm not a bad person, and I don't like how people give me weird looks like something is wrong with me.

How can I get over this problem?",08Jul2018,0
2,How bad would it be if I cut my eyelid and took it out? It’s relatively small but I’ve had it for a couple of years and grows in size or shrinks throughout time ,08Jul2018,1
3,"I've had a lot of turmoil over the purpose of my life. I've been in a depressive phase as long as I could remember. I think the meaninglessness set in rather young maybe around 7 or 8.

As I grew intellectually and contacted more and more knowledge the smaller I felt, as my experiences with various trauma made me bitter I reached for nihilism. For years I've let that infect me and reject the world and everything.

But slowly I've changed, I've started to accept the meaningless reality that I live in and embrace its freedom. I've chosen that no meaning, in reality, entails absolute freedom of choice, and so I've reached into myself looking for what desire is most like myself.

Of all my desires for companionship and various physical desires, I've found none of them to be adequate. None of them felt truly transcendent, but what I did find was one supreme desire.

That desire was self-perfection, to complete me was the goal afterall. My whole quest to find meaning was to complete who I am, and this desire is the truest form of meaning inside of me.

I purpose absolute freedom by perfecting myself in mind, body, and spirit. In the mind that means conquering the demons of the past, in the body it means complete control of my desires and physicality, and in the spirit it means transcending myself.

Each is connected to each other, and my current ambition is the perfection of my body. So I've been weight training and doing martial arts to improve my physicality, and I've been controlling and understanding my physical desires. 

I have an idea about what the mind entails, I feel an extreme disgust for evil. I've dealt with sexual abuse and physical abuse, and my mind only feels clear when I do not tolerate that kind of evil. It's self-righteous but I feel only myself when I confront the things that I hate so much.

As for how I will master my mind and spirit, I have yet to figure out it. But I know that by perfecting my body I will gain the willpower to master my mind and dominate my spirit. 

I do want to clarify that this is self-perfection for my own sake, and not for anyone or anything of gain. Ultimately my path is self-perfection with no doubt and fear. Any suggestions and thoughts on my goals?",08Jul2018,3
4,"A couple of months ago my moms coworker died, she was an AMAZING person and I was kind of close to her. We both loved a lot of the same things. After the funeral her siblings and friends all got tattoos to remember her (I think it was like 20 people that were there.... The tattoo shop got a lot of money that day lol). 



My mom ended up getting a tattoo a little bit after everyone else did and it was very surprising... She is NOT the type of person to get a tattoo. The artist did an amazing job. 


A couple days ago I had a dream where I got a cactus tattoo (the girl that died got me addicted to succulents). I've been thinking about it and asked my mom what she thought. All she said is that it would look cool and I need to be 18 ( ~6 months from now). 



I'm not 100% sure that I want it, I'm scared that I will end up regretting it in a couple years. Its going to be small so it wouldn't be too bad. 




I'm really bad at deciding things. 3 months ago I decided that I wanted a piercing for my 18th birthday, at first I wanted eyebrow, then changed my mind and wanted a septum... Then changed my mind again and again until I finally decided that I wanted a helix.

5,"“What did you say?”

“Huh?”

“What?”

“I didn’t hear a word you said!”

Every. single. day.

I don’t know what to do. Everyone says that I speak so quietly, almost in a whisper. Everyone says that I mumble, that what I say doesn’t make any sense. When I do “speak up” to the level where people can hear me, it feels like I’m yelling. 

I ask for help here because I don’t know what to do. I can’t tell that I mumble. I sound completely normal to myself. 

My family gets angry at me these days that they can’t hear me. My gfather gets so angry at me that he says that I’m the most difficult person in the world to talk to. It all makes me sad and angry and not want to speak it all. It makes me want to never talk again, and my anxiety gets to me and makes me think that I shouldn’t be around others at all.

I would really appreciate the advice. If I can’t tell when I am mumbling, how do I correct it? 

Thank you in advance.",08Jul2018,1

11,"Not that severe as other things on this sub, but I have an issue that started bothering me today. For a while, I've been staying low-key with my parents, so I have no idea why I've finally decided to tell them the truth.


Today, I attended a regatta and a buddy of mine had brought a large cooler filled with food. The cooler was meant for **all 7 rowers who attended**, and people were asked if they wanted any. Some refused and some took sandwiches. I was insanely hungry an hour later (long after people finished their food) so I ate 3 half-sandwiches (they were basically hamburger buns cut in half and made into sandwiches). I believe that there were OVER 10 WHOLE SANDWICHES IN THE ENTIRE CONTAINER, so I wouldn't be impacting anyone.


Now, here comes the fun part! It turns out that my mother had packed a sandwich in my bag without me knowing. When I arrived home, she was enraged and constantly told me how ""dumb"" and ""selfish"" I was for taking my buddy's sandwiches and not her's. That morning, she told me to ""eat the sandwiches""; however, I had also brought sandwiches for breakfast for the car ride to the regatta. I was NOT aware of the lunch sandwiches. 


My father obviously teamed up with her and agreed that I ""have no common sense"". He told me that I ""humiliated"" them and that he would have to apologize to my buddy's mother for ""taking other peoples' food"". Then, they both proceeded to ignore me and I could hear them talking downstairs about how I can't give them a peaceful life and how I will not be able to live properly in the future because I ""never listen to instructions"". 



Just a few minutes ago, my mother came into my room and asked me if I knew what I ""did wrong"" and if I was ""ready to apologize"".

12,"So was wanking, yeah I wank, judge me. Scrolling through Reddit and I find my cousin posting all these photos and videos of herself. Goes without saying that I stopped immediately and all Reddit porn has effectively been ruined for me, which isn't really a bad thing because porn in general is pretty terrible on many levels when you think about it.
I think she's been posting these things for over a year, don't know whether to tell any family members or to message her anonymously or whether to just stay the fuck out of it but I grew up with this girl so it kind of breaks my heart to see her exposing her body on the Internet like this (with her face in the video, and her name in her u/).

14,"My brother is a young sweet summer child. He's dating a girl who we shall call Gina. Gina is a sweet girl but her family. Whoo boy her family. 

Gina has an interesting family. They are BIG Christians. They are hypocritical though  They only got married because she became pregnant yet won't let Gina come over to our house SUPERVISED because they think my family is white trash. (we aren't. We live in a great neighborhood that's safe) Although, the dad is who we are having some issues with. 

He talks horribly about my brother. My brother is skinny and tall. Gina's dad calls him a ""p*ssy"" a wimp, and other disgusting names. My brother is in college, getting a really good degree in engineering and is so smart and funny. He's a comedian. He's charming. Honestly a great person. 

He's made my brother move furniture for them. Mow their lawn. All to impress Gina's family. My sweet summer child is a guest in their home. My brother cooks for Gina almost every night, drives her around, buys her flowers every week. Treats this girl like a queen. Yet her father only sees a boy whos skinny. 

I am infuriated. I'm a protective order sister and he refuses to let me talk to them. He loves Gina a lot. This is his first girlfriend. First love. I can't take it anymore. He comes home from their house heart broken and upset. But he refuses to do anything because he doesn't want to poke the bear.

And that there's a line that serves as a segway into the chorus about how it would all be fine if the woman wasn't beautiful (or something like that)

16,"My father is nearing 60 and I notice his memory is starting to get worse (both short and long term memory.)

My father: tends to conflate a lot of memories together even though these memories were years apart. He's a die hard soccer fan and I noticed he's forgotten many ""unforgettable"" games or completely mixed up the years that these games have taken place. Once or twice a week he gets into a fight with me and my brother for ""misplacing"" the home phone, remote, or house tools and they always end up being in a place that he put it in. Also, he forgets to turn off the lights in his room more than twice or three times a week. He tends to be on his phone a lot and when I try talking to him while he's on his phone, it takes him a good thirty seconds to snap out of it and respond to me and this is mainly after I lash out in frustation.

17,"I have been like this for a few years now and it seems to be getting worse. Whenever I want to do something that doesn't involve being on my computer and playing games or watching YouTube and etc, I pretty much always end up procrastinating. I want to start a consistent sleep schedule, like sleeping at 12 and waking up at 9, at least for the rest of the summer, but every single night I find myself acknowledging the time but keep telling myself ""One more video"" before eventually sleeping at around 2 am or 3 once I get bored. I have a want and all the resources I need for right now to be studying Japanese, but I keep telling myself I'll start once I get a good sleep schedule and study first thing in the morning, meaning I never end up studying. When I have homework from school, I always end up doing it last minute because even when I want to do it and get it out of the way, I found myself procrastinating and doing something more enjoyable. I attend one of the top 100 high schools in America, a college prep school, and so laziness is not an option, so once I start back up in the next school year, I feel like I'm going to be loaded down with work that I don't get to until it's too late and end up falling behind on grades. As to sleep schedules, I've heard and tried many of the popular methods people mention online. That is, reduce blue light from electronics, move your alarm somewhere where you have to get up to deactivate it, read a book before bed, turn off the TV, and so on. But the issues I have when it comes to those, besides the fact that I have the TV on for comfort and I don't enjoy reading, is that I could just as easily not do them and end up returning to the current status quo. 

In short, I can never seem to start or do anything I want to do, and severely procrastinate any chance I get and end up doing whatever I find easier, more enjoyable, or convenient. I can't ever seem to apply any changes to my life that would help me, and my laziness seems to grow each day, which I feel is lowing my quality of life and making me depressed when I go to think about what I'm not doing. So what I ask now is, does anyone have any advice aside from the standard ""simply just stop doing this or do this instead"" stuff that is just lost on me? Possibly anything about working with what I got and making the most? Thanks for anyone who reads this and offers any advice to me, it means a lot. ",08Jul2018,1

19,"Some background: My parents divorced when I was 5. My father moved across the street from my mom because they wanted to be apart from each other but wanted it to have as minimal of an impact on me as possible. It was a move that I didn’t think much of as a kid but I now see and appreciate what was done by my parents to maintain stable relationships with me. Things were great between everyone until I moved away to a new town with my mom. The move was due to me entering highschool but it wasn’t that bad either, only a 10-15 drive away. This is when things started to go downhill between me and my father. Everything turned into an argument, I was verbally abused by him and other people from his side of the family, and I became afraid of my father. I began skipping days I was supposed to stay with him and sometimes refused to leave my mothers house when he came to pick me up. Years of therapy couldn’t fix our problems either and at the age of 13 I was being represented by a lawyer in family court. I made the decision to have full custodial rights given to my mom and a restraining order was served to my father. Before I continue I just want to
Give a few examples of something that happened that lead to this point. One Father’s Day he gathered all the things I had ever given him, put it in a bag (cards and physical gifts) tossed it at me and said these exact words “I don’t want this it means nothing”. The final straw was when we were one day exiting a therapy session and when I refused to talk to him about what was discussed in therapy he began to chase me down the parking lot with his wife all while pushing his mother who is in a wheelchair. I told my mom to get her car and drive all the way down to pick me up because I knew I’d be able to outrun them. When she started driving he walked in front of her car, smashed the hood with his fist and began screaming at me and my mom. His mom then reached through the window and slapped my mom. Although no real damage was done to my mother (thankfully), I called the cops and had them deal with the situation. Four years have passed and the only “contact” I’ve had was when we spotted each other at a Gamestop and a restaurant. Today he sent my mom a number of texts saying “it’s over” “he’s my son I miss him so much” “I’m sorry”. When I was shown the texts I became angry and told my mom to block the number because I don’t want him or anyone from his side of the family in my life. This all leads back to my question. Is it okay to feel this way or should I feel guilty for shutting him out? I can almost guarantee a rekindling between us would only lead to more problems down the road. Any responses are appreciated as I do not feel comfortable talking to anyone I know about it :/

I need ideas on what to do with the money i'll get.

(Reading beyond the line is not necessary) ------------------------------------

So far, I've thought of generally increasing it by investing in a solid business and develop it (I had many great ideas regarding that but I lacked the funds).

Family is everything where i'm from (Kuwait) so i'm very much inclined to give my immediate relatives and, especially my father, a lion's share of the money. (don't question that it's practically mandatory or else I'll be slandered at every corner)

I thought of buying expensive items but what's the point of that beyond impressing people? It'll definitely become pointless after a while, is my thinking. I'm left to build fulfilling relationships with my tribe (yes tribe, we still have those). They say you feel empty after fulfilling yourself money-wise but i'm not sure of that. 

I see both opportunity and new experiences on the horizon. My dream has finally been realized but I am... conflicted? Why am I feeling that way is another question I do not know how to answer.

She claims she's happy with me, and I really do try my hardest to not be upset about how she finds fault in anything I say or do. It's getting difficult to deal with her constant complaining about aspects of her friend's lives she has nothing to do with, and she always has an attitude with me anytime I joke about things. 

She's absolutely in love with me and doesn't like to be without me, but everything is always about her. She always complains about anything I want to do and I'll make a sarcastic comment about it and she gets so upset.

25,"Long story short, I was drinking last night and ended up walking from one end of the city to the other, and when I woke up this morning in my hotel room my phone was nowhere to be found. My biggest concern at this point is that there are nudes of me on it, and obviously if someone was douchy enough to steal it then guaranteed those photos are going to find their way on the internet. I could care less for the device itself, honestly. The thought of some stranger having those photos is driving me insane with fear. I'm about to file a report online for theft and whatnot, and I have to wait till tomorrow to call my service provider. 

So, I have a number of questions I'm hoping someone can answer. For one, I've already deleted the photos from my iCloud, but does this mean that they will be removed from my phone as well? (I hope to god the answer is yes). I can't put it on lost mode or erase it right now because apparently its offline, and when I call it goes straight to voicemail. My guess is that its obviously run out of battery. So second, if someone has it and decides to charge it will I be able to track/erase it then? Does anyone have any other advice I could use to make sure nobody can see these photos?

I'm really hoping I just dropped it somewhere when I was drunk, or that the the hotel will be able to find it if I threw it somewhere stupid. Anyways, thanks in advance to whoever can help. ",08Jul2018,1

His mother never pursued him or sought out any kind of support from him and raised her two children on her own. Our family owns a few pictures of him and I have always noticed that my dad looks nothing like this man, although his older sister does. While cleaning out our house my mother and I came across some more pictures and a few newspaper clippings regarding my dad’s “father”. This sparked some curiosity and I researched this man and located him in a different state and found him on social media. The current pictures of him solidified that this man could not possibly be my dad’s true father. After some intense research I discovered that my dad’s mother was married once before she met my dad’s father. I then researched her first secret husband and found him on social media and the results were shocking. He looks exactly like my father, and their similarities are striking. Unfortunately, I also found that this man died last year due to brain and lung cancer. I have only told my mom about this and we are not sure if we should bring it up to my father and his mother. I am not sure if my dad will be upset to find out that he was an illegitimate child or will be upset that his mother never told him.

I feel bad quitting because of how it’s going to make him feel. Any advice would help, thanks.",08Jul2018,1
34,"(This is going to have to be split up into parts because reddit won’t let me post the whole thing.)

If this sounds poorly written, I am sorry in advance because i’m typing this off my head and writing as I go so it may seem like everything is all over the place and unorganized.

So, imagine me. 16, male, who does nothing but smoke weed and hangout with friends every day being as far from productive as possible. I am a pretty smart kid, but very immature and childish. My parents keep yelling at me cause I say i’m looking for a job but I haven’t got one since January, when I was supposed to get one. Here is the scenario of the past 3 1/2 years to show what has gone on and to help provide any details I guess. 
 
2015/2016: I was a freshman in high school. Wasn’t very productive with my time and played video games a lot. Took normal classes even though I knew I was more capable than that. As, Bs, and a D was on my report card. I knew after that year I was much more capable of that. Told myself I was going to do better next year. I found an interest in medicine during this year and that will be covered later.

2016/2017: Pretty alright year for me, I made some new friends and did not the greatest in high school. As, Bs, and a C+ on my report card. I knew I could’ve done better once again and pushed myself even more. Signed up for honors classes and 2 AP classes for next year. This upcoming year was very important for college and I knew that.

2017/2018: This year was quite the ride to say the least. Starting off this year I was very serious about what I wanted to accomplish for myself and kept myself to it at first. I should also mention that I was diagnosed with ADD over the summer and started to take Adderall to fight the disorder. I could tell that I was a much different person than I am now, and I’d like to say I was a better person then. I was much more focused on my schoolwork and finished the 1st nine weeks with all As and 2 B+. I was very proud of myself at that time and told myself that I would keep it up. That was at the beginning of November of last year. I started to find new people to hangout with once again and I felt like I was liked by them and I enjoyed hanging out with them because they were popular and did things that I had never done before. That was probably the worst thing I could’ve done looking back. These people smoked and drank all the time which led me to start doing those things with them. I smoked weed for the 1st time on November 19, 2017 and I hated it the smoke but I really enjoyed the high. I didn’t smoke for a whole month and tried it again. Then, I finally bought my own weed for the 1st time 2 weeks later. This was probably the worst purchase I’ve ever made. I should get back on track and say my grades started to slip when I started hanging around these people. Eventually, I started to buy weed more and care more about smoking. Eventually my grades hit an all time low and I skipped a bunch of days. Horrible choices. I told myself I needed to change for the better. I ended up figuring out myself and I was sure that I was depressed, the cause I have yet to figure out to this day. At this same time that I was figuring out myself my good friend and my childhood “friend” who lives across the street stopped hanging out with me. I thought not much of it and moved on. I eventually started hanging out with another childhood friend who has made a lot of bad decisions and has been arrested. I don’t know why I hangout with him even now to this day. He’s a smart guy and smoked a lot of weed so I decided to hangout with him more. As I started hanging out with him I was improving my grades. Eventually, we got fine with eachother again and I started going over there every day to smoke. My grades dropped and I didn’t do anything about it until the last 3 weeks of school. I finished the year with all Bs and a D+ in AP computer science. I hated that class and know that I will not major in it haha. Now I go over there everyday during the summer while I could be studying for the SAT or working and ask myself, why do I go over here everyday and be unproductive?

To add context to all of that, my dream is to be a sports medicine or orthopedic surgeon and I know I have to put in the work to achieve that. I am prepared to work towards it starting right now but I can’t seem to find the motivation to do that. I can’t seem to find the motivation to do a lot of things nowadays, and it’s starting to really hit me. I need to grow up. I need to mature. I want to be the best, most productive person I can be. And i’m asking you, Reddit for some help. Anything you say is greatly appreciated and even if it is negative, I will read it and take it for what it is. Time doesn’t stop for anything and I need to get my shit together before it’s too late. Thank you.

The only thing I can do that I enjoy is talk to people. I'm a big people person. Other than that I have the skills to flip burgers for the rest of my life. 

I have these sudden bursts of motivation where I lay off the drinking and smoking, I get back in the gym, and I am overall very positive and outgoing and looking towards my future. Than it'll dissipate and I'll be depressed, lonely, terrified of my future and a feel a ton of shame over the things I've done in my past and guilt over squandering what potential I do have. 

I guess I'm just looking for a lot of redditors who can relate to share their experiences and maybe what they did to push on through the bad times and figure out a career that they enjoy and keeps them going.

45,"Hey,

First of all this is hard to write, as I'm sure it is with most on this subreddit.

I'll try to give a full story, and background to where everything is as well as how I feel about it.

My  group of friends, and I all met around 10 years ago. Our families lived  abroad, and we all went to the same school. We became friends and  hangout together, with some of us leaving and some of us staying.

We  all stayed in touch over the course of high school, till we got to  college. At this point we started a gaming group on discord, and hangout  pretty frequently. We would game, and talk about anything and  everything. Constantly being there for each other as a system of  support. Over the next few years we would visit each other when we  could, and would try in vain to get us all in the same place. This  wouldn't happen however till I got engaged last year.

I invited my group of friends to be my groomsmen, and asked one to be my bestman.

Lets  call him Dan. Now Dan and I became closer over the course of the past  few years but weren't too close before the group started.

My fiancee and I planned our wedding, and set days we would like everyone to come to prepare for it.

The year goes by and they all get into  town to enjoy a few days before the wedding while taking time to prepare for it.

The trip is going well, and we are all enjoy ourselves until the night of my bachelor party.

As we started to head home, and settle down in the car Dan started falling into a crisis.

When we got back to my place, and had some drinks he opened up to all of us on his ongoing battle with depression.

We spent hours consoling him, and trying to help him grab some perspective on his situation to no avail.

The conversation dipped into Dan saying we were not as intelligent as him, and could not possible understand him.

The longer it dragged on would only make him become more belligerent.

After locking up all the alcohol, and having enough of him tearing apart me and my friends we called it a night.

Instantly he was remorseful of the situation, and the next morning embarrassed.

However we let him know it was okay, and that everyone had drunk moments.

Instead of becoming mad, and bitter we decided to wrap around him and show support.

The  day of my wedding this was a similar scene, instead of us talking about  the day or how nice to was to be together we would focus on comforting  him.

Spending hours telling him that he  would not be left out, and included into everything we did. That we  would try to help out, and comfort anyway we could regardless of the  miles.

In two days they would all head back to the respective cities, and back to their lives.

We  talked a few weeks later, rejuvenated on our group friendship and  committed to always seeing each other together. That no matter what we  would not leave someone else, or have them feel left out.

Two weeks later, we were on a call and decided to start planning out next trip together.

Dan was very set on visiting the other two friends on 8/9, and wanted to see if we could set that up.

I looked up tickets, and saw I wouldn't be able to afford a plane ticket on this weekend and was hoping to set up another time.

Our other two friends agreed, and wanted to talk about in a week or so to setup another time.

As this was winding down I found out I could fly there on 8/22 and asked if this was a good time for everyone else.

Dan, and our friends agreed that this might work, and decided to come back to it in a week to pick out a good time.

After this transpires, my wife and I head out to a family event for a week.

We have fun with family meeting her for the first time, and limited cell service.

On our third day there, we head into town where we once again get cell service.

To my surprise, I find that Dan booked his tickets and would be flying out to visit our friends on 8/9.

Immediately I am upset, and astounded that he blatantly ignored our group, and my wishes.

While  we have scattered back and forth, he goes from flat out denying he ever  knew about 8/22 to that he was having a hard time and wanted to just go  visit him.

At no point does he  understand the hypocrisy of this situation, and days of convincing him  he would not be left out of trips or events.

We  finally talk today and I explain that I can no longer trust him, that  he does not care about me or how I feel about being left out. He put a  priority on what he wanted over the group, and was hoping that I as well  as the group would let it go. The truth is that I didn't want to let it  go, hypocrisy is one of my biggest pet peeves and to see one of my best  friends do this cut me deep. Dan's lack of care, or consideration of  anyone but himself really got to me, and is still bothering me.

I told him the truth of how I felt, and that I (for the time being) could not continue my friendship with him.

He was upset, but ultimately doesn't understand that actions will speak volumes over his words.

I feel guilty that I can't get over this, but also slightly proud of myself for not just letting this go.

For the most part I try to be relaxed, and a chill friend who is empathetic and helpful.

However, I feel like this might be a boundary I need for my own sake.

Part of me even hopes that this might be good for both of us, that we will both improve.

The other part of me feels terrible though, that it went down this path.

Now I am facing pressure from my other friends to work it out for the sake of our group.

They are aware that this 'isn't cool' and he should have waited but they don't want to see our group parted.

I'm unsure of how to really proceed. I have been transparent, and shown where I think this should go.

However, I have quickly become the 'bad guy' for wanting distance, and seperation from Dan.

Which I think I'm honestly entitled to, and should be able to do.

Thank you to anyone who read this far, it means a lot.

I feel lost, and deeply hurt but have tried to remain positive, and more objective.

I just feel this might be the breaking point, since now my trust is completely gone.

Sorry for all the grammar issues! I have an issue of putting comas all over the place whether they belong their or not.

Hope you all have a wonderful, and healthy year!",08Jul2018,1
46,"I have a really cool idea for a story and I wanna make it into an actual final product. I have plenty of experience with fiction writing, as I took a bunch of creative writing classes in highschool and college and did very well, but I'm also a huge comic/graphic novel fan. Problem is, I can't draw anywhere near the detail I would want it to be. And the amount of time it would take to learn is just not a possibility for me right now. So my question is, should I just go solo and write it as a novel even though its not 100% what I want?(I don't hate the idea of a novel or anything, just a detailed graphic novel would be way cooler imo) Or should I risk trying to find a good enough artist that would work for free and not try to completely derail or take the story from me?",08Jul2018,1

My life seemed to be headed in the right direction, then it didn't, then it didn't again and now it's worse than it's ever been before. 

5 years ago I left NYC and joined the Air Force, due to a troubled family past of physical abuse. Things were good. 2 Years in I was successful in my training, I was even married to the girl of my dreams, then they weren't. I was forced to separate from the military with a General Discharge. I had about $10k in debt due to furnishing a new house, and just being plain bad with finances. I had no where to go back to in NYC, especially w/o a job, so my wife and I moved to the Seattle area where she's originally from.

My wife's parents took us in, helped us get back on our feet, which we did. I landed a Warehouse job, worked hard, and quickly moved up into a promotion making about $45k/yr. Over the course of a year living with them we managed to pay off all of our outstanding debts, and even save up enough to move out.

After being married for 3 years, my wife asked me for a divorce. I was blind sighted, things were good and getting better for us, I was so confused and all she told me is that she's at a point in her life where she needed to be single. This devastated me. She moved out and shortly after I found a roommate to help w/ rent, which runs me $1500 monthly.

The divorce really impacted my work performance. I was more on edge than I had ever been. I felt so alone. 3000 Miles away from most of my friends, no one to really connect with, except my two cats, who have honestly been a life savers. After being divorced for nearly a year, last week, I was terminated from my job. 

I have nothing in savings, racked up another $4k in credit card debt. I'll have about $2.5k in my checking account after I receive my last paycheck which will include my vacation days paid out. My lease expires in a month and I have no idea what to do. I have no advanced education, and to top it all off I also have a GED. I've been applying for jobs on multiple platforms, indeed, craigslist, monster with a few call backs. I have no idea where I'm going to live in a month, what will happen to my cats or my possessions. 

I'm hurting so bad, I feel hopeless, and suicidal thoughts have been creeping in. I don't know what to do. I've been dating an amazing girl for almost 2 months now. Things again were looking like they might turn around for me, then I lost my job but now I feel like a burden.

So I forecasted that in 6 months or so I will have enough money to get me a Gynecomastia surgery.

I haven’t checked a doctor specifically but I plan to do it as soon as I’m half way in the process of getting all the money.

The truth is that I’m embarrassed of my family knowing that I’m going to invest a substantial quantity of money in something that they consider “unnecessary” and that I should just suck it up.

Would it be dangerous to go on my own to a doctor and asses the situation by myself and everything? Considering that no one else would know it and that I would keep it as a secret? 

I fear that something will go wrong with the surgery and i will have to talk with my family about it...

56,"I am currently 34, male, and happy. I have a good job and education and am on a good happy trajectory.

When I was a kid I am pretty sure I was abused, but maybe it was just life. It doesn't effect me a lot anymore other than occasionally dwelling on negative past events and being susceptible to gas lighting.

Without going too far into the story here's what I've had in my past.

From about 10-19 I lived with my parents, I was severely underweight. I had 3 siblings, who all made fun of me for wasting food. Personally I felt that my dad would control what I ate and when so my only option was to not eat to avoid the control. He would often tell me that I wouldn't eat something when I wanted to and take it away from me. In public he would tell servers/parents/teachers that it was my problem and that I wouldn't eat unless certain rules were followed. He would also go up to servers and say ""I will pay you $20 if you get x food for him because he won't eat otherwise."" Knowing that this would embarrass me. They wouldn't let me go to the gym but denied it. Anytime I brought it up they would deny it and put it on me. There was a lot of gas lighting in general, and the response was always ""You have no idea how hard it is to get you to eat."" Once I moved out, I quickly gained up to a normal healthy 20 year old male weight, and started going to the gym, eating more, and became pretty fit and muscular. When that happened my dad would ask my brother ""What did you do to get him to eat healthy?"" Because he could never admit that I was the one who wanted to be healthy.

I don't remember him ever touching me. He did once bust open my bedroom door with a hammer when I locked myself inside because I didn't want to see him. My mom came in, asked me what I had done, and when it was obvious that it was my dad's fault she told me to ignore it. Later, I asked them to repair the door lock but they never did, and when I brought up that my dad hit it with a hammer they both told me that it didn't happen.

There were multiple incidents like that, but that was always the worst one. My mom always told me to ignore it and then pretended it didn't exist. One time it was really public when I went away to college and my dad wanted me to sign up for classes in front of him, in a public orientation even though I had already done so online. He needed me to do it at his command and to know when and where my classes were. The proctor came by and asked if I was okay and people around me realized what was going on but didn't know how to help. Again my mom told me to ignore him.

I think my siblings know, two of my siblings also tried to control my eating. One of them did it to me years later, but I was out on my own and had no reason to follow what he said so I kind of ridiculed him in front of everyone else, but no one addressed what was happening. Since then, everyone has acted like it was never a problem.

I've really hated my dad my whole life, but kept a close relationship because he helps me with money. I'm not independent and have moved past it, but am wondering if I even need to address it.

Since then, I have been in many gas lighting relationships at work and with friends. I had a boss that gas lighted me really badly when I was in my early 20's, but currently I am fine.

I also allowed the gas lighting and seeking out bad friends to lead to a time when I was raped about 2 years ago. Again, it doesnt bother me and I barely think about it.

Should I go down the hole of addressing it, or since I am happy and healthy should I just move on having survived?",08Jul2018,2

60,"Hi, first off I'd like to say sorry if the title might be clickbait, I couldn't think of a better way to word it. Also, I'd like to say sorry if this is not the right sub reddit to post this on, I'm also going to post it on r/sex 

Just a heads up, this is a pretty long post, so please bear with me. 

My name is Jordan, I just graduated high school about 2 months ago.  First off I'd like to just straight up say what my issue is and why I have a problem with it. I have an addiction to porn. I remember I first looked at it when I was in 4th/5th grade, I would give an exact time but those two years were spent with the same teacher and classmates so it's hard to determine what happened in which grade. I have been looking a porn for around 8 years now. I have talked to my mom about it, as awkward as it is, but she is currently undergoing a masters program as a counselor so she has a pretty good understanding of these types of problems. I've also talked to my pastor and a couple of his friends who also went through the same problem as I am going through, only for them it went into their marriage and almost destroyed everything. 

The reason I have a problem with it is quite weird. I dont know if other people also experience this but it's just what I feel before, during, and after looking at it. I'm going to be real here, we all know why you look at porn. And we all know what goes on during the act. 
I always get this urge to look at it, I dont know why, it's as if it's all I can think about once it crosses my mind. So, of course I try to ""settle"" the urge and in the moment of course I like it. But afterwards I feel absolutely disgusting. I feel ashamed with the fact that I did that, it's hard to explain but it hurts me emotionally and mentally every time I do it. 

I'd like to just say incase anyone was thinking, this has nothing to do with religion. I am a Christian. I have looked to God for help, but nothing as come of it. I'm not making this post in regards to religion. Dont think of this as a religious issue. I'm not hoping for religious advice although I would definitely not mind it. 

So, I guess what I really want advice on is how to stop with my addiction. It is hurting me emotionally and mentally, as it has been for nearly 8 years. I've tried stopping multipul times, but the longest I've gone was a month.

Depending on how people comment I might also add a little bit of myself that also goes with why it hurts me to have this addiction, but of course it depends on the type of comments I get. 

Thank you for those of you who have made it this far in the post. I've been wanting to get help for so long, but everytime I ask for help on this issue online people dont care or dont see a problem. So I'm coming to reddit for help. So please comment, even if it is not exactly helpful, I'll take anything I can get. 

Thank you for your time. ",08Jul2018,2

I have been far too long confined in this apartment and I really wanted to try to meet new people that could maybe save me from this current pitiful state of existence - I just don't know how seeing I'm a shy 17yo girl who doesn't really like alcohol and clubs.",08Jul2018,1
64,"I'm an 11th grader not in the US, and I'm having a hard time with grades, choosing higher education, and life overall.


A bit of background about my school I'm currently attending, it's private, you have to pass an exam and an interview to get accepted. Its curriculum is 100% dedicated to prepare you for our country's equivalent of SAT, so it crams the 3 year high school curriculum into 2 years and spend 12th grade solving practice tests and stuff like that. 
Also, we have to get to school by 7:40 AM, and actually leave the school gates at 9:55 PM. Regular classes end at around 4 PM, and after that, you have to study on your own until the end. 

Ever since I entered high school, I barely studied, and instead played alot of video games. This semester's mid term exam, I actually placed 269th of 269 students in calculus, and almost all other subjects except for English is in the mid 200th places. 

But to be honest, I kinda became numb about bad scores, and my parents keep urging me to study.

I actually tried to study during after school hours(in my school, classes ends at 4 pm, and you study by yourself until 10, and its mandatory), but its impossible to catch up with school curriculum, because teachers, especially math, just zoom through the books super super fast, so I pretty much gave up.

So the only thing I do is wait until its weekends so I can play video games.

And I've been constantly thinking about why I would need to go to college, and what am I going to do in my life, and that didn't help either.

So my mind is half worried about going to college, and half is like, ""grades aren't going to follow me to the grave, fuck it"".

The reason why I'm actually worried about college is because everyone expects you to go to a ""decent"" college in our capitol, Seoul, and they consider all other colleges outside of it, ""some trash nameless college"". And to go to such college, you have to be within about top 11 percent of all the students who took the SAT. I myself have zero regards about having to go to a named college, but my parents especially think its a must to go to a good college.

I don't know how I should untangle my problems. Looking back at what I've written, it seems like a generic case of a student who is lazy as fuck, and plays too much games. If anyone faced a similar problem, I would appreciate any advice, motivation, or anything whatsoever.

65,"I feel so insignificant. I know I'm pretty but that seems like the only thing I like about myself and I tend to put so much worth into that one aspect of me. Truth is I just can't live with the real me.... Everyone irl likes me but I feel like it's because they don't know me, and like it's in my power to screw it up at any moment. Like I could just curse or hurt someone... Even if I'd never wanna do such a thing it feels like I can. Whenever I get a thought or feeling I don't like I always have to cleanse it away with mental rituals and I'm so sick of it. No one seems to care and I don't know how to fix it. I do these rituals so much and I can't even speak normally because of it. I always remember everything even remotely wrong I did, overthink it to the point I feel like I gotta pay for it, even when I didn't mean to act out of line or hurt anyone. I feel like a selfish idiot trying to talk to people irl and I just don't know what to do anymore. The only time I'm happy is playing video games or online when I don't notice my problems as much. I know I come off as manipulative but I don't know what to do anymore. I don't understand anything that's going on. ",08Jul2018,0
66,"Alright boys &amp; girls. I just need to make sure I'm not crazy. Let me know what you think. Keep in mind, I don't have social media, I prefer person-to-person, and I have my phone people can text/call me on.

* Friend of 9 years
* Have hung out, gone to conventions with, gamed together; typical friendship
* Friend goes off to college (I had just graduated)
* Sporadically meetup whenever; keep in touch

So something bad happened in my life

* Father diagnosed with cancer
* Friend knows how close my dad &amp; I are
* Let them know I'm good, don't worry about it
* Father passes away
* Friend suddenly stops texting/keeping in touch
* Friend still... hasn't reached out to say hello or anything

So I have nothing to lose, and call them out

* ""Hey, you haven't talked to me in a while; whats up?""
* Excuses about being busy and what not. 5 seconds to call/text ""hey thinking of ya"" is VERY difficult to do it seems.
* I ask ""well how come you haven't asked how I'm doing? or my dad?""
* Keep in mind, my father had passed away 6 months earlier at that point.
* Friend's response? ""why are you acting like a woman?""
* ""I'm just asking why you haven't kept in touch; just a little strange. Do you care to ask how I or my dad is doing?""
* ""no i dont""

So I send a message that states hey, don't ever speak to me like that, next time to reach out to me better be an apology.

* 1.5 years go by
* Person reaches out and says [""You told me not to talk to you until I had a proper apology""](https://ibb.co/mnQie8).
* Friend wants to apologize at a convention located conveniently close to where they live (and not me)

6 more months go by

* I send a message
* ""Hey, I'm back in the USA; you said you wanted to talk""
* She calls, agrees, and we set a time and date (Today @ 2:30pm) since I'll be done ice-skating and we'll have all day to chat
* She then begins to tell me about a trip of hers and I interrupt and say, ""hey, tell me it on Saturday, I have to go.""

Fast forward a week to today, the day of the apology

* Get a text message ""We still good for today?""
I've done nothing to lead this person to believe otherwise...
* I get the following message, [""So im out w peeps rn, but ill be free around 3-4ish""](https://ibb.co/ctPUmo)
* This person calls and says ""were you serious about your text message?""
Yes...
I call them out and say ""what is your problem? you clearly don't respect me or my time""
""hey man, i dont think i want to apologize anymore; i feel you aren't going to be respectful""
...

* They twisted the point-of-view to play victim




I don't get it ... what in the fuck is wrong with this person? Am I unreasonable? I mean a few YEARS have gone by so things have changed. Having the courage to admit you're wrong and setting up a day to apologize is very noble, but to twist it around and play victim... when you setup the time/date... and then renege... when it's convenient for you...


Just fuck man... dead to me has taken on a whole different meaning.

67,"I like my company. Been with them for several years. They’ve really taken care of me. 

9 months ago there were some promotions and movement within the company and I now have a new manager.  

It’s been a nightmare. She’s unaware of her tone of voice. Gets defensive at the drop of a hat.  Misses social cues. Interrupts constantly.  Misinterprets or simply doesn’t understand things that are said. Micromanages everyone.  And operates at about 600 mph making tons of mistakes along the way.  A spastic mess hanging on by a thread. 

I feel very disrespected on a daily basis.  I’m good at my job.  I’m efficient and observant and very good at retail sales. Unfortunately she’s caused my anxiety to go thru the roof.  I’ve completely quit drinking coffee. Stopped smoking weed.  Gone from sometimes meditating to twice a day meditation.  I’ve read over 1300 pages on emotional intelligence. 

While doing research on emotional intelligence online I came across the story of Phineas Gage who lost a large portion of his front left cortex in a freak railroading accident. This caused his personality to change and ultimately he lost everything due to the repercussions from his accident.  

I remember my manager telling me she was in a bad traffic accident when she was 19. She has a scar above her left eye from it.  I’m no doctor but her behavior reads like the result of a brain injury.  

I really don’t want to quit but I don’t see many options. God I really don’t want to quit....  But I am miserable.  Anyone have experience along these lines? I tell myself that she’s not responsible but it’s hard to smile when someone is creating drama out of thin air for no reason at all.

68,"Hello everyone, I have just joined the world of Reddit today, it's pretty big. Anyways, the main reason why I joined is because I as an individual feel like I am doing something wrong in my life and I just need some advice on improving it. To start, I am currently in my early 20s, male and live at home with my mother in NY. I work at a crappy place, but at least I am going to college. I have just graduated with an associates degree, and am currently working on attaining my bachelors within the next couple of years. A bit of a vague background on my mother, she has a great high paying job, and pays for most things in the house. I am paying for my school via student loan, as well as the phone bill and car. She likes to constantly spend money on expensive clothing and plastic surgery. I needed a car to use to get to school, so she helped me by leasing a new Land Rover that I can use daily. ( I know it's an overkill to drive such a car, I wanted to buy a cheap used Toyota 4runner but she insisted on something nice. ) So now I am paying $1000 a month for the car lease, gas and insurance. I don't want to be a spoiled brat and let her pay for everything since it wouldn't be fair, so I insisted on helping her to pay for the car. I help around at home by doing chores and do things like buy groceries, help her run her errands. She works a lot and comes home late, and I respect that as she is a busy woman. But lately she been saying things such as I am useless and that I don't do anything with my life, she compares me to my friends who make more money than I do, but also live at home with their parents like I do. She has this crazy idea of getting a separate apartment that she will live in closer to her work and I will live in the current one. She plans to pay for both places, that would obviously be very expensive. I really try my hardest to help around much as I can. I am barely at home myself. I am mostly at work and then at school. Once I get my bachelors, then hopefully the car lease will be over and I will pay off my student loans quickly. After that, I plan on leaving NY and move elsewhere and try to lead a normal life. Am I doing something wrong guys? Am I a spoiled brat? Living in NY is hard and I couldn't manage to live here on my own here. I just want some ""adult"" advice on what I should I do. Thanks a lot!",08Jul2018,2
69,"It sounds pathetic, but sometimes I only find out because of something on the internet. 

Sometimes I feel like I'm just this incapable weirdo, but my parents never taught me these things. 

Some examples.. not changing my bed sheets in months, until I read something that said otherwise. So I googled it and it's supposed to be once a week..

Another, apparently I'm supposed to scrub the shower? I've never done that before. 

I vacuum very rarely and only recently realized I'm supposed to do that more often.

I'm sure there's many more things I'm missing. Was I supposed to just figure everything out on my own? I feel gross. I'm going to be a legal adult in less than a year and I feel like a 5 year old :/

My parents just didn't everything for me when I was younger than 13 or so. Now the only thing would be driving me somewhere when I need to, and buying a few things I can eat. They leave me to do whatever. I'm not sure if that's normal either. I could probably go do something dangerous and get a shrug lol. 

But I digress.. I'm not sure how to learn how to do the things I'm supposed to do with no one to teach me. Yes, I've brought this up to my parents before. My mom just responded with something like ""it's not our responsibility to baby you through everything"".

70,"I’ve been cut off from playing video games and social networking with a few exceptions. They made this change suddenly when they assumed I was addicted to playing video games. I explained to them that I was trying to get better at the video games just to catch up with my friends. They wouldn’t listen.

They also tried to put a tracker on my phone.

They forced me into therapy, claiming that it will unlock my potential or whatever. The therapy made me worse and they blamed videogames, when really, the therapy that wasn’t working took up a lot of my free time, which meant less hobbies which means fewer emotional outlets which means worse depression for me.

I have a serious sickness, and the principal told me that when I am feeling like it is getting really bad to go home, and I followed those rules. My parents accused me of ditching school to come home and play video games, which of course is not the case.

72,"So I've messed up massively.

I've since retaken that class and got A, but I've just now learned that my dad's been sending the transcripts to our medical insurance provider, as proof of me being a full-time student.

Now yes, I've taken at least 12 units each quarter, and am taking 8 during the summer, but I did still fail that class, which technically put me at 8 units earned that first quarter, but in total I do hit average mark of 12 units a quarter. I also don't know if they've got a GPA requirement for satisfactory academic progress, but I should be fine in that area. I'm in a terrible situation since this is quite literally fraud. We haven't received a response from my insurance, but I'm expecting it. I'm not sure what to do right now. I just didn't want to go through another ordeal like the one from my AP class.

77,"I'm a 21 y/o female and I've been working my  part-time job as a retail sales associate for the past 2.5 years. My  coworker, lets call him ""J"", started just after me and we've been  working together for 2 years.

Last summer, we both had the same all-week availability so we had lots of shifts together. Things started off casual and friendly between us but slowly things progressed to being more teasy/flirty at work. We'd  always joke around and make fun playful comments and jokes about the other.

J started messaging me on Facebook last summer too, and we went about 2 months straight just  talking. Again, quite flirty but we also had decent conversations on  topics (school, future plans, our work gossip, etc). It was really nice  and I think that was what got us even closer. However, the contact died down once fall semester rolled around last september of 2017.

Now,  ever since about the end of our year of Uni (late April), we've both  been at work more and the contact has started up again. We started  Instagram dm'ing after he reached out a month ago and was like ""I've  really missed seeing you at work!"" and we started up a really nice  conversation from there. We talked on Instagram for about 2 weeks  straight. Then after a shift we had together last weekend, he messaged  me and gave me his number so we could just text instead to make things  easier.

We've been texting daily for  about 10 days and its been extremely flirty from both our ends, and I'm  honestly really enjoying it, its super fun. He compliments me, says how  I'm such a good worker &amp; the nicest &amp; funniest person he's met,  etc etc. He says things that imply we both should hang out soon &amp; go  get drinks even (my initiating), how he hopes our hangout is ""sooner  than later"", and how he loves every shift he has with me. But things  aren't really ""set in stone"", because bottom line we are still  coworkers. (My work has a policy where coworkers can't have romantic  relationships).

I kinda realized a few weeks ago that damn, I'm really into J. Like as in, I'd happily  date him, hook up with him, go out and do shit with him, whatever. I  just really am into him haha. I can only assume he at least feels the  same way based on all the indications, and I know he finds me attractive  at least (as he's complimented me on some instagram pics of myself  before. Our texts have gone from flirty to slightly sexual-flirty. 

Today we worked together and he finished his shift before me, but he came back about an hour later and surprised me with an iced coffee; like he legit clocked out, went to the coffee shop, bought me one and came back to our work to give it to me/hang around for like 10 minutes and chat. We texted after my shift and I said how ""I definitely owe him""....and things got extremely sexual from there, as he basically indicated we hook up as a return favor LOL (which I'm totally down for, the sexual tension between us is high).

So we've finally decided to have a typical netflix &amp; chill night to binge-watch The Office, and drink alot. And we both basically know its gonna lead to us hooking up.

My question is....is this a smart move? I still have time to back out, but I'm so into him &amp; I think sneaking around and lowkey hooking up outside of work would be so fun. My only concern is that our fellow coworkers may find out if he decides to share with any of them (a few of them are his guy friends from University). 

I know I likely won't be staying much longer at this retail job as I am almost done my Undergraduate program (going into my 4th year), and will be moving away to Master's school after I graduate, so I don't run the risk per se of us ending our ""fwb"" and still have to see each other at work for a while.

Should I go for it? Or will this just end messy &amp; is it too risky for us?",08Jul2018,1

But it isn’t and for some reason every time I do something that makes me feel good and happy I just end up thinking about her and how better it could be if she was still with me.

80,"The problem is with me is I'm a colossal failure, but it isn't by just naturally being shit at everything, Its a habit, and choices I have developed and made that I can't do anything right. Objectively I have a lot of things people could kill for, I guess I am pretty smart, I can learn things quickly if taught the right way and have a great knowledge and interest about the world we live in, its history, the science behind it, philosophy, all that. In fact I know so much that I now find it relatively hard to come across new information. I am very attractive, tall, and fit, have very good genes. I get a lot of attention from women because of my looks, get catcalled, waved at, smiled at, you name it. The biggest problem with me is I find it hard to believe in myself and always seem to get into trouble no matter how hard I try not to, and I am very afraid of success.

I had a rough childhood, growing up in a lower class single parent family with my mum having to work hard to put food on the table, living off the benefit, all my dad did was pay child support and hardly spent time with me. All the parents knew me for how much of a little shit I was, one parent even moved their kid to a different school because he kept hanging out with me. All my teachers couldn't be bothered with me because I was such hard work, only a few actually gave it their best and didn't give up on me, I guess because they saw my 'great potential' as they always said I had. I let them down by not applying myself, instead getting angry or being a smart-ass to them. I dropped out of school because I believed I was shit at it and couldn't achieve anything even if I tried my very best. I got 50 credits last year from the required 80, I didn't even go to half of my classes and skipped all the time, so that is really good objectively. I moved to my dads when I was 14, only 8 months later I got kicked out because he didn't want to deal with me. Ever since then I have been on the youth benefit going from course to course house to house, getting kicked out of another house and near getting kicked out of another. I am still a little shit, commit petty crimes like petty theft, vandalizing, trespassing, I haven't been caught by the police, because I have the ability to be cunning and smart. I have never had a girlfriend because every girl that has ever liked me, and there has been a lot. I had been extremely rude to because I felt like they were taking the piss out of me because I used to think I was ugly. More recently, have ignored and not gave in to their advances because I am afraid of affection and love, I don't know why, maybe I wasn't shown it much as kid or am afraid of letting a significant other down or that I just cant be bothered with the chore of having a girlfriend. I'm still a virgin although if I wanted to I could have lost it easily already. I act like I am tough and have no emotion. I tell people I am emotionless and don't give a single fuck about anything at all, but really I am hiding my sensitive nature. Deep inside I am a very sensitive person, and I guess I am probably a really sweet person too, but I can't show that else people take advantage of me. Also being a dude, society places expectations on us to be tough and strong, so being sensitive for a man is a no no. I get that though, strong men and women, usually men build strong societies. Some good, some bad, but all strong.

The reason why I am such a failure, is mostly by habit of choice, I choose to not care and not apply myself, not follow the rules and not give a fuck. I have now done it so many times that it has become a habit and now it seems to come naturally. I don't know how to fix it because I have been doing it so long its hard to break. I am now in a pit of depression and loneliness, I smoke a lot of weed to escape the pain, whenever something stressful happens I go home and smoke a cone, that has now become a habit too. I have come a long way however, a few years ago, I was so deep in my own insecure delusions 'KNEW' I was ugly, I 'KNEW' I was stupid, I 'KNEW' I was never going to amount to anything. Now I actually have realized I have potential, but now I'm stuck with the choice of repeating myself over and over, which I don't want to do but at the same time it is all I know. Or I can make something of myself, and live up to my full potential. The problem is I have a really bad habit of fucking everything up and its hard to break, so hard I have given up making something of myself because the habit it too hard to break. Sometimes I talk myself into the 'I'm ugly, useless, and stupid' delusion, and it happens a lot. One of my habits is to always see the negatives in everything, and I mean everything, this stops me from enjoying life and being happy.

I was really hype about FFXV before it came out, but forgot about it for a long time and now I'm thinking of getting it.

Is it still getting patches/updates? I've heard before that after its initial release it felt ""unfinished"" to some players.

89,"A dear friend of mine has been using weed and alcohol to self-medicate for depression for at least a few months now and has gotten to the point where it's nearly every day, if not every day.

It's gotten formulaic how we talk about their addiction. When they get super high they sometimes message me frantically to ask if they have a problem and apologize for being a burden. Every time, I ask them if they've considered using other options for medication and remind them I love them so much and that it doesn't bother me at all. They tell me they should talk about it when they're sober and apologize and go to sleep. I try to bring it up the next day, and they say they were so fucked up the night before that they don't remember anything.

I don't know what to do to address what's happening. Should I be more persistent in asking them to talk about it or trying to come up with a solution, or should I try to wait until they are ready to confront their issue while sober?",08Jul2018,2
90,"I'm 20 years old, a junior in college, and took up two majors because I wasn't passionate about the first one. Currently taking a couple summer classes to get better grades. Tuition is a shit ton of money, and I thought my mom wanted to support me, but in the end she's just like my dad. 
My dad has been giving me shit about wanting to take on another major and study abroad--now she's doing it too. Studying abroad wasn't even going to be an issue because it would have been the same price they were paying this entire time. 

I can't take it anymore. I didn't get a job to focus on school, but now I want a job just so I can get out of here.

* Friend of 9 years
* My dad ends up with cancer
* Dad ends up dying of cancer
* Friend stops texting (but didn't know of his passing)
* I asked, ""Hey why haven't you reached out in a while?""
Excuses
* ""Well, do you care to see how I'm or my dad is holding up?""
* ""no i don't""

1.5 years go bye

* Messaged out of the blue
* Asked to hear this friend's apology at a random convention that's convenient for them (not where I live)
* Call them out

6 months go bye

* I reach out and message, ""Hey, I'm in the USA; you said you wanted to talk.""
* They call, we agree to a date/time

Today's the day...

* The friend bails
* When confronted, ""im out rn with peeps; can we make it 3-4 ish?""

Do I have a right to feel upset? Why would someone feel so compelled to apologize and suddenly... renege?

This is the only person in my life who's done this so it's quite... odd to me. I can't wrap my head around it.

I’m currently going to school to be a psychologist and made the comment to my boyfriend that it would be a cool place to work. His response was jokingly that I’d “fit right in” because I’m thin. Normally I wouldn’t mind just playfully joking around but his comment really hurt.

100,"I am 20 years old and live with my partner(21M) of 3 years. We have 2 cats and share a 2 bedroom apartment with a roommate(23/24M). We have our room, the roommate has theirs, and we share a common space. In August my partner and I are moving into a 1-bedroom apartment. Before this, I lived with my parents. 

I’ve never lived on my own. If I did, I would have my entire apartment full of pink, cute, fluffy things. It’s childish, but I would love to have hello kitty and sailor moon themed everything.  Pastel kitchen utensils. Fruit-shaped sponges. Themed bedspreads. Some comic book related things. Plush bears. All of it. I’m not a very “passionate” person in that I don’t usually have things I put 100% of my energy into, but decorating with cute stuff like this gets me so happy and excited. I know a lot of people see it as immature, but I think that as long as I dress appropriately for work and other social situations, and don’t force it on anyone, my living space should make me happy. 

When my partner and I moved in together, we used all of his stuff. His bed. His desk. His dresser. His plates, blankets, sheets, cups...*everything*. Our roommate already lived here, so the common space is made up almost entirely of his things, which are very politically driven and of opposite political opinion from mine (which is fine, it’s just not *me*). The TV and all the entertainment consoles save for 1 are mine, though. 

I’ve tried to make my own little space. I have a couple posters, one of which my boyfriend doesn’t like but he respects that *I* like it. I brought over a few of my cups and mugs, and one is now broken. I have a plush bear. I have some pens and notebooks that are cute. My cats have pink and blue themed... everything, not that they really care though lol! Also I did find one fruit-shaped sponge. So there are tiny bits of me sprinkled in, but mostly it’s “GUNS, SPORTS, MEAT, ALCOHOL, MAN” *everywhere*. 

I talked to my boyfriend about making things a little...cuter at our new place, and he seems on board as long as the whole place isn’t full of it in his face, but I need to find a balance between what makes me happy and what he wants, too. I’m not going to just start putting doilies and ribbons everywhere without talking to him about it. He said that I can make the kitchen as adorable as I want, but we are going to move from our current (very large) kitchen to an extremely small kitchen without even a microwave. I don’t think half of what we currently have will even fit in there, which also makes me sad because I love baking and that can take up a lot of space. Plus he is actually the one who does most of the cooking, so I want him to feel comfortable and happy in the kitchen. 

We can’t afford new furniture or anything, and our new couch is this really masculine and dark colored one (it’s actually the same one from now, our roommate is giving it to us) so it’s already looking like our new place will be similar to our current one. 

I guess I just want some advice on how to subtly “cuteify” our new place without going overboard? Things that wouldn’t take up too much space? Or other ways to express this part of me, besides clothing (which I do). My partner and I are both students in a college town, if that helps. Thanks!",08Jul2018,1

103,"This might sound ridiculous and I hope I’m just being paranoid but I really don’t know what’s going on. 

I’ve always been paranoid, had some things happen where I had to avoid certain places to not run into certain bad people, so maybe that’s why I feel so weirded out by this.

Basically ever since I moved here February 2017 I’ve felt really watched. I can’t put my finger on why, just a lingering feeling that someone is spying on me. 

I’d say it started to get weird about 6 months ago, when my neighbour who I’d never spoken to in my life found out what my job was. 
She had taken in a package that I’d received and said she knew I worked “unsociable hours”. Now at the time I was working as a stripper, and I figure if you know someone works nights you’re highly unlikely to think they’re a stripper, more likely to think bar work or care work.
Anyway she mentioned what I did in conversation and I was a bit taken back however didn’t say anything, but I still don’t get how she knows. 

My flat is long with my bedroom being on a different side, different road in fact, to my front door. It’s right by my upstairs neighbours front garden and front door. I’ve always hated sleeping there as it’s so close to their space. The blinds are very easy to nose through and I always feel like someone is watching me through them. 

Not so long ago I went to bed and saw flashing lights coming from the blinds, not that bright, I figured it was a car being weird from the street. But it was like it was looking in my room, and I heard weird tapping noises with it. Very faint and infrequent but enough times to weird me out.  Like not quite rain tapping sounds but similar. I tried to wait it out but after 40 minutes it looked really suspicious and didn’t stop so I moved to sleep in my living room.

A couple of weeks ago my cat was sniffing a small vent that is on my bedroom wall that separates me from outside. I heard this massive growling sound that wasn’t my cat and didn’t sound like a dog, I called my mum into my room and she heard it and was freaked too. It didn’t even sound like the sound was coming from anything, it just happened. I don’t live anywhere with raccoons or foxes either.

Last week I woke up with bad bruises on my arm that looked like a grip mark. I had gone out 2 days prior but I had no indication of any injuries there and no one touched my arm, I don’t think it was from that. Plus when I woke up with the bruising my arm really hurt.

I do web camming now and someone said something really weird in my chat, they could mean it innocently but that freaked me out. This was after the bruising.

Basically all this and just a horrible feeling, especially at night, has made living here really unsettling. I’ve gone to the doctors in case I’m being paranoid but they said it didn’t sound like an indicator of schizophrenia or anything.
If anyone has any advice on how to deal with this that would be great, or even just how to soothe myself as I now don’t sleep until it’s light outside.

Also apologies if this is hard to read, I’m very tired. 
Thank you.

113,"I've been a night-owl ever since I was a kid. When I was super young, that just meant staying up until midnight, but as I've got older and more in control of my life, usually that means staying awake until the early hours of the morning. This is partially because I genuinely feel more energetic at night as apposed to fatigue during the day, and partially just because it makes me *happier* to spend the night awake. 

To be clear, it doesn't in ANY WAY whatsoever hinder me from completing responsibilities that require me to be out and about during the daytime, or otherwise make me an irresponsible person. I'm in control of it enough that I *can* 'fix' my schedule when it's necessary -- when I'm employed or it's expected of me, otherwise. It's always just been a choice for me.

That being said, there's currently a friend of mine (and in the past there's been someone else in my life who reacted similarly..) who more or less *constantly* frames my staying up late as a bad thing. They don't mean any harm, I'm sure -- but nevertheless, I don't think an interaction goes by without this friend somehow bring up my sleeping habits in a negative light. It,,, honestly makes me feel really bad and guilty, like it's not normal, and that I'm just a freak who doesn't have an 'average' sleep schedule... They even often *tell* me to 'go to bed' when we speak late at night.

On the one hand, I want to tell this friend how their comments make me feel and express the reasoning that I've offered here as to why I do what I do. But on the other hand, this is the second person in my life who's talked to me like this -- and there's a part of me that genuinely doesn't know if maybe the odds are telling, and I'm just super deluded...

Just recently, a gay man had messaged me on facebook about how I looked and I responded politely but without any inclination that I was gay because I am not. But I also didn’t shut him down. I just thanked him for his compliment. He continued and we talk for a while here and there. Understand me here, I am extremely confident in my preferences and have no interest in men. I am the type of guy that people like to poke fun at me being “gay” because I don’t care about giving my friends massages or saying other guys are attractive because it doesnt bug me at all and I know what I like. But one day one of my friends saw my conversation with this man on my facebook and was appalled about how I was even talking to this guy back. “why even respond” they would ask. That’s where my concern is.

I need to know why I feel the need to satisfy people that hit on me, and I really want to stop both for myself and for the sake of people I am doing this to. It was happened so often I recognize this as chronic personality trait and need to stop. Can anyone offer me advice? Thank you Reddit ",08Jul2018,0

128,"To start this, I will mention that I am 18 years old, I am male, I work, I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Depression that I’ve dealt with my entire life, and my mother and I have never seen eye-to-eye.

About five months ago, my mother and I decided we needed to move away from our town we’re living in, as we’ve lived here for my entire life (roughly 18 years) and at the time, it seemed like a great idea. I was finishing up my GED, I was studying for electrical engineering, and I had no connections. I mentioned all the time how I could leave “that day”.

Fast forward three months, and I’ve landed a job at a place I really love. For the first time in my life I feel like I am accomplishing something, and I am extremely motivated and happy for the first time in my life.

Fast forward another month, and I’ve found the love of my life. A person who loves me for me, sees past my insecurities, and supports me through everything. I do the same for them, and I love them very much. 

My problem now is that while I was never really behind moving as far away as the planned location, I was excited to leave my hometown. I previously had no connections, nobody to keep me here, and I didn’t much care where I ended up. Now I have a job I love (that I’d have to leave behind) a partner that I love (we would be in a long distance relationship until I supported my mother long enough to move back to my hometown with my partner) and a strong need to be independent.

If I could find a place to stay, I could let my mother move, and I could stay, but we are not financially sound. I am more financially sound than she is, and she needs my continued support. She also is very afraid of being alone, and has nobody else to be with her.

Should I stay because it is what I want, and it is what would make me happy? Or should I leave and be unhappy because it would make my mother happy. 


I’m sure I’ve left some things out, as I’m having a hard time focusing right now. If anyone could give me some advice, I would greatly appreciate it. If anyone has questions, I’d be glad to answer them.

When we hang out we just talk about where we should hang out in the future. After our dates I am not immediately looking forward to seeing him again, but at the same time it’s nice to have someone to go to places with.

133,"I'm trying to use this summer as a way to get more physically healthy and so I'm trying to do things like waking up earlier and sleeping earlier. I am also trying to do a morning run and an evening of basketball with friends to keep me active. 

I know a lot of people recommend lifting and other things to build muscle and therefore improve metabolism but would I be overworking myself if I added this to my routine? Or maybe I'm already overworking myself with two sessions in a day? 

I love playing basketball and it gives me a great workout so I'd hate to cut that out but would alternating days with my running and weight training be a good option? If anyone has advice on this or even something completely different I'd love to hear it. 

Another thing not completely related to working out is my water intake. I've read people should be drinking a gallon a day which is already more than I drink now. I'm wondering since I'm a bigger guy and I'm sweating from exercise, how do I factor that into how much more water I should drink? Should I be at 1.5 gallons a day? Or 2? It seems like a lot to me but I have no idea.

I've finally told myself to get in shape and I just want to make the most of this summer and do what I should have done years ago.

134,"Hi all,

I’m in need of some serious advice. I’m in my late twenties, I graduated college a couple years ago and I’ve been struggling ever since. It seemed like after graduation my life went downhill and I have yet to recover. I’ve been battling severe depression on and off ever since and I’m struggling to beat it. 

It all started after graduation. I was struggling to find employment. I still am. My girlfriend at the time, while still in school herself, had to support me for almost a year while I was job searching. Eventually she grew tired of having to do that and broke up with me. I can’t blame her. I took it so hard I spiraled into deep depression. I was suicidal. At one point I did something stupid and said something stupid to the wrong person. Cops were called, and I was forced to spend the weekend in a mental facility against my will. I felt reality was slipping away from me and I had no one to turn to. 

Let’s rewind a bit. In college, I was one of the most sociable person you’d ever meet. I would’ve considered myself affable. I hosted and help host many parties. I was asked to join many frats but I prided myself on being a GDI. I was everywhere and anywhere there was a party. My studies suffered because of this but I made it to graduation. I made friends easily but I had very few close friends.  College went by fast. Everyone scattered after college. 

Fast forward to today. I’m no longer suicidal however I’m still extremely depressed. It comes and goes. I have no career despite having skills. I keep applying everywhere in my local community for positions I feel qualified to do but keep getting told I don’t have enough experience. I’m having to work temp jobs unrelated to my passion to make ends meet. I have no friends and this is partly my fault. I don’t know how to make friends anymore. I get increasingly anxious approaching strangers. I have no social media. I hate and fear rejection. I feel as tho I need a life coach but I can’t afford one. I’m lost and losing hope. I don’t know what to do. I’m posting tonight because I’m sinking back into my depression. I’m NOT suicidal. Please help. I’m tired of feeling so alone. I want to be happy again. ",08Jul2018,2
135,"My husband and I met 14 years ago, and pretty much ever since then I’ve talked about wanting to move away from our hometown. It’s a long story, but I grew up in many different areas of the US and settled down in college in a city that I didn’t care for at the time. I’d complain about it sometimes, comparing it to other places, which in hindsight was wrong since there are good qualities about it.

A year ago, my husband’s job got transferred and we moved to a new state. There are many things I love about the area, but it’s been very isolating.

Basically, we moved to LA and I wasn’t prepared  for how busy people are, and how hard it is to make friends especially in our 30s. I wasn’t prepared for how low paying the jobs are in my industry either. Despite a much higher cost of living, jobs I’ve applied for pay far less than what I was making 10 years ago in my hometown. I now work remotely but I’m alone mostly during the day.

It’s a lovely area, the food is great, people are cool and I like the bustle and anonymity of big cities.

BUT, I’m deeply lonely. This weekend I decided to visit my parents who are in good health, but rapidly aging. I’m scared I won’t get to spend enough time with them before they pass away. Plus I saw some friends and realized how I may be depressed now from being pretty isolated.

Right now we pay close to $3,000 a month for a small two bedroom apartment. Back in the old city, we could afford a decent house and even live in a neighborhood I always DREAMED of living when I was little. 

I’m sad because of how depressed i feel alone, and out of place I feel in LA. But working there is a great boost for my husband’s career, and after complaining about our hometown it seems silly to say I want to move back.

Not sure what advice I’m looking for exactly. I wish maybe I could speak with someone who understands depression after moving, or anything to help make this a less isolating experience. Even though we go out, most of the people seem a bit more surface in their interactions whereas I really appreciate quality friendships, even just one friend. I don’t know what to do to get out of this rut, it’s honestly been so terrible I didn’t realize how isolation hurts so badly.

136,"I need your opinion on this family matter that has been ruining me for most of my life.

I grew up with a mentally, emotionally, and physically abusive step-father. Not only was he abusive, he was a pathological liar, a gambling addict, bipolar, and a cheater. He could not keep a job for more than a year. Friends he met quickly turned into bitter enemies. Last I heard, he was over $40k in gambling debt. He kept in touch with his high school sweetheart abroad, and told her that he was only in a ""temporary greencard marriage"". He would get mad at my mom for spending a few dollars at the 99 Cent store, but would gamble away his earnings and send gifts to his mistress' daughters.

This man is a terrible human being, but my mother and my younger self were financially dependent on him. Throughout my childhood, we both endured a lot of horrible years. Ever since I could remember, it has been my goal to save myself and my mom from the hell that we were living in.

Fast-forward to 2016, half a year after graduating college, I landed a great career job and finally told my mom that I can support her and save ourselves from him. I also tried to tell her about his mistress, but she had already known for the past 9 years. So I got her a plane ticket to the Philippines to live with my aunts and extended family. I confronted his mistress and spilled the beans to her daughter. Turns out she was also deceived.

After six months of staying with family, my mom returned to the USA wanting to work again because my grandmother needed money for healthcare. I helped her move to LA, and there she lived on her own until one day she got into a car accident and panicked. That same day I received a call from her and she said that she's reuniting with my step-father. It took me a few days to convince her that her decision wasn't the right choice. In my mind, I just assumed that she was a victim returning to her abuser. She agreed to return back to family in the Philippines because of the stressful LA experience.

At this point I've gotten into a little bit of debt myself from purchasing plane tickets, a car, and other expenses for her. My girlfriend with whom I was living at that time broke up with me. I got sick for a whole month and lost my job. A few months later (towards the end of 2016) my mom told me that she's reuniting with my step-father, because she wanted to teach me about forgiveness. Despite myself and all of our family members having advised her otherwise, she came back to the USA. In my mind, I believed that she was not mentally healthy. I told her that she needed professional help, but she felt that her decision was the right choice. Feeling desperate, I did the unthinkable. I have her an ultimatum: to choose her son/family or him. She chose him.

Present day. I'm in my mid-20's with a fulfilling career, but no family in the USA. I've always dreaded the holidays. Everything in my life has been spiraling downwards and I think this single issue has been affecting all aspects of my life. Most of my life, my sole reason for existing was to save myself and my mom from him. I wanted to take care of my mom, and now I've lost all purpose. Even though I've tried to find other non-altruistic and selfish reasons to go on with life, I'm still lost and can't find purposes to live selfishly for myself. Nothing is as compelling. I still fantasize about buying my mom a house, but the idea of my step-father still being in her life haunts me.

I've sought advice from a lot of people, including friends, coworkers, and even a therapist. The answers have been 50/50 and all arguments seemed to be logically valid:

* **Advice - Option A:** ""*You're an adult. You have full control of your life and who you include in it. She made her decision. Move on and choose a new family.""* This is the option I've been living with for almost a year and a half now.
* **Advice - Option B:** *""She's your mother. She's family and blood. No matter what, you need to respect her decision and still be there for her.""* Stop trying to control her life/decisions. Keep in contact with my mother and include her back in my life, but tell her that my step-father has no room in my life. This seems to be the most uncomfortable but most mature option. I'm afraid that reconnecting with her will still allow him to be in my life (whether I can control it or not) and may trigger buried emotions and memories.
* **Advice - Option C:** ?????

137,"Ok this isn't a creepy thing, just a fair warning, but around 1:30 to 2:00 in the morning every night in my house someone goes down and up the stairs for some reason.

143,"Long story short, for reasons that aren't relevant enough to be worth trying to explain or justify, I'm in a situation where the only job I've ever had before was a few months of some shit-terrible (by all standards of comparison I've heard) online gig. 

My father is retiring and I'm pursuing programming for a career to get some financial stability. I've been busting my ass to get good enough at it to get a job in the field and work my way up the ladder. That part of it has been going well and there's no need for advice there. In fact, working on my own and being a self-starter is something I've become pretty good at.

The part where it all falls apart is the getting the job itself.

I have a laundry list of issues in relation to the actual getting of a job and by issues, I don't mean complaints. I mean deep psychological issues. Crippling anxiety about interviews and bitterness toward the whole process, motivation that slips away like water in cupped hands when I try to apply it to things like resumes and applying to places, and a general bitter hatred of the 9/5 situation and fear not only of failing at it, but also of being miserable doing it if I succeed. I've basically never heard from people who enjoy their job in my life, only people who hate it and have shitty bosses, or have good bosses but are generally miserable. I hate the idea of spending 90&amp;#37; of my time in an office to complete mundane tasks and get scolded in reviews because they don't want to give me a raise.

The whole rat race, predatory nature of it depresses the hell out of me and I think I'm probably just too in my head about it and might be moderately ok with it if I actually did it (or at least, less than the anxiety would have me believe), but I have no way of knowing without doing it and where normally rationality works so well for me, I'm just a blind, scared idiot.

Every time in my life I've actually faced down the job process, I've come away demoralized and running scared. The one online gig experience is small reassurance considering that there was no real-time interview process. Just some training, some of it over the phone, and a lot of working half-blind on my own.

More than anything else, I'm just pissed that I get stuck on this stupid nonsense obstacle and psyche myself out to an insane degree. 

I don't know what advice I'm even looking for, to be honest. That's part of the problem. Usually when I face problems in life, I'm able to figure out some idea of what the hell it is I'm up against and how to handle it, but this is just... it's become this out-of-proportion monster in my life and because of the need to get employment soon, my anxiety is through the roof about it. I feel like a vulnerable, helpless idiot right now and that's probably part of my problem, that I've probably got some learned helplessness going on. 

Somewhere in me, I know I have what it takes to get a job and keep it, but there's a part of me that is kicking and screaming because I don't even want a mindless 9/5 (or at least don't believe that I want it). Call it an inner toddler or a reasonably upset adult, I don't know which, but whatever it is, it's mad about the whole situation and it doesn't want that and that's not helping me.

To top it off, I feel ashamed sharing this at all because it feels like an admission of a negative stereotype about people in my generation and I can just imagine some people reading this and shaking their heads, thinking ""I knew it, these fucking whining young people who don't want to put in a hard day's work."" But FWIW, putting in a hard day's work is fucking easy for me to do (well, as easy as it is for anyone to bust their ass). The idea of putting in an unproductive and stupid day's work at some asshole boss or company's behest is what gets under my skin, especially considering just how much sheer time of my life would be spent on shit-all nothing. And it's not like I can just go start a business. It'd take years to make money and all common sense probability says that I'd be one of the many who fail.

I'm just very emotional about this whole thing and I think it's hard for me to even believe there are workplaces that aren't run by shit assholes at one level or another.

I've grown a lot in the past few years, but this is one area where I continue to be broken as fuck and I'm running out of time to figure it the fuck out.

And I think at the core of it I've just lost sight of anything to fight for. Like whatever idealism and dreams I had when I was a bit younger have been crushed by trauma and worn down by cynicism and hopelessness. I feel like my day-to-day is focused on survival, rather than some greater purpose, and that may be enough to keep getting out of bed in the morning, but it's not enough to put a spring in my step. I want to bust my ass *for* something, not bust my ass only to survive, but how can I do that if I don't even know what I want to bust my ass for?

I spent a lot of time at certain points trying to figure out things that were ""passions."" What I never quite got an answer for was things that are meaningful to me. I wish I'd spent more time figuring that out and maybe I wouldn't be so confused and hurting right now.",08Jul2018,2

147," I've been going through a rough patch over the last four years. It started off with my ex-girlfriend leaving me for somebody else after a few weeks when moved away because while away ""I wasn't enough of a distraction from her mom's recent death and it was all she could think about."" Oddly enough, her leaving me didn't have an effect on me even though I loved her. I just allowed it and didn't think about it.

A few months later, my grandfather died who happened to be my acting dad as the original left before I was born. This has really messed with me and I had nobody to turn to but my ex. She was polite about it, but I could tell she didn't to deal with it at the time so I tried not to bother her. This really started me down the road of just being numb and I still haven't recovered from his death.  


I have honestly not felt much the last four years, but I managed to find myself a new girlfriend a year ago that I am in love with (For real this time, it feels true and we have a lot of chemistry). However, a few months ago I started  to self harm out of the blue because it just seemed like the right thing to do at the time (a lot of stress in my senior year of high school) and I have been thinking a lot about my ex, not to get back but wanting closure I guess, I'm not completely sure myself.   


Recently have turned from self harm to smoking cigs which works, but every now and again I have terrible nights and I think about going back to it. I just want to be happy, but it doesn't seem like I'll be able to anytime. I need somebody to tell me what the right thing is to do because I have no idea what to do with myself. ",08Jul2018,1

The kid has zero social skills, awkward as hell, never had a job, and while book smart he is a god damn idiot. I know because I was all of those things. 

I been looking for a cheap place for him to rent. I can help him with the rent and cosign. But fuck, would you rent to someone like him? Especially at such short notice. No luck so far on Craigslist.

There's a church run shelter that can take him in, put him to work, and help him find a job. That honestly sounds like a good option but I feel like that is me eschewing my responsibility. I'm also afraid of him getting being around dangerous people or getting hooked on something.

I have a brother who is 7 years older than me. He became violent as a teenager because of my parents conflicts. He just to best up my mom when angry. Small things would blow up in a big way in our house and it would end with my mom getting hurt badly. I used to stop him from hitting my mom, but I couldn't bear a single hit and would back off. My dad stopped hitting my mom as he became older, but my brother's behaviour didn't change. My brother thinks he's a victim and he was always unhappy that my favoured me more.
Now, my brother got married and has a kid. We still live in the same house. My mom always wanted to not be with him. But he wanted her to take care of his baby while his wife worked. Now, my mom feels overworked and that has caused issues, ending with my mom hitting both my dad and mother. My sister in law never contributes much to our housework and this makes my mom angry. It ends up with my brother asking me and dad to contribute more to house work and that my SIL could not contribute more.
My brother feels very entitled. He did contribute monetarily to our house when I was studying, but that doesn't mean we put with bad behaviour. I have got a good job now. My parents want to marry me off, but I've been trying my best to avoid so that I can have savings and not depend on anyone. My parents have grown old and I can't expect any help from my brother. I understand that I'm on my own and want to be as independent as possible.
Whenever I say I don't want your help to my brother, he talks to me as though I incapable and can't make it on my own. I'll be turning 25 this year. Please advise me how I can deal with my low self esteem and anxiety issues. And how I can make my life better. ",08Jul2018,1
151,"Hi everyone!

So there's a certain department in the uni I attend that handles whether or not students associated with that department get into the courses they need to graduate. However, certain majors have a higher association status with the department and thus get higher priority for everything. Normally this could be understandable (although difficult) but it gets to the point where even if you need guidance or help the department will literally tell you to ""Screw Off"" (that's a quote) even if you desperately need them to graduate school on time (and avoid financial disaster). 

The advice I would like is basically an approach to this problem. How do I make it known to the rest of the school that this department has massive issues and somehow make a change, at least in attitude?

Thank you!",08Jul2018,1
152,"I have no idea if this is the best place to post this but I’m pretty desperate for some objective advice at this point, so here we go. 

I’m in a relationship I don’t want to be in. I think any mental health professional would characterize it as abusive. Im still coming to terms with that. We have been together for a little over seven months now but it started turning south after two months. And I need to get out but I don’t know how. I’m terrified. He is controlling, manipulative, and has intense anger when he feels he has been wronged. 

I’ve tried several times to end things. He’s told me he will come find me and my family and make my life hell. I’ve seen him take vindictive actions against his ex before me. (Breaking into her parents house to steal what he said was his). He has, on a few occasions, gotten physical with me. Specifically he’s shoved me to the ground on pavement, he’s thrown objects at me from across a room and broken and stolen things very valuable to me. He has a warrant out for an assault case he pleaded out of and then skipped probation. So contrary to the impression I first got, he’s not a good guy. I have no doubt that he would devote his life to ruining mine. 

By now I’ve moved out and am staying with family. I’ve “broken up” with him multiple times. And he has left me, many times, through a volley of insults and hurtful comments. After breaking up with me he will then expect me to assume we are still together once he calms down. Any time I try to end it, he will call and text and throw a tantrum, full of threats and ultimatums where he will twist what I’ve said and make me feel crazy. It gets to the point that I don’t have the emotional energy to fight anymore and I end up just playing along as his girlfriend again. I know that sounds awful and heartless. I do care about him and in whatever masochistic way, I love him. I just feel completely without control of my life. 

I find myself wondering how the fuck I got into this mess and usually come back to seeing emotional abuse in my childhood and my propensity to tolerate poor treatment because of it. So along with seeking immediate advice I plan to pursue professional counseling. I just really need him out of my life, but don’t want to end up as a missing person on the news. 

In the last few weeks, I’ve told him I don’t want to be with him and he managed to suck me back in. I’ve already told my friends and family we split up months ago. So now I feel isolated. He knows where I’m staying and knows a lot about my family. He has already coerced me out of thousands of dollars that I assume I’ll never see again. At this point I’d like to just have my life back. 

In the midst of all this, I think asking a clear question might yield the best results. What is the best way to protect myself and my family? 

I feel like it’s a very bitchy move but I could report where he’s staying to the police. If they talk to him, he’d almost automatically go to jail for a year minimum due to the warrant. Yet I have profound objections to the way ‘justice’ is served in America, so I’m reluctant to do that. So I don’t exactly want him thrown in jail, but I don’t want to be with him either. I’d also love if I didn’t end up on the news as a cold case.... maybe I’m being paranoid? It’s hard to say anymore. 

Just in anticipation of this, yes I have gone to the police. I haven’t given his information, because it would essentially be me turning him in to go to jail. I could get a protective order (aka restraining order) but it’s not valid unless they serve him / notify him. If they had his name and address, he would go to jail for the previous crime he got probation for. He’s been on the run from the police for months, so I doubt it would matter unless I turn him in. 

I just want to be a good person in all of this. I don’t want to fuck him over but I need to get out of this too. I thought about writing him a long email explaining that it’s not him, it’s me, and it can’t work anymore. Then I would change my phone number and hope for the best. But as it is I worry about him coming to find me at night, so I would be putting my family in danger since he knows where we live. I just feel very stuck. 

Any insight will be appreciated. Thank you ",08Jul2018,2

I don't even know what to write, so I'm just going to leave the original copies of this message below and list out what I'm thinking. 

I dont really have friends. I have a couple of roommates that I talk with every day, and one other friend who invites me to events every other month or so. 

I don't really have aspirations either, I just don't know what I want.

I go to a vocational college to get my welfare, but I don't really care about the course and I don't think I'm going to get anywhere with them, and I just feel empty, bored and depressed all the time. 

I'm considering going to university. I know I want to go to university, I'm just not sure what I want to do or why. 

Australia has a decent student loans system, so that's not a major issue. 

There are a few things to consider with this, though. 

-I get to do something that makes me enjoy life for once.

-It increases how much social interaction I'll get, because I'll have group projects.

-I have to complete &amp; pass a 1 year bridging course. 

-It massively reduces the hours I'm available to do anything (work, socialize) 

-I might just think I want to go, and end up dropping out, having wasted 1+ years of my life. 

Although if I don't go to university, I suppose I'd have to get a full time job. 

Pros/cons

*Have an income that can support my lifestyle with ease while gaining experience that makes it easier to get a job in the future.
 
*Highly likely that I would have little-no potential for future careers at this point.

Everything they invite me to usually ends up with them smoking and it all just makes me really uncomfortable and I hate it. I don’t want to be the one to tell them to not smoke. I can’t really make any new friends. I feel bad for doing nothing about it also because I feel like it’s not healthy.

157,"My boyfriend, Nick, and I currently moved back to our hometown and were going to transfer our minimum wage jobs, but my parents (46m &amp; 42f) told us that we could live with them in my old room, rent free, as long as we both went to college in the fall. A month in, something switched with my father, he's a narcissist if that helps, and he called the cops on my boyfriend and told them he wanted him out now. The officers were very nice and told my boyfriend he had thirty minutes to leave. 

Nick only has his father (46m) and his husband (39m) and they agreed to let him stay for the weekend (7/6 - 7/8) but needed to discuss further is Nick can stay for a month until his student loans come in and he can get a place and a car, since our car is pending transmission repair from my neighbor. If not, he'll have to go to the local homeless shelter. 

I have BPD ( borderline personality disorder) and I'm having a very hard time adjusting to not sleeping next to Nick every night and seeing him in the morning. He's my bestfriend and my only friend since we just moved back. I wake up in the middle of the night, unable to go back to sleep, and just start crying. I don't know how to handle these emotions. They're very intense and they come on very fast. I try to calm myself down, but the only thing that seems to work is calling my boyfriend, but I know that he's also stressed about his situation and I'm just making it worse.

It's only been two days since Nick has left, but I really want to nip these behavior in the bud. I want to be strong and supportive for my boyfriend, not depressed and upset all the time. I'm trying to busy myself with cleaning my room and moving my furniture around, applying for jobs, but there's still time for me to think about the situation and how much it hurts me that we're separated.

159,"(TL;DR at the bottom) I have some consoles that I don't use that much and I'm not sure if it would be better to just sell them or if I would regret it. I don't really enjoy gaming as much as I use to. I find it really hard to finish things now and I'm not sure if I would come back to these games. I still really like playing my 3DS so I know I would at least keep that. Overall I'm considering selling my Wii, Wii U, PS Vita, and (old) 3DS XL.

I haven't actually played my Wii in a long time. It mostly just makes me nostalgic. I don't really have any games for it that I would enjoy playing now. I traded in some of my games for it like 3 years back and I kinda regret trading in two of them since they would still be playable to my adult self, but I can't take that back now. Otherwise I have maybe one game that's probably pretty good but I just never finished and a few kiddie/party games left (Like Just Dance). 

I also have a Wii U. I only have three games for it. I have one game that I need to finish and then the other two aren't really finishable you just keep playing for rank/the challenge. I don't know if it's worth keeping since I don't play it for months at a time if that. I got it at a bad time pretty much a few months before the Switch announcement. It's kind of become a Netflix machine. This one definitely doesn't get any playtime since I can't bring it to college.

I also have a Vita. It's another one that I don't play for months at a time. I have two games for this one where I got stuck on the final boss and I haven't played in months. I really enjoyed the games though and would like to see the end of them, so if I sell it maybe I can sell it after that. One of the things I would kinda regret is losing my digital games since I can't resell them. They are worth $40 altogether. I think that I have 5 physical games that I could sell with it.

Lastly, I have a 3DS XL. I currently have a New 3DS XL as well. I realized after upgrading that I could have just stuck with my old 3DS since the 3DS probably won't be supported much longer anyway. Now this one just isn't being played at all after I wasted money upgrading. The only thing that it could be useful for is for trading between consoles or as a backup if my N3DS ever breaks (which I think is unlikely).

Sorry I started rambling and if a lot of this information isn't necessary. The pros to selling in my opinion would be clearing up space and getting some money back (which would be helpful since I'm in college). They are all in good condition and I have the original boxes for all of them so I will probably be able to get decent prices for them. I feel bad having what's basically wasted money laying around that has accumulated over the years. I also can't really afford to get games for so many consoles anyway to enjoy them all equally, so it would be better to just have one.

TL;DR: I don't play some of my consoles/games that much and can't motivate myself to finish games often. I also have a loss of enjoyment in gaming. Should I sell them?",08Jul2018,1
160,"Alright so my sister was in long term relationship, and then they broke up, and 2 months later she starts creeping on my brothers friend group. They primarily hangout at our house (we -the siblings- all live under the same roof until September) so I can literally hear her suddenly becoming interested in my brothers friends. Now me and my brother have been close and have common friends and party together, however my sister, due to an age gap (she’s older by 4 years), has always not been a part of that. Suddenly she is and I’m bothered by this. mostly just because I recall her previous attitude and now I’m hearing her contradict herself, but also because the guy that she’s going for I was once interested in, and he’s a family friend, so he’s over a lot regardless of her. Now I’ve found being near my sister and this guy to be terribly annoying and unsettling, am I reacting normally??? **also important** she’s leaving the state for 4 years in September, and this guy is not. I share a room with my sibling and tonight she came home around 7 and I can’t sleep because all I can think about is her and that guy having sex. ^also that statement is very true.

161,"Hello everyone, I am in a big predicament in my life currently.  I will start off with some backstory to help give your advice.  I have been playing my sport, Water Polo, for 13 years of my life, and it has helped me get to were I am today.  I currently play water polo for a division 1 School in the NCAA and have a starting position on the team, but because I have been playing this sport for more then half my life I am extremely burnt out and want to quit.  I am not on any type of scholarship so the sport is not helping me pay for my tution at the school, but my parents do not want me to quit.  I know that since I am an adult I can make the decisions on my own, but my parents are my biggest supporters besides my girlfriend.  I have talked to my parents about wanting to quit and they have told me they do not want me to quit until I play at least one more season with the team.  The reason for this is because I have a lot of potential since I am the fastest player on the team and have been playing the longest.  However, recently I have strained my rotator cuff which makes it very difficult to play my sport.  I am supposed to take it easy to recover from my injury, but that is difficult to do in the competitive atmosphere surrounding my team.  I have been wanting to quit for about 6 months now, but my parents keep telling me not too.  So, the advice I am asking for is what should I do?  Do I stay with the team for one more season or do I quit now?  Below are a list of pro and cons of quitting.

Pro:

\- I will have more time to work and get money

\- I will be able to spend more time with the people that matter most to me

\- I will have more free time to do other hobbies

\- I won't have to stay up at school the entire year to practice

\- I won't have long term shoulder problems

Con:

\- I won't be in as good as shape

\- My parents won't be happy with my decision

\- I will have to find a new job by where I live (won't be too difficult.

To sum this all up, I want to quit water polo because I do not enjoy playing the sport anymore and would rather be putting my time in other places.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and I appreciate any and all the advice given!",08Jul2018,1

I  caught him doing this in my house where my girlfriend and i keep our house drug/alcohol free. My girlfriend was appalled and scared by this. she and I came to the agreement that he couldn’t stay with us for a years time as long as he remained clean. When we found out he was doing meth it created some heart issues and left him hospitalized. My father has been clean and sober for close to 3 months. However he has been extremely verbally abusive towards me lately.  Saying things that my father would never say.  He has no place to live due to financial reasons and I cannot accept him into my house (we have the room to take him in if needed) based off the agreement I made with my girlfriend. When I broke the news that he cannot say until 1 year of him being clean he became irate and has texted me a nonstop slew of very hurtful texts. Saying that I am a sellout and I am stabbing him in the back. I know deep down my dad is a good guy. But I cannot enable him.

Here is my problem.

For the last two months ago, I was struggling looking a company to do my internship. I sent to almost all company that I know via email or third party website. By the way, I am an IT student majoring in software development in local university.

So last week, a company called me saying that they accept my internship application. I was so happy that finally I get a company because I was worried because the deadline for company hunting is at the end of July. For your guys information, I have started looking for company and software house since May. So let call this company as 'Company A' called me and they basically accept me into their company. They emailed me a document that contain the rules and regulations and they even also provide me with allowance which is quite good amount of money. I have to reply them by Monday. But, they will place me in non it department. The job scope will be like doing weekly report, monitor the database and others. 

Then, on last Friday, a magic happened where a company that I like so much ( 'Company B') emailed me saying that I was shortlisted for a phone interview. The person who emailed me is the manager of IT department of the Company B. The phone interview will take place on Monday morning. 

Up until now, I haven't reply the confirmation email to Company A because deep inside my heart, I want Company B but in the same time also, I am afraid that, if I decline the offer by Company A, I might lose both companies and get nothing. I don't know what kind of question that will be asked during the phone interview because this is my first phone interview ever. I am scared that I might ruin the phone interview. As time is running out, I don't know what to do and decide. I am afraid if I decline Company A, there might be a probability that Company B will reject my application also.

But after spending so much time in my life empathizing with and adapting to other people, I don't really know what I believe or who I am. Part of empathizing with others is refraining from making value judgments, but now I feel I have trouble making judgments about what I want to see in myself. I've played so many roles I don't really know which one is mine. I might seem shallow to want to stick a label on your sense of self, but I'm just tired of looking in the mirror and seeing a stranger staring back.

What can I do to develop a more coherent identity and sense of self?",08Jul2018,2
177,"So to get straight to the point, I enjoy autofellatio.  The act of sucking my own dick doesn’t really turn me on itself (ok maybe a little), instead I enjoy the act of showing off my special talent. Which includes sucking myself to completion usually finishing in my mouth, on my face by request. Although I have to admit I do enjoy it sometimes too. 

So what do women think about autofellatio and guys that are willing to eat/wear their own cum? Is that too weird? Or something you could get into?",08Jul2018,0
178,"Mom is heavy drug user (mostly heroin) for 10+ years and finally landed in the hospital with several nasty complications. She’s now day four with no narcotics to mine and the docs knowledge. We’re really rooting for her to pull through ok but where will she go when this is finished? If she goes back to her boyfriend she will certainly relapse. Even if she stays with me there are plenty of ways for her to get her hands on drugs behind my back due to the neighborhood I live in. How do I help her stay clean? In the past she has told me that she will always live with drug use so her promises today feel somewhat empty. If she truly isn’t mentally prepared to quit, how can I help her see that she’s through the worst part being the physical withdrawals? How can I mentally prepare her to take the next step? She has loads of student loan debt and I don’t remember the last time she held a job. I imagine it will be hard for her to even think about working but I certainly can’t take care of her financially. I’ve never gotten this far with her and I think this is the best opportunity she’s ever had to quit. By the time she is out of the hospital her body will be completely clear of any narcotics but I need her mind right to follow through. Thank you

179,"Well, I know it's vital to achieve success. I am a freshman at a university in a foundation course and I just abhor studying. I am busy enough throughout every single day ( I think) and  I just waste all my free time surfing the web at the end of the day when I should be spending some time revising and doing my coursework. 

I know I need to change my habits and can't afford to have 4-5 hours of leisure time anymore as I did in high school. Especially when I want to get good grades and am aiming for a scholarship. 

The thought of being productive for the rest of my life just invoke fear in me. I used to be entertained by watching anime and playing video games, nowadays it is hard to enjoy them when responsibilities constantly bugs me. I feel empty as I find it harder to indulge in pleasure through media consumption, which I grew up with. I don't like anime as much as I used to, and video games too. Right now I don't really have any hobbies. I feel like picking up drawing and perhaps becoming a comic artist while pursuing my studies at the same time, since I liked drawing when I was younger. But I am afraid I might not have enough time for that (I would love to devote a lot of time into it).

I will plan to do something at a certain time then constantly delay until I have barely any time left.

It's hard to admit this but I have bad time management, chronic procrastination, lack of motivation, constant need to seek excitement and anxiety ( which is the worst just before exams because I will avoid revising due to fear of not having enough time, and escapism just makes it worse).

I don't think about success as happiness at the moment, I just want to do what I had always enjoy. But I feel that to have more opportunities I need to be successful in my academics, though I am not sure if I will love what I am going to study as an undergrad student. 

I guess I just need some advice. ",08Jul2018,2

So I see myself with this these 3 options:
- Stay in Italy, keep working and improving my skills, try again in a few months: I don't like this option, I need a change, I really feel I want to go to the Netherlands.
- Look for an Italian mothertongue job in The Netherlands: this would be easier to find (on paper) but the pay would be lower. Also there could be other required skills for this kind of jobs that I could not have, like accounting, for example.
- Go to The Netherlands anyway, look for a job from there: there is a chance that the companies just prefer someone already in the country, so moving could make things easier. But I'm a really tight budget, moving to another country without a stable source of income would be an issue.

192,"Ok I have posted this a few places but im really trying to figure out a way to cope, I am basically driving  myself nuts because this is always on my mind and its making me depressed thinking about it all the time.

Ok im really bad at talking so this is going to basically going to sound like rambling but I will give it a shot. Years ago when I was a kid I used to listen to the Howard Stern Show, there was a woman on it who Howard being the type of guy he is called her ""Wendy The Retard"" she would call in and he would make fun of her use her for bits and sound bytes etc. Anyway as I got older I matured and stopped listening to the show. Recently I was on a YouTube and seen a video Wendy had put on YouTube and I just started crying my eyes out. She looked in really bad shape she was crying basically and talking about her mum being sick and how they are poor and how people are being mean to her, I then went onto her Facebook page and was blown away by what I seen. Due to the way Howard has treated her over the years and spoke about her people are constantly insulting her and accusing her of being a lying beggar because that's the way Howard has made her out to be and a lot of his less empathetic fans like to act like Howard so they say those type of things to her. From the videos and pictures Wendy puts up its clear she is living in poverty, small tiny bed and a small tv seems to be all she has, her family seem to massively mistreat her and she clearly has no support network to help her with anything and she is also caring for her sick mum too. She is mentally deficient from when she was born but seems to be living a cruel life I thought Howard at least would have taken care of her she had been on his show for over 15 years and he has used her for hundreds of hours of material yet she seems to be miserable living in Poverty. She writes statuses on her Facebook how she is bored and always crying and I am constantly thinking about it and its making me cry all the time, and I have not cried my entire life. I have had difficulties my entire life, living in an orphanage, never knowing my dad growing up in poverty but that all never really affected me but this is really getting to me and I don't know what to do. I am really poor at the moment so I cant do anything to help Wendy at the moment but I plan to start saving to send her money when I have enough. But I don't know why but this is making me depressed I'm constantly thinking about her life and getting upset and I don't know what to do. I tried going onto the Howard Stern Sub reddit to ask the same thing and was basically down voted and told the same rhetoric of ""She is a slob beggar"" because that's the reputation Howard Stern has made for her. Wendy spent years on the show being mocked and laughed at, I remember a bit where Wendy was telling Robin and Howard how the placenta got caught around her throat when she was born and that's how she became mentally deficient and they were laughing and saying it wasn't the doctors fault then going on to say how bad Wendy's mums life most suck having to take care of Wendy while Wendy was on the phone.

Sorry for the venting I just don't know what do and was hoping for advice on how to not be so upset thinking about it all the time until I get to the point me my life I could hopefully help her financially

I attached a picture of Wendy when she first got on the Stern show so you can see from that and the video how bad Wendy has got over the few short years

193,"So I’m a 17 year old girl and I’ve never been in a relationship and I just don’t understand how to start. I’m not flirty at all, (not sure if this is a good or bad thing but) I never have issues hiding who I like- like I don’t show it, and I don’t wear makeup (not sure if this has any relevance).  

Anyway on the other hand, I have a lot of guy friends, I always try to dress nice (skirts, dresses, nice shirts, and normal stuff that girls wear), I run on cross country and track, participate in activities, etc.

So now to the real stuff. I’m currently on this big trip thing to Europe with a bunch of other teens. There’s this guy in the group who I think is cute and would definitely date if he ever asked me out hahahah. I have a friend, Anne, who is the single most depressing person I know. I don’t even know how to describe her- like she’s always taking about how she’s depressed, “coughs up blood”, wants to drown, etc. (I always try to help her and listen... not really part of the story but yeah). She also is moody and doesn’t really care about much.

I’m more on the yippy side if that makes sense and always want to be doing stuff.

Anyway, the guy I think is cute - I never expressed to him I think he’s cute or do anything to show it. I just act normally and became his friend. However, over the past couple of days I see him and Anne getting really close and they definitely seem like they like each other (hair touching, hands on shoulder, etc.) 

I’m not jealous or anything, it’s not like a had a huge crush on him or anything, I just thought he was cute, but I don’t understand - like what do guys find cute in girls?! Should I act all gloomy like Anne? She’s obviously getting more guys than me. Do I stop acting like my preppy self? Do guys like girls who they can “take care of”. This situation just got me thinking about like why have I never been in a relationship?!

I’m not seeking a relationship, and I’m not trying to say I’m such a great person, but I think my personality is pretty okay, I’m kind to everyone around me, I try to get to know everyone, make people feel included, etc. What am I doing wrong? ",08Jul2018,1

Anyway, my girlfriend still talks to her ex regularly. Phone calls that last up to almost 2 hours, messenger, text messages. The reason i know the phone calls last so long is because I have recently become fed up with it and I decided to look through her phone because it was eating me to know what they talk about for so long. Thats where I went through her messages to him. Its just friendly conversation but she knows it bothers me that they are so close. She disliked him for the longest time but there was a time where we broke up for a few months amd she spent a week at his house so her son could visit him. She ended up sleeping with him but sidnt tell me until after I moved on myself and found another girl. I had to ask her about it because we talked and got back together as a mutual agreement. She said she slept with him to see if ""there was still something there"". Well now, after going through that, they are more friendly to each other. He messages her when hes drunk. She knows he is drunk and still replies. She even invites him to talk at times without him asking her first. She wants to take her son to see him for a week and she wants to stay the whole time.

One year, it was in my early twenties, a brilliant student, beautiful girlfriend; like the never-ending summer holidays of elementary school with an overflow of warm days.

The next year, I was closer to thirty than twenty, two young friends committed suicide; one just didn't wake, the other had too many pills and passed out crawling for the door in regret. A deeply loved child died. Cancer. Three grandparents passed from old age and sickness. Life snapped her fingers and it was suddenly cold winter. I became depressed.

Five years have passed so fast, I'm afraid to blink and lose another week. Time passed with the good and the bad. I married my girlfriend. We had a child, lost another. I started a business, lost it all defrauded by a supposed best friend. I **love** my extended family like never before. In a real way, I understand the value of reflecting on the transcendent to attach meaning to life.

I look at teenagers and children, deeply happy that they are still ignorantly in love with life, not tired of debating and being right, not yet indifferent to winning the world. 

What am I aiming at? Life is more real but nothing like I thought: Life's play is filled with bright actors, but the script is brutally random and arbitrary.

Is this a normal realization? Maybe I was spoiled and just grew the hell up? Maybe I have become a pessimist who needs to take off my blinders and stop navel-gazing?

207,"Probably a long one ahead. I don't have anybody else to talk to about this so I'm coming to you guys. It's mostly to do with a girl.

**Background:**

I started working with this girl, I'll call her Emma, who's my age and in her mid twenties. That was last summer in 2017. Now, she has a bit of a history. Married twice. Both of them left her for shitty reasons. She's got a few mental illnesses. Used to be a druggie but got clean before she got pregnant. Oh yeah and she has a toddler. She's the type of girl that I'm usually not interested in because I can see the heart break coming a mile away, not to mention that most people see me as a sheltered guy that wouldn't mesh with that personality.

I'm actually a virgin. I had a girlfriend in high school but we never got to actually having sex because she wanted to wait. Everything since then hasn't lasted more than a month or two and usually ends with her leaving me after several dates because I was just supposed to be a rebound. I also didn't start drinking till I was about 18. Never did anything harder than weed and even that wasn't until recently, and I don't plan on doing it again because I want to become a cop after college which means no drugs. So I'm a little sheltered maybe. But I've had more than my fair share of hardships in life. Dad died when I was 12, grandad when I was 19. My sister is a narcissist. I was bullied growing up. I've never had a real best friend that I could be completely open with and trust to be there for me. I'm halfway suicidal (never attempted but definitely contemplated, more so recently). I'm pretty sure I deal with depression, I'm trying to get that confirmed by a therapist here at some point. and I've basically been alone through it all and ever since.

So Emma and I started talking a little and hit it off enough that we were sort of seeing each other for about 2 months. Now, since I'm a virgin we never did anymore than handsy makeout sessions for those 2 months we were talking. Which was mostly down to the fact that I have no fucking clue what I'm doing and don't know when to start heading for the bedroom. She was coming clean off her last divorce when we met so she was still kind of fucked up and really just looking for a rebound. But she acted like she wanted a boyfriend despite the fact that she stated otherwise so I just went along with it.

Things didn't go well. A ""friend"" of mine, we'll call Dick, got involved, I got squeezed out because of Dick's chemistry with her and she stopped confiding in me. I found out she was talking to other guys and going on dates, which I assumed anyway so I didn't freak out about it. But eventually she told me she wanted to stop the physical stuff and just be friends. I got angry and confronted her about how we weren't really friends because she only talked to Dick (I later found out he was actually trying to get a threesome going between her and his girlfriend of 7 ish years, which I don't believe ever happened). I was pissed that she was treating me like she wanted a boyfriend while also pushing me away, lying to my face about dating other guys, and trying to get into a relationship, just not with me. I didn't end up telling her any of that, and we wound up being assholes to each other for the next 4 or 5 months.

While Emma and I had a dislike for each other, Dick would sometimes fill me in on Emma despite me not asking, so he told me about how she was seeing some guy, we'll call Steve. Steve was married with 2 kids, a cop and volunteer SWAT officer, had money, and was good looking. He ended up blocking her on social media because his wife found out and I figured that was the end of that.

**Fast Forward to Now:**

Dick wound up pissing off Emma and they're no longer friends. I got tired of being angry all the fucking time since I see Emma at work a lot and just decided to let things sort of happen the way they we're gonna happen. Her and I are flirty friends and now I'm one of the only people she has that she can count on and vice versa. She's been in an off and on relationship with Steve who's only now getting divorced 10 months after he and Emma started talking because his wife got tired of his shit and is trying to take everything he has. Emma made some intimate mistakes with her best friend recently that ruined her friendship with him, so they don't talk anymore and she felt guilty about it because she's technically seeing Steve still. So now I'm really her closest friend apart from Steve.

Emma and Steve are working things out while he gets divorced. I'm depressed and trying to rely on Emma to help me as a friend because I don't have anyone else who gives a shit. She only helps so much though because she still has her kid to take care of and is made happy by Steve in a way that I can't. I'm just not a priority. So I've been trying to manage on my own, figuring out why I feel like shit, and I figure that it's because I still have feelings for Emma. Problem is, she's in love with Steve. I've also worked out that Steve is actually the guy she started seeing behind my back and left me for. When they started talking, he lied and said he was separated from his wife which he was very much not. So now I'm pissed off again, because now I'm remembering all the shitty things she did to me leading up to her leaving me and how Steve played into it and how she said she didn't want a relationship but ended up in a 10 month thing with Steve, and now she won't leave him since he's getting divorced, they finally have a real chance, and he needs her help to get through it all. She knows I don't like Steve but I still try to support it because he makes her happy. Which pisses me off more that he does and I don't.

**Advice:**

So here's where I need help. I'm falling apart. I don't have anybody else to confide in but Emma who I have a lot of feelings for still, but Emma only wants Steve. Steve doesn't seem to be going anywhere anytime soon unless he fucks up again. Which he's fucked up a lot and Emma still loves him, so it would take a monumental fuck up at this point. I'm heartbroken over how things went between Emma and me, I also can't forgive her for the way she handled it. I haven't told her any of this stuff because I'm afraid doing that means the end of our friendship, which I still value since I don't have anybody else. No one else in my life knows what I deal with. No one else knows that I think about suicide. Everyone I've ever tried to come to for help just kind of brushes it off and goes on with their life. I feel worthless. I feel intensely alone and have lost hope that that's ever gonna change. Emma cares as much as she can, which isn't as much as I need but is still more than anybody else ever has.

I want to tell her. I wanna get it off my chest because seeing her with him pisses me off so much. Knowing that he's a lying prick and that he got away with it while I'm left here with nothing makes me so angry because I've never had anything, while he comes from a decent family, has a good career, has (had) a wife, kids etc. Emma constantly says I'm a great guy and she doesn't understand how I'm a virgin. That I'm attractive. I don't know how I still am either except that maybe I'm a little bit shallow/picky and am severely lacking in self-esteem, but I just wanna confront her about it since she had the choice and chose him. I want to tell her that the reason I'm falling apart is because of our unresolved issues. Maybe ripping off the bandaid and cutting her off as a friend would be best for me, but I still have to work with her. I would still have to see her, she would still accept me as her friend because she doesn't have anyone other than Steve at this point and she's also borderline suicidal, and I wouldn't be able to stay away because I have feelings for her and care about her. I don't want to see her get hurt or hurt herself. I just want to be furious right now. I want to have it out with Emma. I don't want to lose her though because I like having her as a friend, and I still feel that if Steve ever leaves then her and I might still have something.

If you read all that you're a saint and I appreciate you. Normally I'd just suck it up and have the conversation with her and cut her out of my life. I've done that before so being in this situation now and reading through all of it makes me feel embarrassed that I can't just do it, but I've also never been this good of friends with somebody that I used to have a thing with, who I still have feelings for. I know it's manipulative to be her friend all while hoping her and I get back together some day, but part of me still just wants to bite my tongue and try to move on while staying friends. Am I wrong for feeling this way and for being angry? What do I do?",08Jul2018,3
208,"I didn't know if this would've worked in r/legaladvice so i'm posting it here for now. This happened in Finland.

I will write most dialogue in Finnish (AS I HEARD IT) and try to translate to proper English.

I'm a young guy, and today I cycled about 5km from a dirt road from our summer cottage (where I am with my parents on spring break) to some asphalt so I could skateboard there. It was a small lot next to a slightly busy road where you could park your car and take a break (no houses near except a home, but the gate was closed and no cars were in the driveway, any other houses nearby next to the road were also vacant then). There is no map or anything there, so no reason to really stop there which is why I went there since its really empty usually

I got to be there for about 30 min before a car pulls up about 3 meters away from me. It's an old beat up dark green/almost black volkswagen (not sure what model or if it even was a volkswagen) with very dark windows. It didn't have license plates, in fact it looked like they were ripped off, and only one of the front lights worked properly. In it were 2 men and 1 woman, all around 18-21(?) years old, who all had tattoos and peircings all over.  This happened in eastern Finland, but they sounded and looked like they weren't locals (a lot of people from around here speak with a dialect, and tattoos aren't too popular at least in the area that I was at the time).

They start chatting with me, asking what I'm doing in the middle of nowhere alone, asking where i'm from, how old, what i'm doing, so and so. I'm getting a very weird vibe from them because they keep chattering by themselves and looking at me with a few spurts of laughter, I could at one point make out ""olisko se vihanen jos-"" (would it/he/she be mad if-). Then they ask me a question that raises some red flags: ""Huomaatsä täst autost mitää outoo?"" (""Do you notice anything weird about this car?""). The car doesn't have plates, which is what I tell them in my slight panic. Then one of them signals me to come closer and says ""tuu käymään"" ('come visit' directly, in this situation more of a 'come closer'). I ask why, and they reply ""iha muuten vaa"" (""just because"" or something like that I think).

At this point panic has kicked in and I tell them that I've got a text and I need to go home. They tell me ""ei sun tarvii meiän takii paineita ottaa"" (""don't feel pressured just because of us""). This is the last red flag and I start packing up, and I'm sure they noticed my panic when my hands were shaking while packing up. 

They look at me with a disappointed expression and tell me ""aja turvallisesti"" (ride safely) and I cycle off as fast as my legs can take me. I didn't see if they followed me but when I turned to the dirt road that takes me home (stupidly, IF they would've been following me) I couldn't see them on my tail. 

When I'm a bit ahead I hid behind a pile of firewood outside an old cottage and called my parents (at the cottage) to come escort me home on my bike incase they followed.

What should I do? Should I inform the cops? Should I have acted the way I did? Did they just want to have a friendly chat but my panic kicked in magnifying the situation? Was I in the wrong?

Some things to clarify: There was no map or anything at the stop, really no reason to stop there if you don't need a bathroom break (which they didnt). Finnish cars require to have license plates at all times (no vanity plates allowed, plates front and back) and have to have fully functioning lights. I was on an electric bike, and I had a decent sized backpack with me. I wasn't wearing anything flashy, only clothing piece worth anything a beat pair of black Vans. I had my phone with me and I was on it when they pulled up. They did not do anything to me physically, no threats, just creepily asked to ""come closer"". They did not seem to be intoxicated in any way, but were smoking something (probably just a cig, couldn't tell)

Still quite shaken up, sorry for mistakes

TLDR; Was out alone quite far away from home and was confronted by 3 people with multiple face tats in a car without license plates, who asked me to come closer, and I rode away and hid not knowing if they followed.

214,"My stepbrother and his wife have three girls, all under 5 years old. They split up about 6 months ago when he found out she was padlocking them in their room during the day so she could do what she wanted. He works 12-16 hours a day at a plant, but that's no excuse when your children are clearly showing signs of being abused i.e. not talking, shying away from everything, wincing when voices are raised/laughing, always dirty and in either full diapers or gross underwear. My mom and I bathed them and got them clean clothes every time they were dropped off because they were basically mud children.

I haven't seen mom since before they split because she actively avoids us, also knowing I will beat the living shit out of her when I see her next. This is a woman who left her husband and kids during Harvey to go party. Completely unfit mother and neither of them should have had children.

Anyway! So, on Friday, I pull up to drop my dog off at my mom's so I could go to work (her dog and mine are bffs and the last time we didn't come over, her dog became really depressed and upset, so now it's a must lol) and my stepbrother's car is in the driveway. I didn't approach because he's not a good person in my eyes (alcoholic and bad temper). I went into the house and told my stepdad he was out there so he could go see what's up bc it's 5:30am.

He tells my stepdad that he's giving the children back to their mom and he's going to move to another state. He knows the type of mother she is, we all do, but basically he didn't want to be a father anymore. Once the rest of the family found out, they are currently trying to figure out how to do this because three girls with behavioral issues is a lot to deal with for even two people. I am not capable of parenting children, but there has to be something that can legally be done to prevent those babies from going back to their terrible mother. 

I have no idea what can be done, but everyone is willing to take them. The mom wants them back though, because the dad said if she took them back, he would pay $250/week to take care of them. We all know, as she has shown in the past, that she will spend the money on herself like she did when they were together.

The main thing is: we don't want the girls back with their mother. We know they will be abused and neglected. What can we legally do?",08Jul2018,2

222,"I went out to a movie today with a big group of my friends and she came along too, even though she isn't really part of this group, but she's been hanging with us more often. I kinda wussed out I guess and made no moves, here's why:

I really, really like her as a friend and I don't want to ruin that. She is someone I trust entirely and can always seek support from if I require it.

But since about 3 months after we first became good friends, my crush on her has only grown. In fact, it's now at a point where I find myself unable to sleep because of it. I really really want to ask her out, because it will give me the closure I require and hopefully fix my sleep issues. Some nights I get very depressed about it, usually if other things already have me feeling down. On these nights it gets to the point with it physically hurts because I can't hold her close and be with her.

There's a decent chance she likes me back. For example, one time we were binging the second season of stranger things and she slept on my shoulder, hugging my arm. She's also told several people she thinks I'm 'cute' so there's that.

So here's what sleep deprived me is currently thinking. I ask her out. This gives me the closure I require. But here's the thing, it could go two ways. Either she says yes and everything is amazing, or she says she doesn't feel the same way and everything sucks. If she says no, I end up getting even less sleep - worse, I lose the great friendship we have. It becomes awkward and I slowly move myself away from her, for the sake of fixing my mental health or whatever.

It's shit. Even though I feel pretty confident she might like me back (also, we just shared lengthy, kinda tight hug, granted everyone was hugging each other goodbye but you know), theres a likely chance that she doesn't like me back and she just sees me like a brother or some shit. She's the kind of girl who has mainly male friends and all that which is why I feel there's a large chance I'm just a really good friend to her.

I guess I'll list all the reasons she might like me:

* she slept on my shoulder 

* she some times rests her head on my shoulder

* whilst in a conversation with another mutual friend, she called a girl who i hung out with at a party once a b****. Honestly, in hind sight the girl was kind of trashy eg. Not the brightest, smokes weed at the age of 16 and probably before that too, dresses very revealing. But I don't really think she's a b****, I think this was just her maybe being a little jealous? 

* she just shared a longish, tight hug with me

* she generally sits pretty close to me, enough so that our shoulders touch. 

* on a few occasions she's told people she thinks I'm cute, also she hasn't expressed a will to date me or that she likes me. 

Reasons she doesn't like me:

* it's all in my head
* she's just one of those girls who hangs out with guys
* I'm just a really close friend of hers and she sees me like a sibling. 

tl;dr: I like this girl and it's causing me to not be able to sleep. I really want to ask her out but I fear rejection. If she rejects I don't think anything will be solved, it'll just be worse and I'll lose our friendship. Theres a few reasons why she might like me back but it's also likely I'm just a brother to her.",08Jul2018,2
223,"So I'll try and make this as quick as possible. 

I left school at 14 no qualifications. Mucked about for a few years before going to the army for 3 or so years. when i came out I got a decent job as a training consultant.

Kid was born and i became a stay at home dad for 15 months or so. 

Eventually i come across a company that hires ex forces people into positions that would usually require degrees from university providing they can pass a couple of assessments to prove they are up to standard.

So i surprised myself and passed , went and bought a new suit alongside stuff for the job etc
 Then it came they want to do a basic disclosure check on me to start work which although not unusual is really gunna fuck me. 

I've got 1 unspent conviction from prior to army service and I it's cost me jobs in the past. Usually around 3 weeks in the check comes back and im let go. 

Most jobs i dont even get replies when i apply. The only jobs i can get due to experience and crb checks are 0 hours contracts at mcdonalds and sports direct etc. Jobs that go nowhere. 

Its so demoralising and im at the point where i cut my own nose off to spite my face to avoid going through depression again.

This is my one shot to get my career on track and show them and myself what I can do. And I've got this horrible feeling because of the background check they're going to just let me go.

So first thoughts were just go and see but to be fair its 12-16 qeeks of unpaid training prior to starting and i cant afford to be spending 3 weeks not earning to go to work to be told sorry we have to let you go again.

225,"I'm a black girl who hasn't actually dated yet (not allowed to). But I've realized that I find asians especially attractive. I'm open to dating all races and it wouldn't be a deal breaker, but I just find them attractive and seem to be more drawn to them. (I must admit I did have my weird weeb phase when I was 13/14 while I was learning japanese, so I did end up having crushes on a lot of the guys I saw on Japanese TV shows/news/youtube etc. Thankfully I've grown out of that and I'm much more comfortable in my skin.)

When I confessed this to a (black) friend of mine she said I was a race traitor. This really hurt a lot since while I've had problems relating to other people of my race I would never be ashamed or go out of my way to avoid dating them.

Would people think I'm self hating for dating outside my race? I've always seen online that black women are at the bottom of the totem pole when it comes to dating, and it makes me so depressed to think that even men of my own race won't want me. I want to date whoever I want but I'm so confused about who I should and should date/marry. 

I ashamed to admit that I have become quite cautious of the idea of dating black men though, since my mother has also almost put me off it. She's a very pro black person. She loves the whole empowering black women movement and is very very outspoken when it comes to talking about equal rights, women and racism. 

One thing that confuses me however, is the fact that she has told me contradicting things about dating black men. Due to very very bad experiences with Jamaican men (including my father), she has told me that she would be disappointed if I were to date a Jamaican because he would become a deadbeat if I got pregnant. She's also come home almost in tears after being looked down on, sneered at in the street, and called a ""black bitch"" on several separate occasions. She had called me into her room to tell me to ""swirl"" if I wanted to date, but if men of my own race don't find me attractive, who else will?

228,"So long story short I hit it off with a coworker and caught a little bit of feelings. I shot my shot and asked them to lunch and it went well. Towards the end of lunch they mentioned in passing they already had an s/o which surprised me to say the least. I didn't acknowledge it or say anything about it but I kind of clammed up and it definitely got tense and awkward. I got so into my own head that I can't even remember anything I said after that sentence. I didn't say anything to them the rest of the day after lunch which was already noticeably weird.

Thing is I was (and still am) frustrated with myself for setting expectations in my head for myself and being hurt when they're not met. It's not like I wouldn't want this person as a friend if they weren't the opposite gender (since they're cool as shit and completely opposite of my very insular and closed friend circle) so why did I pull that incel shit? I'm worried this got misinterpreted as actual incel shit.

I've considered apologizing and explaining what happened when I get back to work but I feel that overtly acknowledging what happened (even though in my own head its obvious) could backfire completely since what if it \*was\* all in my own head? I highly doubt it but it's possible. On the other hand if I don't apologize and just carry on like nothing happened and it \*was\* a big deal, I feel like that'd show I'm not actually sorry about how I acted and don't regret it.

I call into work saying I can’t make it in until they just terminate my employment due to my inability to show up to work. My life has been totally fine for most of it. Aside from a childhood friend that committed suicide, I had a good childhood and so on and so forth.


I’ve tried everything for my depression. I’ve been on medication and have never skipped a day of taking it, and it just never worked for me. I’ve tried self medicating with marijuana. I’ve tried changing my diet, my sleep schedule, sleeping more, sleeping less, exercising, moving to a new town, going on crazy adventures. I’m not satisfied. I’m depressed as fuck. I’m incredibly sad all the time. I can’t grasp the thought of going to work everyday. I’ve been officially diagnosed with it as of two years ago and have since tried three medications and two different therapists. My brain will not allow me to feel good. I sleep a stupid amount or not at all, my diet takes a dive based on the fact that I have zero appetite, I become anxious, irritable or just plain immobile.

I feel horrible for my girlfriend (she lives with me), because she’s stressed about how we’re going to pay our bills because I’m unemployed, but I know I’m in no position to go back to another job. I look and feel horrible because of this. Where do I go from here after everything I’ve tried? I’m not suicidal. I mean, I’ve never planned or thought up ways to kill myself, but there are days where I *wish* I was dead. Like I wish I just didn’t have to live and do real life anymore at all.

I’m hoping someone else feels the way that I do and can shed some light on how to get myself in better shape, because right now I feel disabled. Like I feel like I’m totally debilitated because of this. I can’t accomplish anything. I never want anything at all.

I would fight with other kids for looking at me funny or calling me names. A few times I would verbally abuse teachers because I would feel uncontrollable rage when I was scolded. It could have gone so wrong for me, but I pulled through and got into a good university.

But as an adult, things have gotten really really scary. Anger has ruined my life and my relationships. My inability to control my seething anger from even the smallest slights against me has lead me to:

- Lose several friendships that I treasured dearly

- Be arrested and nearly charged with assault

- Be banned from several bars and clubs where I have got into fights with bouncers

- Embarrass myself publicly, eg. Swearing and screaming in broad daylight when a machine I was using stopped working

What I have discovered is that I simply CANNOT handle when people talk to me in a stern tone of voice, when I am criticised, or when my plans are disrupted/technology fails. All of these things send me into a blinding rage.

I’ve tried everything. Therapy has only been a temporary fix. The old “count to ten” strategy never worked for me because in the moment all I can think about is getting vengeance on whoever I feel has wronged me. I’ve lost friendships and have deeply annoyed the friends I still have because they’re sick of my anger outbursts, and while I understand their position, it’s very upsetting for me because I genuinely feel like I can’t help it. I’ve been angry my whole life. I just can’t change no matter how hard I try.",08Jul2018,3
235,"A co-worker's phone broke. It slid off his lunch bag and his screen was shattered. He makes a big scene about it and says who broke my phone and no one came to own up to it. I was working with him in the morning at the time. He asked if I did it once I said no. He talked to me a month later telling me that someone saw me do it. I did not break his cell phone. This co-worker will not listen to me at all and he's calling me a liar. Because if I were to confront him about this will be the 4th time we talked about it and I might get heated cuz he's calling me a liar


I've only worked at the shop 2 months and two weeks.

Should I just be the Fall Guy or should I just be really vocal about it and tell my coworker I didn't do it.


Yeah I feel like it's a no-win scenario trying to stand up for myself and I should just leave with the notion that someone thinks I did it",08Jul2018,1
236,"I'll try to make this simple because my life has gone to shit since this happend and idk why. I have been on midnight shifts for maybe 4-5 months prior to being robbed so my sleep scedule is poor. Well, I wake up to some rustling upstairs (I live in the basement at my parent's house.). I walk up the stairs and open the door to a one man with my living room tv in his hands. I think to myself ""What the hell is this guy doing?"". I had no idea no one was home so me being the person I am follow him outside to find out what's going on. Well, I step outside to noticed 4-5 other guys one my age and the rest of them between 30-50 tattoos, wife beaters, and a fucking hammer. I don't know why but I confronted them, I'm 25 have a temper and deal with things not caring about the outcomes. They started asking me about a phone and my sister's exboyfriend from 2 years ago. I knew nothing about it I tried telling them that but they seemed to no believe me. I can't really remember but a couple of them tried idk man handling me punching me in the face and trying to take me to the ground. At that point I tried to de-escalate my self saying that the man they were looking for I hated him aswell. They seemed to settle down. Well, I don't know why I had my phone keys and a weapon in my room. They had a stolen car outside and already took off with my TV. While they were distracted I tried walking back into my house but they started chasing me. Ending up at the door where I'm pushing for my life. They guy with the hammer and the man my age were trying to trap my in my house. What I did was while they were pushing the door (This man's bicepts were easily the size of my legs) just let the door open allowing them to fall in. I quickly ran outside and screamed the loudest I've ever screamed before ""HELP SOMEONE HELP ME"" . I knew my neighbors close by had weapons and I was completely defenseless. This seemed to make them question what they were doing. I felt great that I got away and quickly called the police. They were all arrested with a very long stand off for some reason. I went to work that day and everything seemed fine... Now I don't know where to start.. But ever since then I've felt completely useless.... I quit a job with people I love and care about for no reason at all. I ignore people now that I never have before. I was walking to my car at 11PM at night which is normal.. I heard some rustling and felt so much fear and anxiety. I just want it all to end, I'm trying hard but I need some help or advice that's why I'm posting here. I don't have many people to talk to about it. They said I could sue... I just don't even know I feel like doing nothing. ",08Jul2018,1
237,"I have no clue what to do. I’m an extremely hygienic teenager, like washed hands multiple times a day for no reason, showers 1-2 times a day. I hate germs, or the thought of being dirty / smelly, however, recently it has been extremely hot, and my sweat has been leaking through my trousers, shorts. This in itself isn’t that hard to hide, but the fact that at school we have those classic shitty plastic chairs, which are a magnet for sweat marks. It’s horrible having the anxiety to stand up and look down at either a puddle of sweat or a small circle, I have anxiety about people seeing it, idk what to do. I just hope this heat goes away 😖",08Jul2018,2
238,"This is going to sound ridiculous, so sorry in advance, lol

I have a neighbor who has always been the classic weird neighbor.  Nothing really outright wrong, but just stuff like asking my childhood friend to ride his mower every day for weeks back when we were kids, or making a facebook post about his daughter wearing her mom's silk bathrobe and not being able to look at her because she's sich a woman, etc.  

He recently got a plastic owl and had it on his wood pile for weeks.  Then, after we got a pool installed he moved it to the fence between our yards.  My boyfriend went to go swimming and noticed that its head was moving every few minutes from the pool to his shed.  We thought it was creepy and took a few pictures to show our friends the next morning.

Then when we got home from work, he had moved it to the wood pile again.  Then the next morning to the grill near his back door and a door to our basement.  The next day it was b.s. k on the fence but facing the other direction.  Then this morning its head was facing our pool again when we took the god for a walk.  When we got home frkm our walk it was moved back to the grill.

I know it's probably a solar powered scarecrow, but part of me cant shake the feeling that it's a camera.  Does anyone have any ideas why he would be moving this thing every day, or if there would be any way to make sure its not a camera?  I can't shake the feeling that I'm being paranoid, bit also that he *would* set up a camera to watch his neighbors",08Jul2018,1
239,"There's a problem. I used to be severely depressed, but not anymore. Now I want to live. The issue is that it isn't working too well. How ironic that as I finally want to live, everything seems to suggest that there's nothing meaningful.

I work out and roller skate. I run, draw. I hike. Bought a drawing pad. I study languages, started playing the piano. I started studying and got a job. Started writing. I have a lot do to every day. But it's the same all the time.

I go out for a run, there's the two roads I can take. I stop, and realise I don't want to take either. So I just take one of them. It's boring. Sometimes I sneak to places I'm not allowed to go. That's fun. But the places are running out. I go out to roller skate, there's one good road, I skate it back and forth.  
I start to draw. I make a drawing, time has passed. Yay. When I go outside, I need to listen to an audio book or an intense piece of opera, to distract myself that I walk on that same road and look at the same trees and hear the same people and see the same garbage on the side of the road.

Dishes start to pile up, I don't care if the fish went bad. I don't care if it tasted a bit funny. I'm not depressed. I'm actually in a good mood. I laugh at things. I enjoy finding out stuff. It's just that things don't seem to matter.

I enjoy running and skating. But it's boring. In work it's not really that bad, but I can't wait for it to be over, because it's the same thing over and over again and it's boring. I calculate math in my head like my life depends on it. Because it distracts me of the tedious task of doing the same thing over and over again. I try to exceed my ""score"" every day. Because it feels like an accomplishment.

I'm lonely. But the thing is, I'm an introvert. Not in a sense that I would be bad with people, or that I would be anxious of people. But that I don't really want company. I don't want to make new friends, seeing people annoys me. I don't want to take part in a new hobby that involves meeting people. I don't want to talk to my coworkers. It's not that I hate people, it's not personal. I just don't enjoy it. If you think I'm an ass because of it, it's kind of the same as claiming childless people are selfish, because they don't enjoy having kids.   
Hearing people have conversations, scream and laugh makes me feel like I'm an alien spying on humans. I analyze what they say, why did that one feel the need to raise their voice? That one made a joke to loosen the mood. That one tries to climb the hierarchy. That one changed the subject because they are uncomfortable. That one is secretly hangry. That one has a crush. I continue doing that even when I meet people. I'm never really ""there"". I'm in an observatory.

I want to study in a university, but it seems really far away. The only thing I'm willing to see other people for is if they are interested in those issues I am. Selfish? Why? I don't think so. I don't want to fake an interest, I think that would be immoral. But this is a small town, and I'm an adult. There's very little that has anything to do with my interests, and if there is, it's for younger people. I'm over 25.  
I make lists, lots of lists. I follow my habits and days and how I spend time. I make statistics like a madman, I make rules for myself. I need to do x, y and z for X, Y and Z minutes per day and make statistics. I need to read x number of books. I need to use x number of hours for this and this and this. Because it gives a meaning. Otherwise I think I would just let the dishes pile and the fish go bad.  


But I'm getting bored and my statistics seem to lose meaning. I start to lose efficiency. It feels like I'm being sucked into an eternalistic universe where past, present and the future are all equally real, my life being a uniform block.

I think I'll be slowly going nuts if this goes on, but it seems there's no other way to live life. I'm really not depressed, but think I would have to be a brain dead idiot to enjoy this in the long run. I don't even know what the issue really is. How do you live your life? What would you do in my situation?",08Jul2018,1

241,"I 17F had been in a relationship with a guy 19M for just over a year which he ended, as he felt i wasn't as emotionally connected to him as he was with me. At the time we were quite messy and had disagreements but eventually we ended up just being friends and everything went well. 

The time came when he found another girl, who he was hoping to date. Which was completely fine, i was really happy for him, i also had met a guy i was interested in. So when he told me about the girl, i shared how happy i was for him and thought i should share about the guy i was interested in too. But then he completely flipped and argued with me about him. After a lot of arguing he admitted he still had feelings and wanted to get back together, which i accepted. 

My issue is though, any time we had argued he would do pretty much anything to win. He can be a really vengeful person and he has shared some really horrible things he has done to previous ex's, so it leaves me kinda worried and stressed over have i made the right choice? All things said though he is also a really nice guy. Do you think this was a case of winning or something vengeful?  ",08Jul2018,1
242,"So my father owns an old Ford Ranger truck from 1998, and he got a really good deal on it from a coworker. Thing is, the truck gets extremely awful gas mileage, 12-13 miles to the gallon; we live out in the country as well, making it terrible to use as a normal car to drive around in.

I'm about to turn 16 and get my Driver's permit, and we have a family friend (who's practically my uncle) who has this old car that he recently fixed up that is very reliable. He doesn't want to turn it to the dealership because they'd only give him $1,000 for it (which is not a lot for him, and he spent about that much fixing it up beforehand) so he ""refuses to sell it"" and he wants to give it to someone who needs it. He wants me to have it, and this thing gets MUCH better gas mileage then the Ford Ranger.

Only problem though is that my parents don't want him to give it to me. They don't want to have to pay for insurance on another car, and they'd have to get rid of the Ford Ranger. However, like I said earlier, my dad doesn't want to do that because he got a really good deal on it, and it would ""upset"" his coworker. 

I've tried explaining that if I had our friend's car instead of having to use the Ford Ranger to drive around, I wouldn't have to spend so much money on gas (I have to pay the gas money if I'm driving around, and I will have to drive myself to school), but they don't want to hear it. My father would rather have his friend be pleased that his unreliable and old truck is being ""used well"" then getting rid of it and getting a much more reliable vehicle (that was recently fixed up) that gets much better gas mileage for free.

For reference to understand bad it's gas mileage is for me, it would cost me $5 worth of gas to get to my school in it, my paycheck would barely cover the $10 minimum each day, since I only get a few shifts a week (if any), I wouldn't be able to go anywhere else but school either (which is impossible since I've got to go to work as well). It also doesn't have a working AC, which is like a death sentence in Florida weather. 

So Reddit, am I just being ungrateful because ""your lucky you'll even have a car to drive when you're 16"" or is my dad being unreasonable since he'd rather please his friend then cut my gas spending a little over a half (friend's car gets 28 miles to the gallon).",08Jul2018,1
243,"I'm a very repressed person. Not just emotionally (although one would call me extremely rational). More like all around. Controlling how I walk, how I talk, how I behave at work, always trying to behave in a way that is kind and respectful towards others, while behaving like an adult should. 

Now deep underneath I would like to burn all of this to the ground with irresponsible behavior and not caring at all about anything. 

And I have a drinking problem. I wouldn't call it full blown alcoholism - but I do love to let myself go. Not just like to drink. I love the feeling of losing control over everything and just going with the flow because it's the absolute opposite of how I live my life. There's this extreme yearning for losing control. Lucky for me the worst that has happened in the 15 years of my adult life is getting a phone and wallet stolen / once. and that was years ago - however now I'm getting married, my woman does not like this behavior at all, which is understandable. It's something completely different than people who once in a while like to party (which is a lot of people in their 30s / nearly everyone I know), something in my eyes - she said and I kinda get what she means / it's hard to put a finger on it. It's like this darkness inside which only gets out once in a while but when it's out I finally feel free. 

The best comparison / explanation that comes to mind is the feeling that I would like to sing and dance when sober, but I am  not a good singer and my dancing sucks even more so you do not do that because it would not be appropriate, but after 10 / 15 drinks I dance like no one is watching and I'm soooo happy. And that is just one example there's others. (much more extroverted conversationalist than sober, sex stuff (monogamous with my partner / no cheating / although would I be able to cross this line? It does scare me.) 

Hence I would like to stop doing this. This drinking problem is quite easily overcome by willpower. I am not physically addicted. I am capable of setting a limit and just not crossing over it / ever. 

I also know that adding one more thing to control to my list of things I already control not to do is going to drive me crazy. 

To my understanding if I do not start being less repressed while eliminating my only venting mechanism (getting absolutely out of control wasted 4 times a year) I will probably be long term very unhappy which can lead to many problems. 

So what do I do? How do I become the Mr. Hyde without actually losing Dr. Jekyll. In all honesty without writing this explanation of how I fell I didn't even know what to google.  

Also therapy. meh. I've been going to therapy for 12 years, stopped two years ago and it helped me greatly overcoming my anxiety, building self confidence helping my career. But it made me even more rational and cold.

244,"Now, before you laugh (or after), there's a reason why i'm writing this: quite simply i don't have any other option. I know how ridicolously small the chances of this working are but it's not like i can do anything else and i don't consider giving up an option so might aswell.

I think explaining my situation in depth here won't do me any good because given its complexity it's impossible for me to cover everything, people will start being skeptical and i will use what little energy i have replying to everyone, people will still remain skeptical (because thats how it works) and i won't get anywhere. An extremely TLDR version: Severely ill through no fault of my own, can't afford the health care that i need, can't earn the money myself, can't have insurance, no charity will help and fundraiser failed. Add to this abusive mentally ill parents.

Again, i know what i'm attempting has a laughably low chance of working but i have no other option, if i did i wouldn't be writing this. It's my only hope. I have so many things i want to do in life and i'm never giving up. If i didn't become this ill at an age where most people haven't even finished high school, chances are i would have saved up enough for an occurrence like this one(or my parents not lying to me about how much money they had saved up would have worked too). If there's one thing i can learn from this is how crucial it is to be prepared for an unlucky situation like this one. When you're healthy and just living your life you don't think much about it, but when you fall into it you think oh i'm SO gonna make sure something like this doesn't happen ever again if i get out of it.

Will anyone here help me? The usual ""write a compelling and convincing mail"" obviously doesn't work, rich people get a ton of these and most of them aren't even in a real need, or are straight up scamming. You probably thought the title of this post was generic but i was thinking of a specific person. If i can understand how to appeal to that person i might have a chance, that's why i'm posting here. Please pm me if you are willing to help, thank you.

245,"I'm worried that I'm making a fool of myself with how I dress. I'm female, but i normally wear men's t-shirts, slim fit jeans, and a hoodie or shirt. Skinny jeans make me look beyond stupid, with my long twig legs and no ass. 

I have serious self-confidence issues, and non-uniform days at school were always the worst for me. All the girls would be in *incredibly* skinny jeans and t-shirts which looked about 3 sizes too small to show off their boobs, and would have so much makeup on. I'd be standing at the bus stop in my slim jeans, loose t-shirt and button-up shirt, with my flat chest and no makeup. Made me so worried about what other people thought. Those worries have stuck with me for years. 

I still don't wear makeup. Maybe some nice lip gloss on a fancy occasion when I have to dress up, but otherwise no. Should I wear makeup? In my opinion, my face still looks kinda chubby and childlike, and really, really plain. Plus I think I my hair looks stupid. I've been called 'kinda cute' by a couple of guys I dated, who I think I only got through personality. 

Should I just say fuck it, and buy some girly tops and dresses and learn how to put on makeup? And how tf do I stop my hair being all chunky and puffy around my shoulders? (Shoulder length, really thick hair) What are some things I could do with my hair to make it look nice (e.g ways to tie it up) ?

P.S. I have to dress fairly smartly for the next two days, while surrounded by judgemental people and people i look up to. I have some non-jeans and a plain t-shirt under a button-up shirt. Currently the only fairly smart, summer - appropriate outfit I own. Do I wear it for both days? ",08Jul2018,1
246,"As the title suggests, I know I am a pretty late bloomer when it comes to dating/romance. I'll give you a little backstory to understand why.

As a preteen/teen, I lacked a lot of confidence, mainly due to being overweight and pretty awkward. During that time, of course, there were boys and sometimes girls I found attractive enough to want to date or kiss. However, I was always too afraid of rejection and never really ""put myself out there."" Soon, as puberty-driven emotions began to fade, I found that liking anyone was rare, and that I didn't really know how or even want to flirt.

Now I am only very slightly overweight (still working on my health), and many friends have called me attractive. I have been on a date, though with someone I didn't like back, and every so often someone random will seem to be flirting with me. My confidence has improved a lot, but I am still lost on the flirting/attracting someone front.  I feel like I dug myself a rut in high school because of my low self confidence, because I missed the period of time where I was boy-obsessed to just sort of rip off the band aid and kiss someone. Instead, I am now very cautious about flirting and don't even know if I'm doing it right. I am quite closed off because I am unsure of who is even worth flirting with. Basically, I feel as if all the pure emotion has been taken out of finding someone to kiss, if that makes sense. Now, with college approaching, it feels like a deadline to be ""experienced.""

I feel like I'm almost there. I asked out a boy from my high school class over text the other night and he seemed enthusiastic about it. He seemed to want to see a movie with me and told me he'd plan a day to see one after he gets back from vacation in a couple of days. I'm just scared he'll ghost me, and I'll be back at square one. I am absolutely bored of most of the guys from my high school class and am at a loss for how to get some practice in and gain confidence in casual dating/flirting. 

How should I go about gaining more experience? Should I just flirt with anyone I find attractive? How do I flirt? Worst case scenario, is it really so bad going to college with barely any experience?

247,"I've basically fucked up my life, the past ten years (25-35) have been wasted and now I feel miles behind my peers in terms of where I should be in life, my life is far from where I want it to be and it seems impossible to even know where to start putting it right. Every time I think about trying to do something to change things I'm stopped by two things:

1. I've no idea where to start or what direction to go in, absolutely no idea at all how to help myself.  

2. I can't help but think about this past ten years, I'll never get those years back and although I know the longer I let it go on the longer I'd have wasted...I just can't get over and forgive the fact I've done so much damage to my life.",08Jul2018,1
248,"Ok, I really don't know where to even begin. But here goes. I am a little lost and I feel less and less control over my life right now. 

I am also sorry for the lack of structure and continuity in my writing, I am currently not thinking straight and I am not much of a writer so there will be many scattered ideas and thoughts across the text.

So, I just finished high school with almost perfect grades in every subject and I passed all final exams with very satisfying results. I have practically guaranteed myself a free-off-charge place in my local University (University of Latvia) when I begin university studies in September, however the rating of this uni. is below 1000th spot in the world so I believe I can achieve much more. I applied to University of Aberdeen for which I also won't have to pay as a citizen of EU and well, quite frankly I have a good chance of getting in despite the competition, because the rating of this uni is somewhere in the 100. I dont know yet if I am accepted but the chances are good. I really want to study marine biology btw, and it's not possible in Latvia, it is however in Aberdeen. 

The second thing is that I already have a solid work connected to biology in Latvia and I am more or less financially stable. And the thing that scares me is that I wont have this kind of work abroad, well not from the begining I guess. 

Another thing is my parents. They want the best for my future and in my home country the perspectives are limited. They do support my decidion if i decide to go abroad, however I have a house and grandparents 91 and 86 years old who need taking care of. I am also afraid of not seeing them again if I leave because of obvious age reasons. 

Love or maybe a really really really strong crush. I fell in love with a girl from my class in about march when we got really close and I think she has somekind of feelings for me too, now I know that is what every person who has fallen in love would say but yeah. We both are very shy and  can't express our feelings very well, I confessed to her  about a week ago because life is just too short to not take that chance, I thought I would get back a similar response, but I didn't, she did not say much on the matter. Yesterday she invited me to her house to spend a night, but everything between us is complicated so we didn't have sex or anything like that. I still have hope and I don't want to give her up, because she is perfect, we share similar interests yet are very different and it's what I am looking for. She has a perfect body and character(for my taste). I am not obsessed or anything, just probably in an unrequited love situation :/. And well yeah, She is another reason I would like to stay in home country. I have to mention that after this night I spent at her house I am more keen on leaving because I do feel sad and close to giving up yet at the same I dont want it to end like that. My parents don't know this part. And well life isnt always about what you want but more about what you have earned I guess. 

I understand the complicity of the situation and that is why I ask for help. There will be as many opinions as people but I just need something. I am backed into a corner.

I am sorry but I did not and probably wont add TL;DR because it is too long and compicated to shorten like that. ",08Jul2018,1

254,"As the long title explains, my dad is a horrible boss. He yells at me and his employees (mostly me), he constantly yells at me about how I “don’t care” about the company. 

He constantly get upset with the IT department because his computer doesn’t run fast enough, or his work iPad keeps crashing, or how he forgets login info, stuff that doesn’t really require the IT. 

Ok, got off topic a bit, he says I “don’t care” about the company, but I do, it’s just that none of the employees feel as though their opinions are valued, and that they feel like they’re mistreated. The other reason he says I “don’t care” about the business is that I’ve forgotten small tasks, not relevant to the business’s success (I keep forgetting to empty my trash into the paper shredder)

The SHTF Friday, when I brought up that his company has a poor turnover ratio (I work finances, so yes I see these numbers personally). He got super pissed off, brought me into his office, and said that if I have another “wise crack” like that, then I’m terminated. 

Ok, so I know everyone’s thinking, and it has to be said... he’s bipolar, it was a late onset for him, he didn’t use to be like this, and he’s told me on his better days, that this is why he’s ready to retire and pass the reigns to me.

I need some encouragement for these next two years (more like 2+ years, as this won’t start until the next calendar year). I really care about the business which is why I’m a white belt in Lean 6-sigma and soon to be a yellow belt, I want to implement L6S into the company to increase efficiency, and increase worker morale, whilst also being receptive to what the workers have to say. 

All the tips, encouragement, and other kind words are appreciated. Thanks :) ",08Jul2018,1

257,"May be a little long, bear with me. My 3 buddies and I have been good friends for about 10 years, starting in high school. To be Frank, our hangouts usually consist of smoking weed and later on in life drinking. It never got too rambunctious, we to this day, usually just watch movies, talk about social issues, and bullshit around with each other. One friend, we'll call him Chris, took the leisure to an extra level though. Throughout the years we had experimented with a few other drugs, but I'm talking once or twice a year. However, Chris was usually the one to introduce the drug to us and would have already trialed it out ahead of time. The rest of us grew out of the expirimentation phase and still drink/smoke, but sadly Chris has acknowledged his abusive habits and now hes a full alcoholic and will admit to it.

Chris still maintained a steady income, and he's always been very close to another friend in the group, James, and they decided to split the rent on an apartment together about 7 months  ago. They had lived together before so they had an idea of what to expect from each other, and although Chris has had a homeless bump in his road before, he still seemed stable enough at the time for James to trust him. This past Spring though Chris decided to quit his job because drinking had become a priority. Hes now in the hole with bills, and James has expressed concern on losing their place and even having to rehome his cat if chris cant get himself back together soon. We also live in a different area now, where the environment is a little more harsh for someone homeless to get by.

James and I decided we want to sort of intervene with Chris, but aren't too sure where to start. Chris is self aware enough to acknowledge his problems and hes bright enough to build a resume and get back out there, but I'm not sure if the willpower is there. I'd be happy to take him to get a haircut or some new clothes to help boost him up, but I don't want to cross a line where I'm enabling him. Hes already pretty reclusive, so I'm not sure if an ultimatum will even do much, but I hate to sit there and watch his life fall apart anymore. I'm also trying to support James for the worst case scenario of his lease falling through. We're taking the week to brainstorm how we can talk to Chris and offer him solutions, so I suppose I'm looking for some advice on what we can do. Thanks all for reading and any input

Tl:dr one of our longtime friends is in a downward spiral and its affecting the living situation of another friend. What can we do to intervene and help?

261,"Long story short, about a year ago I moved across the country by myself to a state where I knew no one so I could start college as a 22 year old. Things didn’t go as planned so I had to enroll in my university’s satellite campus in a *very* bad city. I found a single to live in that was month to month, in the same house as my landlord (I was on the third floor while they were on bottom.) 

I moved in during the fall and started school. At first I thought my landlord was an extremely nice senior couple who enjoyed having people to talk to since they lived in such a bad neighborhood (the husband worked nearby in another city). They also liked to host a lot of foreign exchange students, so I ended up spending time with people from Europe, South America, etc.

Again, long story short, one girl from Italy moves in. For some reason the landlord (wife) and my other roommates really wanted me and this new girl to date. We start getting closer despite our differences, and personality wise we didn’t consider each other our types.

Yesterday we got in an argument and she told me a lot of things like how she only stayed with me because she felt bad for me (I had no friends or family nearby) and that my landlord was trying to kick me out for months. Apparently I’m the worst person she has ever met (italian) and that my landlords hates me too. My landlords are conservative, extremely friendly but It was all an act. They are from the south and are legitimate racists who have expressed their hate for black people to my other, neutral roommmate. The Italian girl said the landlords didn’t have the heart to confront me about it so for about 6 months now I have been living in a house paying rent on time every month only to find out that these people were manipulating me, pitying me, playing with me and using me (for giving other tenants rides and such). 


For the first time in my life I feel extremely lonely. I want to leave her as fast as possible because I think the girl I tried to date is crazy as I started crying in front of her and she started laughing in a very unsettling way. I haven’t eaten in 2 days as my appetite and anxiety has skyrocketed and my next class starts tomorrow. Because of all this mental/emotional bombardment I failed my previous class which never happened to me. 


I have a few thousand dollars saved and my car can fit all my things. I feel like a fucking idiot and have no one to go to. ",08Jul2018,1

263,"So here’s the backstory. 28 year old female. I have always had a bizarre interest in politics since I was little. CSPAN would fascinate me. I remember being 8 years old watching The American President trying to figure out exactly what all the characters job titles and duties were. I excelled in any history or related class in high school and was taking college level. I would go into Barnes and Noble and buy books on foreign policy and economics to read for fun. Here’s the problem, until this past year, I was finally diagnosed with ADHD. I also had some serious childhood trauma that I never addressed and it would cause me to get distracted by emotions, debilitating anxiety and intense insecurity in college around men. 

It wrecked havoc on my studies in college. Add freedom and hard partying as an escape. It was a recipe for failure. Even though I excelled at all my political classes in college, I could  ace those even having partied until 4am the night before. If it was a class that wasn’t related to my interests, I found it impossible to concentrate and without putting forth serious effect due to late nights, I started failing and dropped out.  

I ended up getting an okay paying administrative assistant job and have been doing that ever since. I felt bored and just a low achieving paper pusher. With the crazy political landscape in the last 2 years and figuring it would help my boredom, I volunteered with Planned Parenthood. I offered to write letters to the editor and was offered a spot in their local Speakers Bureau. Within 4 months, I was chosen to be flown out to DC for their national conference and trainings on their dime. Now, this is amazing but all volunteer. I was essentially told without a degree an actual paying job in politics would never happen. 

I finally addressed my childhood trauma and untreated ADHD within the last year. I stopped partying due to boredom on the weekends and eliminated toxic people from my life. I realize going back to college is expensive and a degree in political science fully online would not work. I want to be able to do internships and interact with the professors. I would have to quit my job in order to go to classes full time on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I then would have to get a job where I can work M,W,F and hours on the weekends to support myself. 

Should I now go for it? Or it is to late/financially risky?  Any advice would be helpful. Thank you! ",08Jul2018,2

265,"Okay this one needs context (TL;DR at bottom)

When I was 13, I got into a relationship with a girl. During this relationship I realised that I like guys aswell and am bi so I tell her. She dumps me. We became extremely close friends after the relationship was over and, because this seemed wierd to other people at that age (that a guy who likes girls has a friend who is one), I came out as fully gay despite knowing that I still like girls. Everyone accepted me and all was fine.

Fast forward to present day

The girl and I are still extremely close best friends (closer than most people I know in actual relationships), however, I love her very much and want to fuck her. This is a problem because everyone (including her) still thinks im gay and it's been that way for many years.

My Dad (who I don't live with) told me that there's no way someone would be going that long unless they basically kept on relapsing.  Can someone explain how methadone and the clinics work? I've seen some stuff searching on google from here of people abusing it but I just don't really understand the situation. I live with an 11 year old and 6 year old brother too, so I'm really debating doing what it takes to protect my brothers and calling cps.

I've also found some Gabapentin in one of her drawers, and it's not a drug I've heard of but I read that some people abuse it but she does have terrible teeth so it's possible she was using it for tooth ache but I have my doubts. It was in a cigarette sleve btw so not legally gotten

My grandmother lent her 5k(just learned) along with myself lending 2k and it's gone and there's really little chance I'm getting my money back and I just want to know where the money is going and access the situation from there

I'm just trying to get more of an idea of what's going on here, like the possibilities of what she's abusing and so on. She was going to the clinic because of pills btw(i think oxy or something similar). She's also been very sick to her stomach lately saying she's coming off the methadone but something is telling me it might be something else. I'm also really scared what will happen if she gets off the methadone, like if she gets on pills again or heroin or fucking fentanyl. (RIP Peep :/ )

I found a plate in her closet with a razor on it, so I know he's doing coke in the house now. I really want to knock this losers teeth out right now. There's also one of those masks people use for sleep apnea in a box and I'm not sure if that's used for anything and there was also a tube long looking thing near the plate.

274,"Hey Reddit. I’m an 18 year old female who started college about three weeks ago for the Summer semester. I’ve always been the kind of person who didn’t go to any parties in high school and was never interested in getting super intoxicated or high on weed or anything at all... ever. In fact, I’d always been super against how stupid people get about smoking weed (like... who cares if you do it. It’s not a bad “drug”, let’s be real. However, it’s still Schedule I and it’s illegal so like... be smart about it. come on.) ANYWAY, when I started college I realized a few things about myself: 1.) I need to put myself out there and 2.) I need to let loose. So, I started getting to know this guy who graduated from my high school two years earlier than me and is currently staying in my college town (he attends college 6 hours away from my college town and we’re four hours away from our hometown). So, big fucking coincidence that he’s literally across the road from me and my dorm. Anyway, he invites me to some small get together in his apartment (everyone is smoking but I’ve been trying hard to ‘let loose’ and not feel uncomfortable with that environment because literally everyone here smokes weed so yeah) I met new people everything was A-OK and another time he invited me to watch a movie with him and he happened to be super cool. He invited me to a frat party at his college 6 hours away and it sounded like an opportunity to get out there and see what this college shit is like and I heavily contemplated going because I had a bad feeling about it, I almost backed out last minute but I didn’t. To make a long story short, the idiot was going 120mph in a car that smelled like marijuana and once stopped, was subjected to a search that ended up seizing pounds and pounds of marijuana (I’d never seen some shit like that in my life) and lead up to the arrest of the three individuals in the car and a lone survivor (aka me). I was two hours away from my college town and had to wait for my friend to come down and pick me up and take me to my dorm. Crazy. Anyways,I’m lucky because the police were nice to me and let me go- I assured them I had nothing to do with it and it’s true. Couldn’t they have easily arrested me, too? It smelled like weed in there and there’s bags and bags of it in the back. Also, could I be called to testify if I was released at the scene? If I was released is it even possible for them to change their minds and get me in trouble, too? I was read my Miranda rights and everything (I thought I was going to be arrested and started bawling). I never thought I’d be in a situation like this. It’s looming over my head. Any advice?

My life is a little bit unusual and requires a little explanation. I am 22 and an Australian citizen. I have lived most of my life abroad and travelling due to my father's work, and so don't really have a fixed idea of home. My parents currently live in India, while I just finished college in upstate New York. I graduated with a degree in aerospace and mechanical engineering (but poor GPA of 2.85) and have struggled to find a full time job in the USA (most will not sponsor me because of my low GPA).

Currently I am working an internship at a steel plant in a small town in Michigan, and will be doing so until November. I got the job through my Dad, and can't work here full time. Most of my friends are still in the Northeast, and I would like to move back there (especially to a large city), but again the job search is tough. After November my options are:

1. Move to Australia to try and find a job (unsure how likely I am to succeed)
2. Move to Australia for grad school (either computer science or in education)
3. Stay in the US for jobs and graduate school

I'm kinda torn since I don't want to stop talking to her but I also feel that it is kinda stupid always having to initiate.

Also, let this be clear, I harbor no weird feelings or anything. I just want to be friends and stay that way.   
Any advice or anything would be greatly appreciated.",08Jul2018,2
291,"So I'll make this fast:   


I am 30, have lived at my parents house since I was 24... From 18-24 I moved away for college, then back, then back out. I graduated with my first degree in 2012 and during that time, I was in a ""serious"" band. We were trying to make it, which included hitting the open road. I didn't want to continue to pay rent on an apartment I would never be at, so I moved back home. I fully intended to make that band successful, but of course it didn't work out as these things so often do.   


By this point I'm 26. I also lost my job as a GM of a restaurant (restaurant closed), so I worked for a year in auto-refinance sales. I hated that life, never made enough money, got into more debt (personal loans to cover other loans), etc. I quit to try and run my own business from home, which was also not successful. I filed bankruptcy in 2016. 

After this, I went into a coding bootcamp that I thought would change my life. I lasted a month and then dropped out.   


Fast forward to May of 2017. I am 29. I went ahead and enrolled for a second degree, a BS in IT. I know I want to work in tech, so figured this would light a fire under my ass. I finished the degree in a year and I fell in love with programming and pursuing that as a career.   


**I have sent out hundreds of resumes, gotten a handful of interviews, and I finally have one return offer coming, but it is in Richmond, Virginia.**   


My mother has basically avoided the subject entirely. She was supportive when I first was in talks with them, but now that it has become real she keeps saying things like ""Don't go."" And I will ask what do you say? And she will say, ""Nothing."" My dad has had to even go as far as to tell her not to say shit like that.   


I have an opportunity within my fingers that would change my life. I've never made over $30,000 in a year, this job is basically double that and then some. It is an entry point into a career that could easily turn into a six figure salary within three years. 

Nobody in my immediate family has even one college degree, let alone two, and majority of my Dad's side of the family are in jail or alcoholics. I am single handily trying to change the future of my family, but it is hurting my mother in order to do so.   


I am essentially a buffer between my parents and have been for the last six years. They get along about 40&amp;#37; of the time and argue the other 60&amp;#37; of the time. My mom has me to complain to, which she does ALL THE TIME. 

I can't even show that I am excited to have independence again, financial stability, and enough money that I can actually get out and live my life. I have wasted the greater part of my 20's sitting at home staring at a television with my parents. 

I love my mom and my dad. There is no way I will be able to leave without hurting my moms feelings. I am conflicted on what to do. She has me so guilt ridden that I am tempted to say no to the offer and keep trying to find a job locally (something I have been doing every single day). 

She has major nesting issues, but only with me. My younger sister has basically not been in the house since she was 20, and my mom has no issue with what she does. My sister could move to England and she wouldn't care, but me, her son, it is an entire different story. I have been babied my entire life. She still will do shit like clean my room, go through my trash, wash things for me when I don't ask, etc.   


I have nothing in common with a lot of friends my age with real issues, families, and good paying jobs. I am 30 but feel like I am still 16 years old.   


Even when I have to go work, she guilt trips me ""Oh you aren't coming home for dinner?"" ""No, I am doing door dash to pay my bills."" ""Oh ok, bye.""   


How do I make myself happy without hurting others? Or is there just no way?   


TLDR: Mom guilt trips me into not pursuing my goals because it means moving out of state. ",08Jul2018,2
292,"My best friend has been trying to get this girl for a couple months now.  She likes him as a friend but nothing more, and he refuses to accept that regardless of what she does.  She has hooked up with other guys without telling him, bailed on plans with him and has even straight up told him that she’s not interested in a relationship.  Nevertheless he is still head over heels for this girl.  Recently he has been pissed at her for all he’s done for her and how little he’s ever gotten from her.  The other day her and I were hanging out and we ended up hooking up, I certainly did not use my best judgement but it happened and its over now.  A few days later I decided my best friend deserved to know what happened, so I decided to be a man and tell him face to face what happened.  Initially he seemed ok, but about 30 minutes later at work he passes out and an ambulance took him away, I was stuck at work so I was unable to come visit him.  The doctors said he probably passed out due to stress, since its a stressful time in his life (we just graduated high school and he is joining the military in a few months). He began to act more hostile towards me over text later when he was discharged. I haven’t seen him in person since this but he now really seems to hate me, I get why he is mad but I think everyone is overreacting.  I don’t really know what to do from here, a lot of my friends won’t talk to me now.  I think I should just give everyone a few days to calm down then try to talk it out, any advice is appreciated.",08Jul2018,2

He was 18 when he was charged with a DUI. It's been 8 years since then and other than the DUI, he has nothing else on his record. He would like to get his CDL and be a truck driver but he's worried he won't be able to because of the DUI. I know in our state it takes 10 years for the charge to not count (I guess?) but would he have to wait 2 more years to go for his CDL? Or would he be able to go for it now if he wanted?

296,"I acted badly to this person I look up to a lot, a year ago. I hate having to think about this all the time and trying to respond to it but I must. She posted screenshots of private messages that I sent her, on her public Twitter a year and two months ago (it was private at the time but her gf told me recently that she told her to not take down the screenshots so that I can be seen for the horrible person that I am) and now I feel bad that there's screenshots of me acting like a drunk maniac, with my username in the screenshots, on her public social media.

Someone just told me that they really like my stories and that they've never read any stories like the ones I wrote before. And the people on another place keep saying my avatar is cute and they like talking to me and stuff. And people on another place seem to like me too. And people offline told my dad that he raised his son good and that I'm very hard working and well-behaved.

Now I look like a bad person forever cuz those screenshots of me, with my username in it, on her public twitter are probably gonna spread all around from the haters and trolls that follow me and my life is ruined.

I wish that people could see the rest of how I am. I'm sorry that I got drunk and sent her terrible inappropriate toxic messages. I wish she would delete the screenshots of the private messages I sent her, from her twitter. I haven't messaged her in a year and three months, well I did send her one message three weeks ago with a google document of me apologizing and asking her to take down the tweets though.

I reported the tweets two different ways but the tweets of screenshots of me acting drunk and horrible, with my username in it, are still on her public twitter.

People on the other places keep saying they like my stories and they like me and stuff..

I don't know if I'm a bad person or a good person =( and I wish that she would take down the screenshots of me..

People on support discords told me if I can't talk to her, the person that thinks I'm a huge creepy stalker and wants me to never interact with her ever again, then to message people that are close to her. So I messaged her girlfriend a few weeks ago, and she told me that I'm a bad guy and a horrible person and that she told her to leave the screenshots up and that she wishes that I was dead.

I just don't know what to do..

There's a lot more to me than just what those screenshots of me show.. =(

I didn't want to be a bad person who someone that I look up to, shares screenshots of when my dad first started getting me a 12 pack of beer every friday and I kept sending her ""drunk"" messages and even without that I just acted completely clingy and horrible to her and now I'm a bad person forever and I just want to be good.. People at other places keep saying they like me and the stuff I make and stuff.. =(

She said stuff about me that isn't true on her twitter thread of screenshots of me, too.. on a twitter thread of a screenshot of me she posted, she replied to someone's reply saying that I'm ""obsessed with Hamtaro because I met her at a Hamtaro message board"" but that's not true.. She has nothing to do with why I like Hamtaro.. now these screenshots are gonna spread and she said stuff about me that isn't true in the replies to her twitter screenshot threads and I just wish that she would delete the screenshots of me from her public twitter ;-; I wish I knew what to do to ask her to please take down the screenshots of me.. I can't contact her at all.. I don't know what to do..

Sometimes when I would vent about how I feel about her in the past (without mentioning her username at all,) her gf would ask me to take down the post so I did. But now I see that she (not the gf but the gf's gf as in the person I'm originally talking about) has screenshots of me (with my username in it) on her public twitter and I asked her gf if she could get her gf to take it down, she said that she's the one that told her to leave it up so that everyone can see that I'm a horrible person..

May someone please give me advice on what I should do?",08Jul2018,1
297,"My wife has always wanted to move away, and I've always come up with a reason to stay, and each reason always involves others. First it was to be close to friends and family, and then it was to help out my younger sister who was having a baby too young, then it was a want to repair relationships, and then it was because we had a baby on the way and we wanted our child to have family nearby. But each reason has never materialized into much progress: a lot of my friends have moved away, my sister is still having babies, relationships are barely better than they were before, and none of my family seems driven to have a relationship with our child, nor have they been a huge help. The last of it is mostly because my own parents are tapped out helping my sister care for her kids - my mom is exhausted and my dad runs away nearly every weekend.

Beyond relationships, the work here sucks as well. I'm a software developer and the places to work here are few and far between, and the few here offer boring, soul-sucking work. My wife's work situation is similar to my own. So as another attempt to make our world work here has been me working with my dad and his company. I figured this could help kill a few birds with one stone: repair our relationship, get him more involved, allow me to better leverage my dad into doing whats right for my sister, and also give me the opportunity have free reign over my work. Like everything before it, it just doesn't seem to be going anywhere.

And the most important thing of all: growth opportunities for my child (and future children) are lacking here, at least by the numbers. Our academic scoring is among some of the lowest in the US and the majority of kids here are raised by ignorant parents (at least among the people we know the best). What kind of friends is my child going to be able to make down here? Is he going to grow up like me, feeling completely isolated from those around him because his interests don't line up with whats most popular around here? What kind of education is he going to get from his teachers, if we can't afford to put him into the best private schools?

I just don't know what to do anymore. There are so many cons to leaving, and so many to staying, it just feels like an impossible choice to make, and there are no guarantees that our problems outside of family relationships (careers, growth, education) will be made better by living somewhere else. And whether we stay or leave, our family is going to be going up against forces threatening to make us less than.

So what should I do? Or better yet, how can I come to an answer? I should mention that wherever we do move, we will have friends around. Our two choices at the moment are Washington and North Carolina.

""Ms. Prostitute
Yeah you-the one who always had the red light on in your window. I'll start writing down your address on the washroom walls of all the businesses I frequent in the city to drum you up some business.""

The background story leading up to this could be one of two options, a complete stranger has written this note for the first time in the 2 years I have had my grow light for my plants or a woman who got fired because she harassed me at work and threatened to kill me. She claims it was a joke, even though we were not even close to being on that good of terms due to her behavior. 
She called my supervisor at work who wasn't in control of her being fired he was just informed, asking for her job back. He never liked her, she did not interact well with several people except her few. She also bragged about how she was harrassing me at work to this supervisor, who did nothing. He has not control of it either way. The timing would add up and the handwriting from my memory is very similar. I know there isn't much I can do, but I know this woman is unwell. I also know what she could be capable of because my father was undeniably similar. Paranoid personality disorder. I know she is mostly psychological to begin with, so panic would be what she would want if the note is in fact from her. I'm thankful it wasn't on my back door. It's just very unsettling to know someone wants to even threaten of sending drinks to my place. Not that I think many would go for that but I'm a married woman. I go to work I do my job, and get compliments on my work often. My manager at the time didn't care about what she was doing and wanted me to just do what she wanted and tell her I was busy otherwise. Once someone was hired to do his job so he could focus on the business development, they actually cared about her threatening behavior and words and eventually fired her over it.

319,"Myself and friend (let's call her Anne) were friends, then she cut off contact for a few years due to medical issues she didn't want others knowing about. We've reconnected now (age 20) and are close again, and she's dropping hints and subtly flirting with me. Anne is lesbian and out to her family, who are cool with it. I'm bisexual, but I come from a very religious family.

If I came out to them, I have little doubt they would disown me, or at least refuse contact with me until I 'saw the error of my ways'. The problem with this is that I'm also Christian. I believe in God, but I'm not as religious as they are, and I support LGBT people. However, there's still a part of me that feels dirty, sinful, and horrible for liking women romantically. It makes me feel guilty and bad sometimes. I had always decided I'd just make peace with that part of me but avoid dating women, and just date men, with the hope that I'd find someone I love and then never have to deal with hating myself for it or coming out to my family. I already hate myself enough as it is, having a history of depression and anxiety issues.

On the other hand, with every moment I spend with Anne, I end up falling for her more and more. I 100&amp;#37; don't want to just not be friends with her anymore. When the idea of a relationship isn't on my mind, she'd one of the best friends I could ask for.

How do I deal with these feelings? I'm afraid if we date, I'm going to end up breaking up with her and breaking her heart to avoid the guilt and family dis communication (despite them not approving of LGBT people, I love them and have spent years trying to build a good relationship with them). If she asks, should I just explain all this to her, or how do I let her down without ruining the friendship? Or should I just fuck everything, and go for it?

P.S. Please no responses along the lines of religious debate, or suggesting I abandon my religious beliefs. Please.

325,"The title probably sounds really weird and this post will be disgusting, but I don't know where to go for this.   
Every time I have searched this on the internet, I haven't found anyone who knows what I am talking about.   
Let me explain.   
I am a 21 y/o girl who is fairly good looking and in a committed relationship with a really cute guy who loves to kiss me. I have clean, white teeth that I brush twice a day and don't have any visible dental problems. Except when I sleep. If I sleep for more than 3 hours (yes I recorded it), I wake up with a mouth full of foul tasting, yellowish saliva.   


The taste and smell goes immediately once I'm done brushing and rinsing my mouth, but the feeling of waking up with a mouth so full of saliva that I often end up drooling and then panicking and rushing to the bathroom to wash it off, is disturbing and affects my sleep at times.   
And...I don't mean to make this any weirder but...sometimes I have nightmares. Yes, nightmares of a particular kind. In these nightmares, I'm always in a social situation with a mouth full of saliva and i'm unable to speak and even if I rush to spit it out, I just keep spitting and there's no end to it. There's just more and more of saliva and then I wake up to find myself drooling because I've actually been trying to spit in my bed...and its a mess. My family that knows about this habit thinks its disgusting and I should ""stop waking up with saliva in mouth"" but I don't know how to! I've been doing this for more than 10 years now!   
Even if I go to bed after brushing vigorously and not eating anything, I still have that problem. And I'm afraid of sleeping in friends' houses because I don't want them to know about this. And even more, you must have guessed, I'm afraid of sleeping with my boyfriend who is a clean-freak anyways and having him find out about this disgusting thing. Please, don't make fun of me and help?

326,"To be honest, I have no idea what's gotten into me over the last few months. I have shuffled between jobs like crazy in the last little while, finding that I'm not happy with the positions I have been offered.

Ever since I was 14 (26 now) I have worked in many different restaurants, and because of that, have become fairly skilled in the kitchen. I moved to another city a little while ago, and found that I can't quite find a spot that seems to suit me well. My resume is fine, and 9 times out of 10 I get the job offer afterwards. What's really annoying, is that every single time I start at a new place, all the things I signed up for seem to mysteriously change. One of my common demands is that I would like a steady work week, and no more than 9 hours per shift (working in a hot-ass kitchen for that long has made anyone I ever worked with fairly useless by that point.)

These places always agree, and then shortly after starting, they expect me to do multiple 12 hour shifts in a row, with a very small break in between (if one at all). As I type this out, I'm actually on a break from yet another new job, and they're pulling this bullshit. ""Yep Wednesday to Sunday 11 to 7 or 8pm."" Now I'm on a fucking 12.5 hour stretch, and asking around the kitchen, I'm being told this is nornal at this place.

TL;DR: Would I come across as a bad employee for asking to stay within the originally agreed scheduling? I feel like most of these places would either cut my hours or just get rid of me once and for all.

Sorry if there are a bunch of formatting issues, I'm typing this out at lightning speed and getting ready for another 6 hours... Thank you for reading this.",08Jul2018,1
327,"A good friend from years ago moved in with me and my long term partner a few months ago. When she moved in I told her that neither my partner or I are comfortable with casual nudity, and that we would prefer if all of us were clothed in the common areas of the apartment. She agreed and jokingly (I thought) called me a prude.

Fast forward a month and while watching a movie in the living room with me, she was wearing only a sheet, which was frequently falling off/open. At this time, I again said that I did not want to see her naked. I apologized if wearing clothing made her uncomfortable, but that when in the common areas, we would prefer her to be clothed.

She then spent most of the next two months in her room with the door closed, rarely speaking to us.

As summer came and it got a lot hotter, she has begun walking around wrapped in only a sheet or towel again. I get it, it’s super hot so I didn’t say anything at first, but over the past few days, it has become more of an issue. She has been sitting in her room naked with the door open all the time. Her room is off a hallway next to the living room, bathroom and stairs. Her computer desk is immediately next to her door, so she is essentially sitting in an open door way naked all day and any time I am not in my bedroom I can see her clearly.

I told her she needs to wear some clothes around the house and offered her a sundress and a fan for her room to help her stay cool. She declined both. She has been putting on clothes while in places like the kitchen, but she is obviously upset with me for making this request. As I type this in the living room I can see her out of the corner of my eye, naked sitting in the open door way of her room.

I understand why people would want to be naked, I just don’t like it for myself. I feel like if you want to be nude it is respectful to do so in private. My partner and I are often gone in the day and weekends and she is home all day every day, so she has plenty of opportunities to be nude when we are not home. So right now, not only do my partner and I never have the apartment to ourselves(which is another issue altogether), but now we have to see her naked 30+ times a  day.

Am I within my rights at all to ask  her to close her bedroom door, even though it is hot? Am I being too harsh?  How do I approach this subject without making her feel body shamed? She has anxiety and I don't want her to think that I am angry at her, or feel guilty, but I want to be comfortable in my own home.",08Jul2018,4

333,"Hi all, 

I'm hoping this is the right place to post this. I'm a 20 year old university student from Ireland who is about to start my third of a four year course. I'm studying Entrepreneurship and Management, and over the period that I've been studying this, I've become increasingly aware this isn't what I want to be doing at all, and I have no interest in working in business. 

Ever since I was a child I've been interested in going into publishing or journalism ~ or just about anything to do with books or writing. In fact, the only reason I began the course i'm in is because I did poorly in my Leaving Certificate exams and I didn't have any other options. 

Due to how the Irish education system works, I don't have the option to switch to a course that I would like to do (something along the lines of Journalism or English Literature Studies); I would instead have to start another 4 year degree. As well as this, I would have to pay for the final two years of that degree out of pocket because we only receive four years of free education and I've already used two. 

Besides this, I have no idea if I would even be accepted into a course I wanted, even though I did resit some of my Leaving Cetificate exams and got better grades second time around. 

So my options seem to be to waste my time finishing a degree that I'll probably have no use for, to switch degrees and somehow find the money to pay for that (as well as have two more years of studying) or just drop out and go back to university as a mature student (22+ years old) later on. The problem with the third option is I'm afraid i'll never go back.

In fact, and this might be just ridiculous of me, I don’t like how photos are posted on the internet. It feels a little vulnerable. If I’m visiting my cousin in Trenton, New Jersey, the photo will go on the internet, and now people will know exactly where I am. I’m not worried that someone will stalk me online and come after me, but I want as little about me to be available online as possible.

But so many family members are visiting this summer, and they all take photos. When I say “I don’t take photos,” they keep pushing. The idea that I don’t want to take photos is completely trivial and nonsensical to them.

The worst is when someone takes a photo of me without me even knowing, and later on, I find out that it was posted to Instagram or to Facebook.

339,"My brother (20) has been doing nothing with his life. He has really pessimistic views of the world and people around him usually clinging to his phone or his xbox for emotional and moral support because he has never felt that he could rely on others. My dad is a culprit of this seeing as though they've been on completely different ends of the political spectrum and my dad talks constantly about the ""political revolution"" that is about to or has to take place in our country. 

Since my dad has a great fear of the future and mainly is concerned for his childrens well being in the coming future he is very passionate about his political beliefs. My brother is the same way just on the opposite end. Well they butt heads a lot and it's really difficult to be around them seeing as though it seems all they do is talk about politics. I love them both and want my brother to prosper in life... He hasn't been though. 

My brother was bullied as a kid and taught to shut out others. He also is very self conscious despite him saying and trying to act like he's not. He worries about his weight and what others might think of him and all that jazz. Well because of this he doesn't really go out much and he dislikes almost everyone he meets in real life (not really giving them a chance and making judgements before he can really get to know them). He's pretty self centered and at many times I found myself not liking his company because of this growing up.

I try and give him advice and how to talk to people and why he should give them more of a chance but he usually just claims he already knows these things or doesn't really care about anyone. I want to help him but I just don't know how... He's so wrapped up in his own head and refuses to do almost anything. He's ""tired"" most of the time and doesn't leave the house for days sometimes (he doesn't see anyone during this time).

Well recently my dad has had enough of his shit. He tells me that he's always disrespectful, doesn't help out around the house, doesn't work, doesn't pay any of the bills, doesn't cook, and doesn't help himself. So my dad has decided to kick him out... He says he can move in with my mom and I but I know he won't do well there either... I don't know what I can do or say to try and help him anymore.

What can I do to help him?

TLDR: My dad's sick of my brother being lazy. My brother is not sure what he wants to do in life and almost never does anything because of his insecurities. i've tried to help by encouraging him, discouraging him (in some areas), advising him, and trying to give him so initiative to go out, make friends and live life. He says he wants to but then never does... What can I do to help him from being kicked out/help him on a better path for life?

351,"I'm 25, live in the U.S., and have been out of high school for six years. I've been working retail and warehouse jobs since I graduated except for a year I was in the military immediately after I graduated ( honorable medical discharge ). I did programming with various languages and tools throughout my school days and participated in a bunch of activities from robotics to website development to code jams and game development. I lost a lot of sleep on school nights doing it but I just couldn't get enough of it, and I feel I was pretty decent at it as I won awards from companies like Intel and solved many people's computer automation problems on forums when I took requests. Even made a few tutorials and guides. I was happy to be known as the local kid that was a programmer, and I made many friends and acquaintances, some of whom I still message online today. I initially intended to use the military to pay for college and/or to give me more time to decide on what I'd do with my life, but after my sudden separation I fell into a bit of a rut these last few years with a big hit to my ego and borderline depression ( self diagnosed like most people ). Lost a lot of confidence in my intelligence and abilities and for a while was convinced that I'm just not very smart and am a failure.

Due to how little money I make I want to get into a career that will feel more rewarding and with better pay prospects than what I'm currently qualified to do, which is  retail. I have no college education and no certifications ( had my CompTIA A+ in high school but it's long expired ), and aside from a one month web development bootcamp I paid and participated in last year I've had no extra training related to anything programming related. I've done a few personal projects here and there these last six years, but none are of any real merit given how much time I've had in life to get better and probably looks like first year work. Usually I go several months without doing anything, then I pick it back up, get up to speed in the first two weeks, then start a project and either complete it or shelf it and then the cycle repeats. 

I've considered other professions aside from software development such as water treatment, truck driving, HVAC technician, deckhand, and a few others. They all pay better than what I make now and some of them are certainly more mentally stimulating, but I keep racking my brain at night thinking that I'm purposefully avoiding a career path I know I'd like for reasons I'm not too certain on. I could probably afford to do community college part time if I wanted to get an associates to leverage, or invest some time researching the tech job market in my area and plotting out books and other learning material to spearhead myself into being functional in that industry's toolset, but it all seems to come to a halt when I think about how little I really am involved in the field nowadays and that I can't see me ever getting up to speed enough to be seen as desirable for an employer.

I'm trying to figure out if I should seriously consider a career as a software developer in the U.S., and if so how should I go about doing it? I'm not totally against going to college to get a degree, but due to the cost and how it appears the industry has really had diminished need for candidates to have them I feel that if I did pursue it that I might be better served going through a bootcamp or self-study coupled with attending industry events. Software development is such a broad scope that I know I'm not being specific enough so even advice on how to narrow down the options would be very welcome.

**Extra side tid-bit:** The web development bootcamp course I took went over HTML, CSS, and Javascript, along with getting acquainted with version control, working with teams of 2-5 people, design and UX, etc. I did learn a lot of soft skills and got better insight into what a developer's life is really like professionally thanks to the instructors. The bootcamp had two more months to it but the last two months would have cost me 80% more than the first one and I was worried I had joined it for the wrong reasons. Towards the end the instructor I had did one-on-one discussions on what he felt each student should improve on, and I was told during my session ( paraphrasing ): ""I saved your talk for last as I'm not worried at all about you. You've been several steps ahead of everyone given your prior experience, and your classmates think of you as a mentor and value your input. I have no doubts you'll do very well in this industry ( web development )."". Him saying that really stuck with me even a year later and is likely a big contributor to me feeling more confident in re-considering doing something programming related professionally. Probably one of the biggest ego-boosting things someone has said to me that I wholeheartedly believed they said truthfully.",08Jul2018,1
352,"I know everyone and their dog comes to Reddit with relationship advice questions, and if I'm on the wrong subreddit please direct me in the right way, but I have never had as tough of a time with a breakup as I am now. We had made plans to fit into the rest of each other's lives, we were happy together, everything seemed to be going great. Then she became cold and distant and irritable, spent all of her time with some new friends and almost completely forgot about me. With each side still having feelings but things just not working out, we split and have remained in some small contact. That was a month ago. I've spent every day trying to keep myself as busy as possible and stay distracted so I wouldn't think it. But lately it's been starting to hit me more and more, I can't stay distracted, I wake up every morning and I just sit there thinking about what I should've done or why things went awry. What should I do to pull myself together here and get through this?



TL;DR?

I got dumped a month ago, we still talk. The impact hasn't fully hit me yet but it's going to soon. How do I get through this?",08Jul2018,2
354,"This song is actually playing in the background while I'm writing this. Not the biggest trouble I've ever had, but it's still something taking the zzz's away. My guy is going away on holiday to his homecountry - warm, sunny and expensive. The plan was for us to go together, enjoy a couple of days on the beach or wherever and go to his friend's wedding. The ticket alone costs half of what I make in a month. Add a hotel, food, dress for the wedding (unless I cut on that expense and use one of my current dresses - I have nothing showy, my go to look are grays, blacks and light pinks) and it rounds up to a sum that I make in a month. I currently have only that amount, so I'll be left with nothing when vacation ends. Also, until the rest of the year I've got 7 days free of work to use how I wish. If I take 5 work days it will leave me with 2 spare days for absolute necessities. 

I was supposed to save for those holidays, but I was unable to. Food, flat and school costs overpowered me. 

If I go and have a bad holiday, I'll be left with nothing but but bad memories and financial issues.

I have only met this aunt maybe once or twice and I know she has no recollection of me. My elderly father wants to go but will only go if I do because he doesn't like going out alone. He expects me to go with him and sees no reason why I wouldn't want to go. He also said it's my only opportunity to see some of my relatives from that side of the family (who I know a little bit more than the great aunt but still don't talk to them) for a while because our family doesn't get together; he is correct in this point. I really wouldn't mind going to the party if I wasn't doing something else but this is also the first birthday I am getting to experience with my boyfriend of 11 months, who wanted to spend the day with me and take me to an amusement park and dinner. I would try to do both but my aunt's party is 12-4pm so it takes up a good middle chunk of the day. Bringing my boyfriend to the party with me is also not an option because my dad basically refuses to acknowledge his existence and it would be a long car ride for the three of us.

356,"So I've been friends with this guy for several months now. I know several months is such a short period of time to say that I'm falling in love, but I am. I'm my happiest when I'm around him. He makes me smile, makes me laugh, and when he's not around I miss him... a lot. He's become the first thing I think of when I wake up in the morning, and the last thing on my mind before bed. 

Over the course of the last several months, we've grown to be very good friends. We talk everyday, several hours a day, sometimes even spend the entire day together.
However, there's a catch. We met online. I live in Toronto, Canada and he lives in Southern California. 

About 5 weeks ago he took the liberty of telling me that he likes me. I asked if he meant as more than a friend and he said yes. At the time, I only liked him in return and I admitted to that, but after talking to someone everyday practically all day, it was hard to now allow stronger feelings to develop. 

Last week we had a conversation about risk vs reward. I had told him that because I'm so scared of opening up to people, if he wasn't the first one to tell me he likes me than he wouldn't have heard it from me. He had said I shouldn't be worried about being vunerable because what if he was the same way, and waited for me to be the first to say something, than we may never know how each other feels. 

He's someone who always told me that he let's his actions speak for themselves. He has said he has no reason to lead me on and if he didn't like me he wouldn't spend as much time with me as he does, but I'm scared to tell him that I think I'm starting to fall in love with him. 

If I tell him, he might back away because he doesn't feel the same and if he doesn't that'd crush me. However, if I remain quiet than I may never know how he truely feels, which leads me to continue to invest my emotions, and I could wind up getting even more hurt. 

I'd rather keep quiet and keep him around, even if we're only friends than tell him how I feel and potencially lose him entirely. I don't know what to do.

357,"For context, her mother is ill and in pain and it's very nice and understandable that you want to help her (she's really in it for the money but idc at this point). Anyways, she was just ranting on about how she's ""gonna go on the deep web and buy diazepam"" and ""how all the college kids are doing it these days"".

I tried to reason with her but she just screamed abuse at me. Apparently I don't know what I'm talking about since it's to do with drugs and I'm immature for suggesting otherwise.

How can I explain to her it's an incredibly stupid and dangerous thing to do? I've told her pretty much anyone ""selling"" anything on the deep web will most likely (everytime) be a scam or the CIA or some shit.

361,"Hi I don't want to discredit or offend anyone with OCD, I am just legitimately worried and am wondering if these symptoms could be related to OCD. I understand that OCD is a serious mental illness and I'm sorry if his post pisses anyone off. I'm just getting more anxiety about this and it's been going on for the past couple of years and I guess I'm only now realizing it's becoming a problem. 

One major thing is I count everything. I tap my fingers constantly and count in my head without even realizing it and I always have to count by 2s and go up to either 100 or 50 and then I have to do it on the other hand and once on each finger. I have to do things with both my hands not just tapping. I also count my steps  and when I'm walking on the sidewalk I can only walk two steps on each square and never step on a crack. When I don't do these things I get really really bad anxiety. This is my biggest symptom. 

My room is a mess and I'm not a complete germaphobe but I have this thing where I have to organize things a certain way and if anyone else touches what I've done I get like an anxiety attack and start to tear up. Everything needs to be even for me. If it's not even it just messes with me especially if I can't fix it. 

Another thing is violent thoughts, I thought there was something just messed up about me but sometimes when I'm out somewhere in public I look at someone and I think the worst thoughts I thing what if they try to kill me or rape me, how will I fight them off. Or even at home I think about such violent thoughts like if a school shooting happened and I was there. I just can't get these things out of my head no matter how hard I try to stop thinking about it. 

One more thing that I don't even know if it can be related to OCD or not but I'm still gonna say. I can't stop thinking about this one guy. I used to have a crush on him for like all of junior high and now I'm going into grade 12. It's literally been five years and he has a girlfriend and I don't even think I like him. We used to be friends A LONG time ago but I don't know what my problem is. 

There are some other things that I can't think of right now but I'll write them down if I do remember. This might just all be in my imagination but i don't know.

362,"Some background: I am a trans guy who just turned 18 and graduated from high school. During high school I finished all my classes early and was able to take college classes at our community college and not have to go to my high school at all. Thanks to this, I finished my entire first year of my associate’s degree for free before I turned 18.  I am going for video game development. I am currently taking summer classes and after this I will have 2 semesters left and hopefully graduate in spring with my A.A.S. before I turn 19. 

I will be taking 5 classes that come out to 14 credit hours starting in September. I don’t think this is too much work for me as my first year I took 15-17 credit hours each semester. I get good grades (A’s and B’s) but have had some procrastination issues and now and then my depression catches up to me. 

Here’s where it gets hard. I’m moving out beginning of August. My mom is moving to California (We’re in OH) and I really like Columbus so I’m staying here. My dad still will be living nearby so I’ll have him for support if I need anything. I have 2 jobs at the moment (retail and entertainment at an escape room place, I enjoy both places which is why i kept both jobs) and I’m aiming to work about 30 hours a week total once autumn semester starts. I’m not too stressed about money as my living expenses will be low (my mom owns the apartment I’ll be living in so I won’t have to pay rent, just utilities and other expenses) but I want to work to save up money for surgery (top surgery). 

Here’s where I need advice. Will all of this combined be too much? Should I aim to take less classes and just graduate in an extra year so I’m not too stressed? I have a procrastination problem, and it’s getting better but I still put off most of my school work until the last minute. I also want to have free time to work on creating games in my free time and building my experience in the industry. I guess I just need to figure out if the stress of school, 2 jobs, moving out and transitioning will be too much. 

Any thoughts or general advice on time management, budgeting (?), or life advice for a young person moving out for the first time would be greatly appreciated. Feel free to ask more questions if anything I said is confusing. I mostly want to push myself to get better at managing my time and money but not stress myself out too much and be working 24/7.

363,"So I’ve been with the same guy for 5 years. We’ve had our ups and our downs. He’s been really on an up lately. Well call him A. A has been emotionally damaging in the beginning telling me I was ugly etc. he only does what he wants to do and doesn’t  even consider me. But lately he’s been  on his nice game. But when it’s convienant for him.


This morning for example I woke up at 830, he asked for pancakes which I was too tired to make, but made them anyway. I asked if he was going to sit and come have breakfast with me when they were ready and he wanted to have them in the den, in front of his PlayStation. Claimed he was too busy and to “forget about it. “ (after they were already made) and claimed he didn’t know I wanted to eat together. I just made us breakfast! What else would I have wanted. 

He’s all I’ve ever known, so it seems like this is just my path in life now. He’s willing to get married and have kids but I’m also all he’s ever known too. There’s occasional affection. But kisses only happen during sex and sex is a rare thing that we just do to do. It’s more like “hey wanna do this how” rather than a romantic, passionate thing. 

The last 6 months I’ve been communicating and  being extra friendly with someone I’ve met. Let’s call him B. He seems to understand everything about me. I tell him things I would never tell my current bo. We connect on so many levels that me and A couldn’t connect on if we tried.  We like the same books, movies, food, everything.  

I feel like if I give up A for B that i May regret it and lose both of them. I feel so stuck with A and feel like a butterfly who just got their wings with B. 


B just got out of college and is job searching. Im last college age and have a career and a home. A has been in a steady position for a while. A and I live together and b still lives with his mom.

367,"My girlfriend and I have been living in a lower unit within our landlords home for a few months now and a number of increasingly suspicious things have occurred since just prior to moving in.

As a condition to taking possession of the unit, we agreed to allow them to enter the unit at our convenience once a week to do their laundry (shared). 

Since then they've done laundry more and more frequently and for longer periods of time when we aren't home. They've also required access to move and remove items from a storage room also in unit (not mentioned before we took possession). This sense of a lack of privacy has been frustrating but tolerable for us up until recently when something serious occurred. 

The female landlord requested access to find a ""basin for her toe"" and after I offered to fetch it for her, she indicated she didn't know where it was and would have to search. 

After coming home from work I discovered an item had been moved from the laundry room to the nightstand in the bedroom. This raised an alarm for me but I thought perhaps I'd just forgotten I'd moved it. The next day, my SO discovered there was a condom missing from the box within that nightstand (we don't use condoms and only used one). This created a back and forth between my SO and I because she was understandably confused that two were missing. 

I started to get paranoid and the next morning tookba quick glance in the kitchen garbage for it (thinking maybe the landlord was fucking with us) and instead saw two birth control pills discarded in a napkin (my SO keeps her pack on the kitchen table). We both work a lot in the service industry so she glanced at the pack and assumed she's taken them at the right time since they were gone.

Now she's panicking thinking there's a risk of unwanted pregnancy. Furthermore, I'm raging at the thought of someone doing something that malicious for no apparent reason. On top of that, the likely culprit was an early childhood educator before retiring! 

How should I move forward with this?

me \[29M\] and my gf \[24F\] went on holiday to a resort in Egypt about two weeks ago

It was a really nice trip at the beginning but (for me) it turned out to be something that is bothering me still.

On the last day we had some time to kill while waiting for the time we would leave to the airport. We decided to get a massage in the resort spa. I paid for me and my gf while she went to toilet. Some guy showed up and took me in. I was lying there for around half an hour. When I came outside my gf was not there. I waited for around 25 minutes and then went upstairs to look for her. We only had like 20 minutes before the bus was leaving and had to get our luggage. After 10 minutes of searching I went downstairs again, the moment she was coming up. We missed the bus because everything took us way too long and so we had to take a cab. We got our plane 10 minutes before the gate was closing. When we were sitting she seemed to be mad although I was mad because we missed the bus. She asked me what was wrong with me to pick a massage like that. I was confused and she told me that the massage therapist was a real creep. He was maybe 50 years old and told her that I payed for a different kind of therapy than I actually did. I payed for shoulders and neck 30 minutes and he told her I had paid for a 90 minute full body massage. I told her it wasn't true and she told me the guy was basically massaging really EVERYTHING from front to back and he took his time.  I was in absolute rage hearing that.

378,"So my family lives in a neighborhood that is mostly racial/ethnic minorities. We are the only white family in the entire neighborhood. My sister and I, both under fifteen, are used to being verbally abused by the entire neighborhood. These people lump all whites together, and they're too chicken to mistreat adults, so my sister and I are the neighborhood punching bags. This is normal, and we know that: 1. Mom and Dad don't have the means for us to move, and 2. They will never understand the situation, because they don't have to go through it. If those weren't the case, we would have moved years ago. We've been spit on, had balls and frisbees thrown at us, been called ""white bread"", ""crackerface"", etc., been beaten up in our own yard, had our toys stolen right out of our front yard(since we were toddlers), yelled at, threatened with all manner of curses, shoved and hit, and had our property damaged. And that's just the children. Don't even wanna think about what the parents do to us. But today was the last straw. There was a huge bunch of kids, about 6-12 years old, playing on one of the front lawns, with a sign out front that read ""Big Community Playdate! All Kids 4-13 Welcome!"" There were a bunch of adults right at the front of the gathering, but my sister (10 years old) wanted to try to join in anyway. I warned her, but she wanted to risk it, cause generally the little kids are decent to us. I wanted Mom to go with her, but Mom cared more about writing her book than being there to protect her kid. As mentioned above, she doesn't believe us. When she got there (this is a secondhand account) one of the adults said ""What you want, crackerface?"" She pointed to the sign and said ""I came to play. Like all the other kids here."" Then another adult yelled ""Well too bad. Get lost. This is not a space for your kind, white bread"" and shoved her to the ground. A third adult reportedly held her down while the first adult stole her shirt, then she kicked Adult 3 and ran back home when Adult 2 tried to steal her skirt. Mom yelled at her for losing an expensive shirt(it sold for six dollars at the thrift shop). Mom refused to believe someone tried to steal her clothes or called her names, and was just mad she had the shirt stolen. I know six bucks for a piece of clothing is probably a lot more expensive to these families than it is to us, and that's what I told her, but stealing children's clothes right off a kid is a little too far. I don't think they were just stealing her clothes, and if she didn't run away I think they would have stolen her bra and panties too. She's TEN. YEARS. OLD. and was just trying to play with her neighbors. For her sake and the sake of the neighbors' lives, I hope all they wanted was her clothes. I can't tell Mom what I think, because I'm probably wrong (she's TEN. these people are arseholes but I'd hope they'd draw the line SOMEWHERE.), and I can't report it to the cops b/c nothing actually happened. I can't get her out of here because even though we've got a million reasons(now a million and one) to move Mom won't believe a single one.  

How should I protect myself, my sister, and the house, so that things like this don't happen again, and we can stop being targets?

379,"When we bought the car, we agreed to go 50/50 on it. He told me the final selling price was $7000 ( I found an old email that shows this). When we broke up at the end of 2016. I kept the car, got it appraised and gave him half of what a mechanic told me it was worth. 

I sold the vehicle last week, and as I was clearing out the glove compartment, I found a sealed envelope hidden in the car manual. Inside was a bank draft between my ex and the seller and the selling price was stated as $6500. To be sure, I tracked down the guy who sold us the car and he told me that was the only transaction they had and the price was $6500. 

Do you think it is worth it to confront him with this? I honestly am sick about it because I trusted him with so much of the finances ( he is an accountant and we lived together for four years). We went “half’s” on everything. It makes me wonder if he was making me pay extra and scamming me all of those years. Also at the time that we bought the car I was making next to nothing teaching at a private school and he had a full salary. I can’t believe he would cheat me out of the small amount money I was making at the time.

I am still friends with his sister but have been trying to keep my distance since this has come to light. I haven’t spoken to him in about a year. Should I just let this go or should I ask him about this, just to let him know that I’m aware that he is a scum bag? Thoughts? Thanks for reading.

388,"So I am 23 years old and I have never been convicted of a crime, other than 3 speeding tickets (all were 11 MPH over).  I previously served in the United States Air Force and maintained a Secret Clearance. I landed a job as a contractor for the Navy working a call center. I worked there for 2 months before they said there was an issue with my clearance. They said something from October in 2013 that was preventing me from obtaining a clearance. I was given 5 paid work days off to try and figure it out while they did as well. I found nothing and was let go. My HR department gave me a POC (Point of Contact) for the Navy department responsible for my job/clearance and I reached out. I was then told by them that they were not authorized to give me anymore information. After checking back in with my HR department, they said that was the only people they could give me. I know for a fact my first speeding ticket was in 2015 and that was the first of any kind of 'legal action'. I also believe I would not have got in the military (in 2014) if something from 2013 was popping up.  Where should I reach out to? Who should I contact? Please and thank you for your help.

Parents convinced me to try school again and I agreed. I didn't want to waste more money than I had to so I decided to go to a local community college. It was there that I got an associates in a technical skill. It was a skill that I was slightly above average at in high school, so what the hell, not like I have any other options.

I explained to him that he should have given me a heads up that he was considering an out-of- country wedding...since he wants the kids there. I said a basic heads up is sufficient. I said that the kids should not be the ones communicating info of that size.

Hopefully that gives you a good summary of the relationship.

 For context, she got really drunk at a music festival a while ago and hooked up with a guy(she regretted it later but consent was given so no problems there). Anyway, this was literally never mentioned again until yesterday, when we were talking she got all serious and told me she thinks she's pregnant. Of course I switch into holy shit this is intense mode, and start telling her it'll all be okay, that I'm here for her and that she'll get through this(I was ready to drop everything and fly out that night).

Then she says she's just kidding(tf), but glad if something really did go down now she knows how I'd react.

I'm just curious what this looks like from an outsider(especially cause she's not a prank-type, that's usually my deal). 

It's probably absolutely nothing but I wanted to post here just in case there's something I'm missing. It is out of character for her to do something like this, she hates it when people play those kind of extreme jokes.

The first thing I completely understand is to remove a nose piercing (he didn't mention this before though) then he started to say I needed a haircut, which would have been fine had he said It in a polite way, but he was really rude about it going as far as to say he hated my hair even though there are girls there with long untied hair (just some context my hair is just above shoulder length, but I slick it back as it looks more professional)

He also made a sexual joke too which would have been fine if we knew each other longer, but we just met

I reported him to his manager and the general manager of the hotel but she didn't seem to care and just said ""do you want to resign then"" sounding fed up, so I thought that was the best thing to do

Is this a reason to feel like shit, I told my family and they said stick it out for the money but I don't give a fuck about money

However, there are things that aren't going so well:
 - Recently, I was told I would have to wait at least year before I could work on a particular rotation because even though my clinical skills are good, I get stressed too easily. Just about all the other junior doctors have been accepted to work in it next year. It's considered a highly valuable rotation where one develops skills very quickly.
 - I've been single for nearly 4 years and everyone around me seems to be in a relationship. I don't do well with women. There also aren't many young, single women around where I live.  
 - I live alone - the place I live makes it hard to find a good rental property. It gets quite lonely at times.
 - I have no driver's license - I am working towards it now.

Everyone around me seems to be progressing in life - both professionally and personally. I feel like I'm just stagnating and it's making me feel insecure and inferior to everyone else. If I try to talk to people about it, they don't really want to hear about it (parents included) - there are no easy solutions, and no one wants to hear negativity. The advice I always get is ""just be happy, you're doing so well for someone your age etc etc"". That is terrible advice. The only person who can help me is myself.

- I am taking driving lessons to work towards my license - this will give a larger radius in which I can do things/meet people - it will also give me more options for places to live - might also be able to get a place which can accommodate flatmates. 
- I signed up for counselling, but it takes time to get an appointment and for it to work.
- I signed up for a project at work that will help me develop professionally - if I can't do the rotations I want to do to help me advance - I'll do other things to help with that instead.

My problem is that all these things take a while to sort out (up to a year) and I'm stuck feeling negative/down for the moment. My tendency is to ruminate on the negatives - and I tend to try to talk to people about them. As stated above, no one wants to hear it.

I had a girlfriend that I met through university for a year, with the relationship ending in January this year by me breaking up with her. It was long distance and I love her, but I would have days where I’d wake up and just feel nothing. Emotions are an incredibly difficult thing for me to process and I don’t feel them the way I think I should; grief, love and such. As such, I could be a very cold person and throughout the breakup she almost begged me to reconsider and I brusquely said no, in a nice enough way, explaining that I feel this is best for us and I know in my heart it will work out.

It really didn’t - around 3 weeks later we were still talking but I couldn’t think of what to say to her. She said she could take me back but she wasn’t going to tell me what to do to fix it, she was going to let me do it, and my mind drew a blank. I’d have done anything she told me to do at this point, but when it came to me thinking of it myself, I couldn’t. 

Eventually, she was due to come over and see me around mother’s day (UK), which I cancelled because I forgot about it, and I can tell it hurt her. It was a last straw - she became distant and we stopped talking.

This is where it gets fucked up. I broke up with her, I have no right whatsoever to be upset over this. I started it. She fell in love with someone else, I tried to move on, and I can’t. I can’t begin to explain how much I love this girl. I know that now. Everything I am, she made me, because she believed in me and made me more confident. When we eventually severed contact she said she was going back to being her old confident self, making me realise that I had been a detriment to her when I didn’t want that at all. It’s only now looking back on it that I feel an intense feeling of guilt about our time together. I feel guilty for how I treated her, I feel guilty for how I broke up with her, I feel guilt for it all. I miss her so, so much. 

I’ve tried to get back into dating but it all ends the same way. I tried online dating, met a few people, had a few dates but I had no interest after 1/2 meetings. Nobody captivates my attention like she did - even beautiful woman just bore me (not to say I could get a beautiful woman). I compare them all to her and they don’t hold a candle to her. 
I can’t move on from it. I can’t stop thinking about her. I have one thing left from our relationship; i had her block me on literally everything to try and make sure I couldn’t get back in touch because I knew I’d be like this, I don’t have any photos or anything. I found her business card from work in my wallet from months ago and I can’t bring myself to part with it. Losing her felt like losing a part of myself only after I realised what i’d done and this is all I have left of her. 
She’s the first thing I think of when I wake up and the last thing I think of before I sleep. I haven’t had a nights sleep in almost 6 months where I haven’t cried thinking of her.

But, at the time, I didn’t feel any of this. I let her run around after me, I let her down. I feel intense and horrible guilt over what I’ve done and I feel guilty for hating that she moved on so quickly. I feel guilty for it all.

I don’t know what to do. Really, I don’t. I’ve gone to buildings and sat there for hours considering if I should jump, but didn’t because that’s another thing I know I’d do to her. She’d find out, somehow, and blame herself. I’ve spent entire days doing nothing but crying over her and just wanting it all to end. At the time I didn’t realise it but she even said it herself, I was her entire world and I discarded her like she was nothing, and yet only after I realised what I’d done did I start to feel it deep inside me that I’d hurt her. I want it to end, man. I really do. I don’t want to think of her anymore but I can’t not think of her.

I don’t even know what I’m asking here. I guess it just felt good to let it out and tell someone, even if it’s strangers. Someone told me it gets better with time but if anything, it’s got worse, and it got worse fast.",08Jul2018,1
