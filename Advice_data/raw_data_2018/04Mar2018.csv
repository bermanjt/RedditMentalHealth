0,"So here the story. The last three years I worked at an office job making good money, while my husband finished college. He graduated, we moved for his new job making double what I was making before. I don't have a job in the new location. I was offered a job that would require every weekend and make $22,000-$31,000 a year roughly. Its something I would really enjoy, but I would never have the same day off as my husband. I could easily get a job as front desk clerk or a teller at a bank make more, but I know I wouldn't enjoy it. I just dont know what the right decision is, I am really struggling. I have an associates degree, and good work experience. I am considering eventually going back to college for marketing or graphic art. ",04Mar2018,1
1,"My parents work so hard for me and I just want to in the future pay them back for it all. Thing is my mom and dad are taking so much stress because of me and my brother. It feels like it is me more though. I suck at self studying and I always need their help to help me study for my tests. I am also bad at remembering everything I need to do so they have to constantly remind me. They also work hard jobs. My mom is a teacher while my dad is a computer engineer so they work hard. They have recently been feeling the stress and it is causing small problems to their health. This is affecting me and my brother. So I just want to know, how can I take a good amount of stress off their shoulders and how can I become more independent at studying so I do not need my parent's help. Also how do I constantly remind myself to take care of everything I need to?",04Mar2018,1
2,"At the beginning of January, I matched with this absolutely gorgeous girl on Tinder. We started flirting a little and I got her number. This is the first time that someone I’ve been interested in has ever flirted with me and given me their number, so I got pretty excited. We talked a little through text afterwards for a little but then I stopped getting responses. 

I’ll admit, I started getting anxious and began overthinking stuff. My social anxiety only made this worse. I was worried about sending another message and, due to my lack of a car, didn’t ask her to go out anywhere. 2 or 3 weeks passed and I went “fuck it” and asked her out on a date. I was then hit with a “I’m seeing someone”. I’m 80% sure she was telling the truth, as she deleted her tinder account. I think I made my move too late.

Now I’ve been rejected once before and I handled it well. I handled this one well too at first, but I’ve started feeling worse and worse. 

This is going to sound odd, I know because I find it odd as well, but I keep having extremely vivid dreams with her in them. Also, because she’s still in my contact lists, she comes up as someone to add on social media. Because of these two things, I’m constantly reminded of, for lack of a better phrase, my failure.

I would simply remove her from my contact list, but she genuinely seemed like a great person that i still want to talk to, relationship or not. We had similar music taste and we both liked The Office and Star Wars (our flirts were Star Wars related).  A day or two after the rejection, we talked about Solo for a short few minutes and I haven’t texted her since. I want to start a conversation with her, but I don’t really know how and I feel like I’d come off as clingy....which I’m aware may actually be the case. I’m a TERRIBLE conversation starter and I don’t want to start one in an awkward way.

Should I just try my best to forget about her? If not, how should I continue talking to her?

3,"Before we begin, I'm not a homophobe, I'm actually a bisexual [17M if you were wondering] myself so its not that I hate gay people its just that I'm hurting about this particular instance: My girlfriend of just under a year broke up with me a week and a half ago and it was a pretty clean break (I was rather upset because it was very abrupt for me but I got over it) and we've managed to stay friends. And then last week she told me she was gay and that thats why she left me. This left me a little bit hurt because I thought it was a little cruel of her to have said all the things she said to me (she told me she loved me for example) and have been gay (her saying that she had meant it as ""I love you as a friend"" didn't really do much to help...) but I understood that she'd be confused and I forgave her. We laughed about it actually because this meant that I was 3 for 3 on picking lesbian or bisexual people to date. Then she told me that she had been in love with my ex-girlfriend for a few months. and that she had cheated on me with her at new years without me knowing. And that hurt me a bit again, but I once again forgave her because we weren't dating anymore so it didn't really matter. Then today she said she said that they were dating now and tonight was their first ""official"" date and she kept asking me for love advice and how good it was to finally be out as gay. And like... I know that really shouldn't upset me but like... I feel like this just confirms how I felt that my entire relationship with her was a lie... and all this added up just hurts me an awful lot. Like it made me realize that in our relationship I gave so much to her and she never gave back, because now I can see her giving to another person. And like yes, I know she was gay the whole time now so like of course she didn't give it her all with me and I'm fine with that. Just... it hurts me to have been so lied to and its making me unable to sleep, and her not understanding that she hurt me makes it much worse. Any advice on just being less hurt about it (especially cuz I feel like I have no right to be upset)? Thanks guys. BTW in case you were wondering, I haven't brought this up with her cuz despite my internal feelings being messed up, she's happier than she's ever been and I think she has every right to that without me being upset at her, so that option is kinda out, especially since both of us actually do value our friendship.",04Mar2018,1

I have an unexpected opportunity to go to Paris during my spring break. My friend is currently living there and I will only need to pay for my plane ticket, which is about $520 USD round trip.

9,"26, F. Living in the bible belt.

Diagnosed in 2010 because of trauma from a best friend comitting suicide. Hallucinations (visual and verbal) started with seeing him and hearing him and over time has transformed into various things. I've never had a problem discerning whats real and what isnt and the only time I've been on meds it was for sleeping.

I refuse to take antipsychotics. Anything else, I am game for.

Life crashed on me this week. My career collapsed. The restaurant I've been running is closing. My personal relationships are suffering because of my poor coping habits. My father, the only family I have, is showing signs of dementia and called me yesterday asking for help.

I can't even take care of myself, let alone my father. I can't put him in a home for fear of his suicide (his parents died in homes and hes made it clear for years that suicide would be his choice). I'm meeting him this week to talk about it and I'm mentally and emotionally unprepared for the inevitable outcome.

My hallucinations have gone from occasional to every day. My anxiety is through the roof. Cant sleep. Cant eat. 

I tried calling doctors, but no one in my state is equipped to help. They keep passing me off to other doctors or refusing to take me as a new patient because of my diagnosis.

I feel trapped. I feel doomed that I'm going to ruin my lovers life, my life, my best friends life (also coworker), my father's life; and it will all be because I can't get help. Or rather, no one is offering to.

I feel like a lost cause and yesterday for the first time since my friend died, I've been contemplating suicide. 

I just want to give up.",04Mar2018,1

I got pretty close to this guy last year, we had almost every class together. He was a genuinely good kid, kind, honestly so funny, and just loved to meet new people. We studied together sometimes out of class, and just had a lot of nice memories from knowing him.

I knew he had a drug abuse problem (He showed up tripping on something to class one day), and his friends had told me.

I know he had been in rehab for the last semester (september 2017-dec 2017), as he barely came to class. He finally reached out again just at the start of February and was wanting to catch up on class material, hang out, etc. We were getting along to planning the hangout, but he never replied after a while.

3 weeks later, I find out he overdosed. I'm honestly in shock, it's terribly difficult to understand. How could he just be dead? You don't think these things can happen to someone you know...until they do.

My heart goes out to his family. I cannot even begin to imagine the pain they're experiencing right now, and I want to reach out to them.

I know they don't know me, but if I can get a card together with a note telling them how I was a friend of his at school, and I got to know what a sweet, funny and kind person he was, how he still tried to put an effort in to his school, etc, I think it could bring them some comfort.

I suffered with ***severe*** depression the majority of my childhood, far into my teenage years, until I finally managed to get help. I also have ADHD and anxiety, although I’d say my ADHD is the main thing affecting me right now vs my anxiety and (almost nonexistent now) depression.

As a result of all that, I’m a little bit behind my peers in many adult and life skills.

I mean, I can clean myself, I can dress myself, I can clean my room, I can do chores, I can do my own laundry and iron it, I can do the dishes, and I sort of understand cooking and how to sew.

But I can’t drive, I didn’t graduate from highschool when I should of, I don’t understand finances, I don’t understand politics, I’ve never had a job, and I struggle academically which I’m sure will follow me into college in the future.

My mom is pushing me into a career path and future that *she* wants for me, and won’t even let me do so much as job shadow for career paths I’m interested in. She has a path set out for me and gets very irritated if I even so much as *suggest* something different.

I appreciate my life, the fact that my parents have been kind enough to let me live with them past 18. But if a bird isn’t allowed to leave the nest, it can’t learn to fly. 

I’m restricted to the rules of living here and I think they’re stunting me. I’m not allowed to dress how I want, or buy clothes that I want. I’m forced to wear makeup. My mom signs me up for independent online classes and I’m only allowed to take classes *she* wants me to take. When I have meetings with say, a psychiatrist or a life-coach, she insists on staying back with them as long as she can to complain about me and almost has to be forced out of the office. **A relative came from a few states away to visit family, and she kept me from seeing them.** That last one really hurt.

There’s no “how to adulthood for dummies” guide out there, and the ones that do exist assume you have a certain amount of adult skills already, such as a **job**, the ability to **drive**, ect.

How do I carve my way out of this and start progressing as an adult? Not getting to visit that relative was the **last straw**, and every day I’m more and more afraid of spending the rest of my life (or at least the majority of my energetic young-adult years) stuck in a soul-sucking career path that she set out to put me on.

I have a job that pays pretty well, close to my mother and father’s salaries, but I don’t feel like following a career in this field anymore. Over the last two years and a half, I have become increasingly interested in creating music and I feel like this is what I should be doing, since I am absolutely in love with music. At my current workplace, my colleagues are nice, actual work is scarce, I spend most of my time browsing the web because I have no tasks assigned, so there is no actual reason not to be happy. I also have a job offer at a tech startup in Machine Learning, which would pay better, and it is one of the subdomains of CompSci which has a strong future, pays great and that I like.  I have looked up online and saw that salaries in this field of work can become disgustingly huge, up to 14k$ a month in the US. But I want to create music. I am aware that it would pay a lot less and that it would be harmful to my health due to late nights at parties and all the other things, but in my only 8 months of working I have grown to detest my office, I have become hunched and fat has accumulated in my hip area due to large times spent sitting. Also, I have accumulated some knowledge in the computer music and signal manipulation fields which would help me, were I to drop out of programming. I just don’t feel like this is  how I want to spend the rest of my life, working 9 to 5 or 8 to 4 every day, 2 more hours on the commute, and this has been making me more and more unhappy over the past year. I feel like I am wasting my time not trying to create music in my free time(because of school, friends, work and other things keep me permanently occupied). I have also considered moving to Sweden, as I have some relatives there who could help me get going, get a job in programming for a few years that pays well, gather some money then take a break from work to start learning music but I am afraid that I don’t have enough guts to do this. I now just want to get my degree this summer and have an idea of what I want to do with my life because I know that if I get into a schedule now and give up music it will come back to haunt me a few years in the future.

44,"Hi. I decided to post this here as well, since I’m not getting any more advice from r/legaladvice than to contact a business attorney. That’s probably the best advice I can be given, but I have to wait until Monday and need to talk to someone about this.

I guess I’m not asking so much for legal advice as how to deal with this.

We started an ecommerce business with my best friend in May of 2015. He already owned a company, which operated in a completely other field and we just decided to start running the new ecommerce business under the existing company. This company was an “Osakeyhtiö” which I believe LLC is the closest equivalent to. This is happening in Finland.

Right from the beginning it was decided the new ecommerce business was going to be split 50/50 between us. This was a complete side project at the time and we even joked that if one of us gets screwed over for this kind of small money, our friendship wasn’t even worth it in the beginning. No contracts were made. Biggest mistake in my life in hindsight, obviously.

We operated pretty much 100% with my friend’s existing company’s money in the beginning. Around $6000 was used before money started rolling in, and though I’m not completely sure of this, I believe we have never dipped under that. Part of our agreement was of course that if this fails, I’m responsible of half the losses. Please remember that we were best friends at the moment, and right up until about 5 hours ago. We never even had a fight.

The business grew steadily and I would say we worked 80/20 (me doing 80% of the work) until the end of the year. In January 2016 we decided that I was gonna start getting paid, because the business did pretty good and it started to take so much of my time. I dropped everything else and started working full time on this business. We put up a brick &amp; mortar store at this time, which has been running since today. I had my own “toiminimi”, which is the Finnish equivalent of a Sole Proprietorship, and got paid through that.

This arrangement went on for 2 full years + January and February of 2018. We often talked about making the business an own company, which I would be the legal 50% part owner of, but we never got around to do it. During the last two years the workload shifted to pretty much me doing at least 95% of the work between us, which was totally fine because I was the only one to get paid.

We also had help from a third friend from the beginning of 2016. He also got paid with a similar arrangement and was promised 7% of the business, when we eventually would make it it’s own company. This 7% was agreed to be split evenly from our shares.

Come March the 3rd of 2018 (today). I started getting emails from Facebook business manager, Paypal, work email… from every place that I had been logged out, admins removed and the passwords were changed. I couldn’t log in anywhere. I tried contacting my friend, but he doesn’t answer.

At this time, I managed to download our +10k email list, and change the password to Instagram. These are the only ones he didn’t remember to block right away, so at least I have something. I’m not sure if he’s gonna be able to reclaim Instagram from me, because it’s connected to Facebook.

We have around $70k worth of stock in our shop. Or had. I started fearing the worst when I got the emails and drove to our shop. It was empty. He had been there to take it all. They seemed to have left in a hurry, because there still was a little stuff left, probably for around $1000 - $2000. I packed it all in my car. The cash register was also empty.

He doesn’t even have a key to the store, but it’s his name on the lease, so he must have gotten the key from the landlord. I had the shop open to 3pm, and when I went there at 10pm, it was empty. There was a sign on the door saying “The store is closed, the online store is open normally”.

I can’t even understand how this would financially smart from him, all feelings aside. It’s me running the show in a niche he doesn’t really know anything about and we have very good growth. He would be making more money with me probably next year already. I don’t want to brag here, but he knows he will not be able to keep the company growing alone.

So if you have any advice, legal or not, it would be really appreciated. This is quite a shocking situation to say the least.

I will be happy to answer any follow up questions. I’m not sure what was relevant, so I tried to include everything.

Thanks so much!",04Mar2018,3

I have my own ecommerce business that is my main focus and I really put all my time into that and it pays all my bills. I told them I could do postition that has more of a regular schedule and they said they’d let me know something monday. So I declined the 12hr shift job and my mom is pissed.  

If it took the 12hr shift job I would literally have no life and absolutely no time to work on my business. I feel like my family isn’t understanding what’s really important to me because the think I’m passing up and great opportunity.  

I guess I’m also asking did I make the right decision? To me I did, but my mom started yelling saying I need to start paying rent on the house, buying food, buying toilet paper, etc. I’m trying to get my own place soon and buy my parents a place eventually. 

I’m just confused bc she says she supports me and wants me to hit my goals but is mad that I didn’t take a job that would take up all my time.

I just moved out of home (today is my first day in the new place), and I am living in a new town (population approximately 8 000) 2 hours away from my family.

I know it isn't that far, but being a young person living on my own, financially speaking, I won't be able to visit very often.

Any advice on making the transition from being surrounded by family, to being completely isolated (I literally know no one here), less scary and depressing?

49,So me and my finance have a really bad landlord and I don’t know what to do about it. First she lost our rent checks and we had to rewrite one and give it to her. Then once winter started we tried to turn the heat on and the heater was broke so we called her and she sent someone over. After they fixed it she called us and started yelling saying we cost her $300 even though it wasn’t our fault. Then in about the middle of January our roof started leaking into our bathroom and she still hasn’t done anything about it. She said she can’t do anything about it cause there’s ice in the roof but it’s all melted off. Now our sink is leaking into our basement and we let her know about a week ago and she still hasn’t fixed it. Our lease isn’t up until July and I don’t really want to have to move out. I live in a smaller town and have couple pets. She is the only one in town that allows pets. ,04Mar2018,1

52,"Hey all, I'm not in the best of shape at the moment. Things were bad back in high school, things got worse since I graduated high school a year ago. I barely get out much except for work and food, I only talk to three people a day, most of my free time is spent looking at porn or playing video games, because both are instant gratifiers and hook into the primal part of your reward systems. I am miserable. 

The porn excites me, because I get it from kik groups and at times there some other more extreme elements involved that make it very interactive and exciting. I also like going to live cam sites and sites where you can even cam and jerk off in front of the girls who are stripping. Its my way of feeling a sexual thrill like I am really there. Once I am done, they might notice and comment, thats always the best part. Or when I talk to a couple on kik and the girl warms up to an idea I have, she can't see my face, if she did, she would block me, in real life, her boyfriend would whoop my ass to save face. But on here, on here they want me to do it, to say it, to finish to it, tributing its called. The feeling of finally talking a girl into giving an anonymous stranger like yourself nudes is so rewarding and exciting. Waking up to, ""good morning"" and a nice private nude, for free, makes you feel like you are a Chad. 


But in real life, I am a total fucking loser who hasn't talked to anyone outside my immediate family in three weeks and is just someone who sits in his room all day only leaving the house to go to my boring soul crushing job where I repeat the same thing over and over again, in silence, no one wants to talk. I feel empty, I feel a tightening pinging feeling of sadness in my chest every day, every hour. Constantly emptiness and sadness. Its worse when your brother, who is more social than you, brings over all his friends over, several of them are girls. I can't see them as anything but liabilities or sex objects. I try to make conversation but I am so bad at talking to people, so bad at relating to anything, that I always make an ass of myself. I didn't realize how lonely I was tell I was sitting on the couch and this one girl was sleeping on the other side and I looked at her and for whatever reason almost cried I felt so lonely. When she got up to use the bathroom I laid down and hugged the pillow that she was laying on that was still warm, and fell asleep for a bit. I woke up with a sharpie dick on my face. Hell yeah. Later that night I cried myself to sleep.  

I am constantly doing shit to feel excitement, to feel a small rush that keeps me going. I did this all through my life, I would commit small crimes and do dumb shit and get away with it and feel a rush that quickly wore off and left me feeling bored again. I almost got caught several times but I never once thought about really anything or anyone. I've always had that disconnect with people, but I want to be with them, I'm sick of being a separate entity that is depressed all the time and bored and doing all this shit to feel like I am living instead of going to work and going home to jerk off and game. I want to quit porn, I want to find something to do that makes me want to wake up in the morning. 

TL;DR incredibly depressed all the time, even more depressed after high school, barely any friends, addicted to porn, wasting all my free time, important shit being put to the side, dead stop in life, no motivation to live but too pussy to die, committing small crimes and taking risks randomly and without logic to feel like I am living, really want to be a different person in a year because this has been going on for six years and has only gotten worse in the last year.

Basically there is a ongoing war(irl) and there was this post on this subreddit that shows a sign that is used when my people are about to get killed based on what I have seen or pictures and videos and the people from “the other side/ethnicity”. I commented on the subreddit that “I would shove it up their ass if they did that in front of me” which might’ve been too much but from my point of view, these people have been killing my people from ages so I have some negative energy inside of me which I let out.

Now that I know she's gotten comfortable posting their dates on her social media. Now I am not over this girl in the slightest so I decided to unfollow her from everything as to not expose myself to that. This really upsets her as we are still pretty close friends. She begged me to follow her back and I'm really am a sucker when it comes to her. Not even 2 hours later she posts a picture of her on a date with him.

62,"Honestly, I don't even know where to begin by writing this. There's a lot that I do want to say, but now that I'm actually taking the time to write this down, I don't think I can properly express everything that I want to, and I'm sure by the time I finally decide to submit it, I'll realize something I wanted to add.

I guess I'll start with this though. My mother has a pain pill problem, and as I do not make enough money to even consider moving out, I have to deal with it. When I get paid, I hand over half of my pay check. Now, see, I wouldn't mind that because I'm still living with my parents. That's not my issue; that's not my concern. At the very least, however, I would like to be able to negotiate the terms with her because I can't save up money with other bills that I have to pay on my own, such as the internet bill.

Sometime in June-July of last year, we were evicted, and we had to stay with a family friend for awhile until we could find our own place. Conveniently around this time, my mother was at last approved for social security benefits, and we were able invest in our own home. My mother did all the financing and assured me that not only would we be able to afford this new place although it was far more expensive than where we were at prior, I would finally be able to start saving up money from my paychecks with the intent to save up for a car or a maybe even a house of my own one day. 

Fast forward a few months, and that's no longer the case. I later found out it was because my mom neglected to mention her pain pill addiction part of the 'budget'. She'll sell her pain pills with the intent to help contribute to the house as she can't work, but then when she runs out, she'll buy some, creating an effective endless loop that is preventing bills from getting behind. My step father works two jobs and I work part time, as well as my step father has disability benefits.

There've been entire weeks that end up adding into a month where we just actually don't have anything for a proper dinner, aside from like PB&amp;J (which, admittedly, is pretty darn delicious, but I hope I'm not alone when I say that I can't count that by itself a proper dinner).

Naturally, I've tried talking to my mom about it. But she refuses to talk about it; she'll just say ""Of course I know how I'm dragging everyone with me!"" and just start crying, balling her head off. She's overweight and has high blood pressure as well, and I'm afraid trying to implement ""tough love"" would set her off; potentially in a tragic manner.

I've also asked what few friends I have if they're looking for any room mates, but they're either married or still with their parents. And in the area in which I live, there's... a lot of untrustworthy people here. It's also unfortunately the cheapest area to live in as well.

With that out of the way, I guess what I need to know is what are my options? If I was to turn my mother in, my dad and I can't afford to pay this house off. It's too much without my mom's disability. Far above what we can make. Of course, I don't think I could report her even if I wanted to. She's my mom.

Should I take a risk, and try to find a roommate with somebody that I don't even know? I certainly can't afford to live out on my own.

I've tried tagging along with my mom when it comes to getting her scripts filled, but she's told me no, and she's had me administer her medication before, but I later found out before she even had me do that, she'd sold a number of them prior to handing them over.",04Mar2018,2
63,"my brother has autism, and though he is high functioning, he still has struggles sometimes. it especially took the reigns last year when he developed a special interest in right wing politics, and became a trump supporter at our very liberal, california school. (if you are here to complain about the correlation between my brother's disorder and his right wing-ness fucking click off right now. im not here to fight, im here to help my brother.)

every time he saw something he morally disagreed with he'd be vocal about it. when a black girl was talking about cultural appropriation he, a white person, would find it necessary to become very upset and force her into debating with him. he would constantly tell jokes that people found uncomfortable, and though some of the things he would do could be considered bullying, he was bullied too. when the year ended, and he snapped out of this mentality and began trying to get better, it was too late and all his classmates had already gotten an impression of him, and will not drop this idea of him.

this made him very depressed, as he could not find a way to improve his image. he commonly used reddit and began to engage in activities that differenced him from other students. (it sounds silly, but please do not laugh,) he would call other students normies, and dressed like a proud boy at school, with a tie, khakis, and military boots. whatever his peers liked, he had to make a point to dislike it.

lots of the people trying to help him began to tighten their reigns on him, to try to veer him away from this behavior. this includes the spectrum program at our school, and my mother. the spectrum program tends to be skeptical of any time people are kind to him. for example, his fellow conservative friend complimented a coat he wore the other day, and they tried to convince my mother that his friend was joking when he gave the compliment. my mother over reacts to the smallest detail, to the point where she makes him more different than the other students. tonight, he was forced into deleting his reddit account because she doesn't want him talking to people online, even though he is a teenager. she is scared to have him talk to other kids at his school because she doesn't know if they're bullying him. they both have a hard time letting him get away with things lots of kids do.

he tends to come to me to vent about all this, but i am a very introverted person who has a hard time dealing with constant communication, and he wants to vent a lot of the time, when i want to be alone. it does not make it better that his therapist, who he sees once a week, encouraged him to talk to me. i am too scared to say that i don't have the mental energy to speak to him, but i know he needs help. so i feel like i am not a good person to come for for advice.

i have some ideas of what could have caused him to get like this in the first place (it was a traumatic experience over the summer before that school year started. i do not want to speak about it), but i do not have an idea of how to help him.

please help with any advice you can, i do not want something bad to happen to my brother.",04Mar2018,2

My mom booked my sister and I (she's 11, I'm 17) a surprise trip to New Orleans, Louisiana for 3 nights, 4 days. I was super stoked because we hadn't gone on a vacation in a long time, and I was glad to know that my mom was doing well enough to pay for this trip (recently divorced, not related to issue at all, trust me). 

My sister, on the other hand, simply said TO HER FACE, ""Ugh, why are we traveling so much this year?"". I was about to go off on her and tell her how rude that was, but my mom stopped me before I could say anything and just said something along the lines of ""because we deserve it"" or something very casual. What kind of ungrateful brat doesn't even try to act excited when told she's going on vacation? Then, when my mom told us she was planning a trip to the Dominican Republic in the summer, she said the same thing. I was pissed off, but again, I said nothing and my mom was completely unphased. 

We just got back from New Orleans this morning. That was the most rage inducing trip ever. My sister complained every. Single. Day. If it wasn't about the wierd food, it was because of the ""heat"" (50 degrees farenheit, which for those of you who don't use F, is not hot at all) or her teeth hurt from the braces she doesn't take care of or SOMETHING. The second night, my mom finally said something about her attitude. She went on about her she's ""this close to taking away her phone"" and ""sooo close to getting mad"", basically telling my sister that she's not in trouble but you will be if you don't stop being so ungrateful. My sister replied in a ""yeah I know you're not going to punish me so whatever"" tone. 

She just didn't give two shits about anyone but herself and it's been driving me insane since she was old enough to speak and time and time again, my parents not only stand by and let it happen, they conform to her every need as if she would murder them if they didn't. I could go on and on talking about all the shit my parents just put up with. I could talk about how my sister refused to get my mom a glass of water for her pain medication after she was in a car crash because she was busy playing a computer game with her friend, or how she got into those dumbass slime making videos and my parents just clean up all the sticky stains and corn starch she leaves all over their houses, or how she never even takes her backpack with her when she gets out of the car because she expects someone to do it for her, but I won't go into that. 

If I say anything to my sister or my parents, they just get mad bc its ""none of my business"" and ""I'm not the adult"". I don't want to put myself on a pedestal. I'm not a perfect child. I'll admit, they did spoil me a lot as well. We got into plenty of arguments and disagreements. I took a lot of things for granted. They screamed at me, called me names, took away my privileges, etc. But I was still respectful and showed them I cared about them at the end of the day, even if they were still mad at me. They're family. You love them unconditionally. 

But I swear to fucking god I'm about to throw a fist straight into her braces (which were very expensive and not mandatory). I hear my mom complain about my sister in a joking way all the time, but she does nothing about it. She's never been grounded, never had her iPhone 7 taken away, and never been scolded the way I was. I'm not jealous they treat her different, I'm glad they don't treat her the way they treated me, but I'm sick of watching this fucking bitch disrespect my parents time and time again and have everything done for her and act like such a heartless demon. 

I can't take it anymore. Someone needs to put her in her place. We're going to see a VERY EXPENSIVE musical tomorrow and my sister has done nothing but complain about how she doesn't want to go the past 5 hours. My mom's feelings are so hurt beyond belief after this whole week's nonsense with this bitch and I'm one snarky comment away from throwing a punch. I'm not joking. I've had it. If they won't beat  some manners into her, I fucking will. 

It clearly bothers them, but they do nothing. Why? What am I supposed to do, if anything? How do I supress my anger so I don't accidentally explode and do something horrible? Am I overreacting? Please help me.

20, female, in college. Im really close with my family.

I have bipolar disorder, which wasn't diagnosed until October 2017. I've done a lot of dumb impulsive things as a result of my bipolar. One of the most significant was I moved across the US this past summer. I now live 2,000 miles from my family. I'm attending university now, as of January. I like where I live now, it's beautiful and people are so nice. Back home, the weather is terrible and people are not so friendly (east coast us).

Now that I'm properly medicated, I'm wondering if maybe I should move back home. I like it where I live now, and I'd like to get my degree eventually, but I really miss and love my family. If I stay here for my degree it might be harder to move when I graduate because of state certifications and stuff.

I'm 16, and my family's dog is 17. He's a small breed of dog where this is a little over average age. He's been with my my entire life and been just like a brother to me. He was always there to not give any judgements and just to be there when I'm having problems with my depression and anxiety.

Over the past couple years, he's really slowed down and has had a few troubles. He wears a diaper, has very weak legs, needs to be hand-fed a special diet, and is blind and deaf. He sleeps almost all day, often has poop messes at night, and is often scared when we try to pet him until he realizes it is us. He really does not have much quality of life anymore as he is always anxious and afraid.. We've decided that we are going to bring him in Monday morning to be put to sleep so he can finally just rest.

This is the hardest thing I have ever had to do in my life, and has just been so emotionally draining. I know he has lived a very long life and has been very happy, but the thought (and unfortunately soon to be reality) of not having him around at all anymore is the worst pain I have ever experienced.

Tomorrow is Sunday, his last full day. I want it to be an amazing day for him so he has lots of good memories in his end of life. Is there anything specific I should do in this time for him, or anything that people forget that they wish they did earlier? I've been taking lots of pictures of him and have preserved a small sample of a few hairs in a sterile, air-tight container (who knows what will happen in the future).

72,"So here’s the situation I was and still sort of am in a group of four friends (friends for about 3 years). One of our four was a new girl who we added to the group about half of a year ago. But a few weeks ago three of us pranked the new girl’s best friend, it did not go well and suddenly the NG stopped hanging out with our group (we hangout but mostly play games online).

But what I wouldn’t learn till the following week was that she wasn’t hanging out with me and rest of the group was hanging out her behind my back. They lied about having things to do, or saying the were simply to busy to spend time together. When we did hangout the other two and I they both acted odd and withdrawn, I attempted to dig into why and even asked if it specifically related to NG but I got backlash for doing so so I let up. However later I learned about her not wanting/being to hangout with me was a “intervention” where the three of them sat me down and told me that NG’s BF old her that She couldn’t be friends with me anymore because her BF told her that it was all my fault and she had to choose between me and her BF in addition I learned that why my friends had been harsh and avoided me earlier in the week, they had lied to me about the whole situation. They knew about the ultimatum that NG’s BF gave her the whole week and decided not to tell me till now, they claim it was to save my feelings but it didn’t come off that way. The “Intervention” ended with her leaving and me leaving as well.

The next couple of weeks are bad not only is our group divided, I am the odd man out they spend the bulk of their time with NG and ignore me for the most part. So I confront my two friends (one I’ve been friends with for five years and the other three), I tell them it’s unfair that I am getting the short end of this situation when she made the decision to break up the group, I also tell them that the fact that they were willing to lie and go behind my back is wrong and that they justify it by claiming that NG is the victim because she lost a friend (so did I). They have apologized for the lying and going behind my back but I told them that I don’t feel comfortable with them spending time with her and being friends with all the problems she caused me and their easy willingness to lie for her to me. They tell that they will always be friends with her and that I can’t ask them to cut her off because it would divide the group, even though she already divided the group by pushing me out and they did nothing about it as a matter of fact the backed her up and supported her decision. So I told them that I have too walk away from the group then because I don’t feel valued, respected, or able to trust them after what they have done. They tell me I’m creating a problem were there is none and that I’m creating pointless drama. 

Am I in the wrong? What should I do should I walk away? I don’t want to throw away my two closest friends but I feel like they don’t even care about me anymore. Does anyone see any other solutions?

I feel like I'm constantly playing catch-up with my peers, who know way more and are doing way more things with their lives than I am. Last year I basically learned how to talk to people and make some friends. I'm not perfect at it, but I'm in a better place than I was a year ago. I have a lot of doubts about myself. I have a lot of bad habits, like self doubt, little self love in who I am, and I often compare myself to others. I'm not depressed, but I want to know how to improve myself. I would appreciate advice, and pointers, as well as habits and mindsets I can incorporate into my life in order to improve, and figure things out.",04Mar2018,4
82,"So basically I’ve been really good friends with one person for about 2 years now and with that I’ve kind of joined his friend group. We play video games and talk in discords like any other people but recently I’ve been the one left out of things such as if they’re hanging out, I’m not invited. If they need a spot in a lobby, I’m out. I’ve said to the friend I’m close with that I’m frustrated of being home every night while you guys party and he’s said I’m sorry it’s not my house I don’t have the right to do stuff like that.

83,"I'm not sure how to ask for advice on this issue, but I just can't handle it in all honesty. More a question of how to cope considering I can't really approach the issue itself. 

So she goes around dating guys. Not the ""sleep around"" type. Far from it, in fact. But she goes through many, many guys. I dated for a while in my past, but I can count past relationships on one hand. 

It's my understanding we both accepted we would die alone. But every time she says she's done, she relapses with someone else. It seems more like dating flings than actual relationships. Either way, I don't like seeing another guy in my house ""in that light"" every few months. 

It seems she is trying to establish a father figure for my siblings. Those were her words. Just dating is probably the worst way to do this. Maybe it's a coverup, I'm not sure.

85,"Context: A few months ago I was bored, frustrated, and had too much time on my hands. So, I went spelunking in the expanse of the internet and found a guy who was looking to have a casual, occasional but ongoing FWB situation. I responded to his message and met for coffee, and a couple of days later we had our ""fun."" I heard from him once after asking to meet again but I couldn't make it, and then I never heard from him again. I shrugged this off as just some random encounter. 

Five months later (aka today) I just got a message from him saying hello, and that it's been a while. Now, keep in mind it's late over here. Pretty damn late. And we weren't exactly friends, we were just friendly strangers. Hearing from him was the last thing I expected. 

I'm not really sure that I want to try to start up a fwb relationship with anyone right now, let alone him. I don't know what to respond with, or even if I should.

Has anybody ever heard or prosper bank? I looked them up and it seems like there are some fraudulent practices in some of the reviews, but what scares me is the credit score. As though somebody had my info and attempted to secure a loan with them and it prompted this denial letter. I'm going to contact my bank Monday and see if they can run my credit check and see if there actually was an inquiry on the 17th. I'll also ask for their advice as well on what to do if this is a real attempt to steal my identity. Is there anything else I can or should be doing immediately?",04Mar2018,1
95,"**This is going to be incredibly long, I've got a lot to get off my chest. I'm at a very important stage in my life and I don't know what to do, decisions are going to have to be made and soon. This post may give off a vibe that I'm full of myself or think I'm some hot shit but I assure you that my only intent is to be as honest as possible and to paint the most accurate version of who I am and the issues I'm facing**

This is my final semester of High School, and I've got long standing social problems that need to be addressed before I get out of here. I don't think I'd ever say that I'm not happy with who I am. To be honest I'm an incredibly lucky person. I'm an 18 year old guy from a well off family, I drive a nice car, I have a good job, I'm a successful athlete with school records, I'm good looking, I'm very friendly and easy to get along with, I have no difficulties in getting a room full of people to laugh and pay attention to me. I say all of this not to sound like I'm an asshole, but I want everyone to know that I am indeed very lucky, I think given my circumstances I should be the happiest kid alive. But I'm not, I haven't been happy for a long time. Although I'm social and friendly with just about every kid in my school, I struggle with making any sort of connection beyond the most basic friendly conversation. This is the chief reason that I've never dated, despite knowing plenty of girls that are into me. I'm incredibly shy when I need to take anything beyond casual flirting or conversation. I think you can see where this is going at this point, it's a classic shy guy and girls issue. But I think it stems deeper than that, I have an important decision to make very soon that I think could determine who I become in life. 

So.....there's this girl. I'll admit that I haven't just been in love with her for years I've been infatuated. I know it's gonna sound cheesy and pathetic when I say it but to me she's my idea of perfect. I'll spare you the basic ""she's smart and pretty and interesting"" rant because every guy has said that about every girl he's loved ever. The fact is she's the girl I've always wanted to marry, and like so many other girls I've never had the balls to move past anything over than casual conversation. She's gone, she was a grade above me in school and she left for college last year and she has a serious boyfriend. I've accepted the fact that she's never going to be part of my life. But she lingers in my mind. I thought I could push it away, but it came back in the worst way possible. Her little sister. (For now on I'll refer to the older as O and the younger as Y) Just as beautiful, just as great in all those ways, and she's into me, and I'm into her too. For the first time in my whole life I'm starting to make a connection with a woman, I think for the first time in my life I'll be dating someone soon. But I can't escape this feeling that they'll be something wrong about it. I can't escape the feeling that I'll only ever half love Y, and in reality I'll always be fixated on O. Y doesn't deserve that, she deserves someone that actually loves *her* not her sister. But I do *like* Y, I like her a lot, she's a great girl, she has a great future ahead of her, she's great. But I don't think O will ever escape my mind, especially when I get serious with Y and I'll start seeing O all the time. The two are incredibly close. I don't want to lie to myself or her. But I feel this may be my only chance for a long time to forge a real connection with a person. I'll be honest when I say I don't really care about sex in a relationship. I just want to bond with someone, something I don't think I've ever really done. 

I appreciate any advice you can give and I'll answer any questions about my situation you have. Again I don't want to come across like some sort of dick with this post. I know many people have much more important stuff to ask for advice about. In the grand scheme of things this will be tiny to all of you, but this is massive to **me**.

Hi. I’m Allison, a college student majoring in Neuroscience and a tenant of an off-campus apartment with very *very* crappy management. I pay $750 a month in rent (not cheap). Many of the residents here are immature and disrespectful, they party all week long and blast their music until 3 or 4 am, scream/yell, stomp and bang on the floors. I was told when I toured the property prior to signing the lease that the concrete flooring made the facility *SOUND PROOF* and guaranteed never to hear my upstairs or downstairs neighbors. I have had 3 meetings with management of the apartment and my landlord, in which they told me they would “talk to them [the neighbors I have filed noise complaints against]” and nothing ever gets resolved. It says in the lease that disorderly conduct/excessive noise that disrupts other residents is subject to eviction, but the landlord and management seem so coy in actually taking any actions against the residents involved. My advice is: what can I do? I’ve already invested $300 in a pair of noise-cancelling headphones, which work until my chronic migraines kick my butt after wearing them for too long and they’re more of a temporary fix. Is there any action I can take against landlords? Legal action? Any advice will help. Please don’t pass judgement on me for being bothered by noise either. I’m just wondering if anyone can help me in my situation. Thank you.",04Mar2018,1

This thought has been in my mind alot and tbh... I'm scared of being alone but at the same time I felt like it's all my fault for this...

Anywho... I have this complex yet extraordinary friend of mine... let's call him Wilson... we're like  the same person... well almost and tbh I felt like I'm losing the other half (cliched? Yeah I know but that's how I view it). The both of us would play games together, have meaningful conversations together, laugh together, draw together, etc but he's been... uh, how should I put, been though alot and I didn't know how much he's hiding just to see me smile one more time...

I know that he's suicidal but I don't know how much that I could understand him... I understand him. I really do and have absolutely fucking tried, even if I haven't gone though it (call it a character. Like understanding one that you'll care for him/her. At least that's how I see it anyway...) and as each day goes by, the thought worsens... And I'm afraid of losing him... ever... and that's where the thought had began to develop... 
""Am I selfish for not letting him go?!""
""Why aren't I there when he needed you me most?!""
""Why am I such a coward AND a failure?!""
""Why wouldn't you try harder?!""
So many questions I still do not know the answers... and tbh this thoughts does make me died everyday inside... I'm frankly lost in this battle knowing I would possibly never find someone like that. I might but that will never change because I would never feel the same thing ever again... I know this is cliched and such a small matter... but what can I say? I'm autistic after all and I would expected many would've expected naiveté from this simple and childish thought like this... I frankly have no idea what I'm supposed to do...

P.S. Wilson, if you're reading this... I want you to know... that I'm sorry... I've failed you. My effort wasn't enough. Yes, I haven't been through what you might have. I know I'm naive. And I'm sorry for leaving you with that impression... I tresure us. Those memories. The good. The bad. The ugly. And I would have wish for the best for us but such is the world that we live in that living pains you more... You wanted me to live on... but can I really live without you? Idk. I know this sounds cliched and childish... but yeah, you were the best.",04Mar2018,1
101,"My husband is not a violent drunk, but this problem has persisted for a long time.  This usually happens at night when we come home from work.  I have school at night too, so this is especially hard on me.  Sometimes he's fine, but once he goes out for a smoke break and don't come back for a hour or 2, he comes home really out of it.  This also makes me very worried because sometimes I don't know when he'll be home or how he'll act when he is home.  
He acknowledged that he has a problem, and always promise to not be that way, or many times he'd blame his boss (who sometimes call him at night for status reports), that his boss makes him smoke a lot and some times drink.  I have threatened to leave before, but doesn't solve anything.  A few times I'd stay at his aunt's place because they're not too far from us, but he'd usually blow up everyone's phone because he got intoxicated.  My parents are sort of aware of this problem, but they tried to encourage me to work it out peacefully, also they just lost their parents and I don't want to stress them more, although they may be a last resort.
I really feel like finding a friend's place to crash without telling my husband where I'd be so that he wouldn't keep harassing whoever when he gets intoxicated.  Although so far I only have a male friend who might be able to help me due to close proximity to work and school.

102,"I am a writing tutor at my university and I was emailed a paper last night that was clearly not written by the student who emailed me. I ran it through a plagiarism checker and the report indicated there was very little original content. Some came directly from a ""buy an essay"" website and others from various articles on the topic.

I have already emailed my supervisor without naming the student, just saying I suspect plagiarism and I don't know what to do.

Technically the assignment hasn't been submitted yet so he still has a chance to do the assignment on his own. Should I send him an email saying that his paper doesn't sound like his own work? Or just leave it alone? The assignment is due Sunday at midnight so I am assuming he'll just turn it in if he doesn't hear from me and the offense will suddenly become much more serious.

If this were during the week, I could just go visit my supervisor's office and chat with him about it but I don't know if I will hear back from him until Monday and by then this will go from an intent to plagiarize to actual, submitted plagiarism.

112,"So recently I've been feeling pretty down. This whole post can pretty much be summed up and boiled down to some guy having girl troubles, but honestly, it's a little more complicated. To really get the full grasp of this situation, I pretty much have to start from the beginning. I'll try not to make it long, but I want to make sure all the right details are in there.

So basically it all started when I met this girl in a Barnes and Noble around Christmas time. Needless to say, I was awestruck, and surprisingly, she was too. It came to this point where she comes up to me, and asks for book recommendations, clearly to flirt with me, and I pick up on it and ask for her number. Turns out she's an American who lived in the Netherlands for a few years because her family is in the military, and she just moved to around were I live in the states. We start texting for a bit, and eventually we go on our first date. Now here's where the first key thing comes in, because this date was easily the best date I ever had in my life. Easily. We just talked for hours and hours for what seemed to only be minutes. The only reason we actually left the date at all was because we found out the restaurant was about to close. Everything seemed to click; We shared basically all the same opinions on things, we loved the same music, we were super interested in the stuff we find interesting, (she's a writer and I'm a comedian), and she even laughed at all of my jokes! It went so well, that we basically had to see each other immediately for a another date, and that's exactly what we did for New Years. The more we talked to each other, the more I thought about her. I've dated plenty of other girls before, but none like this. This was different. I was comfortable to be weird around her, and she was too. To me, nothing could get in the way, until something actually did.

Eventually I started to text her, and I wouldn't get responses like I normally would. I start to worry a bit, and I start to freak out a bit. Did I do something wrong? Did I say something to piss her off? Turns out it was none of those things, turns out she was in a hospital. I was scarred but she was fine. Turns out this is pretty normal because she was in a hospital regularly. Naturally I was really confused. Turns out the real reason she moved to the states was because her and her entire family got chronic carbon monoxide poisoning, and the only way to get treatment was to come back to the states. Miraculously, the whole family lived, but they all needed immediate care. She's been in treatment for months now, but took a break because of the holidays, when she then met me. So this is really when things started to get complicated.

I took her on a date to try and figure some of this out. At this point, we haven't really been dating that long, but we've been getting so close, it still felt difficult. She wanted to end it, but for a good reason. She basically said that she feels that as a girlfriend, she has to take on a bunch of responsibilities that she can't do in her current health state. She then said that she gets out of treatment in about 3 months, so when that happens, then we can maybe reevaluate our relationship. I said ok, but then we had to end our date. I took her to overlook a river. The moon glowed really bright that night like she did. I actually had this polar bear hat meant for five-year-olds that fits my head (don't ask) and we laughed a bit wondering why someone would make something like this. She then asked if she could try it on, so I put it on her head, so my hands were then on her hair/neck/shoulder area. Now I don't know if it was the moon that glowed on her in the right angle or whatever, but she looked so beautiful, I just leaned in and kissed her. We kiss for a bit and the do that thing where your noses and foreheads are touching, when she then says ""No..."". I ask ""Why not?"" and she replies, ""You know why..."". She then gets a text from her mom saying she needs to go home, and I go ahead and drop her off, and that was the last I saw of her.
Fast forward to right now when I'm typing this post. It's almost been three months. I tried texting her, but I'd get no responses. I tried dating a couple of other girls, but it didn't feel the same. Nothing feels the same. Part of me wants to be hopeful, and hope she will come around and we can pick off where we started. But then there's the more realistic side of me; the more cynical side of me. The side that realizes that I have to face reality and move on.

117,"I am very emotionally intelligent so I am not a “Cryer” by nature but that brought tears to my eyes. She said I tend to “ compartmentalize” things, and she said I have “lost touch” with reality over the past few years. I avoid all of my friends, I literally just sit at home if I’m not working I read, watch tv, lurk Reddit, watch documentaries, or text my friends. I’m also a full time student so I get stressed very easily. I am very anti social and avoid crowds, and meeting new people by all means. Even Christmas with my family peaks my anxiety. 

I feel like every day I am waking up just to exist, eat, then go back to sleep and do it all over again. I’m not depressed (I don’t think) I’m just coasting by. Nothing makes me happy, I don’t look forward to anything. I watch the same TV shows over and over and listen to the same songs over and over and keep eating the same food. I feel like I’m stuck in the twilight zone. 

A positive aspect is that I met someone (in a romantic sense I suppose) but I don’t wanna throw all of my marbles in at once and risk rushing into things. I also don’t want to keep rejecting everyone I meet. I’m stuck and I’m lost. I’m 28. 

**EDIT** also want to add that a lot of my friends have given up on hanging out with me because I constantly tell them no. I moved away from the small down I lived in to move to a major city (an hour away) because something traumatic happened to me and it’s just too painful to go back there.

119,"I'm posting this in here instead of r/relationships because I feel like it fits in here better.

So recently I've been hanging out with a friend and co-worker (fast food) a lot. Almost every monday we go out to a local pancake place after work, usually with a few other co-workers, and just talk to each other. Last Monday dating came up in the conversation and a mutual friend that we both know has a crush on her kept on joking about how lonely and single he was, she was sort of doing this head-shake to me as though she was saying that she wasn't interested in him.

The next day me and her went on a long drive and talked about life. She brought it up and told me specifically that she wasn't interested in this friend. Then we talked about dating again and she asked me if there was anyone at work I was interested in and I sort of panicked and said I didn't know. The conversation naturally moved on and that was that.

A few days ago I told her I'm taking my driver's test soon and almost every night now she's taken me out in her car and has been teaching me to drive. The last time we went out we went to a cookie place and sat in the parking lot just eating and messing with each other.

Yesterday she called me into work to fill in for someone else and sent a text about how she appreciates me and sent a few heart emojis with it.

I honestly can't tell if she's interested in me or if she's just being friendly. She has a really outgoing personality while I'm more introverted. I feel like our friendship is sort of like a Jim/Pam (From The Office) relationship except a little less flirty. 

What would be my best course of action here? I'd love to be in a relationship with her but I'm terrified that if I do ask her and she rejects me that it'll ruin our friendship and she's the closest friend I've had in years. I don't know what to do.",04Mar2018,1
120,"Hello friends,

Recently moved into a new home. Because of the size of my room I built a lofted bed so I could still do hanging out stuff below it. Now here comes the problem.

I eat a bowl of cereal every night in bed before falling asleep. 

Now if you have not tried eating cereal in bed before I would highly suggest it. Perfect snack. Puts you right to bed. Cant say enough good things about it. Having said that... now that my bed is 5 feet in the air I have no bed side table to put the empty bowl of cereal. This brings me to either climb down from the bed or fall asleep spooning a empty bowl of cereal.

Asking for ideas to solve this problem. I think the best solution would be a empty cereal bowl shelf but maybe someone on the internet has a better one. Thanks for all the help.",04Mar2018,1
122,"I am a vanilla type of gal, the most rebellious I got was “dating” a guy 3 years older than me I met online (barely saw him IRL, never once went on a real date). My little brother is a 15 year old “wild” child, he’s done drugs, had many girlfriends, made it to all the bases (so he says), etc etc etc. My mom is extremely controlling (requires access to all social media, reads all communications, needs to know and have a hand in everything you do), so when he needs someone to talk to I try to be the one that he can come to. After growing up under her thumb, I know how stifling it is and I don’t want him to have to grow up feeling the way I did. 

But, last weekend while he was out hanging with his friends, he texted me from either a friends number (or a fake number) to ask me to buy him some cigars. When I told him that first heck-to-the-no am I buying you cancer and second I do not have the money to spend. He replied that he was selling some pot (not yet legal here, nor will it be for a long time) that weekend and could pay me back Monday. I reiterated my points, and he moved on. 

Today, I got a text from my mom that he suddenly has money and she is wondering if I know if it’s from selling vape juice or from her purse. Both are possibilities, these are things he’s done before and she is missing money from her purse (note: my older brother is also living at home unemployed and he is also known to dip into mothers purse as well). 

I don’t want to disappoint either of them. I don’t know if anything actually happened. I just have texts. I want my little brother to keep confiding in me, but I also don’t want him selling shit.

127,"On mobile. Sorry for formatting etc

A little back story: I've lived in this duplex (side by side) for roughly a year and a month with my boyfriend. My landlord is a younger guy who seemed really cool when we first moved in. He bought new appliances, fixed up some stuff, replaced some floors, remodeled the bathroom and I even helped paint/ did some side work. 
There were a few little thing that happened in the first month we moved in that he fixed right away. 

Fast-forward to the past few months:
Nothing was really going wrong until the ceiling fan in the bathroom that he put in when we moved in started leaking. It's winter where I live but there was some really nice days where the snow melted and it rained. The first day it leaked it was super windy and it rained pretty hard. We told him it was leaking a little and since its winter still we just wanted him to know. He said he was out of town and the cap must have blown off from the wind and he was going to have his buddy who's a contractor come over and check it out. The guy came over and we heard nothing about why it was leaking, so we figured it was fixed. Nope. The next time it rained it leaked but worse. I put a bucket under it and my boyfriend sent him a text telling him about what was happening and we got no response. It got cold, snowed again and we kinda forgot about it. Up until a few weeks ago the temp went up and it rained for a few days, so this time not just the fan was leaking but the door frame. Literally pissing water out of the door frame. I didn't even know that could happen. 
It's rained since then and every time it's leaking from the fan and the door frame and this dude is not doing anything about it. We don't expect him to crawl up on the roof in 20 degree weather but we expect him to at least acknowledge there's an issue or act like he cares etc. Whatever. Not my apartment. Not my actual problem...except when it's dripping on my head when I'm trying to do my makeup or hair. 

The second problem is now the garage door is broken and my car is trapped in the garage.  The rollers on the track are literally falling off and the door won't open more than 4 inches on the left side. It happened overnight basically. 
The next door neighbors are the ones that couldn't get into the garage to park in there and they sent a group text on March 1st asking when the last time we used the garage was. We told them Tuesday (Feb 27th) when I got home from work &amp; hadn't used it since. ( I have 2 days off in a row and had been sick) So they texted the landlord about it and... he's out of town. Go figure.
Luckily a co-worker was nice enough to pick me up Friday and Saturday. 
My issue with this is not only can I not use my car but we haven't heard from him about when he's going to get someone fix it. 

Anyway, I have no idea how to go about telling him I'm fed up with this bullshit of him being out of town and not taking things as seriously as he should. Both things are pretty important and I really don't even know what to do at this point. 
I've never paid rent more than a day late (he has a 3 day late policy) and we're not bad tenants.
Anyone have advice for me?",04Mar2018,5
129,"Hey Redditors, I need your advice!

I have recently started a new job as an Event Technician, setting up stages, drapes, sound, lighting etc for events from Bands to Corporate Events. I have no experience in this field but I'm learning on the job and have found that I'm naturally wired to how the job works. I've picked up concepts faster than other team members who started at the same time as me with no experience like me. For obvious reasons I won't name the company, but the Director has noticed that I'm progressing ahead of some of the other new team members and has put me on specific jobs to accelerate my learning.

While this is all very positive, the flip side is that the Director is also an Event Tech who has built his business up. He has anger issues. Our warehouse is pretty full and we often have larger jobs so inevitably things break and don't always get put away exactly in the warehouse. The Director operates on a ""everything will work perfectly all the time"" basis, I'm not sure if he realizes that he's running a business - nothing will run smoothly and perfectly all the time.

The cause of this is that as soon as something is slightly out of place - not even a problem, just enough to be an inconvenience, he (for lack of a better term) looses his sh*t. 

While I understand his frustrations, there is no excuse for the way he acts in this situation. To add to the confusion his wife works within the business and in the brief time I've been there I have observed tensions within their personal life (marriage?) arise, even resulting in screaming/swearing fits at each other. 

To me this behavior is extremely unprofessional and even immature, but the problem is that no-one deals with it. Everyone just shuts up and gets on with it. Because of the way the Director looses his cool other techs are hesitant to let him know when things have broken, which only worsens the situation when he discovers the issue.

My operations manager, effectively my supervisor, has already on at least one occasion since I started, taken the blame for mistakes me and the new techs have made and worn the brunt of the fury the Director unleashes in these situations. I recently found out that the operations manager will soon be leaving the company (for external reasons.) Already in the short time I feel comfortable around him, and have talked to him about issues I would not feel comfortable talking to the Director about. 

Company Culture starts from the top of the business down, the Director and his wife who co-own the business maintain a high standard of work, but they do not maintain a high standard of self control or self management. For example today the wife had helped fill on a job - she worked 12 hours and in the warehouse packing up she was going on about how she was being ""bitchy because it had been a long day so it was okay to be bitchy."" The thing is that everyone else had also worked the 12 hour day, and some of us (including myself) had worked close to a 14 hour day. No one else was complaining (bitching), why does she have any right to? 

I have enjoyed my time at this job, but I can't see a future in it because of the way the Director and his wife operate. Out of work they seem like lovely people but internally they have some serious issues. I am thinking about leaving because of the way they operate, but I have no idea where to go next. Without blowing my own trumpet I am a switched on worker and was an extremely high achiever in high school (two years ago.) I am excellent problem solver, I love troubleshooting things and trying different methods to find the best outcome. I can work well in a team, pick up new concepts quickly and I'm very good at reading people but I will not and can not tolerate the owners of this business acting the way I've seen them act. I'm not sure whether to recommend them a therapist, a business adviser or a training about company culture (or all three!)

I hope I've explained my situation thoroughly so you understand so now I'm asking your advice- do you think I should leave this job?

If I do leave, where should I go next? An Event technician is a very limited role in the area I live in. I only 20 so I want to cultivate an employable skill set that will set me up for the future and not limit my options. 

Are there any other careers that you can think of that my natural skills/abilities are suited to?

Thanks in advance, if you need to clarify anything I will answer all the questions I can.",04Mar2018,1

Financially I am blessed because of my family, but things at home have been pretty bad for a long time. I used to sneak out last year all the time to see friends and go to the club, but ever since I got caught my parents lost all trust. Its been a couple months and our relationship did get better, and I compromised. But something stupid will happen every now and then, like my dad will check my phone bill and call numbers i've txted only to find a male voice at the other end. They take my phone away on a regular basis because they say they cant trust me. My dad wants me to cut off any male friends I have. I have argued and tried to explain myself and have told them that guys can be my friends without banging me but they dont believe it. I pray just to please them and am basically their housemaid at home. I can rarely go out, and I cant be out later than 8. I had to miss multiple events and birthday parties of my friends because they dont trust that I'm going where I say I'm going. If they cant trust me with anything, and if I cant gain their trust back by already contorting my lifestyle to their ways, then I see no point in staying.

135,"~~So ill keep this short and simple.~~

* Back some time i got bad back.

* Prescribed oxy/opies like candy for bad back.

* As such, I began eating oxy/opies like candy for bad back.

* Some great years pass and oxyCODONE/CONTIN no longer candy

* Damn near turns into into oxyGEN, needing to dose just to live at that point.

* Turn to Xanax BARZ for opiate induced sleepless nights.

* LOVED Xanax. WORKED GREAT!

* So great that I went to rehab 3x for it, (then fired because of it - *long story*).

* Now on relapse#554,685 and I **FINALLY**, and even better ***MENTALLY*** do NOT want Xanax anymore.

* Been kicked opiates and now been on Suboxone 8/2mg for 3-4 years (I get prescribed almost 3 films per day but take SO much less than that)

**(For this next part, Save the ""this doc is a pill mill bs"" plz - The person is part of the chemical dependency and psychiatry department, not defending them, just saying for context)**

Well this doc knows my xanax situation (got barz off street [pressed] and some real pharma, she found fentenyl and meth in my system; She knows I'm downer type and so thats how she knew something was up and asked where i get my xanax from and I was honest and told her ""pill hill"" [anyone from my area knows this is THE FREE MARKET zone.

***So I'm assuming her willingness to help me so much was for me to stop buying xanax off the street)***

* After my recent relapse (around 8-12 bars per day! - It's been rough times lately so I got purposely self-destructive.) She wanted me off xanax so i would stop buying the most pressed pill in America, I assume.
 
* She was deeply worried that I would seize from sudden ""xanax cold-turkeying"" so we tried Klonopins (due to they're high anti-convulsant and sedative properties) But they weren't doing SHIT for me. 

* I switched to Valium (for same 'KPin' properties but has much faster onset, and muscle relaxant property for my back issues.) 

* Ended up into a (x50 qty) for a 2 week supply to see how I did/liked it. 

I'm seeing her this coming week and WILL end up taking the month prescription (even though I dont want it mentally but my addictive head says ""we can use it!"") Ima try to see if i can get (x120 qty) for the month because I'm an addict like that :( 

As stated, no current job so Ive been getting my **Pablo Escobar** on and flipping my subs and oxies (wiggling my way off subs for a few months becasue 'my back hurtz docz"" so i can candy flip then go back to subs ""because I realize they've worked better"" - which is honestly the truth.

I know I love this Valium so much but dont want to get trapped in the rabbit hole of it. It's half life alone is like fucking suboxone, theyre double whammies. **Personally i love the nods they give me (valium[benzo] + suboxone[opiate])** but I dont know if I have the courage to have someone hold them until I find the buyer. 

How do you do life?**

136,"I have been looking for employment to supplement myself while I'm in University. I'm employed now, but want to work elsewhere. Tonight I cruised around checking out local businesses and picking up applications. I live in a blended community; I am white, but a lot of the locals are migrant workers from parts of Mexico and South America. 
   
   
   
I have been working on learning Spanish for my future career. I've also made a lot of friends at my various jobs who I could only hold broken conversation in Spanglish with. Tonight I surprised myself, though. I walked into a Mexican bar and applied for a job.

There's two reasons why I hesitated to accept the offer (it was only for a trial period of a weekend or two, but they didn't see my resume, or references, or anything).
   
   
   
1. It seemed too easy. There was no verifying of who I said I was. It just felt odd to me.
   
    
    
2. I'm not sure my Spanish is good enough yet. I'm worried I would be unable to communicate well enough, and that I would embarrass myself or offend a patron.

I've set a couple of goals for 2018, including improving my memory, time-management and presentation skills, and so far I've started making solid progress on those three. Making post-BSc plans and finding a mentor are the other two. 

Finding a mentor seems incredibly important to me, because I've consistently been finding myself being on the wrong path towards my goals. Whenever I make any improvements in my life, I feel like those are things I could have done years ago if only I realised its importance by then. Which is why I think finding a mentor is so important. Preferably somebody who's experienced things similar to me, but 10-20 years ahead. 

I know my dad could help me in this. He's awesome, had some management roles &amp; built his own, very respectable company from scratch, but he didn't take my route. He had to work himself all the way up, while I'm in university. He doesn't have any experience in that.

142,"I’m 19, male, I live at home, skipped one year after high school to have a gap year, now I’m re-doing some of my final exams in may, to get into a better university. 

It’s been going on for years, but I just can’t take this anymore, I can hardly concentrate on my studies with all this shit he keeps throwing at me. We have shouting sessions pretty much every day (or I avoid him completely), the latest thing was that he can’t remember his passwords to his phone, and the one I remembered was changed at some point, obviously have to take it out on me very vocally. Whatever the fuck he finds to blame someone else with, he’s never taken responsibility for ANYTHING in his life. 

This is the light stuff, I’m sure this problem is pretty common. 

But he likes to do a few things that I’ve just had enough of for good. For example, eavesdropping on any conversation, especially when I’m with my grandpa(he practically raised me, he’s super jealous of him), it’s not hard since they live in the house next to us. And the door thing. He probably has a big thing for seeing stuff he shouldn’t see, 
when I’m on the toilet, a LOT of times when I’m in the toilet, practically every time I take a shit I keep grasping on the door handle, and wait for him to open(never once been disappointed, though I got a lock, he still keeps yanking the door handle, and when I forget to lock it, he scores)
In the bathroom, he used to do that when I was younger and taking baths, we didn’t have a shower curtain around the bath, and he just came in to do whatever, usually just kept washing his hands for a really really long time, now I got a shower curtain, and this doesn’t happen often but he still comes in. Once he pushed the curtain away to see if someone’s showering because “he didn’t know”(the shower was running, pretty fucking hard to miss). 
2am in my room, barges in, flicks on the light and comes to say some stupid shit to help with(now I don’t mind helping him, but whatever I do I’m always at fault, and even with helping he acts like I’m making everything worse) 
and just casually when I’m getting dressed. 
I have other horrible memories with him, when I caught him cheating on my mom(almost kissing the fucking bitch in front of me, wasn’t exactly hard), and sexting others. He came clean by showing every single chat he had in his account(while the sexting shit still appeared in deleted messages, good job). My room had a computer and he kept watching porn on it(knowing from the browser history I kept deleting) which is okay, we know their marriage is a flop, but please not in your 13 something year old boys room. I don’t remember this clearly, because I don’t want to, but at least once he left his jizz on my carpet and chair, I had to clean it up, I didn’t tell anyone. 
Just some examples. 
He keeps finding some shitty excuse for everything, right now he justifies opening the door on my room with that there’s mold in the corners, and it has to breathe. 
So the reason I’m writing this, the last drop was today, this morning I took a shower, got a towel on, went to my room to dry, and closed the door.
I was naked, obviously, and for a reason I put earphones in, I couldn’t hear outside. Next thing is that I look up at my door, he’s standing there, door fully open, looked him in the eye and then he turned and left, leaving the door wide open. 
I sent some warm hearted words after him, and he felt okay defending himself and then proceeded to victimise himself too, for whatever the fuck completely different reason, all in the same argument. 

What can I do now? I can’t take this anymore, I just want to kill myself to not feel so so violated and disgusted all the time. 
I’m already paranoid, and feeling like someone is watching me, listening to me at all times, seriously there’s no stopping in that, I’m constantly searching for cameras in my room he could have placed, checking the wardrobe, I don’t know what it feels like to be safe and normal.  Not just at home, anywhere I am. I check everything. There’s no chance anyone can watch me like that, but I don’t really think this is normal.

(now don’t be worried I don’t need a suicide hotline, I’m 100% set on trying to keep living, I have solid goals I want to reach before giving in. I guess I’ll just have to live with this, but I’d like it to change some)

Edit: Thank you for reading

Update: after this morning I caught him eavesdropping on us when going home from grandparents(next door). I was talking with my grandpa and cousin(moms side btw), and just casually being outside because it’s a snowy good day, then quickly decided to go home without loudly announcing it, because I thought he would be listening to us. So I went home, and me being quick and quiet, I did actually find him hiding behind the corner.

143,"A certain friend of mine hasn't been the greatest friend to be honest. He's messed with drugs and alcohol often and it's something I'm working against to becoming fully sober. We got close to an extent until I disliked his treatment towards his now ex-gf, and then his overly physical and rough habits when hanging out together with me. It's been on my mind for a while that I should cut ties, but he's mentioned he's got depression and he's considered me very close. I do not wish to stay friends but I feel like by cutting ties he might further his depression or even hurt himself. What should I do? ",04Mar2018,4
145,"Sooo this is basically me asking reddit how to respond to a dilemma involving a girl I’m interested in. This girl who I’ve met once but having been taking to online for a long time recently when on a university-based camp for a few days. I only found out about this through her friend, who told me that the camp was “basically an orgy” and that this girl wouldn’t be able to respond because she’d be “busy losing her virginity”. Obviously I’m quite interested in this girl and I was under the impression I had serious chances with her until hearing this. 

I decided to give her friend the benefit of the doubt that she was joking around or exaggerating, but just tonight I asked her how things were and whether her friend was right about the camp being an orgy (jokingly, of course). She responded “it legit was” and when I said I wouldn’t ask anything else, she said “yeah you’d probably be better off not knowin”, which killed any chances of it being a joke/exaggeration. 

Should I be as cut about this as I am? Is it wrong that I’m as bothered by the possibility of this girl who I don’t know too well getting with other guys and possibly forming sexual/romantic relationships with people besides myself? I feel somewhat selfish by how distressed I felt upon hearing this, and I’m now unsure of whether I want to pursue this girl at all.

It’s troubling me how upsetting this whole thing is. I’ve really been struggling with my relationships recently, including friends, family and potential (and ex) partners so I guess I got my hopes up too much in the case of this girl. She goes to my university so it’s unlikely I’ll never see her again, but I’m unsure of whether it’s wise for me to cut things off completely.

Is it worth pursuing? Is it possible things could still work out between us even after this? We’ve barely had a chance to get to know each other properly and I feel things have already gone to shit.

Could really use some advice to put my mind to rest. Thanks in advance.",04Mar2018,2
146,"I earn &lt;$400 a week and he earns around $1000. So between us we can only just afford a unit at 30% of our joint income. I feel like I’m the most excited for this - I’m currently in a situation where I move between my parents houses every two weeks because I don’t want to upset either of them. I can’t think of anything I’d rather do than come home to my boyfriend every night and just relax and spend time with him. I’m concerned he thinks it’s a bad idea as he earns almost triple what I do. 

We’re from Sydney so living isn’t exactly cheap. I want to still put money towards my savings but don’t want him to feel I’m not contributing as much; to save I would need to spend less money on rent and food than him.

148,"I'm 18 (legal drinking age here) &amp; I feel so ashamed of myself. I went to an 18th birthday party last night &amp; I drank so much. I don't really know why. I had 6 or 7 beers and took shots with my friends. I didn't get sick or black out thankfully. I can't remember the last 3 hours or so. My dad collected me &amp; I fell over going to bed. My sister had to watch me brush my teeth and getting into bed etc. 

I feel so terrible. I don't get hangovers but I have made such a fool of myself. I've gotten drunk before but never this bad. I was hugging everyone apparently &amp; falling around the place. How on earth do I get over this? My dad won't talk to me, he's so angry. I feel like crying, I hardly ever get into trouble. He said I'm a disgrace &amp; I humiliated him.

149,"A friend of mine got drunk off of wine with his parents and then entered a voice chat room where my  friends and myself were having a fun conversation while playing some games on our day off. He had mentioned to me that he was drinking with his mom earlier to me over text but everyone could tell he was hammered when he started talking in the chat. I made a small and subtle joke with my other friends as he is underage but it was nothing really aimed to put him down. My joke really meant nothing cold hearted, but rather was a play on the situation and in reality meant nothing that would ruin him or his family. He took it to the extreme and started telling people of some personal and private things about me to my other friends, he went as far as calling me a hypocrite because I experimented with weed when I was in high school (which was one of the things I regret and have buried). He then called me a cunt and that I was ruining him and his mom's reputation. My dilemma starts when I abruptly got infuriated with him, cursed him out and made him leave the chat after feeling embarrassed around my other friends. It hurt me deeply because he told five other people of some personal information I've been trying really hard for years to get past, plus I feel like I ruined one of my closest friendships. Was I wrong for doing so? I recognize he was absolutely hammered but it still hurt me deeply, and I most likely demolished that friendship after today. ",04Mar2018,3

154,"My group of friends are really cliquey and I feel that they alienate my girlfriend and I a bit.  I met them after moving to a new country and moving into a houseshare.  During that time, I was very friendly with them as I just went along with whatever my housemates were doing. 

After I met my girlfriend, the clique of girls in the group and everyone was friendly enough but never really gelled like all the other girls have.

Fast forward a few years and I am out of the house-share and living with my girlfriend in our own place.

No one in the group ever makes effort with either of us. The girls in the group arrange girls nights out but exclude my girlfriend and no one really makes an effort with me unless I reach out to them first.

We went out the other night after I made effort with the group and whilst drunk, one of the girls invited my girlfriend out with the girls the next day, but my girlfriend was busy the next day (they'd all planned it way in advance but one drunk girl only told my friend the day before).

I feel like we often don't do much fun, social stuff and often just stay at home in each other's company only. I also feel like the older we're getting the harder it is to make new friends (I also suffer from anxiety so find it very hard to reach out and make the initial effort with people).

Hoping anyone with similar experiences can give some advice on how my girlfriend and I can form more closer friendships and not feel excluded.

157,"I'm 18 years old turning 19 this year. I graduated high school last year but didn't go to college for various reasons. I assumed that I have to afford college on my own because my family sort of always gave me a hard time for asking for money (I live with my extended family since I was little, parents are gone). I intended to find a job to fund college this year but nearly a year had passed with no such luck. So I decided to take another year to try and find a job since there's nothing else I can do anyway. Then out of nowhere my family said they're going to pay for college (yeah, not much communication going on here).



Now this is where things gets complicated. I want to go to college badly, but:



1. It's not exactly cheap (SouthEast Asia), probably more expensive than high school, and if my family gave me shit about high school tuition then what're they gonna do if they pay for my college tuition? I absolutely hated being depended on them, I'm actively seeking a way out but being realistic, there isn't much I can do. If I can't work and save enough this year I can't afford to take 3 gap years (or possibly more) which means I have to let them pay (if the offer is still available). Scholarship is not an option until year 2 of college.



2. It's March, the uni entrance exam is due in May, so I have only 2 months for preparation which consists of learning 4 subjects that I have no idea about because I don't learn it in high school. I'm not slow, but with 2 months I don't think I can beat thousands of people who have prepared themselves for months or years ahead.



3. I don't think I'm ready for college yet. Money and exam aside, I have a lot of personal issues that I need to resolve before I go to college, lest I will probably have a shitty time. Again, there's no guarantee that I can tackle all these things in a year.



A little context about my family, sure there are some asshole but in general it's not a bad family. Since my parents are gone those people think I'm their responsibility. Being brought up by a lot of people with logic and ideals that doesn't align with mine messed me up a little bit, which made them berate and hate me more. Cue giving me hell for being ungrateful little shit and wasting a lot of money.",04Mar2018,4
159,"Hello everyone! At first glance this may seem like a very stupid question but as of now I have no where to turn and was wondering if you guys can help me.

Ever since 8th grade I have always wanted to build a computer for gaming and other online purposes. Throughout high school my parents always said they wouldn't allow it and it was understood, I focused on my studies and they were correct to not spend money on something I wanted.

Before I get into anything I just want to comment on how fair my parents are. I am 19 at the moment and commute to college and involving going out or spending my own money they are pretty ok with it. Regarding household duties I consistently help out and contribute because I feel it is right.  

Furthermore, I graduated with 4 year honors and all acceptances to universities with a academic award at my graduation. The summer going into first year college I went to work in a factory which I absolutely hated the shift and the job involving 6am to 2:30pm in consistent heat and labor. I didn't care to much because it was only for 2 months and I took home around 2500 dollars which was amazing. Moving along I came to first year and my parents still said to me its not a good idea because it will distract me from my studies and they were right. I was still upset but I let it go and just focused on other hobbies. 

Moving along to last summer I basically had to work construction due to my dad's request. All the jobs I applied for rejected me and he only would let me switch jobs if there was something in my field which for me is very rare. He made a promise to me that this job would only be for 1 summer and regardless of arguing I worked there for 4 months. The pay was good for a student but 50 hour work weeks were kinda hard for me but I kept my mouth shut and did my job and took home a good amount of cash in 4 months.

In present day I still would like to purchase my computer but It is just so hard to convince them. I am 19 years old second year of university and have enough money to fund the whole project myself. However every time I bring it up to them it gets brushed off and not taken any interest. When the argument escalates my parents argue that I dont pay rent and that as-long as I am under there roof they have authority which makes me furious. My friends have told me to just do it and pay the consequences but this really upsets me in the fact that my parents will always be mad and any drop in academic grades they will blame on my passion for gaming.

The big reason why I am frustrated is that my brother has a setup similar to one I want except he has a gaming laptop instead of computer and my parents just leave it alone. I understand this is very stupid and immature but I would just like to ask your guys take on it. I contribute more then enough of my efforts into helping my family around the house and other then this there amazing and some of the most fair people I have ever met. As of now my parents just purchased a laptop for school and I know people may say I am greedy but the system has low specs and doesn't run anything. The only video games I play are old mobas and other low spec games that have trouble running on a laptop that is 5 years old and elevated.

If anyone can help that would be amazing, I know this is stupid I just don't know where else to turn.

163,"I am 24 and graduated from Va Tech. My degree is in business mgt. I moved home after school and began working at my parents boat company where I have been for 2 years. I love fishing and I love boating. It is one of my favorite hobbies. Their company is one of the best(by volume and $) in the entire country and, as good parents, they would like for me to be a part of it. I really do enjoy going to work, but the boat store is in a really small, conservative town w/ no one that is my age who share my interests/beliefs. Outside of work, I have nothing. I went to high school here but all of the people that I would like to see have moved out. The ones that stayed I don't want to associate with. After living in solitude, I have come to realize I need friends my age around to be happy. Over the last year I have become depressed because of my situation. I don't want to disappoint my parents but I do want to be happy. I have a girlfriend from college who is now in TN and I have friends all over the east coast. I have decided to leave the boat store. My plan is to see my girlfriend for several weeks and figure out if 1. it living together is something we can manage and 2. if there is anything in her city I will be happy doing.  After several weeks with her I will go out to mountains of California to see my best friend, work a month long (casual)job, and clear my head.

I don't have that ONE thing that interests me like some people do that are my age. Maybe it's music, but I don't think I can make a living from it. I have considered more school and I have considered more jobs but I don't know what direction to go. I am not built to work in a suit w/ an office job. I do want to make a decent living though.

164,"My father left my mother when she was pregnant of me, got with a much younger woman with which he became polygamous and frequently went to parties while having us over during the weekend. Sometimes they gave houseparties where I would be around drunk people and sexual promiscuity at a very young age. They also neglected me frequently, and my dad left my then 22 year old stepmother to raise us while my father was too busy playing videogames or in bed after a night out. My stepmother was a tyrant, and wouldn't shun harsh measures, from violently being held under water after pretend-drowning my younger half-sister, to hitting me and my older sister. My father let all of this happen, and seemed almost unavailable most of the time, too busy behaving as what I would consider an immature child. I dreaded every visit, cried on my way there, and longed for the time when I could gain authority over which parent I wanted to live with.

To make this immensely long story a bit shorter from her on out, I was born with autism and went to special schools in a time when people didn't exactly know what to do with autism. My father never accepted this about me, once even blaming my mother for making up autism and creating this anti-social behavior within me with the way she raised me. Slowly I stopped seeing my father, from once a month, to once every three months. Every time we did visit it would be on his terms, doing the things that he wanted to do, never once caring about the person I am, solely convinced that I just needed to do the things he did to 'fix' myself. I even took him on it a few times, and worked jobs that he was able to get me. They were absolute hell, and I would often quit because it was too crowded and too social for me to handle to work jobs that I liked and didn't require too much social interaction and stress.

After my father moved and didn't even think to tell me or invite me to the opening, I simply quit talking to that side of my family altogether, that includes my younger sister, my stepmother, and my father. This also damaged the relationship with my older sister, which I already barely see, because she is convinced that my father and stepmother have changed, and that they deserve another change. The problem is that I honestly don't feel like I lack something in my life, it feels like a relief not to have to visit them and feel awful after every visit. That side of my family is also very mean spirited when it comes to the way they treat each other, often saying spiteful things or fighting over past events.

The thing is that I simply don't want this kind of family behavior for my children, I don't want my children to grow up having to deal with hurtful, bigoted people, and to be able to feel accepted. I want this bad family history to end with me, and I feel like even if I would go back to seeing my father, that behavior wouldn't stop.

167,"I grew up in a very rural area and now I live in a big city. To say that my hometown is racist would be an understatement.. we are talking about generations upon generations of racists. My family moved there when I was ten, and before that time I had never heard a damn racist comment in my life. 

My father is a South American immigrant, my mother is an Irish-Canadian immigrant; they never told me that there were going to be people out there who hated others because of their race, and they never EVER used derogatory words when referring to other races. The first time I ever heard the “N” word- some kid called me it while on the bus to school and I was so confused. This was before google so the only thing I could do was listen to the other kids and hear their definition of what it meant. Fucking awful. 

I lived in that town until I graduated from high school, then I moved on to college and graduated there as well. I still saw my fair share of racism after leaving that podunk town but for the most part it was behind me, until now. 

I’ve been working at a company for almost three years now and I work with a woman from my hometown. She is a member of one of the deep-rooted families, and she never hesitates to let her racist flag fly. The super shitty thing is, is that there are other coworkers who perpetuate her behavior, and it all seems to be a big joke to them, I feel like this is just positive reinforcement to all of the awful stuff she says. 

There have been a few occasions when she and I have gone out together with a group of people who are not from work, and she made extremely unacceptable comments which offended pretty much everyone. When people confront her about the horrible shit she says, she always comes back with “k-zilla and I grew up in such and such a town and that’s how people talk there... it’s not me.. yada yada yada”, 

I just hate that she includes me in any sentence where she is defending her own racism. My friends know I’m not racist so ultimately it doesn’t matter, but it’s the principle... I mean, really? Your family has been racist for 100 years but you’re gonna use me as a crutch so you can try to get away with saying your shitty things in front of people who won’t put up with it... okay. 

Here’s the real kicker, I actually really love this girl. I’ve known her since I was ten, we played multiple sports together in high school, she’s one of the only good listeners that I know, she genuinely cares about peoples lives to the point where she will ask you every day about a problem you might have mentioned to her until it gets resolved. She goes out of her way to do nice things for the people she loves, if I needed anything ever, I know I can count on her for sure. It breaks my fucking heart that she’s admittedly a racist.

I never really made a move since I dont feel like we play in the same league and I hoped that maybe for some reason she would approach me or that there would be a perfect situation to just kiss her. So yesterday a guy came up to her in the club and they got all flirty and she left the dancefloor with him. I felt like I was being ripped apart from the inside. I went to the toilet to catch a breath and accidentally threw my phone into the toilet. I felt like this night was definitely over for me.

It's really embarrassing the last thing I sent them was this big huge long thing with a link in it and then I didn't get anything back for a week. Then I got a message from them saying that they were trying to think how to respond now that I had found some support and that they didn't read my last message. They also said I could contact them again if any new concerns came up but that they advised we stopped messaging back and forth. It was a really soft let down and its humiliating.

170,"I am currently 17 years old, in senior year of high school, and was always known as a careless guy, as someone childish, and immature. I was also one of the people who would make a lot of black humor jokes and stuff like that, all around not the best way to be a good friend, or have a good friend. Also I almost never had a ""real"" friend, who is not just someone who shares intrest in what I do, but someone who actually cares, making my change friends countless times until the 7th/8th grade.

My problem is that no matter how much I try(I know it sounds that way, but I am not trying to change for other people to look at me better, but for me since I think its a better personality and a nicer way to live), people will always see me as immature as I was(Or still a little am). I have always had my ups and downs with that, sometimes feeling like I have no friends at all, sometimes feeling like I do but only I am trying to be a friend, and it seems to me that only when I try to get involved actively I hang around with people after school time. I mean I had a huge wake-up call when a good friend of mine, who is a neighbor, and has been a close friend for like 15 years, had his 18th birthday, and had like 10 people invited from the group we hang around with but I was not invited, I know it sounds childish, but its just an example, one of the more hurtful ones.

171,"Hello. I'm in need of some advice as I'm unsure what to do. This is a throw away account - some people know my existing account.

**First some background:** I'm 26, live in South Africa, and have been diagnosed with Aspergers and ADHD, which can impact the decisions I make and also make it a little difficult to sort myself out in terms of the future. I left my job just under two years ago to do some traveling and enter full-time studies for a degree. The studies never happened as it's tricky to get into a university where I am unless you have the exact requirement on your school leaving certificate. After traveling, my parents offered for me to study overseas at the university I wanted, only to retract the offer later as they realised the cost. I tried to get into local universities without any luck, even though I have industry experience and have taken courses (online mostly) for the subject I was lacking. I was able to get into a college, but reviews were mostly negative and didn't seem worth it for the much higher price than the universities.

**The problem:** I need to sort myself out for the future, I'm in a bit of a rut now where I don't know what to do. I'm still living with my parents and realise I have been doing too little for too long, and I need to make the jump to independent living at some stage, which is difficult as I don't have an income yet. My mother sent me a message saying:

""*I have had enough of your indecisiveness and bullshit. By Friday I want to know how many jobs you have applied for. You have a month and then you move out*""

I understand why she is angry, although I don't think it's completely fair? Anyway, I can get a job, but another 9-5 job is daunting and scared to go that route again considering the stress of my last job, I don't think I'd even have the energy to do this right away. I also do not have any qualifications, so I cannot move to the job I'd like right now, at most I could probably get a similar job to what I was doing 2 years ago (worked in IT). If I start working full time again, I'd want to do so overseas and not here. So I think my options are:

* Work as a freelancer (online) (I have done this before, briefly), get my visa in order for moving overseas, and develop a portfolio

* Put a proposal together for my parents - I have small business idea that I would love to try and would be relatively easy to start, and develop a portfolio.

* Get my visa ASAP and move overseas and work there, I can also do my degree part-time and online there.

Reason I want to move overseas is that I would like some change, there are better prospects there, more jobs, better income. I have more family there and people that I know, than I do here. I don't really have any other family here other than my parents and grandmother. I also do not have contact with friends anymore.

I'm really struggling to decide on what to do, and scared of making a decision. If anyone can please help me with what the best way to handle that I would so appreciate it.

Sorry for the wall of text.

**TL:DR:** I'm in a mess where I've been inactive (mostly) for 2 years, my parents are irritated, and I'm not sure what the best part is. Move overseas (I would like), do freelancing, start my small business or get a job.",04Mar2018,6
172,"I’m 34 and I haven’t lived at home since I left for college. Now an opportunity is presenting itself for me to move in with my sister for one year and save quite a bit of money. The house belongs to my parents who will be there about 5% of the time (this is their second home) and my sister lives there with her 3-year-old son.   

Benefits:  

1. I would save about $10k over the course of a year because of the greatly reduced rent I’d be paying. At the end of the year I could move back to the city to a really nice apartment where I could have a dog (I’m not in a financial situation to do this now, but I would be in a year, with the money I save and I’d be debt free by that time).  
2. I would become closer to my sister and her son, which would be nice.  
3. Living with a 3-year-old would help me determine whether I want to have kids, which I don’t think I do but I am worried I will regret and welcome an opportunity to make a more educated decision.  
4. I could take some time off (it’s in the country, I’ve always lived in a city) and focus on myself for a year, which aligns with some larger goals I’m working on.  
5. I could get a dog. It’s a nice house, there are trees (I live in the city ha ha) and enjoy being outside more, which I love. I think getting a dog would improve my quality of life 100%.  

Concerns:  

1. I have a really quiet, agreeable personality, and the idea of living with my family again scares me because everyone is more domineering than me. I hate fighting and if I live with my sister there will be (occasional) fighting and yelling. I don’t think it’s unsafe or an abnormal amount, it’s just something I’m really sensitive about and something I don’t have to deal with when I live on my own and am in total control of my living space. I figure the worse case scenario is that it doesn’t work out, and within a few weeks I could be moved back into an apartment in the city.  
2. My parents have furnished the house and have a lot of stuff, I don’t know if I’d ever feel relaxed living amongst tons of chochkes and chaos.  
3. Dating is very easy right now because I live in the city. I don’t know who I would meet/how it would go to date when I live in a small town with my sister.  
4. I LOVE living in the city and walking places. Being able to walk places makes me feel really good for some reason. I don’t know if I will feel claustrophobic in a setting where I have to drive everywhere.  
5. I tend to have a perfectionist idea about myself/my life so this idea that “taking a year off” would be really good for me could be a false idea. I think I need a year to work on my goals but really I should be focusing on being happy with myself/my life right now and I don’t want to feed into this tendency that I have to believe I need to accomplish x things before I can have a real relationship/feel like an adult/live my life.  

(I work for myself so commute/work stuff isn’t an issue).  

If I’m honest with myself, I am leaning towards moving, but I’m concerned I’m just doing this because it feels like progress/taking action and not because it’s the best step for me. I don’t know if I take this year “off” and move home and it’s great for me or if it’s another year in a series of years where I make of list of everything imperfect about my life and feel like I can’t do anything else until I’ve fixed those things.   

Appreciate any perspective or insight an outsider might have into my situation!  

Tl;dr: I need advice about whether I should move in with my sometimes difficult family away from a city I love.

173,"My mother went through trauma because of her mother. 

She does not control her emotions. They're either good or really bad. When the emotions are good she's a great caring woman who seems to love us. But once a little thing triggers her emotions, she destroys you verbally. She blames my father for everything (He's suicidal and lost his bond with me as he blames himself for things that are not happening). She criticizes my sister's actions since she was really young (She never had true emotional support from our mother). When she feels bad she sends very long text messages to my sister and father telling how how bad they are, how they are and will never be successful and basically destroys everything good they believe about themselves. One moment she loves you, the next minute she hates you for existing, with the same face on. It's like two personalities in one face. I don't know if she actually loves us.

With me it's very slightly different. She does not send me long destructive messages. But when she feels good she's caring and loving. But when she feels bad she calls me gay (She also called my sisters psychotherapist and told her that my sister is lesbian and all the ''bad things'' she apparently does.) , she calls me unstable, she criticizes everything I do, she starts raging or crying and destroys my life verbally. She always supported my career and complimented my intelligence, but I always felt a disconnect in the outside world. When she's arguing, she will not stop. She will only go harsher.

I got to a point where I got into my mother's mind and asserted some kind dominance. She told me she thinks I am manipulating her. Maybe I do? I do not know, I do not control it. If I happen to do it then it's for good. She is very anorectic. She doesn't eat and would have to force her to drink at least some water, which will turn into an aggressive argument either way.
I am 21 right now but I heavily emotionally unstable, my friends can't handle the amount of triggers I have unknowingly. My father is depressed, he's afraid of being himself in the house and we have lost our bond. He was just going through a reoccurring suicidal phase. My sister is very distant from my parents, she told me she cries very often, she knows she will never find support from my mother as much as she wants to.

How can I change my family back to normal, where we can meet and be happy with each other? Last Christmas my mother threw a phone towards my sisters face out of impulsive rage, luckily she missed. It's so thin it's almost sharp.
 I miss the good days of having a normal family and I feel like being sad about everything is my normal state of mind.",04Mar2018,4

175,"I'm in 8th grade. I'm a boy. My History teacher always ignores me and never acknowledges me. For example, he never calls on me in class to answer a question or anything. When every student walks through the door, he acknowledges every student except for me. I raised my hand to answer a question once. I was the only student that had their hand raised. He didn't call on me. Another student raised their hand, and he picked that student. Even outside of his classroom,  when a student from his class walks by him, he'll greet them. When I walk by him, he never greets me. I was walking with a friend once, and he only acknowledged my friend and not me. I always look at him, hoping he will acknowledge me. And he never does. I also notice he avoids eye contact with me when I look at him to get him to acknowledge me.

He wasn't like this towards me at the beginning of the school year. During the first few weeks of the school year, he always acknowledged me when I walked by him and in his classroom. It was until one day, I was walking to his classroom after lunch. I was running a little behind. He was standing by his door, and he saw me. As I was walking to his class he goes, ""Such and such, hurry up!!!"" This startled me a bit. Ever since then, I thought he didn't like me. After that point, I was hoping he would acknowledge me again to see if he still likes me, and he never did. I think he doesn't like me. 

I have never been treated like this by a teacher before. I am usually my teacher's favorite student, and I usually always get special acknowledgment from teachers because of that. This is why this situation is upsetting for me. So I'm asking you guys, how can I get my history teacher to acknowledge me again?",04Mar2018,33

179,"Hello, i am 26 years old and a very ‘unique’ issue in my life. 

Background - I go to sleep early and i do this EVERY single night. I do this because i don’t function well the next day if i stay up late and i experience anxiety, feeling out of it, physically weaker, etc.. i don’t know why this happens and when i was 19-20 i desperately tried to find out by going to doctors with no luck. I am also sensitive to a few other things in my life, including the foods i eat (more than ~40g of carbs per meal makes me feel out of it. At nighttime i binge carbs 2 hrs + before bed because my body wants more) and my daily lifestyle (a hot shower makes me feel out of it and weak). 

These issues have cost me a lot of enjoyable times, and i combat them by sleeping less (ideally from 10:30- 5:15 at this time of year), sleeping on time, eating right, showering at night, etc..

So everything is going ok, and i am quite functional when all goes well, but there’s a new issue i’m experiencing. My memory is different. I cannot remember things as well and i’m thinking it’s because i’m tired very often. I’m afraid that i’ve deprived myself of so much sleep throughout the past few years that my memory is not as good as it used to be. Do you think i can combat this by sleeping more? I’m pretty scared for my mind at the moment and would trade my happiness and daily functionality to make it remember properly again. I hear there is books that may help with memory (like Moonwalking With Einstein). Any advice would be greatly appreciated. By the way i just slept in and feel as though my memory might be better today. It’s like i need to live with a brain and more suffering or live with a fading brain on cloud 9.

181,"Hi All,

First of all thank you, and I'm using a throwaway since the person involved knows my main account. Also disclaimer; I'm in high school so please take that into account. Now onto the story...

I go to a very small school and last year, I noticed this guy who was moping around in the hallways. we had a previous class together and we got along so I thought this was odd. Later that night, I texted him asking if everything was alright and if he needed to talk I was here. He said sure and we called on the phone. It turned out his girlfriend had dumped him, and while we were on the phone we learned that he has a lot in common and we thought the same on a bunch of issues and subjects. The phone call ended up being 3 hours long. But we've been best friends ever since and talk every single day. Over this year, I've fallen for him a couple of times, but it was when his ex started to get involved in his life again that things became messy. We went to homecoming and we held hands and all of that jazz, and our group consisted of 2 other couples that we were all cool with. Suprise! The ex shows up to homecoming! (Mind that she went to a different school) A week later I sorta confess my feelings and he's like, ""sorry, I kinda have feelings for my ex."" This day has been haunting me ever since. (This was back in October)  We have a very open and honest friendship, and he's helped me with my depression and anxiety so much; not to mention that we always have a great time together. But I don't think I can take the feelings of pain anymore. Every time I hear about her (or any other girl he has a romantic interest in) I can't help but feel incredibly jealous. I feel like shit too because I want him to be happy. I called him this morning and told him how I was feeling. He said that I can take some time to think things out if I want to and to just keep him updated. He seemed really sad about it all. I ended up confessing that whenever I talk to him its always bittersweet. Because I've never trusted any of my friends more than him and none of my friends care about me as much as he does. But knowing that we'll never be together as is like a dagger in the back. He goes off to college soon, so I'm thinking I should just stick it out until then. Simultaneously, I'm not sure if I can handle the pain of him talking to his ex and these other girls anymore. If I decide not to be his friend anymore I lose a shit ton of emotional support, and my friend group will be split right down the middle. I will also have to find a new prom group. not sure if this is relevant but he also said that things probably would've worked out between us had the timing been different. I just feel so... tired.

182,"My sister is 7 years older than me. We grew up in a fairly stable family but my mom was a raging alcoholic and it was taboo to ever discuss. 

She married at 21 but had met a guy when she was 15 and pretty much lived at their house. I don’t blame her. It was to escape my mom and my dad’s crazy denial about the entire situation. 

She’s never been there for me on a consistent basis. She swoops in and out of my life but usually when a marriage fails, a boyfriend dumps her or she gets in huge fights with her friends. I’ve always thought she was prettier and cooler than me so I used to shine in the attention. 

And then I grew up. Dealt with a lot of personal shit in my life on my own. I never asked my family to help. Growing up you got yelled at or ignored for weeks at a time if you did something wrong. My parents had a saying. You can have problems but don’t bring them home. 

My sister has made some really shitty decisions. Married young, divorced young. Married a second time to a man everyone warned her of and it came crashing down years later. But she is always the victim. Never accepts the outcomes that are based on her decisions. 

Drama and confrontation are her life. When she has a major fight she’ll write you a letter, usually to your work email, about the horrors she suffered, how she’s the strongest person and has suffered the most. She takes no emotional responsibility and always has a reason it was your fault. 

So I decided to cut all ties with her. 

Yesterday she wrote me a text and said she’s studying yoga and is doing an exercise where she wrote me a letter and she needs to call and read it to me. I don’t know what to do. The reality of all this is that it’s all about her personal growth. I have no idea what she has to say or wants to dig up from the past but I have no interest in hearing it. The last letter she wrote me asked me what she would say at my funeral if she had to speak. GFYS is all I responded. 

What would you do if it was you? Would you reply? Tell her to email the letter or say no thanks. 

Thanks for reading. I have a hard time deciding on these things and I suffered with depression for a long time. I’m in a stable place and part of that was removing toxic family from my life. But I’m torn cause it’s family.

189,"Hi Reddit, 

I'm currently faced with a big decision. And that is whether or not to drop my calculus class this semester.

I'm a computer science student. Already half a semester behind because I switched majors. If I drop this, I will be a whole year behind. 

So that sounds bad, but I am considering it for a few reasons. 

After working through the gen eds, which were basically a breeze, and working up my math, it finally came time to take on some CS classes. 

So I take chemistry, calculus, and computer science. this semester. Counsellor told me it won't be easy, but I thought, ""Eh, I'll handle it"". Fast forward to me almost having a mental breakdown because of all the stress. I honestly feel mentally challenged not understanding it all so quickly. 

I have fallen 2 weeks behind my calculus class, but have kept somewhat decent chemistry and I'm getting almost 100% in CS, focusing my attention there.


But chemistry is tough for me. I feel like if I dedicated my time to chemistry and CS, I would be learning much more and in-depth rather than just half-assing all 3 classes. 

I don't think I was prepared for so much work. I've never been good at math and that's basically what all 3 classes are. 

But I don't want to be a year behind. I feel like my friends and family will think I'm an idiot and judge me for that. Taking 5 or more years to finish school. Like, ""yeah, it's my third year at the community college. I switched majors and dropped classes"".

It's a $500 loss, which isn't that crazy. 

But at this point, I'm earning a D in calculus. 2 weeks behind. And the class is obviously still moving forward. Trying to catch up while still keeping up with all this chemistry...

The thing is, I don't want to drop just because ""it's the easy way out.""

I came at this with really no study habits, no real plan, lots of procrastination, etc. I feel like I should get myself together and organized first. Start smaller. Chemistry and CS are a good start. And not plunge myself into more than I can handle. Like when people want to change their lives so they do everything at once: quit smoking, start exercising, eating better, etc. But it usually fails because it's too much at one time. 

So am I being a little bitch? The challenge is too hard so I run away? Am I being logical here or is the lazy side of me just trying to make my life easier? Is there even any point in continuing calc this semester with 2/4 exams putting me at a D?

I'd end up taking calculus again in the summer, rather than taking calculus 2 in the summer (which I don't even know how I'd handle a calc 2 summer class lol).

Thanks, Reddit. ",04Mar2018,3

209,"Last year, I decided to transfer from Indiana University to Depaul in Chicago. One of my best friends, James, told me that he was also interested in transferring schools to Chicago (he went to Iowa). James didn’t get in to DePaul so he decided to go to Columbia for a semester before transferring to a cheaper school in Chicago, UIC. We are both from the suburbs and grew up together. Neither of us knew many people here, so we decided to live together. We moved into our place August 2017.

Fast Forward to now

-James shows no signs of even wanting to transfer (which is fine). I’m concerned that the reason is that he’s too lazy however.

- James smokes weed everyday. And not just casually. He smokes until he can’t function- drinks the same way too although much less frequently. I think that he believes that this is normal because he’s in college. 

- he also can’t control the munchies after he smokes. He will literally eat until he throws up the next morning.

- James quit the job I got for him yesterday after 1 shift of working, citing mental health problems. Told me he couldn’t work this weekend because he was going home but he did not go home.

- James never leaves the apartment. I feel as though he may have anxiety about leaving this place. He never steps foot outside unless I drag him out or he has class

- when I try to take him out, it’s almost embarrassing because of his viewpoints and his drinking habits. He’ll get belligerent and incomprehensible while everyone else is just having one or two.

- He’s becoming more agreeable and less vested in his own well being. Hygiene has gone down, watches tv all day, hardly tries to make new friends outside of the ones I introduce him to.

When I try to confront him about these things, he gets super defensive and yells at me until I take it back. Or he makes an excuse. I’m usually fairly confrontational but for some reason I can’t find it in me to wake this guy up. This is starting to affect me too. Having a bum roommate sucks, I feel like he’s holding me back. How can I fix this?

tldr; my best and I transferred colleges to Chicago, now he’s turned into a lazy bum who yells at me/makes excuses when I try to help him.  ",04Mar2018,2

214,"Hey guys.  I live in a relatively small town, ~25,000 people.  I don't really like living here anymore, so I'd like to move in the next year and a half to two years.

Currently, I'm an apprenticing automotive tech at a dealership.  If I play my cards right, I can get certified to work on a specific manufacturer of vehicles this year.  When I reach certain certifications, I get pay raises.  My plan would be to start making at least $15/hour, and then try and make the move.

Personally, I'd love to be able to live around a city.  Ever since I visited New York and Boston, I've always wanted to live near a city.  Sooo much stuff to do.  I know it's insanely expensive though, but I still wanna do it.

I live in the South, so I feel like Nashville or Charlotte would be a good move.  However, I'm open for some suggestions to anywhere.  Just wondering what you guys think would be a good fit for me.

Thanks.

However, she recognizes this but I feel she still thinks she should be with these other hot asshole dudes. I feel like she was nicer to these other dudes, and she still unloads her frustrations with those situations not working out on me.

220,"Hi r/Advice, I am looking for your responses on this specific situation, the right thing to do or the best way to handle it and what you, personally would have done (independently it's the most accurately action or not) 
I suffer from OCD so don't be surprised if I exaggerate. 
The housekeeper was drying the bathroom floor with a mop that looked like this: https://previews.123rf.com/images/mkphotography/mkphotography1412/mkphotography141200001/34487514-old-dirty-mop.jpg Not joking, we haven't bough a new one in ages. When she was going to put it back to its place, it accidentally rubbed the footboard of my bed (insanely I guess) I could see the whole thing since I was a few inches from it. 
Next part of the story: My cousin is babysitting our neighbor's kid, who is very playful and extroverted as most 7 year-od children are. Well, he was walking around the house and touched, for a solid 40 seconds, the area, he was like swinging into it. I did not tell him to wash his hands right in, and when I finally did, he didn't last a second in the bathroom, I asked if he had used soap and he proceeded to place his hands very near me in order to prove he had done a proper job. I freaked out. He kept touching objects, the piano keys and other things I constantly use.
I haven't been able to touch the bedsheets that probably were also infected, neither the objects the boy touched.

224,"Okay, let me first contextualize a little. I am a 22 y/o guy who recently got in my university's program of buddy partners for international exchange students. I was assigned a girl from an European country and I live in a Latin American country. Since she came here we started hanging out a lot and we became really close, going as far as telling each other stuff we had never told other people. She has a boyfriend, with whom she's been with for like 6 years and now they even live and have a dog together back at home (which for me sounds like a huge commitment because dogs are the coolest thing in life). Her boyfriend is also going to do an exchange semester, but due to being from different majors and all that, they couldn't go to the same country. I guess I have really developed feelings for her but I also don't think anything would happen because, even though since she came here they've had some fights, she really loves him and I think it goes both ways and to be honest, I wouldn't want to be the guy who destroyed a 6 year relationship and made a dog sad. Another thing I think is important for the story is that she can be REALLY naive and won't notice when people are hitting on her, because she thinks they are just being nice, until they literally ask her if they can kiss her or stuff like that, at which point she will tell me that I was right. She also really likes it here because dancing is much more common than in her country and we would go out and hang out just the two of us until really late all the time. We are so close people would annoy us all the time about us being a couple, because to be fair, we could be as close as one sometimes.

Okay, a new player who I'll just call John comes into the scene. I think he might be a nice guy, he is also not an international and after a couple of times he starts talking a lot to my buddy partner and her roomie, but to be honest I could see he was really into her and I chose not to say anything, but truth is I was kind of jealous because she started to hang out more and more with him and less and less with me. Fast forward to last week, we were at a club with all the internationals, dancing and having fun and all that lame stuff. After a while people start telling me I shouldn't let John win her over because they had been dancing for a while really close, because everyone but her noticed he was hitting on her and they would tell me. Until that point I was having a lot of fun and to be honest I was already drunk. When people started telling me all that and I saw them, I got jealous and kind of mad so I wanted to go home. When I was about to go home, she came out and asked me what was wrong but I did not want to talk, so I told her that it was nothing and got into the cab (which charged me more than he promised because I was drunk, angry and sad and taxi drivers here are huge asshole nobody likes and we don't have taxi-meters, can you believe how behind we are?), because I really didn't want to make a scene there. I know I shouldn't have acted like that because we're nothing but good friends but being drunk and people telling me all that stuff didn't really help. She writes to me instantly asking what the matter was and I got a little too honest and I told her that I didn't want her to lie to me telling me that she cared for her boyfriend and then just playing along with that John guy. She then talked to him and asked him if he was hitting on her, to which he basically answered that if she did answered positively to his flirting, he would try more stuff, and she told me she left things clear with him about not wanting anything else than friendship, to which John made her promise that if he didn't try anything their friendship would not change. She then went to my place at like 4 in the morning so we could talk and leave things clear. At the same time all this was happening her boyfriend was really mad at her because he thought it wasn't nice that she hanged out so much with me or John alone. After we talked, I thought things would be okay again.

They weren't. That week she basically evaded me as much as she could, and when she told me to hang out things felt really weird from both sides. I felt she would really hang out with him even more and less with me, to which she said that it was bound to happen because we used to do everything together, which I didn't really like but kinda understood. I wasn't really acting in the best way and I was being kind of obsessive and insisting a lot, that much I accept. Because of this she would tell me maybe we should take some time because it might help me. To me that felt like she was the one who needed the time, so I asked her many times if she did, to which she finally admitted she wanted it because the drama we were going through did not feel like a friendship but for something stronger. So, yesterday, after she finally accepted she wanted some time, I conceded, we decided to do that. But as life really loves putting me in awkward situations, we ran into each other the same night after the day we decided to get some distance and she was with John. At the beginning I felt really weird and awkward and she came to say hi and wanted to talk like nothing had happened because ""why make things more awkward"", but I didn't really feel like it so we basically evaded each other even more. And the same thing happened. Everyone noticed how much he was hitting on her and how he would try to get her alone every oportunity he got.

Now it's the day after and I still have a lot of mixed feelings about it. I really care about her and I know she cares about me too, but when she writes to me after some time, I don't know what I should do or how I should react. Should I just act like everything is fine or should I tell her all that I think would happen with she and her boyfriend or that John guy?

Right now I also feel I would like a little distance myself, because I think John will try to get into her pants soon, and I don't know how she will react, but after that I know shit's gonna go down with her and her boyfriend or things will get awkward between her and John. I really don't want to be the 'I told you so' guy so I feel like I should just step aside. By now I feel a lot like just a guy to fall back to when something happens and I really don't like that feeling. I also think our friendship won't be able to go back to what it was before and I don't think it will heal, at least for some time.

So, what should I do? Should I do as I said or should I act differently?

TL;DR: I am a guy who met a female exchange student that I really care about now. She has a very long and committed relationship. She met John. John wants to get into her pants. She's too naive to realize and thinks I just hate the guy. I don't want to lose our friendship, but I also don't want to be involved in the drama when shit goes down.

Especially cause I can't handle face to face flirting in a very public and busy area(think: clubbing/bars/etc.). I may be able to pull through in somewhat less busy areas, or maybe online?

I'm fucking done with it though. Why should I have to feel like this for any longer? I gotta get the hell over myself and work on a better me. In order to do that I do need you guys though, you with experience. What is a way you would suggest to me? Ask my friends if they know anyone/could get me into contact with someone they think would be a good fit? Online dating? How? I wouldn't know how to approach anyone.. tinder is definitely not my thing, that is way too popular and I wouldn't be able to handle that kind of thing. Go meet people some other way?

So last Friday asked me to talk with with him. ohshit.jpg

However, this person has a lot of insecurities, and for this reason she would put a lot of it on me and the relationship.

All of our friends kept telling us to break up, and one day about a year ago, I did. However, I cared about her. I couldn't stand to see her upset, so I went back to her 2 days later. Now it's more than a year later, and she said the other day she was gonna break up with me out of the blue. At this point, I was upset. So I told her, ""fine, if you want it to end then f*ck it."" About an hour later she said, ""I didn't mean it, I'm sorry."" However, I wasn't having it so I told her that I wanted time to think about if this relationship is healthy. She started crying and when I walked away to go get some food, she said I didn't care about her enough to comfort her while she cried. I repeated that I wanted time and I wasn't gonna be there to comfort her right now. After that she started begging me not to go and that she would be better because she said she knew she was treating me badly and I didn't deserve it. I still care for her a lot. However, at this point, a lot of my friends are trying to tell me shes manipulating me into coming back. Also, on top of all that, there is someone else I have feelings for and had feelings for before me and my current ex / not-ex started going out. This person I have feelings for is still in my life and I'm pretty sure she likes me as a person. She wanted to go out with me before I got together with my current s/o, but I didn't know that until after the fact. I get butterflies in my stomach when I think about her or see her, and I always wanna smile when I'm around her. However, I don't wanna break my current s/o's heart, and she's been telling me things like, ""no one can fill this hole you've left in my heart but you.""

We go out to eat on our anniversary’s but she hasn’t like put makeup on and dressed up since the first months dinner. She’s on my Snapchat all the time, and Same with instagram, whereas I’m never on her Snapchat, but she does have a few Instagram posts of us. It may not seem like a big deal, but it just makes me feel like she doesn’t like showing me off or something. Like she’s ashamed of me. She wants to join a sorority next semester, and I’m really against the idea because of that fact that she’ll be wearing certain outfits, probably dancing with other guys, and the possibility of cheating skyrockets. She’s so totally against cheating, and I don’t think she’d cheat on me. But the idea of her getting bored with me, and finding something exciting in the moment kills me. I don’t necessarily want to fuck other girls outright. I definitely find other girls attractive, and I get the urge to make out with girls more than like having sex, but if I’m happy in the relationship then all of that goes away. The first 2/3 months of us dating was awesome, it still is. But sometimes, I just don’t feel appreciated. I got her a flower on Friday, and I went to her room and gave it to her and everyone there was all “ awww” and she said thank you baby and hugged me. She said she appreciated it a lot, but I don’t know how much I felt like she did. I’m going to counseling and maybe somethings wrong on my end, but I just don’t know.

251,"My sister-in-law's boyfriend (18) was recently ""evicted"" from his mother's apartment for failing to pay her rent money ($200/mth) where he isn't even given a bedroom...he sleeps on an air mattress in the dining room. The mother can't afford to feed their family (3 other younger children are in the apartment with them).


He's in the process of getting his GED online, he missed a bunch of school during his junior year due to his father's incarceration. Needless to say, this kid has gone through a lot and had a pretty shite hand dealt to him.


He's currently sleeping on the couch at his manager's house and is extremely scared and distraught. My wife and I love the kid, he's quite possibly one of the nicest individuals you'd meet and totally runs counter to the statistic that he should be. We have 2 extra bedrooms in our home and we wish to offer him one while he finishes the GED program and saves up some money for a car and place of his own.


My question to the community is what are some of the ground rules that you would incorporate to allow him to live under the same roof. My wife is a stay at home mother with our toddler...many have mentioned that this would be a red flag for them to not let someone live in their house but we trust the kid wholeheartedly and aren't scared of any of that stuff.


Some of the things I thought of was a requirement to maintain a job that allows him to focus on his schooling. He must also have a defined budget that allows him to save up enough money and also be livable for when he gets his own place.",04Mar2018,178
252,"Back story we are identical twins/best freinds, about a year ago he was scammed out of his life savings I chipped in also, since then he has spiraled out of control. He was an alcoholic for around 10 years, he got off of the booze and finally I had my brother back, he was good for a while, and roughly 2 years ago he tried heroin and struggled with that for a while, he was using it daily (smoking it) I confronted him about it and it put stress on our relationship, he stopped coming around he would hide it although everyone knew he was on something, when he was scammed  the heroin use got really bad he lost 100lbs he was depressed,  miserable, and suicidal. He said he quit heroin but now he is abusing cocaine, I suspect it’s daily but again he hides it. On a side note about 3 weeks ago he said he was attacked by random people,  first time at the mall some guy hits him for no reason and when brother looked him in the eyes he said it was like the guy was possessed, second time a random lady in staples followed and again attacked him, third time he said he was against a wall waiting to use the bathroom and an unseen entity chocked him lifted him up off the ground and choked him. He believes he was possessed i think it’s a bunch of bullshit and he’s hallucinating from the cocaine, can you hallucinate like that from heavy cocaine use?  Don’t know what to do I’m afraid if I keep pushing his buttons and accusing him  he will sever our relationship!

I have degenerative disc disease, scoliosis, narrowing discs, bulging discs, and the list goes on. It’s getting extremely worse. Physical therapy seems to be making it that way. 

Anyways, I’ve noticed a change in my boyfriend. He even made a comment today that our days off together aren’t the same. I get it. I’m in too much pain to go out and do what he wants to do. And I’m on muscle relaxers, so I can’t have a beer with him. My job is also wearing on me and making me too exhausted. I’m trying to go out with him as much as I can.

255,"Hi guys! I recently moved into a new apartment in NYC with 2 friends from college. We saw about 25 places before finally settling on a 1st floor apartment we finally leased. The apartment is great - recently renovated, big kitchen, tons of closet storage, quick commute. But, there's a creaking sound above my bedroom that is driving me insane. Whenever the tenants upstairs walk around above my room, there is a very loud, sharp creaking/squeaking in two spots. I'm a heavy sleeper, and it wakes me up. The sound is incredibly obnoxious during the day, too. My roommates aren't directly affected by it, but they can hear it too. I met the tenants upstairs and they're very nice and understanding - however, there's no sound of creaking in their unit. Yet, my roommates could hear it in our apartment when I walked around upstairs. They're definitely not jumping or stomping or anything out of the ordinary because we don't hear anything else in other spots around the apartment.

My landlord has been dismissive of the problem since I brought it up. At first, he claimed it was ""all in my head"". He tried to fix it by having his contractors nail down the floorboards upstairs. No fix, as I expected. I know of that breakaway screw fix you can get from Home Depot or Lowes, but he said the problem is likely in the wall and is not listening to other solutions. That's an expensive fix, and I doubt he'll make it his primary mission to fix it. There's nothing in the lease claiming this was an existing issue or that he would need to fix it even if it was.

Even worse, the landlord is frustrated about my complaint and consistently asks me if I want to break my lease. I don't want to break the lease because that puts my two friends and I out. Although my roommates are supportive of the noise fix, they said they would be furious if I went that route of breaking the lease. But, I don't think I can tolerate this creaking for 12 months. It really bothers me that I may have to constantly use my wireless headphones just to enjoy my own personal space with an expensive monthly rent.

I feel like I have no control and this problem is making me miserable. Not sure what to do. Has anyone gone through this before?",04Mar2018,2
256,"Hello,

For background - I'm late 20s in the UK.

I won't go into details if that's ok, but 8 months ago I started developping symptoms. Months later, I have exhausted myself seeing multiple doctors, specialists, getting tests done - and still no diagnosis. Because of the invisible nature of a lot of the symptoms it has been tough convincing doctors what I'm experiencing is real and for them to take me seriously, and the whole experience has also taken a huge toll on my mental health.

I'm now coming to terms with the fact that whatever is wrong is causing me big difficulties day to day, to the extent that even going to work and socialising are now a struggle. I feel like I'm causing further harm to myself by stubbornly maintaining a front that everything is OK to my employer and wider circle of people in my life (only closest friends and family know) and I need to start putting myself first and take some time to rest after a rough and intense few months. 

This hasn't been an easy realisation to come to - I'm the type of person who pushes themself and works hard at whatever they undertake. I got my degree, got a competitive job in my field, worked for promotions, saved hard and bought a property which I renovated myself, went back to education whilst working full-time to progress towards my chartership... and until now have had only one single sick day in my 5 years of working. Not really relevant, but it's important for me to feel like you know I'm not the type of person to give up easily. I'm just so exhausted mentally and feel awful physically every single day now. 

I'm looking for advice in 3 areas;

1. How do I open up to people in my life about this? I'm worried that because I've put on such a convincing front for so long, and because of the invisible nature of the symptoms and no diagnosis to refer to, peole will assume I'm grossly exaggerating and have no time for me.

2. How do I deal with this with my employer? I'm currently missing a lot of work for medical appointments, so my boss knows something is up and has been flexible to this point due to my past excellent record. I know this can't go on indefinitely though, and also being in work is becoming such a struggle that I often find myself in tears on the journey in, dreading the day ahead. I feel I need to take some time off to come to terms with what's going on and gather my emotional strength back. I also think taking some time to focus on my health can't do any harm, although it won't fix me. My contract entitles me to 4 months full pay 4 months half. How can I get time off though without an actual diagnosis?

3. What are some good coping strategies for me right now? I feel my life is falling apart and everything I've worked so hard for is slipping away from me. I used to be so excited for the future and had it all planned out - now I'm just filled with fear and uncertainty.

Thank you.

257,"So I don't have the greatest home life when living with my family at the moment (we are 4 people on completely opposing schedules in a small 2 bedroom apartment) and it's really grating on me and making me feel quite depressed all the time. 

I have an amazing friend who I've been close with for about 3 years. She's by far the kindest person in my life. On two separate occasions she has suggested I move into her house (she lives alone and there's a spare room &amp; bathroom in her basement). Even her family members have been saying things like ""Why doesn't Hayley move in with you?"" At the moment, I visit her 2-3 times a week and have sleepovers there all the time. Her dog loves me and I help with caring for her. My friend often tells me she loves me like family, and I feel the same way. Whenever I go to her house, she always comments about how good I am about cleaning up after myself, helping with meals, and picking up groceries etc. without being asked. I miss her whenever I leave her house to be honest, it almost feels like homesickness. 

When she offered for me to move in, first I said I thought I was nervous that my family would be upset/hurt/mad that I was leaving them. But since then I have mentioned the idea and they said they wouldn't have a problem with it at all. 

So now here's the real issue...I really love my friend and it would break my heart if I moved in and she didn't like me anymore, or things weren't working out but she kept that to herself and was unhappy/resentful of me. :( I know for sure that I would never get sick of her, but I have really low self-esteem and I have a really hard time believing that anyone could stand to be around me for extended periods of time.

So I would like some advice - what do you think i should do?

Option 1: Go for it, move in with my friend -- we would be compatible roommates! 

Option 2: Absolutely don't move in with my friend -- there's too much to lose if something went wrong.

Option 3: Try an audition (stay there for 1 week) and see how things go, but BE HONEST.",04Mar2018,2
258,My parents ever since elementary school have helped me study for every test. They already deal with a lot and I hate having them help me as an extra.

260,"Okay, so in like 11th grade I was exploring careers and found out about occupational therapy. It seemed like a good job to me, get to work with kids, make good money, only a master's degree required (versus Phd). My passion was in psychology but my mom told me that the world didn't need any more psychologists and the idea of getting a PhD was so terrifying to me. I'm from a small town and all my friends just wanted to be moms and I knew if I got my PhD I wouldn't be able to start a family until I was almost 30 or later. 

So for college I only applied to accelerated OT programs or schools that at least had a masters program in OT. I ended up going to BU because their grad program is number one for OT. However, I'm a junior now and am very confident that I don't want to be an OT. The work involved just doesn't appeal to me and all the OTs I've met seem exhausted and sort of miserable. I shadowed an OT and didn't like it. 

However, I work in a psychology research lab and have really become immersed with the psych faculty at BU. I really enjoy research and have been told I have great potential. I want to continue to work in research and to eventually get my PhD in developmental psychology or clinical psychology. When I think about that prospect, I feel genuinely excited about my future. With OT I don't. Plus PhDs are funded, so I won't be paying off loans for the next 20 years of my life.

I'm home for spring break and my parents are asking me what OT schools I'm thinking of applying to and I just keep walking away or saying I don't want to talk about it. Regardless of what my parents say, I'm definitely not going to OT school, but I just feel so so nervous to tell them. How should I go about this? What sort of responses should I expect back? Please, any advice to help soothe my anxiety...It's not like all my life my parents wanted me to be an OT, I mean I technically set this expectation, but it's become an expectation nonetheless.

I got accepted in the resettlement program for refugees along with my grandma and we both moved in with my dad about year ago.

He hits me for things like talking back to him and ""being disrespectful"" and i'm pretty sure goes through my things and monitors my online activity.

269,"Over the past couple of years i have experienced some nasty things in life. As a result of this i had become timid, i went through day to day life on a auto-pilot if you will. This in turn has killed my energy, I've lost enthusiasm and excitement for just about anything in life.
I wasn't even aware of this problem until quite recently and it took a while to be able to formulate it.

I now see that my life sucks because i am not in control, my happiness is a result of other people and their actions. This has led to lots of ups and downs with the downs always being more prolonged and severe. 

To tackle this issue i have to regain control over my own life and start doing things that i like. This is also where my current obstacle lies, due to my timidness and introversion created by years of depression, i no longer can answer the question ""What do i like?"" or better yet ""What would make me happy?"". The only answer to those questions right now, is a person, for whom i have the most intens feelings I've experienced in my life thus far.

I remember as a kid, there used to be so many things i liked. Many things i loved doing and wanted to do in the future. These things now elicit no response within myself. Nor do any other things i come across in life. 

This has led me to believe that it not the objects that i am disinterested in but my general affection towards them seems to be missing. 

How does one regain such childlike spirit and enthusiasm. How do i begin to like things again. How do i become less timid and more open. I want to feel alive instead of feeling like I'm doing everything in a weighted suit, causing me to react less to just about anything ",04Mar2018,1

It sounds kind of minor, but after everything, this is just the straw that breaks the camel's back I guess. I guess she cares more about the house than me. She didn't threaten to kick out my younger sister, though, which kind of hurts. I can barely get into the stuff that she's done over the years (threatening to murder my sibling, threatening to kill herself through text to me, not buying food, etc etc) I could explain more but she uses reddit and I'm fucking praying that she doesn't find this. If she does, I guess I'll have to go. I really don't know what to do. I'm considering just saying ""fuck it"" and walking out the door, but I don't know if that's my best option. (I also currently don't have a phone with me, and I would get caught if I called someone using the landline.) I have half a year until I can move out for college, but it's been getting worse and I don't know if I can wait that long. I also don't want to fuck up my graduation prospects, and I need to keep my grades up so I can keep a scholarship which basically guarantees I'm able to move into a dorm. I'm also afraid that if I leave they'll call to police or something and I really really don't know what to do. I'm sorry for the wall of text but I'm really panicking.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me, I can’t stick to anything. I start off as the model employee and then I end up not showing up to work by accident (oversleeping or mixing up schedule) and usually that’s automatic termination. I thought being a stripper would help me since I work for myself and there are no rules but 3 weeks in I can’t do it anymore. There is way too much free drugs and alcohol and I can’t control myself anymore. The alcohol doesn’t work anymore, I’m feening for the hard drugs the moment I get there and I’ll ignore every guy that doesn’t have some. Now I get tipped more in drugs than cash. My boss is onto me now and makes me feel like shit about it every time he sees me. Im embarrassed to show my face there again, especially since I only made $50 the other night. I can’t believe I couldn’t even handle being a stripper. I don’t know what to do now, it’s an endless cycle. I would go to college but I failed a few years ago. I don’t know how I’m going to support myself like this. Is this normal for my age? I can’t imagine being over 25 still feeling this useless and lost. I genuinely don’t know how people are able to hold down jobs for years, it seems like an impossible task to me. Anyone care to share how they do it?

For years now, my family has tagged me as gay. This typically isn't a problem for most families however my family is STRICT Catholic and I'm not. I've always felt like an outsider because of it but I'm feeling more and more isolated.
My mother is the main culprit. She constantly suggests that I'll go to hell or end up with HIV. It's ridiculous! She even mentioned to a girl I was seeing that I was gay and I was using her to cover it up.

Sale goes a bit pear shaped- buyer views it but it's unseasonably snowy and doesn't start. So, he jump starts it with his car, and seems satisfied that everything is in order. Drives it maybe 50m down the road with me, all seems fine. Hands over money, I hand him docs, all good. 

Cut to a week later. I get an angry text from him demanding the money back, or he'll ""find me"" or take me to a small claims court. Apparently the spark plugs are too rusted to change and the car keeps misfiring. I feel awful but I'm not sure what to do.

&gt;I still get nervous when talking to someone I like.

&gt;Never know what to say nor do when a girl/woman is just staring at me.

The thing is I don't want to give up, I want to improve.

So I think it would be better not to bother with women (basically forget about them) untill I'm actually attractive.

I think this is a good idea, because I have proof I'm not handsome (getting rejected frequently).

I'm basically 99.99% or let's just say 100% sure I need to change.

Also, I think going to the gym again for the sake of looking more manly and building muscle will surely help when it comes to being attractive.

295,"I go to a school that is ""project-based"" which basically means we don't have teachers we just have an adviser. This adviser who I'll call Sarah watches over our half of the building, and she is the one in charge of everything in that half of the building. Everyday she comes back into the room where my friends and I sit. She is really obsessed with my friend who we'll call Bob. Here is how the situation usually plays out. Sarah walks back and begins rubbing Bob's shoulders. Bob is a quiet person and doesn't say anything, he just smiles and continues work on his computer. Sarah will continue to rub his shoulders and tell him he needs to get more work done. A little weird, but nothing to set off an alarm. Well recently our school took a 9 day camping trip that Sarah and Bob went on. Sarah and Bob shared a tent with Sarah's husband, and in the middle of the night Sarah got ""cold"" and began trying to get her feet under my friend Bob. Even after this I still didn't suspect anything, just figured they have a close bond because that's easy to come upon at my school. The part that has started to make me worry is that Bob just got a girlfriend two weeks ago. His girlfriend is on the same side of the building as us, and Sarah leaves post-it notes on his girlfriend's desk telling her not to focus on him, and that school is more important. Sarah also continually tells all of us (4 people in my room) that our girlfriends are crazy and over-dramatic. She also tells people on her side of the building that I smoke weed, even though I have never said anything to her about it or ever came to school high. When I told Sarah I didn't want to go on the camping trip, she made a remark about how it was because me and my girlfriend can't go nine days without weed, and nothing to do with the fact that the trip costs $500 per person. If Sarah is ever wrong about something and you tell her, you will be met with her furious voice while she yells at you for not knowing anything. I want to do something about it but I feel like either this isn't enough information to do anything, or that if it is, the school will do nothing about it. If I talk to her personally about it, I know she will make my school life hell, as she has already done that to multiple students. I was hoping you all could give me some advice on what to do.

298,"I’m 25 turning 26 this December. I graduated college with a BA in Psychology and I haven’t done anything remotely close to Psychology because I’m not interested in it. I like learning about it but I was never interested in making it a career since the beginning, there’s not much good jobs around for an undergraduate. Basically I did it because it was easy.


I’ve tried taking career aptitude tests and it always shows up with me being interested in the arts &amp; music.  Second would be working with animals. I really am in love with the arts and music, I play the cello and guitar myself and I’ve drawn a couple times. Making music or arts as a career is extremely hard and stability has never been great; I’ve tried looking for stability working with animals but pretty much my job as a customer service representative - I get paid more than a veterinary technician. 


I’m not sure what to do... I’ve been trying to meddle with software development, while it’s fun at first I just lose interest. I remember I was at it for a couple months but after finishing jQuery and JSON - I stopped. I know I’m not as invested as I would like to be - but the pay is stable and that’s what I’ve been looking for. Also, I found it hard after... I wish it wasn’t so hard for me but it really all boils down to how passionate I am to learn more about software development... but I’m not. 


What I dream of is just being able to become stable and not have to worry about checking my bank account for $60 of groceries a week kind of deal. I don’t want an extravagant life either - I just want to be in a nice apartment, decorated to however I please, with my dogs... and maybe own an apartment building one day to rent out to tenants or own an art store where there’s art classes (mediocre painting) where everyone can bring their own alcoholic beverages - and maybe include live jazz music as well - or any music to local musicians for a chance to advertise themselves. 


I’m sad as well. I have been with my boyfriend for almost 3 years, we have been long distance for a years now but we visit each other once a month. He lives a 1000 miles away from me and it has gotten harder for us and I’ve become very lonely. While we planned to move in together in the summer - plans changed because he’s not ready. Basically he told me he doesn’t want to be responsible for me since I’m not financially stable. He’s a software developer and he’s making about 65-70k a year, while I’m just still in customer service earning $12.50/hr.... I thought maybe with our finances combined we could make it but it hurts. We have no set date and I don’t know what to do. I’m trying my best and it’s why I’m trying with software development because I’m willing to move to his location... but I realized he wouldn’t do it in his side because well software isn’t popular in my area and he likes where he’s at. I do too and my goal is to be in the same city with him... but he doesn’t want to live together. He thinks we’ll get married and it’s not that at all.. 


I have so much pressure in me to make a certain income for him and I feel like I’m dying. I feel like maybe no one would want to deal with this and maybe I’ll just never have that small apartment with my dogs and the apartment building or art store that I’ve wanted..

301,"I’ve greatly condensed what happened during this relationship, so long story short: I already struggled likely with depression after high school for nearly two years, so I planned on just saving up my income from an internship, securing a new job several months later, and moving to start fresh, ultimately putting college on hold since I was struggling academically.

The beginning of my internship, I met this guy *Josh*, we started dating, and I sacrificed my plans to be with him. But the relationship rapidly started to decline for a number of reasons—notably him ruining my finances, constant arguing and shouting matches over small things (which he would deem “normal in relationships”), realizing that he’s a completely different person with others than with me (e.g. more talkative with others), noticing how much he lies about things, seeing how invasive he is (I’m sure he’s been prowling through Reddit to see what I post, and he somehow found out information about one of my friends and found out who my ex is).

During the arguments, he would also twist my words and say things like “I feel like...” and “In my head, it’s like...” but they would be completely false and he just wouldn’t listen when I constantly reassured him the opposite. One example is I am friends with this guy, *William*, for 5 years now because he is my brother’s best friend. A heat-of-the-moment sexual encounter happened between me and William **prior to me meeting Josh**. This upset Josh ridiculously, and he’s been insecure about my friendship even when William and I completely stopped talking for several months after I met Josh. The only kind of communication we had was via social media since William, my brother, and I were in a group chat (only sending vids and pics). After constantly telling Josh that this is only because I wanted to keep the peace between my brother and William, Josh would still always say, “I feel like you’re disrespectful of our relationship/I feel like you’re trying to make me feel wrong for feeling the way I do about your friendship with him/I feel like he doesn’t respect our relationship,” which was obviously completely false. William and I literally haven’t texted or talked on the phone *once* during our relationship.

So most of our arguments revolved around William, and I grew so tired of arguing about someone I haven’t spoken to in so long. That was the cherry on top of all of the other small things we argued about:

- How I “don’t let [him] be a man” when I try to help him fix/do something (especially when he did something like incorrectly assembly a table or have scolding hot water to wash a puppy), yet he always talk about “teamwork”

- How I supposedly “ask [him] questions the wrong way” even when I ask nicely (“Josh, did you spill the chocolate milk in the fridge?”)

- How saying something as small as “you like *prunes*?” angers him and he ends up saying, “You know what, forget it. I don’t even want to eat it anymore,” but when someone says something similar he’s all smiles and laughing. 

The relationship has just been extremely toxic. The amount of times I screamed and cried because he just wouldn’t stop something is overwhelming. There was a time he followed me everywhere in my mom’s house and down and around my block screaming at me and calling me a whore because of what happened between me and William.

He’s since apologize for the severities that happened for the first 2/3 of the relationship and has been trying to fix what he’s done, but I still suffer from the pain he’s caused and stress about the debt he’s put me in, and we still argue over the dumbest things. I’ve given him so many chances, and the time when I was pregnant (since miscarried) and wanted him to change, he lied about seeking counseling/therapy, which is severely important for making the relationship work. 

He’s also been unstable when it comes to working. For about 90% of our relationship he’s been unemployed, and I really need stability in my life, especially after everything that has happened, and I want him to find stability, too.

My final straw was a few months ago when he went through my phone (and found NOTHING, since I’m not a cheater). I decided it’s time to take a break from the relationship. 

My plan now is to move far out (I already have two stable jobs), see a therapist regularly, and regain financial stability by paying off debt and saving. The main reason why I’m doing this is for therapy since I believe my depression has gotten worse since college, and he and this relationship has only been the fuel.

The night he went through my phone, I was upset because just a few days earlier, we argued about William, but Josh has this thing where he completely blows things out of proportion. So this incident of invaded privacy blew up into a huge argument. When I told him to leave (which is usually extremely hard to get him to do. The only reason why he left is because he knew my mom was going to be home soon), I contemplated and planned my suicide, so much to the point where I ended up calling the suicide hotline because I felt like there was no way out of what he’s put me in. Ever since, I knew just how important it is for me to see a therapist, because I’ve been spiraling down quickly.

Now he’s upset because I want to put off seeing him frequently, put off saying “I love you” and “I miss you,” and avoid dabbling in any old feelings because I want to be a new, better person, and I want him to be, too. I told him couples therapy won’t work for two broken people, and that we need to fix ourselves because we’re unfit for relationships, and that when the time is right, we can start over.

He says he understands and that’s what he’ll work on, but I don’t see him taking any steps to better himself. Meanwhile, I’m planning outdoor things to do once I move to better my health (my life has been too sedentary since meeting him and my health sucks). I’m mapping out places to go in my new city I’m moving to. I’m changing my diet and looking into homecooked meals, which will be a struggle because I usually have no appetite and barely eat. Most importantly, I’m looking into therapists and counselors around my new city.

I’m doing this to be a better person and help myself before I make the wrong decision, and I want to avoid conversations that focus on old feelings and the past since it won’t help me heal, but now he’s trying to make me seem wrong for not even saying that I love and miss him. Obviously we haven’t 100% broken things off since he’s still helping me pay down debt that he’s caused. Also, I planned on limiting conversations to strictly about things we’re learning and doing when it comes to our therapy so that we can still connect in that kind of way.

Everything is just so complicated, I’m not even sure this makes sense. From the outside looking in, what do you think? Am I missing or doing something wrong here?

UPDATE: This is what I mean by him twisting my words. He called about how I haven’t said I love or miss him, and I literally said, “I don’t want to dwell on old feelings if I’m trying to become a new, better person,” and something else about how if we’re looking toward a new relationship, we should dwell on the past. He quickly got off the phone and texted me, “Don't dwell on me ok 🤗”

Cue today and I was inviting friends to my birthday party. My friend explicitly told me that she wouldn't come if Gary comes to the party. I knew she's been uncomfortable with Gary before, but I didn't realize she felt strongly about it. 


I asked Bill for advice, and he told me that Gary was touching some women in the group repeatedly although they asked him to stop several times. It ended with one woman saying he was sexually harassing her, and the other woman (my friend) immediately left the group. Gary went into a rant about feminism and the #metoo movement, which he had already made fun of throughout the night to me. Bill tried to talk to him but Gary wouldn't hear any of it.


After hearing this, I planned on telling Gary he's not welcomed at my party, but Bill was worried it would break their friendship if Gary thought Bill told me about what happened. Bill said if I told Gary I heard about what happened at his party, it would ruin everyone's relationship with Gary, not just mine or Bill's, or the two women's.


I'm torn because Gary is one of our oldest friends, but he can also be pretty offensive. In fact, I got into an argument with him on my birthday last year because he insulted a woman (a complete stranger) who pushed him away when he tried to grind her. He was very drunk at the time so I brushed it off the next day, but after what Bill told me I'm sure it's his personality.

311,"I’ll start with a small disclaimer, although I know it’s not an excuse in the slightest, a few older members in my family (mostly my grandparents/uncles and aunts on my mothers side) don’t believe in races mixing. I have a feeling it is more of a generation thing, and while I don’t agree with it at all, there is no changing their minds. However, on my dads side they are more relaxed with the subject of change and are just generally more excepting. But anyways, I’ve been struggling with this problem for a very long time. I am 20 years old and ever since my 6th grade year in middle school when I had my first “boyfriend” who happened to be African American, it’s been relayed in my head that there is a 98% chance that If I date anyone who has a different skin tone than me, that my grandparents would disown me. And for along time I just avoided everything that had to do with conversation on that subject because I didn’t want my friends to think that because they weren’t white, that my parents and other miscellaneous family members wouldn’t like them. That’s not the case. It’s simply dating/marrying. Well, up until a few days ago I ignored it. I didn’t want to think my family was bad, because I love them.....but, just a few days ago I returned from a short term study abroad in El Salvador, and while there I met a guy....he’s the sweetest, most amazing, and caring guy I think I’ve ever met. I truly do think that if given the right situation and opportunity that it could work (that is, if he feels the same way, which I kinda think he does but I don’t really know). We’ve been talking ever since I got back and I’ve told all of my friends about him, some already knew him because he happened to be at my university for a semester although I was always too shy to talk to him (yea, I know it’s a weird situation). Anyways, they all tell me to go for it and they like him! But I’m torn between my family and my happiness, because even if I don’t end up with him, maybe one day I might find someone else....I already know what my options are and to be honest I don’t really know what I’m asking for here....maybe someone in a similar situation? An opinion? I don’t know....just.....help?",04Mar2018,1
312,"To start off, I do not mean to be emotionally unavailable in ALL aspects of my interpersonal relationships, only in college! This is in regards to hook up culture. 

I'm a first-year student in college and I'm utterly confused when it comes to hook up culture. Everything else in college is pretty normal to me now, like being exposed to frat parties, drugs, alcohol, you name it. Although I'm young, I've always had this idea in my head about finding true love and having sex for emotional, human connection. I guess this stems from how I was raised by loving parents with a pretty good marriage, but who knows. Anyways, I was taught to not settle for just ANYTHING and maintain a monogamous relationship (or just not sleep around). This perception has shifted since I've come to college. 

For instance, I've already experience being ghosted about 5 times already! It felt awful each time, with myself asking the universe or God(?) up above why it keeps happening to me. I questioned my self-worth, and even tried to change my appearance to please others. This was my doing of course, but with a little help of the notorious app, Tinder. I knew what it was and the purpose of it, recalling my older sister's experience with it when she was my age. Nonetheless, the friends I made actively use it, so I felt the need to use it too? Don't get me wrong, I love kissing and having sex as much as any other young adult out there, but sometimes I think, is there more to it than this silly app? I appreciate the experience with sex and the whole ""woo I'm a liberated woman and I can do what I want!"" ideology, but why do I keep going back to this app if it brings me more insecurity and false intimacy? 

My very(?) experienced peers and close friends have told me numerous times to DETACH myself from emotions and sex, especially as I cried in the stairwell of our dorm about this fact. One friend, in particular, emphasized the fact that I should be taking advantage of these boys and break their heart FIRST, before they break mine. That makes sense, but I'm not cold like that! I could never ghost someone on purpose, because I know how it feels. Perhaps I should be tougher and disregard my own feelings and theirs. Still, why do we have to do that? I guess since our lives aren't predetermined or at all stable at this age, it's okay to be ""experimenting"" as they say? Then again, why has apps like Tinder made us more afraid to be hurt (thus building our defenses) and made it easier to drop someone than ever before? 

I have not been on a single ""date"" since coming to college. It's always been back and forth texting on Tinder, meeting up at his place or mine, watching Netflix, having sex, and leaving. Again, I'd like to emphasize that I do enjoy sex and I appreciate the ability to be flexible in discovering my likes and dislikes! Especially since starting birth control. But I do want the ""fairy tale"" romance you see in movies, or at least some knock-off version of it. For example, as much as I want it, I will NOT be having sex with a guy who just finished an IM game, even if he came to my doorstep. Too stinky. I digress. At the end of the day, I wonder, will I meet the love of my life this way? Isn't college the place you find your person? 

For now, all I can do is slow down on my ""rendezvous"" (as I call hookups) adventures and perhaps focus on my own needs. I mean, I'm a relatively good student with a full scholarship to the university, but I have so much growing to do! 

So reddit, what should a girl like me do? Is it beneficial to me in the long-run to be emotionally unavailable and have fun with sex throughout college (and perhaps sometime after that)? ",04Mar2018,0

319,"I seek sex by paying for escorts because I cant get sex anywhere else. I tried meeting women online (no replies after sending 100s of messages) and in bars but they all end in rejection. My past dating experiences ended mostly with money loss with no sex in return after being used/ghosted, so for that matter I though I might as well just pay for it then if women are going to make me work, earn and pay for it. At least with an escort, it's only cash involved and it's guranteed raunchy sex with an attractive looking woman.

All I'm saying is... I enjoy seeing these escorts but I feel depressed and unhappy that I cant afford to see them regularly that's all.",04Mar2018,0
320,"Okay, so I'm sort of going through an identity crisis, I guess? See, there's a reason that I don't go through the comment section on YouTube. People's opinions tend to control my life. Sort of. I usually just listen to whatever music that I want to and dress however I want to dress. Then I look in the comment section and see people say that listening to a certain type of music makes you this way. Or, dressing a certain type of way makes you another. I totally get how the way you dress can impact what people first think of you, but does it really MAKE you that way? I don't know if that makes sense, so I'm sorry if it doesn't. But, I'm just trying to have a good time and listen to stuff that I like, and then I see people call it ""emo."" Then, I start to feel self conscious for listening to it. It usually only gets to me for a few hours, but I just want it to stop. Also, the way I dress. I usually wear a band t-shirt and jeans, but I really only do it because it's comfortable. I really wanna change up my style once in awhile, but I do struggle with confidence, so doing something like that makes me extremely nervous. Next time I go shopping I'm definitely gonna try to get more... I don't know, neutral clothes? Some more regular t-shirts and stuff. Also maybe some lighter colored jeans? But I don't wanna COMPLETELY change myself or anything. Honestly, my head just drives me insane sometimes. And I listen to every type of music, it's just certain genres that's I like that make me self conscious. I won't stop listening to them anytime soon. I might eventually because everyone grows and changes, but I just don't wanna be shameful for listening to something that I enjoy.",04Mar2018,1

327,"I'm an ex-pat from the US living abroad for a year for work, and I have an issue with my neighbor. She keeps smoking cigarettes below my bathroom, below my living room, etc. and it drifts up into my apartment.

There is no vent in my bathroom, so my landlord requires that I keep the window cracked in there to prevent mold growth. Even if I try to close it, that thing is rusty and will not budge. And I can't predict when she will smoke, so I wouldn't even know when to close it.

For that reason, I politely asked her if she can smoke in her living room, which is below my living room (and her bathroom is below my bathroom). I figured screw it, whenever I smell the smoke in the living room, I'll evade the premises and barricade myself in my bedroom. The windows don't seal in the living room so it gets in there no matter what (apartments in this country are poorly built). She said sure, I'll make sure I only smoke in the living room.

...And of course she did not honor her word. My bathroom smells like a damn chimney all the time, because she just HAS to smoke while she's taking a bath in her bathroom. I asked again, she accused me of ""harassing her"" and told me to ""get a fucking window."" I told her my landlord won't let me do that because of the mold issue, she responded ""well that's not my problem."" 

This country seems to favor smokers over non-smokers, they do not respect non-smokers' rights one bit. The laws are loose. I don't know what to do here, I have congenital lobar emphysema (lung disease from birth) which makes me more vulnerable to cig smoke and more likely to develop lung cancer. It's my bathroom! I need to shower, brush my teeth, etc. in there and I can't do that without breathing in the cigarette smoke. My landlord does not give a shit, and if I were to leave I'd have to pay a penalty of two month's rent.

All because this woman insists on smoking in her bathroom. I feel like shit, I'm always coughing and developing sinus infections. Any suggestions?",04Mar2018,2
328,"Hey all, been needing some thoughts on something and figured this was a good place to look. Here goes:

So, I work at a restaurant. I happen to work with one of my best friends that ive known for almost a decade (we're both male) We both got jobs there together, and see each other a lot both in and out of work, game nights, D&amp;D, etc. 

Around 6 months ago, this girl starts working at the restaraunt as well. I ended up being the one to train her, and even though I was in a relationship at the time I thought if I wasn't I'd have asked her out. I also ended up being the one to introduce her to my friend. I didn't see a huge connection, but cut to a month or so later they start dating. 

Its been around 3 months since they started dating now, and a few things have happened. I'm out of the relationship now, they're still together. Me and the girl my friend is dating have gotten closer, but since she's unavailable I've kept it strictly friendly since I don't want to hurt my best friend. She's got a lot of issues ranging from anxiety to depression and self-harm, all of which she hides from all but a very select few. 

Here's where it gets hairy. My best friend is a terrible relationship person. She doesn't feel cared about and feels just used for the physical aspect of the relationship. She's tried to talk to him about her issues I mentioned previously or her feeling not cared about and he just doesn't do anything. I don't mind being a shoulder at all but she's a really sweet and cool person. She tries to make dates and couply things for his recent birthday and other stuff, and he'll just complain and say no.  Or when they are together they don't really talk much, or if they do its just jokes or memes. 

I should probably mention that at 4 going on 5 months of dating, they're using the L word.

I'm talking to her about her mental/emotional problems and her fear that she's being used and she's not important to him. I'm talking to him and he's totally fine and joking around and planning D&amp;D stuff. Obviously I want them to work as a couple and happy as both a couple and as people. 

I don't mind being friends with both/being in the middle, but besides the feeling of going behind his back and just the emotional and mental exhaustion, I need whatever help I can get. Thanks guys. 

TL;DR : I'm caught in the middle of a couple involving two people I'm close with, where one half feels used and ignored while the other doesn't care.
