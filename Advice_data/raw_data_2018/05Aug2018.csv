my wife (they/them) and i (she/her) have been married for 2+ years, and we're both mentally ill (they've got ADHD, i've got autism, and we've both got anxiety and depression disorders). recently we've been in rough times. our car broke down, we've been having trouble making any money at all, and we can barely afford to get groceries or pay the bills. my wife has turned to selling nudes in order to make some more money, and we've been busy promoting their content on tumblr and other social medias where that sort of thing is acceptable. we recently found out that one of their bosses (they work at a daycare) is being cheated on, and that boss' husband wanted to buy my wife's nudes. that has had a serious toll on them. they already seem so emotionally fragile.   
recently my wife has had trouble eating. the only thing that helps them eat is weed, but we can't really afford to buy it. i've been fixing them meals and trying to help them work through problems, but they often refuse to talk.

i understand that i'm probably pushing them a bit too hard. i know i can come across as pretentious, and i have trouble being gentle with my words. it's come to the point where i can't say anything. i'm beginning to think it would be best if i just didn't say anything at all. but i don't want the problem to just get worse. i don't want my wife to think i don't love them, or to think that i've given up on their mental health. it just feels like there's nothing i can do. i know what works for me, but that sort of advice only comes across as degrading or snobbish. i don't know what would work for them, but they don't want to talk about it either.

i don't know if i'm right in saying that this is a problem with me. in the past i've let this sort of thing send me into emotional downspirals as well. frankly i'm kind of afraid that if i /don't/ follow them down this hole then i'll be a bad wife?? but i've only recently felt comfortable with myself for the first time in a long, long time. i have a job that treats me like a human, i have consistent time off, and i'm taking care of my body. i feel good, and i guess i'm afraid of my wife hating me because i feel good about myself.

i know a lot of this is just paranoia. i know that things are fine, or at least, could be a lot, lot worse. they have been in the past. but when everybody is feeling so cataclysmic it makes it really hard for me to be happy. 

should i change something about myself? or should i just wait this out?

2,"My brother just graduated in may, and has applied to every company under the sun. he finally gave up and got a job as a car salesman at chevy hoping to eventually get moved to manufacturing. This sounds crazy to me. It's hard to believe that there is no demand for mechanical engineers anywhere. He is willing to relocate. He says everyone wants experience, but I still find it hard to believe he hasn't got a single job offer. ",05Aug2018,1
3,"My mother had gained so much weight over the years. She’s gone up at least 100 pounds in the past 10 years. She eats junk food quite often, usually when she’s by herself and not around the rest of the family. She does not exercise at all. She gets out of breath just by climbing the stairs. 

My father is kind of the same way. He’s gained weight as well but not as much. He gets acid reflux and coughs up phlegm a lot but refuses to do anything about it. He is very stressed most of the time and doesn’t seem happy. 

I want them both to start going to the gym and running but they don’t like being told that they have issues, even though they know it. 

How do I get through to them? ",05Aug2018,2
4,"I need advice as to my current state of my dad's mental health. I'll give you the rundown of various things he's done over the years. My dad has anger issues. He gets mad very easily and even yells when it clearly is not that person's fault. He practically never says sorry seriously or genuinely. He constantly talks about the power going out and saying that we would struggle if things went to ""shit"" . I'm pretty sure he looks down on the rest of the family. My sister who takes college classes in HS and I as well who will take college classes in HS this coming year and yet he still looks down on us. I've gone to States comps and have been told I've could've done better when his academic history is terrible.  He doesn't care that my sister has cried because he never attends her dance recitals as she is a semi-professional dancer. I believe he looks down on us because we are kids. If he ever argues with our mom and knows he is wrong he just says ""ah woman"" angrily. Me along with my sister have suspicions that he may be cheating online on our mom. I also think he has been internet brain washed. He watches Alex Jones seriously and says stuff like ""if the shit hits the fan , we are screwed."" He has bought ""survival kits"" before and preps like its Doomsday soon although not as extreme as you would think just canning food and putting water in milk jugs. My dad is also racist. He doesn't want immigrants coming over from Mexico and has talked about Muslims all being terrorists. This is all ironic considering his wife is an immigrant from the Philippines. He walks out from his computer room acting erratic and making weird noises as he marches back and forth in the kitchen. He can't speak properly as he says ""ah ah"" when angry in between sentences. He also is Catholic and says gays will go to hell (nothing wrong with being catholic I just find it hard to believe he can call himself Catholic with all this racist and homophobic things he has going on). He has to have his way. He's always right never wrong. I'm not sure what else to say but yeah. He clearly has a lot of problems. I want advice as how to handle living under the same house as him. It drives me crazy and being in the same room as him makes me cringe and just feel hatred. Its sad because this guy is my dad and I wish I could honestly love him but I just can't. I want to know if maybe he has some mental disorder or genuinely is just messed up in the head.",05Aug2018,1
6," So I’ve started talking to this guy online. I was 16 he 18. He was like looking for a gf I guess or whatever cuz he’s a little weird and what not. Anyway we talked about literally everything. Like I know things about him that I shouldn’t. And we live pretty close. But I’ve never met him. Anyway fast forward we were arguing mostly because I was kinda hurt that he never talks to me (I guess I didn’t like him then but I do now) and he even said I start most of the convos....and I was like wow ok. And he told me he slept with some girl and that made me even more jealous. I’ve never had a bf before so I’m really dumb when it comes to guy stuff. 
So at this point I kind of want to block him from everything. I just thought he at the very least liked me as a friend now but I guess im not even that. I even told him I had to go to the hospital and whatnot (this convo was like a five hour long convo in the am) and he didn’t really text asking if I’m ok or something. 
He started saying more stupid shit and I told him I’m gonna be awake but he should sleep cuz he was tired and he hasn’t texted back since. I guess I should give it some time for him to say anything back?? Or just get rid of him. ? Idk

7,From kindergarten till the point in life im at now i attended a all boy school. Suddenly my parents decided to switch schools for me. This wont be a big a issue as it is if it weren't v for the fact that i live in a Muslim world where interactions between the two sexes are frowned on.,05Aug2018,1
8," So I've known this girl for 6 years now. We realized about a year ago that we had feelings for each other but there were two things stopping us from pursing something deeper. 1. She was in an abusive relationship 2. She was moving soon. So we flirted and met up but I didn't want her to be a cheater so we never went further then flirtacious talk, touching and suggestive pictures. Did she technically cheat? Yes, but she was in an abusive and loveless relationship so I don't fault her for that.   
 

 Well luckily, she did break up with her husband and this is ironically when I started making mistakes cause I was like “Fuck yeah now's my chance, she's single and I can take things further now.” However I didn't take into account that she suffers from anxiety and depression and just got out of a traumatizing  relationship that for all the shittiness she obviously loved him and the person she loved betrayed her in every way. So I ended up being needy and tried to push her into a relationship that she clearly wasn't ready for.   
  

Thankfully, I realized I wasn't being my best self and she deserved better then how I was after all she'd been through. So I cut contact with her stating just that. That I wanted to be better and work on myself so I could be the man I wanted to be and the man she deserved.   
  

I did that and learned a lot about how to let those you love come to you at their own pace and to love in a way that your significant other feels free and loved.   
  

I reestablished contact about a month and a half ago and she was receptive and things have gone back to almost how they used to be with some very key differences. And this is where I'm having trouble I'm getting a lot of mixed signals that I don't know how to decipher.   
  

There are four things that seem to contradict each other that I need help understanding:   
   

She texts me every day and she's 	the one who establishes the contact. This tells me that she at least 	likes me enough to be in her life but at what level? Does she see me 	as something more or am I just a really good friend that she wants 	to have in her life cause I've always been good at making her laugh 	and I still do. But she's fucking GORGEOUS so she could have ten 	guys that make her laugh for all I know. Admittedly not many people 	know she's divorced but I know for a fact that she's been on dates 	with other guys. Which doesn't bother me honestly. She's single for 	the first time in years. She can explore all she wants. All I can do 	is be my best self and be the best option and show her why I'm the 	one for her...

BUT She refuses to see me. At this 	point we're long distance so there's that barrier but I've tried to 	set up dates where we can vidcall and she always has an excuse why 	she doesn't want to. I actually asked her why she was avoiding 	vidcalling me and she says the thought of getting on camera 	terrifies with her which, considering her severe anxiety, I can 	totally believe. But when she was with her husband and couldn't 	always see me we would vidcall and she didn't seem to have a problem 	with it in the past but now all of a sudden she isn't comfortable 	with it and it just comes off that she's just trying to keep me at a 	distance, this is further shown 

BY Her not flirting with me anymore. 	She used to say suggestive things and be suggestive and responsive 	to when I would flirt with her but now she doesn't anymore. Again, 	this could be because she's still raw about her ex husband. She told 	me yesterday that she got into a fight with him and I feel like the 	thought of working on being with someone else scares her cause the 	same thing could happen all over again just with a different guy. 	HOWEVER

 She sent me a nude the other day 	RANDOMLY. We were messing around and she said something like “I 	think my boobs are growing” and I said “Oh yeah? Let's seem em, 	I'm kind of an expert” totally joking but then she actually sent 	me a picture and said “Bet you didn't expect that” so that tells 	me that there is definitely some attraction there. At least enough 	that she would send that and with how self concious and insecure she 	is I know that sending that was a big deal for her.    
    
  So with all that I'm having trouble figuring out my place in her life. Am I just a friend? Am I more and she's just nervous about going too far out of fear of getting into another abusive relationship? Is she not interested in me at all? Is her anxiety preventing her from “letting loose” and being totally open with me like before?   
 

 And my main question; should I talk to her about any of this and how I feel? We're not in a relationship so truthfully she doesn't owe me anything but I want to get some clarity and no matter how I bring it up it's gonna come off as weak and needy and that's exactly the opposite of how I want to express myself to her. So like the title says: Should I talk to her or just let things continue as they are? I would be fine with how things are but the refusal of vidcalls is the BIG THING that bothers me cause if I'm just being confined to the phone I don't see anyway that things can progress if we just have a “phoneship” and I can't “physically” interact with her through a vidcall or from her visiting me or me visiting her and I think that she MUST know that so idk how to proceed cause if I just keep talking to her whenever she hits me up without ever seeing her I think that's just gonna get me put in the friendzone.   
  

What do I do?   
  

TLDR; Honestly there's just too much important detail to put a TLDR. Sorry, I know it's a long post. ",05Aug2018,1
9,"Over the past two years, I've been hearing stories about how the mom of my two nieces and nephew is insane and makes false police reports against my brother for attention. My brother supposedly came to our mom's house crying about how she's trying to lie to get him in prison. The reports were about sexual abuse against the older of his two daughters. What he supposedly did was tickle her vulva in front of his 6 year old son saying she liked that, and he then he touched her inappropriately to show him how everything worked down there. His daughter was 3 and unable to stop this but hated it of course. She told her mom who called the cops.

I admit I found this story hard to believe because if that really happened, why didn't she take the kids and run? I don't have any love for my brother at all and would have believed and helped her even without any proof.

But she stayed with him. CPS investigated and did nothing. Neither did police. This incident got swept under the rug. 

I start babysitting for them after I hear they have mean and neglectful babysitters. The kids seem nice and normal, but then my 8 year old nephew asks me before bed if I'm going to shower with him like his dad does. I assured him he was perfectly capable at 8, and he was. He did it himself and brushed his teeth. I inspected his arms and legs where he was dirty before and asked if he scrubbed his nether regions. He did. So why is he still showering with dad at 8? He says he doesn't like it but they do it to save water. Wtf.

I don't know if it's in my place to ask questions like, ""Does my brother touch you?"" to an 8 year old. Instead I told him I loved him and he could always tell me about anything that made him hurt or uncomfortable and I would always believe him and be there to help. He said that my brother tells him naughty things about his mom's boobs and vagina in the shower and he also gets mad and calls her fat and psycho. He wanted that kept a secret.

I'm so disgusted with my brother. I didn't think I could hate him more than I did before I heard that. I don't know if should tell his wife, make a CPS report, or just keep it under wraps for now like my nephew asked me to.",05Aug2018,1
10,"Burner account for this post because I don't want to get roasted by the friends who know my usual username.  

I am a recent college graduate (22) who has just broken into the office world within the past year. With working an office job comes the need to wear slacks and other dress pants. I bought a couple pairs of slacks before I started my old job (this past January). 

Throughout the first month, I thought I noticed my boss looking in the vicinity of my crotch.

I, as a male, thought nothing of this the first couple of times because people look in random directions when thinking, talking, or listening during a conversation. I know that I often look behind or to the side of people when having a one-on-one conversation so that we can each take a break from direct eye contact. BUT as weeks started go to by, it felt more and more like my crotch was my boss's number one place to look during our conversations.

I am by no means well endowed. Under a silk sheet you would compare my small bulge to a baby carrot or even an oblong grape. I can assure you that my slacks do not somehow produce a mirage that makes the bulge look bigger than it normally would appear when lying down. 

I knew I was only going to be at that job for a couple of month (it was a temporary assignment), so I brushed off the perceived crotch glances as a weird conversational tick, NOT because she was a horny middle aged women and DEFINITELY NOT because I had anything special to look at. However, I started a longer term job about a month ago and I have noticed my new women coworkers also looking at my junk.

Can anyone offer a possible explanation for this? Or maybe some pants recommendations that would get rid of a budge completely?

I would just prefer my coworkers to not look at my crotch when I talk to them. I always get paranoid that I have a rouge pee drop that made its way through my boxers or a full-on boner that snuck up on me--and when I do get the random work boner, I make sure to wait it out before standing up or talking to a coworker. 

Maybe this is a normal work thing? Or are middle-aged women really horny enough to look at my junk in the office? I can say that I'm one of the only people &lt;30 in the office, and the only recent college graduate. I would may I'm mediocre looking--nothing special to look at (I would have noticed the extra attention by now if I was somehow Brad Pitt). 

I know this is a weird post (that might be taken as a joke by some), but I'm really interested in hearing what other people say. Nowadays my friends only laugh when I bring this up.",05Aug2018,4

16,"We have mutual feelings with this girl and I know her a lot, She has a scary past and she cries every day because of her problems. She is the type of girl that is alive on the outside but dead inside. She uses self-harm to escape from her problems but when we started knowing each other, she stopped doing it. I was the reason why she smiled and continued to live with her life again and I was so happy about that since I was able to help her in a small way. We have mutual feelings but I just can't make her my girlfriend since I am planning to study in an ""All Boys school"" and their number one rule in there is ""No Relationships allowed"". On our first day of knowing each other, I told her about this but she didn't take it seriously because she thinks that it was just a joke and she said that ""let's just create memories"". Now I told her something that convinced her that I wasn't really joking on that day. She cried and said that ""We will stop this, Whats
 the point in staying in this kind of relationship when I already know the ending of us"".

17,"I’ll try to keep this short but it’s a very long story.

I became friends with this girl a few months back, we’re both 15. I became friends with her so I could help my best friend of 13 years get more comfortable with her because he had a crush on her at the time. It worked, but we also ended up becoming really close friends.

I ended up developing a crush on her a bit later because I felt we really matched up well. I talked to my friend about it (who had been rejected by this point). We’re very understanding to each other so we just discussed it openly and freely without and harsh feelings or anything from either side.

Anyway this girl and I kept getting closer. It got somewhat more interesting at a good friend’s birthday party. The party was in a ballroom at a hotel, with a dance floor and music and all. She and I saw each other there and she was very excited to see me. She dropped some subtle hints here and there, called me up to dance a couple times, and at one point tied her hair up and told me she was “ready to get down”. Whether she meant it as sexually as that came out was something I was unsure of at this point.

Anyway I couldn’t act on anything in the end because shortly after I had to leave cause I had to catch an flight, and I also didn’t want to make a move when my best friend was around. So I missed my opportunity.

Anyway the day after that she and I were talking and she starts getting really flirty and telling me how horny she was at the party. We flirt back and forth and she tells me about how she made out with some dude at the end. I jokingly asked her why she would make out with him when someone like me was about. She told me I missed the opportunity. We kept talking through the night and etc. And she made it pretty clear that she found me attractive and that she would have made out with me. She also told a friend that she found me attractive and that she liked how I dressed “formally” and how I liked to take care of myself. (I’m a very well groomed guy, and she’s very fond of that)

Anyway I asked her out a couple weeks later, but she rejected me because she wasn’t really looking for a relationship. Her main reasons why we’re:

1. Were too young.
2. The next time we would see each other is 2 months away.
3. What if it ends badly and ruins what we have.

I have my counter points to that and she said that we would decide at the end of summer, and to leave it to the flow of things.

Now we still talk and we’re still close. But I do want to revive all the flirting. And when I get back from vacation, to create an opportunity to make the make out finally happen (after such a long time!). Any ideas/advice.",05Aug2018,1
18,"While I was working a yard, I stepped on something really sharp. I noticed that I wasn't really feeling anything sort of cut, or sharp stinging pain that you'd get from something sharp.

22,"Hey guys. This summer I've wanted to get a summer job, and I finally landed one at KFC. I started about 4 days ago and Monday will be my third day on the job. School starts in about 3 weeks for me and I am a little concerned about balancing work and school.

In school I'll be taking three AP (advanced placement, for non-Americans) math courses and would still have to prepare for other things such as SAT subject tests and the SAT itself (third time taking it). I can see myself struggling in the future with the 3 AP classes, so I have to make sure I seriously study. On top of classes, I volunteer for my school's Red Cross club, but I hold no leadership responsibilities. I also belong to a few other clubs, but those are all usually in-school hours. 

Work, on the other hand, presented a new challenge for me. I've always been told I was smart, but being a fast food employee requires something else. **I'm still new so I am still very slow at tasks, but I want to know do things like this fix itself over time?** After work I get pretty tired, even though I only work 4 hour shifts. During my second day, I was actually thinking about quitting AS I was on the job because of how the place was ran and everything I don't like about it. But anyways, I most likely would only be working weekends and Fridays during the school year, but I really would only like to work 2/3 of those days.

I still would really like the money just for my own reasons like clothes and food. My parents are covering my basic living expenses (which I am extremely grateful for), so I do not desperately need the money. I'm just really concerned about work getting in the way of school. I've asked a few friends and family, and they said basically to just try school and work together for a couple of weeks or so and assess it from there. That's most likely what I would do, but I want to know your guys' experience with this. How did you guys manage a job and school at the same time? ",05Aug2018,1

I have been really confused lately, I’m not sure I should do my Masters : Master of Professional Engineering (Mechanical)

They are mainly safety devices that could potential save human life I.e.(like a seat belt or life raft).

This position would be working alongside me in my department, so it does make sense for my imput to have some weight, but the issue lies more in how this situation has been structured. 

Each candidate is going to be coming in for a full day separately to work with me. He wants this so I can see how their productivity is and how good the quality of their work is. None of them know they are being pitted against each other or that I am making this final decision.

Before my meeting with my boss I was already working with the first candidate, and am now struggling with knowing I'll have to make this choice.

I have a friend who is (Male) 19 years old and has been very mentally ill for years. He has been abused all his life mentally and physically. He lives with his dad who is an alcoholic and is just as mentally ill. Every night without fail his dad shouts and attacks my 19 year old friend. They have been evicted from their house because his dad has created so many problems with the neighbours. The police are there at least once a week for various reasons which are usually the neighbours alerting the police because they are fighting.

My friend is an absolute handful to deal with and he starts a lot of the problems but never gets physical with the dad, the dad is always the one who punches first. The dad recently chain emailed multiple people saying he was going to kill himself a few days ago so someone called the police and all they did was let him talk to a psychiatric nurse over the phone.

Someone is going to end up killing themselves if I don't intervene and call the NHS and get the dad sectioned as soon as possible, I and my other friends can help the 19 year old get back on his feet.

Is this the right thing to do? I have never had to deal with something like this and I am only 19 too so im worried I might completely ruin their lives.Hello,

The police are there at least once a week for various reasons which are usually the neighbours alerting the police because they are fighting.

My friend is an absolute handful to deal with and he starts a lot of the problems but never gets physical with the dad, the dad is always the one who punches first. The dad recently chain emailed multiple people saying he was going to kill himself a few days ago so someone called the police and all they did was let him talk to a psychiatric nurse over the phone.

Someone is going to end up killing themselves if I don't intervene and call the NHS and get the dad sectioned as soon as possible, I and my other friends can help the 19 year old get back on his feet.

Is this the right thing to do? I have never had to deal with something like this and I am only 19 too so im worried I might completely ruin their lives.

26,"So, a few days ago I met a really cute girl in a Best Buy parking lot. Now, normally we wouldn’t have even acknowledged each others presence, but when we both left the parking lot, I rear ended her vehicle. We were in the parking lot exit,  I was following a bit too close and she hit her brakes because someone turned in the lot in front of her, I wasn’t paying enough attention and we had a low speed fender bender. It was my fault completely, but she was extremely cool about it. She was really easy to talk to and was very sweet about the situation. Anyway, we exchanged information and we swapped numbers in case either of us needed any more information (neither of us had been in an accident before) I messed up her back bumper up enough to have to file an insurance claim. I felt really bad and after I got home and sorted ot everything on my end, I sent her a formal apology via text. She responded within an hour and said it was alright, she wasn’t mad and sent a smiley face. I want to talk to her more because she was so kind and genuine I’d like to know more about her and maybe end up becoming friends. I feel awkward about the situation, how would I talk to her without it being awkward? I doubt she even has my number still, or has thought about the incident since it occured.  Is this something that I should just ignore and move on from, or should I try and make contact with her? I feel like it would be difficult to go from “hey, I hit your car.” To “hey, lets be friends.”  Any advice would be appreciated. 






More details: I’m a male, I didn’t mention that above. She is one year younger than me. We’re both single. We have a few mutual friends on facebook but those are people I haven’t talked to in 6-7 years. I haven’t sent her a friend request or anything because I don’t want her to know I looked her up on fb. I’m not necessarily looking to date her, she just seemed like a really nice and genuine person that I would get along with really well. ",05Aug2018,1

Our relationship became serious really quick so I definitely don’t mind putting a lot of money and effort into it. However, I don’t want to scare him. I LOVE giving gifts. I put so much effort in my friends and family gifts so I’m super excited to put something together for him. I feel like we aren’t at the stage in a relationship where I can buy him one expensive gift. So I’m going to buy little things. For gifts, I was thinking; a practical gift, a gag/inside joke gift, a hobby gift and probably something romantic from the heart. Food.

29,"This year, a new girl got enrolled into my school class. Let's call her ""Hannah"".
So, on the first weeks of class we discovered that we both were in some of the same niche fandoms, and started talking to each other about shows sometimes, but it wasn't anything very consistent. In time, I noticed Hannah missed a lot of classes every week, and as this year is the time for us to take college exams, I messaged her one day asking if she wanted my class notes, and as she gladfully accepted it, I made a habit of always messaging her everytime she missed a class, and although she almost always accepted it, she'd never ask me first (This is important, she was REALLY grateful everytime even though I was like ""Chill Fam, I got ya back"").
In time, Hannah started dating one of my best friends, and sometimes Hannah would ask me for some relationship advice in our sporadic conversations, and although I tried to help her they broke up after 3 months, but in these 3 months me and Hannah became closer and closer, but we talked so sporadically that it didn't even seem like it. 
So, this is where it becomes kind of weird. From the start of the school year I talked a lot about my sister to Hannah, because they liked some of the same things, and in general my sister is a really awesome college student that outshines me in a lot of aspects. But back to the point, I hyped my sister up about Hannah, and I hyped Hannah about my sister.
So until now, I have had to initiate almost every conversation with Hannah, but some days ago she met my sister, and Hannah immeaditly started to fan girl (and so did my sister), and in the same day Hannah add her on Instagram, called her in chat, and overall acted very friendly towards my sister.
My point is: Throughout these months I always had to initiate conversations, tried to help everytime she accepted my help, and I didn't want anything more than her friendship.
But with my sister, that she didn't even know personally untild DAYS AGO, oh no, she stans the girl.
My question is: Should I even try to talk to her anymore? 
Even though she never starts conversations with me she always accepts my help and talks to me after I initiate conversations.
Like, really, what is this about? Does she want my friendship or is she just being polite?
I really don't like to spend time with most people, as I think I don't do well to them, but I'm really confused about her.

Anyway I freaked out but then told him I would touch his dick if he kissed me. He was like ""I guess that's fair"" and he gave me two pecks on the lips. A couple days later we hung out again and I offered to give him a handjob but I told him I would do it if he kissed me. He was like ""see I don't want to kiss you again because I don't want you to get too attached. When I get back together with an ex or get a girlfriend, the sadder you're going to be when I'm gone."" I told him the kiss doesn't have to mean anything and finally he was like ""just one?"" and we kissed each other. We didn't hang out for like a month and a couple days ago he asked if I wanted to hang and I went over to his house. We sat in his car for like an hour and talked. Of course he was like ""will you please do me a solid?"" and pointed his eyes down toward his dick. So I gave him a handjob and put my mouth on his penis a couple times.

31,"My inner self thinks I shouldn't take this so seriously but anyway, here it goes.

Not long ago, a guy broke not only my heart but also my self-confidence into pieces. I kept all the pain to myself and struggled alone during some months. I don't usually tell my personal problems to anyone but I was really waiting for my best friend to come to town since she lives in another city and I didn't want to tell her my situation via telephone or text.

She came. I told her everything as detailed as possible. She saw me sad, wrathful, disappointed and whatnot. She gave me some advice on guys like that and agreed with me that he was a total asshole. Everytime I had a bad time trying to get him out of my head, I called her and she knew how to calm me. She knows that just the idea of him can bring me down. By the way, I gotta make clear that she met him before me but she didn't pay any attention to him so I kinda was his second option. We were even planning on getting revenge (the dating him and never going to the place sort of thing) but I decided not to and let her know.

Now, one week ago, she, just out of nowhere, started following him on Instagram, liked a lot of his most recent photos and sent me a message telling me ""hey, I don't know why the universe is sending me this signals but I found this (screenshot of an archived conversation with him in her whatsapp)"". This was pretty shocking to me. I just answered with a ""I don't want you to talk to me about him anymore"" she agreed and then asked if she could go to my house to get something she had left. I answered the other day telling her that I had left it somewhere else for her to get it. She noticed my bad attitude and asked about it but I haven't replied yet.

As I said before, I think I'm probably taking this too seriously but tbh, even if it sounds stupid, shallow or not important, I'd never do that to her with a guy who had done her something similar. I thought about it as an implicit statement between friends. 

Yes, I know I haven't talked to her yet, but I dont really know what to say. I'm sure she'll find it stupid but it isn't stupid to me. I feel as if my words didn't mean anything to her.

I’m 14 years old
I’m a male
I’m 5,11
And I weigh at the moment 197.2 lbs



I used to get bullied for my weight in elementary school but ever since I’ve gotten to this new school I think my insane height has gotten people to fuck off, but I’m still insecure about my body.

I often wear swim shirts anywhere that I go to water and I usually wear hoodies or t-shirts instead of muscles shirts and the such. 

I’m not insanely obese I guess, I’m still likable enough that I’ve dated a couple girls and they seem to shove of anything I say about my weight, but they do like to pick on how tall I am.

36,"Hey guys I need your advice. 

Three years ago (although it feels like yesterday) my mother passed away. It was unexpected and in a tragic way. Put it this way, it made the news and people from all over the world were reaching out to me. 

I was and am completely devestated and for the past three years I've been trying really hard to take care of myself and my mental heath - but it hasn't been easy. My anxiety got the best of me and although I'm working on it, I'm not at 100%. To this day, whenever I leave my house I'm afraid that someone with a gun is going to enter the place I'm going and start shooting. That's how my mom passed away and with all the crazy things I hear in the news (even though I try to stay away), I'm afraid the same thing is going to happen to me. I'm absolutely traumatized. 

Here's the thing. Ever since my mom passed away my family in Italy has been begging to see me. I've told them EVERY YEAR that I'm just not ready for two reasons: 

1) I used to go with my mom to Italy and I'm just not ready to go without her and; 

2) Mentally, I don't think I'm ready to travel that far just yet. Even just a short trip to the cottage had me crying in my bedroom the night before as I felt terrified. 

I understand that living in fear is not ideal and that I need to work on myself and I AM. Hence why I did get into the car and did go to the cottage. I didn't enjoy the trip but I did it because I am taking strides towards success. It's just that Italy is a too big of a stride for me at this moment. 

The weird part is this. My family is telling me ""I need to go"" and that ""I am being ridiculous"". So much so that my best friend decided to latch on to a trip to Italy with me that is suppose to happen on August 28th. I did NOT agree to this trip my family mentioned it to her and now she is so excited to go with me. 

I don't have the heart to tell my friend that I am just not ready and I have been avoiding her and I feel like a horrible person. Mostly because when I try to explain my mental heath situation to anybody they look at me like I'm crazy. 

Reddit, how should I approach this to my friend? What is the best way to tell her that I I'm not ready to go? 

  
My friend is the type to over react and I'm not ready to deal with her. Even though we're almost thirty years old she gets her parents involved and I don't feel like explaining my mental health situation to them as well.

He has this opinion to my understanding, because he told his girlfriend some sketchy stuff then she told her friends who told the police because he was being stupid. Drug deals, lying about access to guns and what not. 

I for one (being a younger brother to him) 16,19 don't really like him because of how unopen to other perspectives he is yet I have to be around him. Not sure if I should try to convince him, or forget about it. My parents want him to be included in the family and I've rejected him for a while.

41,"Hey, I need some advice.

So a friend group that I do trivia with recently met and started including this guy we will call “Tim”. Tim is a nice guy, very quiet from time to time but that isn’t always a bad thing when it comes to a rambunctious, competitive trivia team. Over the past month Tim has grown attached to us and he and I personally will go to the bar after work/shoot darts/ etc. 

From the time we have recently started to spend together, Tim has opened up about recently getting out of a hard time in vague terms. He says he is lost and went through a “rough year” last year and is thankful for my friendship and support. From this I decided to get him involved with my friend’s Pathfinder campaign as I thought it could be a good creative outlet, without alcohol or other things that can bring him to a bad place.

Last night, by accident I found out that last year Tim was arrested for messaging and soliciting a cop who was undercover posing as a minor. I am the only person of our group to my knowledge who has this information as again he is a really private, quiet guy.

In the past 24 hours of thinking about this, I have decided that I am not going to bring it up to him or the others in this friend group and want to respect his privacy. However, the knowledge has thrown me for a loop and I just want to be able to be a decent person and show support to someone who has made me a part of their life and seems to very much need it. But with the knowledge in my head, I hope you can understand how that could be a bit uncomfortable.

I had two roommates, and all roommates needed to sign an addendum, however one of the roommates was out of the country during this time and couldn't sign it (still out till the 7th of August). The sublease asked me if he could stay at my place and if he could just venmo the rent money until the other roommate came back.

After about three weeks it became a couple times a week, then once a week, once every couple weeks, and now it’s been well over three weeks. I used to go down on him fairly often because I like it and as a way to show my affection and appreciation. After a couple months of doing this and getting absolutely nothing in return, I stopped. I get that he’s not always going to be up to returning the favor, but every single time? Not even an offer to get me off? He’s on antidepressants so I understand that his libido isn’t up to par, but I would think the desire to please me sometimes would still be there. In the beginning we’d go running, go to the aquarium, or go see movies, etc. but now he never wants to go out anywhere or do anything with me. He’d rather sit at home watching tv or playing video games for hours on end. When I bring up the sex issue he just laughs and says I don’t need sex, I just want it and he’ll be really sarcastic and say “you poor, poor girl.” 
     He says he loves me and wants to be in this relationship but based on his actions I find this so hard to believe. I’ve asked him if he wants to break up with me and he says no. I’ve asked him if he thinks he should get his antidepressants adjusted and he says he feels fine. Maybe he’s waiting for me to do the dirty work and break up with him.

my mom came down and started yelling at me, and said my sister is through a lot and im mean to her and started screaming and getting heated. my dad came downstairs to ask me what happened and i started crying a little. my mom told me to come up stairs and she started yelling at me for minutes which she usually does when shes mad at me, and says to never turn on my sister or her, and my sister would always be there for me, and i only have three friends and im the reason we arent moving, at the end of her rant she asked if i was happy and i said yes, and she asked why and i said because i think you are going to stop talking soon. and she told me to get out of the house. so i left through the front door and when into the backyard, thinking what i would do if i couldnt come back inside, i didnt have my phone, money, shoes, socks, and i sat on a bench and grabbed a long pipe and just sat there for a while, then my mom came outside and started smoking a cigarette which i knew she did even though she said she didnt or tried to hide it from me.

eventually she came around the side and saw me and i picked up the pipe and aimed it at her, and told her not to come near me. and she was a bad mother, and she was stupid and didnt get education and doesnt have a job and shes the reason we're poor. she didnt really care what i said and asked if i called the police because there were red lights outside, and i kept the pipe up and tried to defend my self. my sister came outside and was looking for me before and i realized she was behind my and tried getting up and she grabbed the pipe so i tried hitter her off and she said wtf is wrong with you, and then they left and went inside and i went into my front yard and then they came back through the backyard and i held up the pipe to my mom and i think she cried a little bit, then i waited in the front and she started yelling at me that there are people nextdoor and to get inside and she would leave me alone, but i refused like 10 times and she went inside and i went on the bench again. she came out a little later really mad and told me to get inside, so i walked behind her slowly and went inside to where she told me everything shes ever done for me, and when she walked away a little i went downstairs, got my phone, a deck of cards, water, all of the money i have and locked myself in the office, nobody has come down here yet. what do i do?

58,"Hey Reddit,

I am looking for some advice and or thoughts on my current position. Please help me reddit!

I have been working for this fairly big IT Company through a contracting firm for about a year and eight months now. When I was brought on, I was told by the contracting firm and the manager for the IT Company I work for, that generally around the one year point I should be converted to a full time employee. I took the job that was offered for the 3rd shift on weekends. I work F-M 10PM-9AM.

As an employee in this office of about 20ish people, I am one of the best workers. I have proven myself to be a huge asset for the company. I have always gone above and beyond to do what is best for the company and make sure my work is near perfect with no mistakes. We have about 5-10 other contractors who also work here, and only one has been here longer than I have. Of the contractors I am BY FAR the best contracting employee, I could go into detail but for the sake of argument, take my word.

I sit here on the thresh hold of that two year mark coming up and I’m facing an internal struggle on which path I need to choose. Right now as a contractor I am making 17$ an hour with NO benefits at all. I don’t get PTO or any kind of provided health care. Now if I DO get converted to the IT perm position, I go up to about 23$ an hour, about 3 weeks of PTO/vacation, and great healthcare. As I was promised that at least before the 2 year mark the conversion would happen, I have asked again and again when this is going to happen or what the update is. I get the same, I don’t have any info right now, or the company is on a hiring freeze, or there aren’t any available reqs out there right now. But I know now the 2 year mark does not mean the contractor instantly gets converted as the one contractor who has been here longer than me has just hit her 2years and 3 months…

At this point I get so angry that I have been put through this for so long, especially when I do better work than a lot of the IT perm employees that make WAY more than me… I try to not stress it and try to forget about it and just think it will happen sooner than later. I have been telling myself that since the 1 year mark, and ill forget it for a month, then the frustration comes back. The longer it has been, and the closer I get to the 2 year mark the smaller that gap gets that I can just suppress the anger/frustration.

Today I had a really good interview for a fairly similar job that will pay around the 18$ an hour rate with a lot of options to grow, it was only the first phone interview, but the guy told me it went really well and it’s likely that I will get the follow up interview and be invited to tour their campus and meet everyone and hash out any details and questions. The way I see it is I have 3 options…

I can tough it out for the 2 year mark, where I’ll be given at a minimum from the contracting company another 1-2 dollar raise. And wait out the conversion possibility
Call them on their crap and tell the IT Company that if at the 2 year mark if I’m not converted to a full perm employee I’m quitting and I can look for a new job elsewhere.

In the event I DO get the follow up interview, and in the event they DO offer me a job, quit and go with that new opportunity.

My frustration over this conversion issue is getting to the point that I think about it daily on shift and it pisses me off so much, but I feel that If I just pack up and leave BEFORE I get converted to that perm spot, that I will have wasted so much of my time and effort, It’s hard to want to pack up and leave this job after I have the equity built up. I feel that 2 year mark COULD mean I get converted and see a big pay bump, and benefits…but It could end up being another year, maybe two, maybe never get converted.

Please if anyone happen to read this far, give me some advice and or thoughts on my dilemma.

60,"So my bf had a gf when he was 13-14. His parents just got divorced and his mom was being batshit crazy, screaming at him 24/7, waking him up by screaming at 3am in the morning to the point where he has panic attacks and bad anxiety.

Anyway, during that time when everyone was against him and his step dad moved away &amp; lived far away, his mom isn't even a mother to him.. he felt lonely. At that young age, he had a girl who liked him and he felt special for once and they were together. 

He was a good kid, who is innocent. That girl's family were horrible. They're white nationalists and basically trashy people. He told me they would blast out those white power songs, all they do is drink like idiots and get drunk. They're stoners too and that girl started smoking weed when she was 12. He has never even smoked weed then, he only started at 15.

Anyway, he would tell me that her dad would make fun of disabled people, people who look a bit different, etc. He's basically an asshole and they're all full of hate.

When he broke up 2 months later because he realises that she and her family are horrible trashy people and are a bad influence on him.. this is where it got bad.

Her dad, cousins and a bunch of other grown man beat the living shit out of him till he passed out and ended up in the hospital. Obviously my bf then and his mum pressed charges and the police did nothing. They just went to their house, and said they can't do anything. My bf doesn't come from a rich family anyway and his mum wouldn't care less.

Anyway, he's 23 now and sometimes he suffers from memory loss and has frequent headaches  and he is too scared to check it out. He's suspecting that it all started when he got bashed up and he was hit on the head a lot. He did an MRI when he was younger and apparently they found out that the trauma is in result of his anger issues.

I really do love him and I'm worried. I'm fucking pissed that his ex got away with everything.. she is still a Nazi white trash piece of shit on FB. Posts shit like ""white pride world wide"" and she works in a restaurant and also a famous pizza chain.

So, should I message the business that she works in to show proof of what she is posting on her FB? Her family are drug dealers too.",05Aug2018,2
61,"I’m sure this kind of stuff is posted a lot, but my ex is pretty much the only girl I’ve ever loved. I truly believe I was the happiest I’ve ever been when we were together, but we broke up once she went off to college ( I was a year younger).

I’m now going into my second year of college, and she is going into her third. We go to the same university, although my choice to go there was unrelated to the fact that she had chosen to go there. It had pretty much been my dream school since I was a toddler and I wasn’t going to not go there after being accepted just because she was there.

We dated on and off throughout high school and were pretty much each others’ “firsts” for everything. The TL;DR of our breakup is pretty much that we talked about how we would handle her going off to college, and she was adamant that we should stay together. Well, not two weeks later, she decided we should actually break up. Understandably, I was pretty pissed. Got pretty drunk and called her a “c*nt.” Yes, I know, Major dick move by me and I apologized profusely the following day but not sure she ever really forgave me.

Anyway, I would love to just forget about her and move on but the problem is that she is pretty good friends w/ my sister (2 years older than me) so i still see here fairly often which makes it pretty difficult for me.  Anyway, I pretty much haven’t ever really stopped thinking about her since our breakup 2 years ago and am thinking about maybe trying to rekindle the relationship but am not sure how to go about it.

I know it sounds bad on my part tbh, but I can promise I’m not obsessed with her or anything, it’s just that when I look back on the years we dated before our breakup, we rarely fought and overall had a great time together and connected on many levels.

Any advice on how I should proceed with this is greatly appreciated.

64,"I live in Canada (Toronto, Ontario) and I'm going into my final year in my physics undergrad. I plan on making my final year the most positive experience I had in my entire undergrad. That being said, I also want to prepare for life after graduation. I don't want to be in a position where I'm mindlessly sending out resumes and cover letters in hopes of receiving a job, living paycheque to paycheque or having no real direction. I also don't want to want to fall behind in experiencing life/learning either.

In terms of career path, I've yet to figure what I want to do. I've thought about diving into the world of software since I love solving problems (hence why I'm in physics) and already have a decent amount of programming experience. My issue here thought is that I don't have programming experience to put on a resume. I've been rejected for every internship and research assistance position that involved programming (I'm not exactly the best student either and my crap marks put me at a disadvantage in the academic world). I have nothing to show for it even though I know I can do it. I'm sure there are problem solving careers/opportunities that I've never heard of so I'm open to hearing about those too.

In terms of life skills, I am really good with finances and read a lot of books about investing, managing money and knowing how to avoid traps that many people fall into. I'm also quite the extravert so being social, negotiating, making friends are pretty natural for me. 

My end goals are as follows: I want to obtain financial freedom as soon as I can. I want to be able to travel as much as possible in my youth. I'm not interested in luxuries (rather spend money on great experiences over materials). I want to become an author (specifically in the fantasy genre) and potentially create/open a game development studio. Very ambitious of me I know.

66,"I play the bass guitar and I fucking hate it, everytime I pick it up it makes me feel awful straight away, it sounds terrible, and looks ugly.

For years I've practiced and practiced, I've trained so hard but I'm still at the level of someone who has been playing for about a month or two and it drains my self esteem. Everytime I'm done playing I feel frustrated and unhappy, it has never brought my any sense of happiness.

But unfortunately it is the closest thing I have to a talent, without it I'm nothing, there is absolutely nothing to me, I have no actual hobbies or skills, and it's not as simple as just going and getting them while I have school and work all the time.

To make matters worse, my mother spent way beyond her means on my 18th birthday to get me a flashy new bass and amplifier and a bunch of accessories, I'd never tell her how much I hated it, but I did, and now I feel trapped playing an instrument which makes me feel so bad.

What should I do? I can't just give it up cold turkey, not after my mother had spent so much money and is so proud of me, and if I do quit, I've lost the biggest time and effort investment in my life and for what? a bunch of lost hours and holes in my wall?",05Aug2018,1
67,"You can skip to below the horizontal line--the ""life crisis"" part isn't until after the line, the following is just background about myself.

I graduated as an Applied Math major over a year ago. Job prospects haven't been that great and doing contract work making educational math videos and tutoring on the side, living with parents so not paying rent (saving money in the meanwhile) while helping pay for bills. All of my work experience has pretty much been teaching or tutoring, but I don't see myself becoming a teacher. Everything I learned in undergrad is just too vague/broad to be applied practically and I think I need to go back to school, take some bootcamp, classes, or something because I feel like I wasted my time and money getting a math degree, but more than that, I wasted my opportunity in college to do internships and network (only ever just tutoring), so I feel pidgeonholed doing nothing else but education-related jobs that don't pay well at all.

I've ran through different possibilities for what I need to do next and to be honest am hitting dead ends for some reason or another:

- Go back to school in something practical like CS or engineering. I had a good GPA, but no relevant experience (whether for finance/CS/engineering), but don't see how I can get letters of recs to do so.

- Go to a programming bootcamp. I've always regretted not getting into CS like my peers during school; many of them landed solid jobs after graduating and here I am sitting not knowing what to do. Bootcamp seems like a good way to bridge the knowledge gap, but in the end I'm still competing for positions that CS majors also want.

- Try to become an actuary. However I've read that the entry level market is VERY saturated--so many newcomers wanting what can only be so many positions. And these newcomers are in much better shape than I, likely to have passed 2-3 exams in college with relevant internship experience. Whereas I have nothing, even if I sit myself and take to passing 2-3 exams, that's not enough to make up for my zero experience.

---------

I just came back from a trip abroad and after running through those options, I decided I don't want to settle in the US. At least not for some time. I get so depressed thinking about work, and even hearing my friends' plans about staying with their company for X years, saving for retirement etc just makes me even more depressed. Just, ""is that it? Is that all there is to life?"" I know it sounds like a spoiled dream and impractical fantasy, but I want to live and work abroad, especially in Asia (I'm Chinese-American if that's relevant) if possible. Being able to work for a good company as an expat in Asia sounds like the dream. Though I know the most practical option is to just settle for a job in the US, work and save vacation days and do so through there, but I guess I have to figure out what I want to do first.

I know I mentioned not seeing myself as a teacher, but in regards the above I've been considering the TEFL step and getting certified to teach English abroad, though it sounds like I'll be closing a lot of doors that way. People who have done it say it's difficult to relocate/settle back in the US for a job, since it's always just going from company to company and not paying that well either (not the most 'prestigious' or practical experience). But pay is secondary to me at this point, as long as I can be comfortable. I guess I just want to be at least semi-reasonable about my long-term future.

Lastly and unrelated to the career aspect that has made up the majority of this post, I just found out I have type 2 diabetes. And discovered it kind of late, where I'm undergoing diabetic neuropathy (nerves beginning to get damaged/die). My toes have begun to feel numb and that's what prompted me to check it out. It's to a mild extent and not affecting me too much and can be staved if I just begin to watch my diet now. But it's just another factor that's adding to this gloom/depression, and I'm wondering if that would kill my dream for being able to work or live abroad.

My head has been numb from thinking so much the past few days. I feel like a combination of restlessness from overthinking, depression about the past, anxiety about the future has just not not been good for my mental health. Combined with the recent diagnosis, even if for a common condition many people deal with and manage, I'm in this state of suspension where my life has halted and I'm just going through the motions of work and thinking but not really being serious about what I want to do. I'm an indecisive person by nature and I guess just have a lot of self-doubt. I don't think I have what it takes for anything I want to do, if I can even decide what I want to do. 

This post was really messy and didn't really have a direction but I guess I just needed to vent. I've been keeping these thoughts bottled in all day and typing it out helps. So I don't really have any expectations on what kind of responses, whether advice, shared experience, or whatnot, but if you read all of this, thanks for reading.",05Aug2018,1

We were standing at the way back of the room where the cast member stands, he was in front of the door, then next to him was my cousin, then me.

80,"I posted this on another sub but was suggested that I post this here:


Been single for 7 years, but have dated around. I have only had two relationships in my adult life. One with a male and one with a female. Both of them were terrible. The last one that I had (with the female), she was significantly older than me (25 years) , as I prefer to date much older women. She played a lot of games but came off really sweet at first. I was REALLY into this woman but she never claimed me as her boyfriend even when we lived together and did everything couples do. She would also do stuff on purpose to hurt me like making fun of me being bi or when I was having a rough day she wouldn’t try to make me feel better.

The guy I was with was kinda the same way. He never respected me and used to make fun of me in front of his friends and he was very controlling. 

Both of these relationships have made me quite bitter and I have never been able to let myself fall for anyone ever since. The first thing that runs through my head when meeting someone new is “oh lord, what kinda issues does this person have and can I handle them?”, so it makes it hard to relax around them. 

I have been in and out of therapy for the last seven years and currently am seeing a new therapist for the last two months. Not seeing a lot of results from the therapy though.

How do I move on and allow myself to love again?

Edit: also I just feel like everyone I meet is putting up a facade and I am afraid they will become abusive after I commit to them and then it will be too late.

81,"Hi there, I'm a first year graduate student working towards my PhD in Clinical and Translational Science . I just started my first quarter of classes and not to my surprise, everything is quite harder than undergrad. I don't feel so overwhelmed to the amount like I can't do it, but I have these moments where I feel like I can't.

When I talk to second or third year students, they usually say that it is somewhat normal to feel a bit stressed out during the first few months of beginning a PhD program, but they don't make a big deal out of it - is that because it isn't as big of a deal as I think it is, or is it just because they maybe didn't freak out as much as I am about this.

I know that I am capable of doing this. I never pegged myself as someone who is smarter than most people; rather, I would just chalk it all up to my work ethic. That's always been my thing, I'm willing to work harder. I don't feel like I'm dumb or anything, this is just a lot - is it supposed to be like that?

I did well in undergrad, had a good GPA etc and I've managed to acquire a good bit of research experience. I know that this experience isn't supposed to be a walk in the park or anything, but like I said, I just have these moments every now and then that I feel like I need to be doing more, studying more, or just know more in general about what I'm doing. I know I'm not supposed to know everything, that's kind've the point of the whole *school* thing...

On the other hand, the people that recommended I apply to these programs and wrote my letters of recommendation and mentored me etc. wouldn't have done that if *they did think I could do it, right?*

I don't expect to earn all A's or anything like that, I just - I don't know, am I just having these little freak outs because I'm still fresh into a program? Did you guys and gals have experiences like this before? How did you cope with the stress? Is it normal to have moments wherein you feel this way?

Sorry for all the rambling...

Any and all advice is much appreciated",05Aug2018,0
82,"So I met 2 different girls on the same dating site right around the same time. We talked for awhile after a couple weeks or so I went on a date with one. We ended up going on 4 more dates and seemed to really like each other and enjoy being around each other. On the 4th date we ended up having sex. It made me feel closer to her and I hope she feels the same. 

During all this I've been texting other girl. She has stated she wants to have sex and we have ""sexted"". She says she has a hard time keeping emotions and sex separated so she doesn't wanna be a ""booty call"" but at the same time she didn't really say she wanted to be exclusive. She also told me she wished she had flirted with some guys when she was at a bar with her friend so I mean she's demonstrated that she isn't trying to be exclusive or anything. 

Should I tell the 2nd girl about the 1st girl? Am I jumping the gun by doing that? I feel a strong connection to the 1st girl but I've gotten too attached too fast before and we are still new to each other. I don't want anyone getting hurt but I also don't want to limit my experiences. ",05Aug2018,1
83,"I moved home after college and my plan has been to stay until I finish grad school and find a job. It's driving me insane though. I've had 3 therapists tell me I should move out. Nothing terrible so to speak, it's just that my family can be really invalidating toward me and I'm sick of it. They're very negative and only criticize me and don't believe in mental health. I just can't be myself or even defend myself. I've tried talking to them about things, but it's no use. They'll never change. It's time to give up and just isolate myself as much as possible from them.

I would love to live on my own, but rent is getting ridiculous where I live. The absolute scummiest studio apartments are going for over $700 a month. I only make $800 a month. I do have savings, but it's for tuition. The therapists all say to just take out loans for tuition and use the savings for living expenses. I've had it drilled into me that loans are evil and will ruin your life. But living at home is sort of having the same effect. I know I should do it, but the more I look into the apartments the more discouraging it gets since the rents are so high and now I have to consider the high crime pockets where the only affordable apartments are. All I ever hear about is crime in apartment complexes and cars getting broken into etc so that does freak me out. It's just so much to account for. If I move out suddenly I'll be paying for everything - not just rent but food and everything else. Also where do people find out about openings for rentals? Zillow and [Apartments.c](https://Apartments.com)om are very limited. I've joined a few rental groups on Facebook. Not really sure what else to do...

Also, I'm not very interested in renting a room and having roommates since I had terrible experiences in college. I would consider it only if the room was somehow separated from the rest of the house with its own living space etc. 

Any advice? For the time being I'm toughing it out. I'm starting to look at what's out there though just in case I reach my breaking point.",05Aug2018,1

106,"So I have this friend whom I don't feel comfortable around. Let's call her A. Around mid July, we started 12th grade. I initially wanted to sit close to my male friends, because despite being female, I feel more comfortable hanging out with them. The seat I chose was behind A's chosen seat, and my male friends are seated to my and A's right. 

Then A's best friend, B, came. A initially wanted B to sit behind her, but since the seat was taken, B sat to A's left. Both of them then proceeded to bug me and begged for me to switch places with B. Feeling annoyed, I reluctantly agreed to switch. After switching though, both of them just ignored me, and only talk to me regarding topics about school. 

For a little background, I'm known as the one who has the highest average grade in my year. A is a schoolmate since elementary school. Back then, A bullied me a lot, since I was only a shy, friendless kid who couldn't stand up to myself. In high school, I took my studies seriously, so I got better grades and in turn my social standing became better. A suddenly turned all buddy-buddy towards me, and somehow became part of my friend circle.

B is a schoolmate since middle school. In my opinion, she is quite similar to myself, in that she's a quiet, hardworking, and nice person, except that she's richer and has better social skills than me. From what I see, A is only exploiting B, and I have heard B even admitting that A would never be her friend if she wasn't as rich and smart.

Back to the story. The dilemma I'm facing is group projects. I don't know whether to stick to A and B for projects, or go my separate way to group with the males. A and B are hard-working and smart, and both of them are well liked by the teachers. But to be honest, A had done several things that makes me uncomfortable around her. It would be too long to describe here. I honestly want to just confront her and say my disatisfaction towards her, but I have seen someone else do that before, and well, she turned a lot of people, including the teachers, against him. She's definitely not someone I would want to associate with if given the chance. And to be honest, just having A's presence in the vicinity is somehow enough to make my morale drop and lower my productivity, as seen in the past few weeks.

About my male friends, I have three close male friends, and I have to admit only one of them are hardworker. This would mean I and the one hardworker would have to do most of the work. But I feel comfortable around them, since they actually include me in their conversations, and not explicitly whisper and giggle while excluding me, like A and B do. Since I actually feel included and accepted here, I'm more motivated to actually do better.

So the question is, should I stop being an emotional kid and stay as A and B's friend for a better grade? Should I just suck it up and stop being emo and ditch my work just because A is present? Or should I just follow my emotions and go with my male friends more?

Please do ask for more details if needed, I know this probably sounds biased because I really want to just ditch A and B, but I do want an unbiased opinion if possible.",05Aug2018,1

Jaw is broken in 3 places; left and right side, at the mandible. So I have screws holding it in place on both sides. Also fractures at the chin, so metal plate there. And bars/wires holding my jaw closed and teeth together. I have basically zero mobility of my jaw, so no opening.

It's hard to drink like that, i keep spilling but at least i can get rinse my mouth and get liquid down that way. Also constant bloody drool, so I'm constantly wiping and holding paper towels to my mouth to keep from dipping blood everywhere.

But all I do is think about killing myself when I’m alone at night and send my friends shitty memes about it to try and get their attention. Even though I know I’ll never go through with it and I don’t really have an illness.

118,"Hi all,

I've had a very difficult week, to say the least, purely with my own issues.  The cherry on top, so to speak, has been my mom's (and brother's--basically the family) dog getting very ill (possibly with pancreatitis, last I heard) and having to be hospitalized twice.

This might seem like a basic human thing, but (as my post history indicates) I'm severely mentally disabled/ill/not neurotypical.  Oftentimes my conditions get in the way of expressing sincere emotions and empathy towards those I love and care about.  I'm also, admittedly, not a dog person, so I'm really at a loss here.  This dog is a 'family dog', basically, but I've never been closely bonded with her.  I couldn't stand her as a puppy, actually, but in recent years have come to find her really endearing and sweet and bonded with her a little.

Might seem like I'm jumping the gun, but realistically: said dog is very old (12-14 years, I think?), was from a puppy mill and has been plagued with numerous disabling health issues throughout her life, she's in the hospital for the second time in a week, and while I'm certainly hoping for the best, it seems wise to start thinking about this now in case she doesn't make it as I don't want to be caught totally off guard.

Despite the fact that she's lived a long life, it's still going to hit my mom really hard.  I'm just afraid that anything I try to say or express is going to come across as stilted or insincere given the circumstances.  So what is the best way to approach this inevitable life situation?  Other than saying, ""Oh, I'm so sorry..."" I'm not sure how to handle it when it happens.  Should I encourage my mom (and brother) to share positive memories of her?  Any advice appreciated, thanks.",05Aug2018,3
119,"I met this girl online a few months ago and things were pretty alright between us until I asked her out a week after meeting her (yes I know, this is waaaaaay too soon) and she rejected me. Since then, she’s been extremely rude to me, sometimes ignores me, and forces herself to hate me by believing things that aren’t true at all about me. Despite all this, my crush on her continued. Today, I asked her why she’s been acting like that cause I didn’t understand. And that’s when she admitted to me that she’s liked me the whole time, but refused to accept it due to me being 3 years older than her.

I’m in shock really and I hope she truly means it, but now I have no idea what to do now lol. Send help.",05Aug2018,3
120,"First of all, my friend is an 18 year old out and proud Bisexual and has been in a relationship for a little over a year. Her girlfriend is a complete nightmare. At first she is very charming and seems like a decent person but she is literal scum. 
Some examples of this:
1) she will make my friend pay for everything for her including things like: clothes, food, other shit. I know this is normal in relationships to pay for each other but that’s the problem, she never returns the favor and my friend has brought his up to her. But her girlfriend just throws a tantrum and will accuse my friend of not even loving her just because my friend does not wanna pay for EVERYTHING. 
2)  she goes through my friend’s phone and sometimes will text people on it pretending to be my friend. 
3) she invalidates my friend’s bisexuality by telling her that “that” does not exist and that she is a lesbian and gets mad at her when says otherwise and will throw a whole ass tantrum.
4)she is 21 and acts like a fucking child and throws actual tantrums. 
5)she also controls who my friend hangs out with, and she never lets my friend hang out with our friend group by herself. Or she will but my friend has to contact her the entire time.
6)she also has changed my friend’s personality and made her become very brash and rude. My friend like talks major shit behind her best friend’s back now, all because her gf does not like her.
Like i just think their relationship is really toxic and i am not sure what to do. It has gotten to a toxic peak where my friend will hurt herself if they have a big fight. I have told her parents about that because i was worried for her safety and they were like “lol she is a big girl she can handle it.”

121,"I've never had a problem sharing my opinions on Facebook but this one is very taboo and I will probably be heavily ridiculed. It's a very important message to me but I guess I'm trying to find the line between getting my thoughts out there and essentially publicly embarrasing myself, even though I can handle the critisism but I'm just worried that a lot of people would have a different opinion of me. Most people on my FB are just people from my high school in another state, so it's not like I ever interact with them in real life, but I still feel hesitant to post about it even though I really want to. I don't even want to say what it is here because probably nobody will take me seriously. 

I know that me making a couple of Facebook posts in itself won't convince anyone of my beliefs, but for me it's always been about the hope of planting curiosity in people's minds, whether that curiosity goes toward my belief or something else it doesn't matter because I just want to fuel thought and discussion. 

So do you think it would be worth following my urge to post about my unpopular opinion at the risk of people who I know, but don't interact with/see, thinking that I'm a nutjob? I'd probably block all the people whose opinions I actually care about from seeing those posts. I just have low self esteem tbh so sometimes when I make posts like that on social media I feel stupid or embarrased even though I know I should be proud to stand by my beliefs. ",05Aug2018,0

I only get these moments of feeling really worthless and loneliness that come and go. Among other thoughts like not thinking I'm not good enough, being forever alone and feeling sad for no apparent reason.

127,"I'm a agnostic; when I say ""agnostic"", I mean as close to being an atheist as possible without actually being an atheist. I live in a fairly conservative community where Christianity in general is a moderately important part of the community, and I would like to become more integrated. I would describe my own politics around center left to moderate left. I do not believe now, nor do I find it likely that I will ever believe that there is literally a man sitting in the clouds passing judgment on my soul, but I do believe that Christianity, like most religions, is an elaborate metaphor that is useful for working with complex philosophical topics and giving a sense of identity to a community. So if I were to say ""I believe in God"", it would be in the sense that I believe in the concepts of goodness, righteousness, and justice.  


All of that being said, I don't know much about the various denominations of Christianity; I know that some are more tolerant and accepting than others, and that some churches focus more on a humanistic view than on bible thumping. What would be a good choice for someone like me? Are their other options?",05Aug2018,1
128,"Original post: “So I got a part-time job this summer. A family friend “Rob” got me this job. His dad “Joe” owns a golf shop and he was looking for someone to work during the summer at its peak season. I’ve been working since the end of May. I’ve also been taking college courses and an internship so I can graduate. 

Joe only has a few people working there so it’s hard to get days off already. He is moving right now too, so he isn’t able to be at the shop as often, and he usually helps out there everyday. I’m going on a vacation to celebrate my college graduation in three weeks. On Labor Day Weekend (one week later) my girlfriend is coming to visit so I would need that weekend off too. I am really scared to quit, but there is no way he’d give me all of these days off. I feel like he is going to tell Rob about how bad of a worker I am and make me out to be a bad person. I also feel like he’s going to be very mad that I’m quitting even though it’s just a part time summer job. What should I say to him? I’m going to tell him tomorrow”

Update: I talked to my boss the other day. I told him I think I have to quit at the end of August because I’m going to be asking for too many days off. He was pissed and told me I was “fucking” him. I told him I have a job interview this week and need a day off and he’s mad I was looking for jobs. I’m a student, and I want to use my degree and not work at a golf shop. It’s insane that he was mad about that. He expects this job to be my life when in reality it is the last of my priorities as I’m taking six classes and an internship right now. Anyway, he told me he hired me for the season and me quitting would fuck him over and the other three people that work there since they’d have to pick up a bunch of hours. I feel like three weeks is more than enough time to figure out what to do about that. He told me to write down the days I need off and he’ll try to work something out. I’m okay with that, but if I get this job and they want me to start soon I’m obviously going to choose a real job over a golf shop. I’m not sure how to handle this situation and tomorrow morning I’m going to have to give him the note with all the days I need off and talk to him about it.

131,"My scenario is one that pretty much depresses me everyday. Out of highschool my parents would not let me take a year off to decide what I really wanted to do so instead I enrolled in a journalism program. After a full semester I dropped out knowing all along that this was not the path I wanted to take in life and decided to reapply for a general arts transfer program at a college because I decided I had wanted to go to university and get a degree in criminal studies. 

A lot happened in my life after that. My relationship went sour with a girl I had been dating for a year and a half, I became really depressed for that and multiple other reasons and dropped out of my dream program, where I was in the midst of being accepted to the University of Toronto (In case someone doesn't know yet I live in Canada.) 

It has been a few months since I dropped out and as my situation stands I am barred from applying for financial assistance from OSAP for a full-year due to my 2 drop-outs of school, and I owe them $7000 starting in November. And on top of that my parents are moving away and told me I am on my own for living situation, financially (which is fine because I have a job and I've saved a decent amount to barely scrape by as someones roommate.) My biggest concern is going back to school. In highschool I was a dumbass and never took math seriously so I only have a grade 11 College math credit and no Grade 12 maths.  


Ideally I want to go back for something like video game design but they all seem to require either a portfolio (which I do not really have) and a math credit or computer science experience of some sort. I have looked into Private-colleges like TriOS which online have terrible reviews but am willing to hear anything good about paying 30k for a diploma/certificate that may not be accredited. 

  
Overall I just want advice. On everything. Mainly about going back to school but any advice helps. The HARDEST part is watching all of my friends and classmates now in their 3rd year of Uni or college ready to soon graduate, while i'm here doing what seems like nothing in life.",05Aug2018,1

137,"Okay, as creepy as the headline sounds, I need advice and I need help. 

Basically, I was walking my dog and saw a young woman sitting on the curb rocking at dusk while walking my dog. I stopped and asked her how she was doing and if she needed anything. I sat down, we chatted, and she asked me for a shower.

So, since we were a block from my house, I let her shower. Now, I'm married and immediately texted my wife giving her a blow by blow. She apparently started watching on our house-cam therafter. So she showers (and I later learn shaved). I offer her food or something to drink. She takes a bit of both. She told me a bit of her story and it was rather upsetting and I don't want to get into it. But, she's pregnant and homeless and had been couch surfing for a while. She was having a panic attack on the curb when I offered help.

Even though I couldn't shake my good-Samaritanism, I knew I could not let her stay the night because WTF this is a stranger. However I felt responsible at this point. So I offered her a hotel room. She said yes and I went to the closest hotel, which was full (I actually think they thought she was a hooker or something and denied the room). I, frustrated, offered her $150 or a hotel room and she wanted the room. So, I pressed on and found her a hotel room after about 20 minutes of searching, and it only cost $110. 

I gave her my number, asked her to please check out in the morning, and told her to call me if she needs help.

And then I debriefed my wife. 

So, I feel responsible for a homeless pregnant girl who could destroy the hotel room and I'd have to pay for it. What resources should I seek out if she needs help ad calls me?",05Aug2018,2

I am incredibly uncomfortable at work and don't want to be there any more. I plan on taking some time off to figure things out but it isn't that easy. It is a great company and I like the people there but I just dont feel like I belong so I need to quit asap. I have a good amount of money saved up so I'm not worried about my finances if I take an extended period of time off.

What makes it hard is that I recently received an offer elsewhere but my current company matched the offer as well as gave me a pretty big promotion. It just sucks that they have been so good to me but now I have to tell them that I want to leave. Also, this is probably the worst time ever to leave. Things are about to get insanely busy and there isn't really anyone that does a lot of the tasks I handle. I currently have a huge workload and it would be literally impossible for them to manage it all without me. I would probably give extra notice to find a replacement because of this reason.

At the end of the day I am going to do what's best for me though, regardless of the effects it has on the company. I just don't want them to be put in a tough situation because of me.

What can I tell my boss so that I dont burn any bridges? I have thought about saying something along the lines of:

1. I need to leave for personal/health reasons, nothing to do with you or the company.
2. I am sick of living in [state] and want a change.
3. I have received a big opportunity in [state] and don't want to pass it up.

The first two are actually true but not the third. I want to be as honest with them as I can but as vague as possible.

Last night I went to sleep and when my dad woke up in the morning, he found the window screen open as if someone took it off. He asked me if I heard anything and I told him that around 2-3 am, I heard a noise coming from the window, but I thought it was my cat playing around in my room. I went to the bathroom and came back to check outside the window and didn’t see anything, so I went back to sleep. We checked the window screen and noticed a dent/broken piece. 

Anyway we came to two conclusion: someone tried to break into my room or the window screen fell off. My neighbor told my parents that there’s a couple walking around the neighborhood and they’re shining flashlights trying to steal some stuff.

Recently I expressed to her that I was not comfortable being in her wedding as the maid on honor because I do not support the relationship she is in and how it came to be. I had a feeling that she was going to trash talk me though and so I did some secret snooping and I was right. Her and her fiance were calling me a bitch and calling me petty and vindictive. They also said that it's a good thing I'm not going to be in the wedding because I would just ruin the pictures anyway. I finally felt that I had enough of her and her fiance secretly judging me and so I unfriended her and blocked her on everything as well as her fiance and mother. I did however write a two page word document on all my feelings regarding the friendship and what has been happening recently and since the beginning.

I just stopped living life and would sit in my room all day and pity myself and think of ways out of it. I stopped going to class, stopped talking to my friends online or offline, didn't go to parties anymore, left any club I was in, and just sat in my room all day being an insecure mess and hoping nobody could see what I had become. Nothing major even happened that I remember, I've ever been ostrisized, I've always been pretty average, good friends, no trouble making eye contact or talking with people, got invited to parties, had relationships.. It feels like I've lost all semblance of who I was. I know what everyone is gonna say ""Oh you need to just get yourself back out there and get off 4Chan and go talk to people again."" I know I should do that, but doing it and knowing it are two different things. 

This all stems from, me feeling like I won't be able to live up to expectations myself and others have put on me, or that I'll fuck up and be alone forever. That's what's holding me back and scaring the shit out of me right now, that maybe I'm no longer able to be the old me and if I try to reach back out to people or try to resume my old life I'll fuck up and lose everything and have all my fears confirmed, and end up alone and hopeless. I'm scared that I won't be able to learn to be a normal again. It just feels like I can't even 'Be Myself' and I never know what to say or even think outside of being insecure, it's like any confidence or self-esteem I had is gone.

151,"Some context: I graduated from college in 2015 with a useless degree and could only find work in retail. For two years I was basically sleep walking though this part time job. Not going anywhere. Then I had horrible nightmares before I turned 25 and realized I was going nowhere in life.

I went back to school for a BS in Computer science because of the stability factor in computer programming. I didn't take a CS class until January to April of this year. It was rough. The professor did not use a textbook and there was no structure to the course. I basically passed only due to the help of a friend and learned very little. I vowed to teach myself to be a good programmer in the coming 4 summer months. It didn't happen. Not one hour of studying programming took place.

I didn't sit around doing nothing though. May to June I was in summer math courses that were challenging to me and very stressful since I am not good at math. The stress made me want to have fun when I was home from school and work. When I finished my studying or assignments...I didn't want to study about programming. I wan't to blow off steam. So that's what I did.

July to August is my second round of summer courses. One of them is a health class, which I've been using as a springboard to lose weight. Running has boosted my mood, but nowadays I find my depression comes at night. At night is when I can't run or exercise. It's when I study programming. Since August 1rst I've tried to at least do 30 mins of coding to an hour a day. The problem is in 13 days I get to go on my vacation....then go to fall classes which is my second programming class. I'm angry at myself for only starting now...

I'm terrified I'll be woefully unprepared. Just so much fear and anxiety that this isn't the right path for me, that I'm not meant for this field. That my brain isn't suited for this kind of work.

At night, these depressing thoughts overwhelm me and the anxiety terrifies me. I keep trying to tell myself that I can conquer this degree but my first degree gave me no jobs. I can't help but be perpetually scared.

Do any of you have tips on how to handle this depression or anxiety at night? If I feel it during the day, I can be rid of it through exercise. But at this time of night I cannot safely exercise outside.",05Aug2018,1
152,"So about an hour ago I'm added to a group chat on Snapchat with 4 others,

I know 2 of them as they're friends and 1 of them is threatening to shoot us for insulting his friend?

He kept claiming he has a gun and my friends know he has numerous drugs on him (weed and other things apparently)

Now I didn't want anything to do with this, but I did get one thing which was his address.

He doesn't personally care about me, however he might hurt or kill one of my friends and I'm trying to prevent that.

He repeatedly said he has a gun and his friend was also backing up his claim.

This has not much to do with me at all but would the police forces do anything if I called in and said someone was threatening my life what would they do.

I'm not trying to get any of my parents or family involved because it has almost nothing to do with me so would it be wise for my friend to tell his parents or something?

164,"Ok so to start off, i’m 16 years old and this is my first job, its retail. 

So today at work I wasn’t feeling really good emotionally, during my lunch i was sitting in my car and i started having a really bad mental breakdown, i was bawling my eyes out more than ever. But eventually my lunch was over so I went back in to work even though i was still kind of crying, so after i clocked back in i asked my boss what part of the store she wanted me at, she noticed that i had been crying so she asked if i wanted to talk. I started crying again so we went into her superiors office and started talking, I ended up telling her WAY too much about my life, i told her about my ex-gf who was on heroin and how that fucked with my brain, and how one of my friends has been going hard on drugs and how its affecting me, other than that i also told her a lot about how i hate myself and the person i am and basically for 30 minutes just had a mental breakdown in front of her. She told me she used to be a counselor (she also used to work in hr at my work) so she like understood it. But i cant help but feel so guilty, ashamed, embarrassed, self-absorbed, etc. I guess it was all ok and she said that she wouldn’t tell anyone about it, it was just so embarrassing and i REALLY regret telling her that much stuff especially about the drugs that i’ve seen and been around with other people. 

So basically I want some advice on this situation, do i apologize to her? do i never bring it up again? what do i do¿ this has been such an embarrassing experience for me and especially because shes my direct superior its just so much worse in my head I don’t know how to handle it.

165,"I haven't really talked to my dad for some 7 years, a few years after the divorce when he acted like a real dick towards my mom. To sum things up, he just never really been a very good dad (narcissistic, yelling, and occasionally violent), but I still recognize the fact that hes just human, but extremely bad at being a parent. 


Anyway, he started writing me on facebook. Extremely carefully, telling me he like to have contact again. That he's not good on writing (thats true!) and suggest we meet if I like.


I honestly don't know what to think or feel about this. I never intended not talking to him ever again, but it felt nice not having to worry about his existence the past couple of years, and I can't say that I've missed him in any sense.
But I don't like the thought that he'd die one day without at least talking a bit to one of us (I have two older brothers, but I'm probably his best chance of getting in touch again), and I have a lot of stuff to get off my chest as well. But hes neither verbally or empathically gifted, so talking about this kind of thing has always been a struggle. Last time we tried to talk about these things, he only had focus on his own thoughts and feelings and constantly victimized himself, and blamed everyone else (especially our mom, who really haven't done anything wrong other than taking too much shit for far too many years).
I have very mixed feelings about all of this. On one hand I don't want to talk to him more than necessary (I'm okay with superficial chitchat, but I'm not the one who is going to be carrying the conversation) and the thought of meeting him makes me very uncomfortable. On the other hand, I've been avoiding things as a problem solver for far too many years. 

I just don't trust he has changed enough for it to be worth the time and energy, but I obviously can't know for sure unless I give it a shot. I've changed a lot over the past couple of years, and learned to be more open minded and that I have to give things a chance (and fixing rather than tossing is a good rule of thumb for more than just broken household items).
I don't know what exactly I can gain from getting in contact with him again, other than getting stuff off my chest (but that could potentially be a waste of energy too, if he's still not able to listen or understand) and getting a feeling that I gave things a shot. I don't feel like I owe him anything, but fact is, hes just a human and all his kids cut contact, obviously it effects him.


Up until now the conversation hasn't been long. I told him I need more mental preparation if we were to meet, and that its not going to happen right now. I told him I needed to get a feeling what his primary intentions for wanting contact again, and not surprisingly he told me he just wanted contact with his children again, but also wanted to get to know his grandchild (my son). This was a pretty sensitive area I choose not to react on, but that is definitely off the table if I don't even know if *I* want contact. I fear his reasons for contacting me is purely for selfish reasons, and he has been pushing things a bit too much from the beginning, which makes me pretty uncomfortable.
I don't know how to mentally tackle the situation as a whole either, if I'm going to be able to give it a chance without too many old feelings involved. Last message was me trying to tone down the entire ""I want you back in my life"" thing by telling him that since writing is not ideal, topics on the heavy stuff had to wait, and he could start by telling me whats going on in his life right now.",05Aug2018,3
166,"Before I start: sorry if I’m doing this all wrong. I’m really new to reddit and idk how anything works so I’m guessing I posted this in the wrong place and I’m gonna get in trouble with the mods or smth.  Anyways let’s get started

167,"Okay so there's going to be a *lot* of backstory in this post so  let me just give a tl;dr: 19F here, and I had planned to move in with this guy I knew from school and some of his friends (platonic all around), but a recent incident made me realize that this guy is super condescending and bad for me, and that I had been running to him for an easy ride after a not-so-good-but-not-terrible childhood left me pretty depressed/anxious. Now I don't want to move in with him at all, and want to find my own place to live instead (no rush on that and I haven't signed anything regarding moving in with him so legally/financially I'm fine). How do I tell him that I don't want to move in with him? He's always managed to talk me around to thinking he's not so bad and that we could still be friends even after everything he does.

\---

Right, so with that huge tl;dr out of the way here's the medium-long version (the long version would be a fucking book). My parents are pretty alright, relatively supportive, but when I was in school grades were the be-all and end-all, and any emotional issues were swept under the rug (crying meant I was weak, every time I went to my parents about something that was hurting me, especially if it was about them, I would be shouted down and basically told to toughen up). So, as a result, I'm pretty emotionally stunted. I've got that whole 'usually dead inside but sometimes violently breaks down, has a foreshortened sense of future, stressed out around people, sometimes has suicidal thoughts but would never go through with them' thing going on. So, pretty fucked up inside but I can pretend to function.

Anyway, in comes this guy, let's call him Pete. He's all caring, agrees that my parents are fucking me up, says that he wishes he could take me away and take care of me, etc, etc. At this point I'm only 16 so that sounds like a fucking dream come true (and he's 17 so it's not like he's some creepy older guy). We start planning it out, he's actually a functioning human being so he manages to get everything in order by the time he's 20.

We date for a little at some point while he's doing that, I realize I'm asexual/aromantic so I try to break up with him as gently as possible. We don't talk for a while, but eventually he contacts me again and we become friends. He says he understands the AroAce thing, and that he just wants to be friends, and I agree because at that point I still think he's an all-around cool guy. Sometimes he gets a little too touchy (especially with me not really liking being touched) but I brush it off because it's usually just him standing/sitting too close or maybe at most touching my hair or arm, nothing too bad.

So since he's my only friend in the area (I used to move a lot for Dad's work, and I'm pretty introverted anyway so I don't have any friends beside him and my brothers at all, really) I decide to invite him to a carnival. He accepts the invitation without telling me that he hates everything about carnivals and proceeds to bitch about everything I wanted to do in a super condescending way, treating me like a kid and giving me a superior look whenever I tried asking to do something more than once. It totally ruined the night, which I had been looking forward to for days. I didn't even get to go on any rides, which I specifically texted him that I was the most excited about when I invited him, because he doesn't like them. When I texted him the next day to tell him that he could have declined the invitation, his 'apology' boiled down to 'but I had fun and we don't hang out enough but sorry anyway I guess'.

Looking back without the starry-eyed 'he's going to save me from my childhood' crap, I've realized that the carnival was the first time I've tried to do something I want to do with him, and every other time we always just do whatever he wants to do. That, and because I don't have much life experience and I'm still learning a lot of thing to do with independence, while he's basically been living on his own for a while, he's always so condescending whenever I make a mistake or go slowly with something that I'm only just learning. I had been idealizing him so long that I didn't realize that, when it mattered, he always made me feel like shit.

So suffice to say that I'm not going to move in with him. Question is, how do I tell him that? I know it's going to turn into a confrontation, but not an angry one, a guilt-tripping one, and I just don't have the energy for that between job hunting and fighting really bad depression days.",05Aug2018,2

170,"Hi everyone I was hoping I could get some help figuring out how to fight this issue because I’m becoming desperate.


Let’s start from the top. 


After my dad passed away I ran myself into a fluctuating eating disorder. Firs I started by starving myself. I worked out for two hours a day, ate no more that 600-800 calories a day, and was losing weight faster than my body could keep up. Even then I would look in the mirror and think I was still fat. I was 5’7” and 119 pounds at the time which was nearing underweight.


Soon after I finally fell into depression and anxiety after experiencing denial of my dad’s death. I began to stuff my face every single day. I could eat up to 4,000 or 5,000 calories a day. This could include bread with butter, ice cream, chips, candy, and loads of McDonald’s. I would then go through a vicious cycle of eating and then hating myself.


I don’t gain a lot of weight but I become bloated and disgusted by how large my stomach looks after I binge.


Yes, I do see a therapist and they don’t suggest much about it other than the anti depressants that I already take.


Now I switch between these two horrific forms of body dismorphia and continue to shame myself.


I’m afraid my boyfriend will think I’m ugly and that I will be unattractive.


I’m not trying to be an unhealthy weight, I just want to love myself and learn to eat healthy and exercise regularly so that my body doesn’t have to suffer anymore and neither does my mind.


Every time I start eating healthy and working out I seem to convince myself that it doesn’t matter because I’ll just lose to my urges again anyway. Usually I’ll start off well until I spot a cupcake and I’ll have one just for moderation and then I have zero self control and end up eating four or five of them.


I would love to hear some advice to stop all of this. This stresses me out everyday and I am constantly beating myself up about it.


TLDR: I switch between starving and stuffing myself and I can’t stop.",05Aug2018,1

172,"TL;DR: In a moment of weakness, I gave the ex the only proof I had of the assault and he destroyed it and I was totally manipulated like an idiot. Can I still report it? Can I still get his ass handed to him? Or am I just screwed?

Long story: I dated this guy 3 years ago, and from day one he was cheating on me with an ex of his. [Literally found out on my 25th birthday so fun.] When I found out I was manipulated into it somehow being all my fault because of how I reacted on my birthday [ got blackout drunk and cried. Oh man. So terrible. ] and how I needed to do all these things to change his mind..and like an idiot, I did. Of course, didn't work. I confronted the ex and we started getting the story straight...turns out we weren't the only ones getting played and we were seriously getting played.  He didn't like that I started talking to her and us finding out about everything.... but because he cried in front of me when the ex ran away and cut him out of her life, so I took pity and didn't blast him right then and there either..wanting to see if he would prove himself and maybe reconcile one day or something [ I'm an idiot and believe in people. Just FYI, I'm gonna keep saying a lot. ] I tried to stay away as best as possible to give time and space for both of us, but we had to be around each other since we both were members of a makerspace and co-ran the cosplay groups. One night I crashed at the makerspace, which was against the rules but everyone would do it from time to time due to their projects. I crashed on a futon in this loft the makerspace had. This is important because the camera for in the loft directly looked at the futon. It was the only camera in the space that was ever on any sitting area. I was woken up by the ex, asking if he could crash on the futon with me. Claiming other members had taken up the couches downstairs. I agreed, thinking it was a good thing that he was talking to me again. And not expecting anything like what would happen. The futon rolls out into at least a full and half sized matress. Plenty of space. We both have our own blanket. I go back to sleep and get woken up with fingers on my thighs going underneath my shorts and panties. ...I won't go into super detail, though feel free to DM me if you need the story, but basically I had to fight him off me telling him how confused I was by what he was doing and trying to do, and how we couldn't do that right now and we needed to talk after everything. When I finally got out from under him, I went down stairs and there wasn't a single person down there. We were alone and he knew what he was doing.  He wasn't going to take no for an answer. Not from me. We talked and he convinced me he wanted to be with me again and he had done all this in his sleep and it was just a reaction I gave him, and because at the time I didn't want to accept he was just a terrible person, I forgave him I wanted to believe him. A week later, as I'm literally risking my job to take time off to drive him around after a wreck he had, I catch him texting another girl while he's in my car. And this goes back and forth. This is when I break, honestly. I confront with what I want to do which is go to the police, file a report, blast him in the maker community so he doesn't have a chance to hurt anyone again. I ask him what he wants me to do, does he want to do this or does he want to work things out on my terms [ terms I didn't really have and honestly still don't. I don't know how this can be fixed now. ] He begs me not to do anything. And tries to convince me there's no way I could...so I ask a friend that was on the member board for the tape of the incident. At the time I was scared to complain to the board about it because I was scared I would be in trouble for sleeping at the space. I kept in my car for months trying to decide if I wanted to ruin this guys life, all the while finding out this isn't his only incident, that he has harassed at least 5 other women [ and counting ] and cheated multiple times all the while playing this victim mentality of how everyone hurts him and he does nothing wrong. I made the mistake of every single time I was at the police office, of telling him I was there and what I was about to do. Every time he made a promise to change, to get better, to make things right with me. All the while the PTSD from all of this manipulation, and mental abuse came crashing down and I was pretty alienated from my friends at this point because I let them down by constantly letting this guy in. One night he followed me around a convention, begging me not to go to the police and asked for the tape, wanted a token of my faith in him and I gave it because I wanted to still believe. [Have I mentioned how much of an idiot I am?] ... This kind of only wanting me around to pay for things, drive around, be there when he was lonely, and never fixing a damn thing or apologizing for a damn thing ever happened and when I poked things blew up. And I would go to my coping mecinism. I got severely depressed. I ruined my life to try to give this monster every bit of hope and faith and trust I had. I tore myself apart to keep him afloat and I don't even know why...until something happened. I don't know what. But he tells me I'm a terrible person, and I tried to do something to him and I need to stay away. I don't know what I'm being blamed for now. And at this point I don't care. I just want my power back. And I know that means finally reporting this, and naming this person. But I don't know if it's feasible at this point. I don't know what to do to protect other girls and protect myself at this point. Do I just leave the community and leave my passion? Or do I try to report it and possibly get painted as a ""crazy ex-crying wolf"" ...I don't have the proof anymore. I'm an idiot.",05Aug2018,5

174,"Hey yall,

Need some advice because ive never been in a situation like this before.

I live with three of my friends (including my cousin) and have been doing so for the last 3 years. Im real good friends with one of my room mates and of coarse my cousin but the other house mate i'm just not as good friends with. We are still friends (or so i thought) but just not as tight with him as i am with the others.

so last night i received pretty confronting Facebook message from him, this is what is said: ""Hi Name, Look, i have to type this out or it'll never get said...whatever you think of me I can tell you your judgements are wrong. please don't talk to me from your limited perception and project whatever story you tell yourself onto me. You will never see through my eyes, and the way you treat me never brings out the best. You talk to me like I don't exist and I've finally found a way to say fuck you and be diplomatic about it. You do you and leave me be. I'm glad for your every success, even though you've spent years ignoring mine. recognise that from my perspective it's nothing new. I'm doing what's good for me at this point in time. Understand it's not all about you, Boii xo""

I know you guys don't know me and are just taking my word for it but this is completely not my character to do what he said i do and im always supportive of what he does, it very much caught me off guard and made me feel pretty damn shitty. This house mate can be very in his head sometimes and get into all sorts of bad moods at seemingly the drop of a hat (he smoke a fair bit of weed on and off so not sure if it has something to do with that).

Ive reached out to my mum and my cousin on advice for what i should do in this situation and they gave some pretty good advise. when i get home later, im going to pull him aside and have a chat to him about it because i feel like it has to be done and some things need to be cleared up. I'm going to tell him that that i'm sorry he feels this way and i didnt realise that he was feeling like this. it was never my intention to make him feel uncomfortable or unhappy and I'm sorry that i have done so. He didn't mention what exactly ive done so maybe ill ask that as well.

Anyway i would love to hear if you guys have incounted something similar or have any advise for me also. i hate this confronting situations but i think you have to confront them to get a resolve.

176,"So I'm 19 years old and all my life I haven't really known what I have wanted to do. I always wanted to do something that gets me a comfortable living, like accounting or other white collar jobs,
But those sorts of jobs always seemed really boring and complex.
So 6 months ago I got a job in retail and although I can't stand it my store manager is a great man, he always tells me that there are just somethings that we can't do. Like for example his brother works some really complicated and high paying job, my store manager says straight up that he would never be able to do something like that, it's just not him.

I spoke to my dad about stuff like this in the past and he always says to do something you enjoy, not something that will get you the most money.
When I told my store manager he instantly agreed and said that I should follow my desires while knowing my limits.

I'm not a natural mathematician (I'm not cartoon dumb but I'm not going to be able to be a good accountant) I have always enjoyed prehistory and wildlife in general. I would watch nature documentaries all day long when I was younger, I just never saw any sort of job in that sector. After all there can only be so many zookeepers etc.

But I found this great looking course at a uni in wales called international wildlife biology. It seems to be the closest I can get to truly enjoying what I study, that being said I don't yet meet the entry requirements so I would have to take a gap year due to the penny only recently dropping (I didn't yet understand the concept that no one will come to save me from a lifetime of minimum wage other than myself, so I just did nothing at school)

I decently understand that stuff takes proper hard work if I ever want to make something out of myself.

But I still have doubts over this course as I'm not sure where it will lead me. What I was banking on was learning about completely new jobs as I studied due to new contacts and networking.

Am I making a mistake here or is my mindset completely wrong to go to university",05Aug2018,1
177,"Disclaimer for mods: I know that asking help for health issues isn't allowed, but this has more to do with getting the person the proper treatment rather than making him deal with it himself.

tldr: This person I know from Hungary has been under psychosis for three days and I have no idea how to get him a psychiatrist, I am 1000km away. I have his real name, a social media profile, the 1mil+ pop city he lives in, his age, 85 minutes of voice convo recorded on tape as proof. What do?

I believe this was caused by sleep deprivation + stress from new workplace.

Two days ago (around 18h into the episode because he has had it before and it had always subsided in a matter of hours), I was on voice chat with him and I made him do various things that might grab the attention of his parents - I told him to go look his father in the eyes (the 60 year old boomer was apparently clueless) and after that I told him to confront his brother about a thing he hallucinated the brother doing (he lives away). He called his brother and the brother said that he's going to come over tomorrow. He refused to do things like ""tell your dad you need help"" so I had to be creative. Also tried to get his brother's email, refused. I knew the brother works in IT and isn't tech illiterate so I got my friend to send the brother a base64 message saying ""HELP UR BRO"", at least I was told he sent it.

Yesterday I waited for the brother to come over and he was noticeably a bit more upset, mentions of suicide and killing people came up. I once defused a suicidal spiral really well but those continued later. He mentioned how he told his mother he's suicidal and his mother wouldn't believe him. In the evening he said he's gonna go talk to his mother and never came back for the entire night. He went from AFK to online very briefly and never replied to messages I or our mutual friend sent him, and shortly after he went offline (he never does this, always keeps computer running at night). I assumed his brother arrived and started taking action by pulling the cord first and foremost.

This morning he comes back on and said nothing fucking happened. His brother didn't bother to come over at all. At first he wrote really coherent things about negative existential realisations and his past, and after I offered my somewhat lengthy response he went full 180 again and could only comment on my fast writing speed, and the same parade resumed. I asked if he's still suicidal (the existential text made me go hmmm) and he just said there's a window behind the curtain, which immediately made me say ""let it be"".

His parents obviously don't give a fuck, brother is a smooth brain who 99% saw incoherent rambling in texts and still didn't do anything. All the people I know who knew him IRL are 1000km away just like I am, but in the opposite cardinal direction. The family obviously sees something is off, if he keeps speaking in word salad to me there's no way he's not doing this to other people. I have been under so much stress over this for 3 days now, I can no longer eat or sleep from the fucking anxiety. I'll snap myself if I have to deal with this bullshit any longer.",05Aug2018,1

186,"My family sucks, I've come to terms with that, but I'm getting to a new level of fed up. 

My dad is getting pretty old, and my mom is disabled, so I help my mom out with rides to the doctors or I'll come by to cook if she's too tired to. I'm always fine with helping her with anything from laundry to cleaning to food shopping, since she needs the help, but my father on the other hand is basically an agent of chaos. 

I get shit from my brother and sister who both live 1,000's of miles away from them for not ""helping"" my dad out enough, but helping my dad wouldn't do anything. 

For instance, my fathers house has a bunch of birds in the attic, and  the door to the attic (which is one of those ones in the ceiling) is now always open since he removed the mechanism that keeps it in place, the ground underneath it is covered in bird shit. That is a problem that he created because he removed the locking mechanism and now their house is covered in bird shit. 

He also leaves the door to his basement wide open all day for his cat to come in and out as she please, the problem with this is now there are a million fucking bugs in the basement since they live in a suburb and the trash is right next to the bulkhead door. 

Along with the bugs, he also removed the gutters on his house and now his basement regularly has water in it whenever it rains. He also refuses to turn on the dehumidifier since it uses ""too much energy"" so on top of bugs, he now has a terrible mold problem and it's suffocating to walk into the basement and probably dangerous. 

His finances are also retarded, and his car breaks down every few months because he refuses to get it properly fixed and just does cheap patch jobs that hardly ever last. 


I'm pretty sure my time would be better spent pissing on a dumpster fire than actually trying to fix the wake of destruction he leaves after he touches basically anything. 

He's the pinnacle of incompetence and I can't bring myself to feel bad for him anymore because it almost feels like he's intentionally being an idiot. He's destroying his only solid investment (his house) and apparently I'm the asshole because I'm not actively preventing him from being a fucking idiot. 

The worst part is that he is an unapologetic asshole as well, and I can't stand talking to him for more than a few sentences because he always makes threats or tries to give me advice in fields he has literally no knowledge in.

187,"so i live in a unit with a good friend of mine, and recently her best friend (i suppose a friend of mine too since i met him through her) has moved in with us as he's between living arrangements. he stayed with me for a month recently while my housemate was overseas, and then in a sublet (air bnb type thing) for another month before having to leave and move back here. obviously while my housemate was away he just took her room, so i had no problem with them making their own arrangements and me paying my half of rent while we split the bills evenly. however now, the situation is a little more complex - he shares her bed most nights but when my housemate's boyfriend comes to visit (this is a whole other drama) he's down on the couch. this unit is not exactly huge, and the 'lounge' is practically one big room downstairs that the front door opens so you're very much 'in the way' trying to live out of a suitcase down there.

now, this guy is practically useless - he leaves for work at about 7 and isn't home until about 10 - so there is no contribution on his part to cleaning, cooking, groceries or any other chore you can think of.  on the off chance he did washing, it would be drying inside on the stairs until you folded it up for him. at the same time, he has never once cooked  (i'm not exaggerating when i say he orders take away delivery every night). while he is not really around enough to make a mess, when he does it will be lying around for a day before we just clean it up for him. 

so my question is, how much should i expect him to contribute? am i being too kind if i just let him and my housemate split her half of the rent, or too greedy if i expect to save money too - given some nights he is taking up the lounge room - and given under the stairs and any spare storage space in the kitchen is filled with boxes of his junk?",05Aug2018,1

195,"TL;DR: My girlfriend of 1 year is unhappy and doesn't want to talk about it (I think because she doesn't understand exactly what's wrong either), and I don't know what to do.

Some background about myself (20M, Belgium) and the relationship: I've been really depressed and suicidal until two years or so ago. It changed when I went to university, lived in a different city, and met new friends. About 1.5 years ago, I met my now girlfriend, and she was the first one I could really open up to about my problems and depression. At that point, the depression was behind me, and I really started to enjoy life again.  
It may be important to note that this is my first relationship.
We have our differences, and the necessary discussions, however, we both worked hard to make this work, and we care a lot about each other.

I noticed something was off when we both came back from holidays about two weeks ago. Due to time zone differences etc., we didn't talk that much, and I assume that the 1 year milestone got her thinking about our relationship.
She didn't want to talk as much, there was no intimacy, etc.
So I asked her if she was happy: ""I don't know. I should be.""
She then told me she felt as if she needed to be my ""lifeline"", that she always had to be happy out of fear of making me depressed again, she felt that she's loosing herself in trying to keep me happy. She didn't tell me about this before, because she only just discovered she has been feeling this way. 
I don't think that she needs to try to keep me happy. I'm much stronger now, I have good friends I can open up to, etc. And she genuinely makes me happy.

One of the difficult points in our relationship is that I don't like going out and drinking, and she sometimes feels that she wants to go out, but she doesn't do it because of me. I think this has improved a great deal since we started dating, but she still feels that she misses out because of me, I think.

The problem now is that she doesn't want to talk about how she feels right now. If we do talk about it, it's all vague, her reasons seem to change, which makes me believe that she doesn't know whats wrong either. I asked her if it's me who makes her sad, and she said she doesn't know. (I think this was a genuine 'I don't know', and not one to save me from the truth.)

I have no idea what I should do. It would be so easy if she knew what was wrong. If I am the reason she's unhappy, I'd want her to be happy and end the relationship on more or less good terms. If I'm not the reason, or if I can work on it, I want to do anything to help her, because I love her and I've struggled too.  
But it's just impossible if she doesn't open up to me.
When we meet and do things together, everything seems to be alright, but when we get tired or start talking about serieus things, the mood is just bad, her smile fades, and she barely talks.

I'm looking for some advice on how to handle the situation. Should I just focus on doing fun activities together, and let her figure it out herself? Should I leave her some space? Should I try to talk about it? I feel terrible being unable to help, and not knowing what's going on with our relationship.

I told her that I wanted to stay and that we could do long distance and she kept getting angry. Then when I said I'd come with her, I was very upset for my pets, and it felt so forced. Her house in the states is a 2 bedroom house and there would be 6 people living there if I went. Her grandma sleeps on the couch. I feel guilty.

An ambulance did not come as there were worse matters to deal with, Before she got drunk I said we were in a toxic relationship and I thiought that it's best that we end it and she gets help from her family.

I was out with a friend for drinks last night; she saw me open a snapchat from him and immediately asked ‘why is Mark texting you, he has a girlfriend.’

Of course my answer was ‘No, WTF?!’ and I got the story about how her friend is the gf’s best friend, and by proxy friends with Mark. They’re both extremely unhappy together but refuse to break up. The gf is apparently ‘nuts’ but I didn’t want to know any more so didn’t ask.

I feel so betrayed. He’s told me a lot of personal stuff but has somehow omitted telling me he has a live-in girlfriend of 5 years. He’s crushed my self respect. And whilst I’m quite happy having a grown up relationship with someone from my work, if this story gets out it could be extremely damaging depending on how it’s slanted.

206,"Everything is happening so quickly.

I have had anxiety and depression all of my adult life. For a couple of years, up until maybe 2 months ago, it wasn't acting up. I thought I was better.

I currently live overseas for work and about 3 months ago I met an amazing man. I have never fallen in love so quickly. He also has depression and anxiety so I knew if it flared up, he would be understanding.

1 month into the the relationship, my grandpa died, I lost my wallet, and I made the huge decision to stay at my current job and not move home (all within a week). Making the decision to stay must have triggered me. I hate decision making. 

From then until now I have been super anxious and depressed. Living abroad, he was all I had. I know I can't depend on people for my own problems... but that's easier said than done. 

He broke up with me this weekend because he couldn't handle it anymore. He thought I didnt trust him. I really did but he just couldn't believe it. 

Now obviously this break up hurts more than anything as I have no family or true friends here. I am scared to be alone so I'm moving back home. Breaking my contract that I JUST signed for work. 

I feel empty and worthless. He claims to still love me but obviously he didnt care enough to try to be with me as I was continuously making progress. This has set me back so much and I'm losing so much money... flights are expensive! I hate big changes and my life is COMPLETELY changing. 

Even though my depression came back, I was happy for the most part. Now I just feel not good enough and worthless.

207,"Hi! So I'm a 20 y.o. student who has saved a little bit of money from past part-time jobs and scholarships. My parents both know this and while my dad is chill about it my mom seems to not realize that my money isn't her money. She has borrowed money (a couple hundred bucks) from my bank account with my permission a couple times, which I didn't care about because she asked me beforehand and I knew she would pay it back pretty quickly.

Now I've realized it too late but the way she views my bank account has become very warped, and it's partially my fault. About half a year ago I noticed on one of my bank statements that she took out 2k without my permission which surprised me. I confronted her about this with my dad and she laughed it off saying she would pay me back with some interest. While I made sure she knew this wasn't okay I let her off thinking she would pay me back quickly. She never did and has only paid back about half the amount she borrowed. I remind her occasionally but honestly didn't want to push it as I know my family isn't the best off financially.

Now my grandmother has moved in from a different country and she has a lot of money. Whenever we visit the family in our country we stay at her house and she pays for most of the things we need there. I don't have the best relationship with her and my mom hates this and harasses me over this. This morning I started talking to my mom when out of the blue she says to me ""Hey your grandma needs 2k and she'll pay you back when she goes back home next year and even double it!"" This got me really pissed and I refused as she agreed to lend MY money without me being present and she snapped over this. I had a feeling this might happen as she had been bragging to everyone she could talk to about my scholarship money over the summer but I never really did anything about this despite how uncomfortable it made me feel, which I now regret. She yelled at me and told me to move out if I didn't like her way and wasn't willing to support my family.

To be honest I don't even think I was really mad about the money, it was about the fact that my mom is now treating my money as her money fully. As I was in the middle of writing this I started speaking with my dad a bit when she barged into my room, yelled at me even more, and even hit my face. Now she's yelling at my dad in his room for defending me and I'm just scared because she'll break my doors if I lock them but if I keep them unlocked I think she'll either hit me or break my possessions.

How should I deal with this situation without ruining my relationship? I know I should immediately remove her from my bank account but other than that I'm pretty damn lost. I don't think I have enough money to safely move out and I don't want to put a burden on my dad (who is pretty willing to support me if I do move out)

*TLDR*: Let my mom borrow some money occasionally, situation escalates over time and now she takes me for granted. Don't really know how to deal with this situation.",05Aug2018,1
208,"20F here. Throwaway for several reasons. I need your opinions here guys, this is important to me because I'm not sure it's the beginning of depression or just stress. Opinions, experiences, advices, all very much welcome so that I can see clearly.

For the last two years I've made some wrong decisions, hung out with wrong people etc. since I left home for college. I managed to got out of that toxic environment but when I look around, there isn't anyone that I can have a real friendship so it's mostly basically I and my SO. That is actually pretty cool, we've been together for 2 years and we share mostly the same interests, so time we spend is really valuable and I love him.

A little while ago he emotionally cheated on me, when I was already stressed about exams, not being able to visit my family, financial problems and problems with the roommate. He regrets doing that, is sincerely sorry and we're trying to work things out. 

In the meantime I passed the exams, moved into a new place and got a job, which were the advancements in my life after a very stressful process but it didn't feel any good. That's when it hit me, that I'm not enjoying these positive results like I would used to do.

I am basically going to list here what I've been observing about myself.

#1. I can't fall asleep for hours. When I do, I have very much of a difficulty waking up. I just run through thoughts when I get into bed and can never shake them off.

#2. Nightmares. For the past 2 months I've seen more nightmares than I've seen in my entire life. I wake up screaming or out of breath sometimes.

#3. I just don't have the energy to do any housework at all. I get annoyed when I can't find a clean plate and have to wash one.

#4. I'm getting aggresive. As I mentioned in #3, I get easily annoyed for the littlest things but most of the time I put on a smiling face and keep it to myself.

#5. I just start crying for no obvious reason. I don't even know beforehand that I'm going to. I just feel sad, cry for a while and then turn back to normal.

#6. For like half an hour in 2-3 days I feel super cheerful, making jokes and stuff. Then I just shut back down again all of a sudden.

#7. I have a history of self harm. I used to cut myself 5-6 years ago. I didn't have any thoughts of it ever since, until recently I only thought about what my emotional state was back then. Like, I must have felt worse than this. And that noone should ever do it to themselves, we're worth more than that. I thought of it in a condemning way but I would be lying if I say it never crossed my mind.

#8. As I mentioned earlier, I don't have much of a social circle. All my close friends are back home and I don't have many people to talk to here. Actually, none except for my SO and he's been trying to help but it doesn't seem to be helping more than slightly.

#9. I have a stressful job but who doesn't? Just noting that to give you guys the full context.

#10. I've lost my appetite. It could be because of the heat, I'm not sure it's emotional, but I can't seem to finish the plate anymore.

#11. I guess this is the most important one. I don't feel like myself sometimes. There are obvious mood swings but beside that I'm just not acting like myself. I forget things, care less, honestly sometimes provoke my SO into an argument. I don't know why. Then I remember all the energy it takes to remember, care or argue and give it all up.

I've seen a therapist once, may see him next week too. He said there have been many events in my life that could easily stress me out and doesn't think I'm in a bad place, I just need some time to myself, maybe get back to meditation &amp; yoga and clear my head. But since our appointment, after I clear my head I get new stuff that needs to be cleared. This has been lasting for a week I guess. Everyday I clear my head of some negative thought and then I get a new one.

Plus, he is only one person. I thought I could use different points of view on this. So, hit me. Anything will be appreciated and thank you in advance.

TL;DR: I've been experiencing some negative events in my life and I think my behaviour is changed towards almost everything. Losing sleep &amp; appetite, having nightmares, getting aggresive and lazy, crying suddenly for no reason and having mood swings. Also stressful job and very small social circle. Need opinions/advice/experience if anyone also had this happened.",05Aug2018,1

210,I just ran away from home about 10 minutes ago and I'm crying from writing this. I'm emotionally exhausted and I can't deal with anything right now and I don't know what to do.

211,"I'll give you a little backstory. I left home after I turned 18 near the end of 2016 because my mother rejected me over my sexuality. I moved in with my brother to get my life sorted out. Since then I got myself a full time job in IT, started Uni doing my bachelor of S.E. remotely. I also see my boyfriend every weekend and we have a strong relationship. I also moved out in uni accommodation which has benefited my independence.  


My problem is I still feel inadequate despite what I've achieved. I'm not financially struggling anymore, I am surrounded by great people, and I am studying what I love. But I don't know what's missing. I came from being depressed and miserable to being depressed and miserable with great things going on for myself. I could be rich and famous and still feel this way and it wouldn't make a difference!  


I don't expect answers that are going to solve the problem, but I would appreciate different perspectives as to how I may approach life differently. Maybe my values are incorrect? I have a hunch it's because I've had been in a situation that has been unsatisfying, hence why I've put effort into my life to put me where I am now. Still not sure.

217,"My father isn’t fond of White people at all. We’re Black. He says they are the most evil people on the planet. I’m going off to university soon. The university I’m attending has a high White student body. There are no Historically Black colleges in my state. My father tells me, “Be careful around those White people.” My roommate is going to be White. My father tells me to make sure you sleep with one eye open. He doesn’t want me to become best friends with my roommate because he doesn’t want me to have a White best friend. He's highly encouraging me to befriend other Black students at school. He tells me, ""Make sure you make a lot of Black friends. You're a Black man never forget that.""

Everytime I go out with my father, he always talks crap about White people. He says things like “Most of them are racist, they’re crazy, they’re evil, they’re weird, they’re annoying, etc.” He HATES seeing Black and White couples. He always talks crap about interracial relationships. He calls Black people dating White people, “Stupid, sellouts, colorblind, etc.” It’s honestly making me scared to go to university because I’m going to have a White roommate and I’m going to be surrounded by Whites. We live in a majority Black city. I’ve never interacted with White people on a personal level, so I don't know what to expect.

219,"So me and my partner are both 23(Im older by 4 months) and we have a daughter(1) together. 

We are also getting married in 6 weeks time.

Well our situation is that she works 32 hours a week as a pot washer and veg preparation at a restaurant and apparently she really enjoys it.

Im a checkout operator doing 15 hours a week and I hate it. This also makes me the main carer,especially since we can't afford childcare and have very few options of family members since they also all work.

We both suffer with depression(I am able to deal with it better than her). She came up to me and said whilst she is happy to be back at work she still feels that she wants to accomplish more and going to college a day a week could be an option. She would like to be a mental health nurse or something of the sort.

I'm exactly the same,since I only work 15 hours a week that I hate and can't really find a decent job that I would like since my flexibility is limited and my qualifications aren't great. I wanted to work with companies dealing with website design and security, and eventually running my own business. 

I can't do that since I haven't got the qualifications and can't even build my own computer designed for this sort of thing in the house since there isn't any room according to my partner,I tried to convince her otherwise but I have to wait till we move to another place,which by looks of things it will be another year. This has killed my motivation to do anything.

I just don't know what to do at this point. I may end up being unemployed at the end of the month anyway if my employer won't agree to a flexibility contract,which I have been asking since March.

220,"I’m 18 and American and about to go to university in a few weeks. 

Through my life I’ve rarely gotten that close to people. I’ve maintained a lot of light friendships. People tend to really like me, I tend to really like people, but I just don’t get close to them. But recently I’ve been starting to change that. I’m trying to have better less distant relationships with my parents, I have a friend whose pretty close I’d say, we’ve been friends for a bit but now are really starting to be really good friends, and I’ve started to do more with and talk more with other friends of mine. 

So there you go that’s my background info. My issue is that I don’t know how to talk to people about serious things. When you hold light friendships with 100 people in a 300 person high school you are constantly switching between projects and people doing light things, comedic and fun things. But I’ve been told by my parents for a while, and now by my best friend, and I can see it with my other friends, that I always speak like I’m disconnected from whatever is being talked about. Like I never speak about things like I’m truly feeling emotions. 

Now I believe them and want to change this, but I have no idea what that looks like. What the hell do I do to work on this? My whole life I was either surrounded by elementary/middle school nerds or too many people to learn these skills, I don’t know what I’m doing wrong, I just known doing something wrong and that just dipping out and not talking about serious things again is the wrong approach. 

So what can I do to start talking like a normal person? Everybody just tells me I’m doing it wrong, but I never get examples of what to try. I at least want to fake it till I make it as the saying goes.

223,"This is quite out of character for me, I typically tell myself I can deal with anything by myself, but it seems that over the past few months this has just been getting worse not better.

So I guess I began to notice the effects of whatever the underlying issue is several months ago now when I was finishing up highschool. At first it just started with being kicked from the messenger group (in our group we did this sort of often as a joke, but then added the person again, so at first I thought nothing of it). Then, the friend group that I had ever since fifth grade started to plan their events/gathetings without me intentionally. It started with them talking about the event (everyone else clearly already invited etc) in front of me, then I would ask and they would invite me half heartedly, then progressed to the gathering happening without me knowing about it, then they would talk about future gatherings in front of me and openly say I'm not invited. 

When we talked or whatever though, nothing changed, and it sort of still felt like we were friends. I sometimes tried to make new group chats or arrange events but everyone would decline to come/choose not to participate in the group chat which included me. 

I was admittedly annoying quite frequently as a joke, but if anyone ever showed any signs of not seeing it the same way (not laughing or any frustration) I would stop immediately. For a while I thought this might have been the reason  that my friendships seemed to be deteriorating so I stopped all together for roughly a month, but all my friends apparently found this even worse and said it was ""weird"" that I wasn't being my usual self and got frustrated with me about it so I reverted.

Towards the end of highschool they sort of said that they hope I found friends where I was moving (only one of them was coming to the same place). It was sort of like in the movies where your parent wants you to do well when you move out, so they are willing to help you and everything, but they definitely want you to move out, except the house was the friend group. When highschool finished I didn't hear from any of them in months except to ask me for my final exam scores and that was only do they'd know if they beaten me. They have all kept in touch except me.

The other day (after roughly 8 months) the one who moved to the same place as me approached me (I didn't even know he was there, he came up behind me), said hi, and then talked to me like we were still best friends for like an hour, and then we both went our separate ways. (I tried to reach out to him several times since we have been here but he declined opportunities to meet/talk). He pretty much documented the whole conversation on the group chat so I guess the group has some sort of interest in me just not being friends. (I play video games with one member of my old friend group, but if I don't go on I won't hear from him, and if he's not on for a while and I try to reach out he isn't interested.) 

The obvious result of all this is that I need to find new friends, so when I first moved here (way before the run in with the person from school), I set out to make new friends at uni. I have conversed with lots of people, found people with which I share hobbies, interests, world views, career directions etc, and we have great conversations, end on good terms, might even meet up once or twice outside uni, but then our interest typically fades very quickly and then we stop meeting. We are still friendly and everything when we see each other, we just don't really ""click"" and when we try and meet up it just ends up being sort of boring/awkward and I don't know how to improve that situation.

It seems like most people's really strong friendships/effective socialising revolves around drinking, and I do not drink. I don't like the way it tastes or how it makes me feel. Maybe it's just not possible to form strong friendships without drinking anymore? I don't know.

Something that has been said to me quite a bit is that I ""think I'm better than everyone else"". People have been telling me this ever since I was very young, and it's people from all different relationships. So, through my life I have tried to address this, when ever I have a differing view from anyone else if I have offered my perspective and they disagree I will take their side and agree with them, I don't mention any achievements/positives about myself in conversation, I pay close attention to other people's achievements/strong points and compliment them and try to be as nice to everyone as possible. 

Still, today at work one of my colleagues, who has only ever been around me after I implemented all of the above, still told me (in a light hearted sort of way, but still the message was sincere) that I think I'm better than everyone else, and I don't really know anything that I have done or said that would give someone that impression. The only time I mention anything good about myself is if I am asked a question point blank that I couldn't reasonably avoid, and even then I say it like I'm practically ashamed of it.

I don't know what to do, or how to improve. It feels like I'm doomed to a life of acting friends who only want to know me on a superficial level to avoid any awkwardness in public, but having no real friends who genuinely want to spend time with me or want to share anything about themselves with me. I have tried everything from being vulnerable and telling people about parts of my life that I don't like to share to satisfy their interest, telling people next to nothing in order to not over share and every shade of the spectrum inbetween.

227,"Long story short...


When I was 15 years old I became increasingly more religious and decided that I would leave high school and enroll in a Hasidic Yeshiva. I spent one year in a boarding school in the United States and I had a great experience, but since I was from a non Hasidic and non religious family, I experienced a significant amount of taunting and isolation. The first year was fine because I did not let anything bother me since I was just so happy to be doing what I wanted to always do, which was delve deeper into my faith. The second year I spent in Israel at a Yeshiva in a very religious neighborhood and it was even better than the first year. I was the best student in my class even though I was not Israeli. I worked extra hard and put in long hours to grasp the language and advanced skills the Israeli students already had by virtue of being Israeli. The next year in Israel (my third year overall) commenced and a new class of younger students entered the school. There were a group of them that hated being in Yeshiva, presumably they were there because their parents wanted them to be there. In the middle of winter, I started noticing that my belongings in my room were being cut by someone. First it was my pillow that was slashed to bits. The next day my winter coat was sliced up. I told the Rabbis but they did not really pay attention. I had to lock up all my things with a lock, but anything that was left out was fair game to the cutter and my suitcase was slashed to bits the next day. The rabbis still did not pay attention and the situation led to me leaving that yeshiva and going back to the US, to a yeshiva whose standards were much lower and eventually expelled me for speaking out against some abuse that I saw there. When I was leaving Israel, they asked me who I *thought* did the cutting and I said I did not know, but that there were just a group of younger kids who were acting sketchy. I did not know what happened to them. Many years went by, I enrolled in university and ended up embarking on a different path, studying a STEM field, getting married, having kids, building my own life and career. I get a call six years after the cutting incident and it’s a student from the yeshiva who called me to tell me that it was him that cut up all my stuff. He said he actually was trying to get my room mate’s stuff but made a miscalculation. He said he had been feeling guilty for all these years and had to tell me the truth. I just forgave him, but I am always wondering what would have been, could have been, etc. I was a really passionate Yeshiva student and my career in Jewish Studies was basically castrated because of this experience. I’m still involved in Judaism in my private life, but that incident really changed things. 

Any advice in regards to how to process all this? I got the call like a month ago. ",05Aug2018,1

231,"It's been about a year that I'm struggling to force myself to get productive but it just doesn't seem to happen. I don't know the root of this problem but I know I used to be able to fight it. However, these past few months, with all the crisis going on, sometimes it seems pointless to even try to fight it.

ever-since childhood, I used to be a productive person, making time-tables for each day of my life and sticking to it. I used to value time above everything else and make use of every moment. 

when I was 16 years old, I hit a rock and stopped being productive for a while. I spent an entire year on online gaming (diablo and WoW). being home-schooled, I didn't have to go out so I cut all my social ties, stopped responding to all my friends and limited my life to gaming. 

But after a year, I put a stop to all this and started getting productive again. I began studying and got into the best university in my country. but everything went downhill from there...

The first two years of university, I could feel myself getting drained again (University wasn't hard, I don't know what it was that was draining my energy). but still, I didn't lose it completely and for the first two years, I had episodes of being productive and episodes of not caring about anything except for my fun. 

Right now, I have finished my third year. The start of the third year was when I really hit rock bottom. I studied just enough to pass with good grades. I worked just enough to have money for weed and alcohol. I stopped reading books. I cut many social ties (not all of them cause it's not possible at this age). I spent all this year by having sexual conquests and trying boys after boys. It was like this time gaming was replaced by sex.


All this time, I've been enjoying life, A LOT, but at the same time, there's a constant nagging voice inside me, blaming me and shaming me for not using my time. but there's also a counter voice, replying to the first voice: ""So what?! what if I spend my days by enjoying life?!"".

 These voices argue a lot but the second voice always wins cause it keeps reminding me that everything in my country (Iran) is so messed up right now that I better enjoy life before the arrival of the inevitable disasters that are on the way. In my mind, I had planned on having fun till the end of March. April was supposed to be the start of my return to productive life. but that's when all the crisis started happening and that's when the voice that guilts me into getting back to being useful, lost all its touch. 

Still, sometimes I wonder if I'm using the promise of these upcoming disasters as an excuse not to start being productive. and yet sometimes I wonder that even if these are excuses, what if they're actually legit excuses... when I know there's at least a definite massive civil unrest on the way, should I not spend these last few months of comfort on the simple yet unforgettable pleasures of flesh?

Anyway... I have two questions for you; the good people of Reddit.

A. If you lived in a country where you knew something bad is about to happen very soon and there's nothing to do about it but wait, would you spend this waiting period by working and studying?

Let me tell you why I feel this way. This company is a start up company that opened up the facility in July of 2016 and I’ve been here since the day it opened. I’m the only employee besides management that still works here from that time. I’ve done so many things to help this company. I’ve even worked a 24 hour shift, never left the warehouse one time for the duration, I’ve trained many many many people who come in and out of this building. I’ve even trained people who are in management at this point. 

All of this time and I still have only gotten one $1 raise since I’ve been here. People who I’ve taught how to do everything here are making more money than me, people who work in my area who I have to constantly correct make more than me. They just did a round of raises and gave everyone in my area except me a raise. I’m almost 100% my supervisor hates me which is why this is happening. Every lead talks shit about me to employees like 75% are not my friends and won’t tell me? Every time something goes wrong in my area I’m blamed for it. I’m the only person who knows what my job takes (none of management has ever done my job before) yet they keep telling me what it takes and how to do it properly. I’ve been over looked for inventory positions multiple times just for them to hire someone from the outside. There’s many more things but this post is getting too long already. 

If you’ve read this far this is my point. I really want to quit my job but it’s so easy. Everything is so easy to do. But on the flip side I hate my life working here. I dread coming to work in the morning and I’m afraid if I quit I’ll be even more miserable someone where else. And on top of that I live with my parents who count on me to pay bills. If anything I can just go back to a temp service that I was at before and have a job the next day. What should I do? I’m so lost. ",05Aug2018,3

A lot of the time I lose contact with the friends I've made when I'm away from home because I get too sad to talk to them because they're not there anymore. Also, I don't want to be sad knowing they're not physically there, and then I just don't talk to them anymore.

Hey guys. Ever since a young age, I've always had a terrifying fear of what's behind me. When I was around 6 or 7, I'd look over my shoulder ever few seconds. When I was 8, I told my parents, and they let me get these sunglasses with mirrors on the the edges that I could see in my peripheral vision. After about 2 years of basically wearing them everywhere in public, I just stopped. Cut ahead a few years to when I got a headset. I always have worn it with just the left side on, because when I wear both, I feel very ""exposed"" for lack of a better term. After many years of wearing headsets, I tried wearing both sides last night. I immediately started looking around the room. I'd look at the door literally every 5 seconds. When I tried to resist my urge to look around the room and at the door, I'd basically start trembling and feeling like someone was standing over me. Is this normal? Does anyone else experience this?

245,"Hey!
(Sorry for my English, I'm from Norway lol)


So I need help to refresh my mindset, need help to be able to think more on my own again. This due to that I feel lost in the society, very lost. I want to start my life over again, if that makes more sence.

So I am a 23 year old girl. I am ambitious, interested in A LOT and hardworking. This year I studied nursing school and retook subjects on the side to start medicine school this semester. But I ruined my health by doing so, I got depressed. 

So earlier I studied psychology for one year, and that was what made me want to study medicine. But it didn't work out the way I wanted. 

I feel so old, as well as I feel like I never can fulfill anything or that I always gets lost. I am scared to take a new step to start studying something new. What should I think and do?

So I have always been very interested in writing, and one of my big dreams is to write a book. But I want to aim for a higher education as well, because I love studying and learning new things. After I aimed for studying medicine, I realiced I am not that good at math nor at practical doings. Sooo I am not really sure I want to do health care in that way anymore, I for instance hated nursing school as it wasn't for me.

But I have a big interest in human beings, I love charity work and action aids. This one semester I worked at Red Cross and I loved it!! But I have low self esteem and it makes me think I can't do anything with my life... Due to that I got depressed I decided to take one year off, to figure things out and to find myself again(??). But I need to find out what to do with my life. I want study, but I need to be sure about my next step. 

But I think about studying law school or journalism. I don't have so much experiences with law school and I am therefore not sure to pursue it. What if I end that school as well?? I am so scared. And if I study law, is it possible to work abroad after graduating? In addition I feel like my self esteem is way to low to study law, but I love working with myself/ challenging myself and I hope that I can ""get there""/ become who I wanna be one day... I love human beings and I interact really good with others, but I'm just not sure....

What should I think or do? I'm not sure if this text makes any sence, but do any of you guys have any advice or experiences? 

To sum it up. I feel old and after quitting two studies I feel lost in life. I have lots of interests, but I can't find a way to fulfill myself or to be happy with anything. Some of these issues is based on me being depressed, so I am taking a year off. So now I am interested in hearing experiences or if some of you have any suggestions. Especially I am interested in hearing if some of you know anything about law or journalism, or whether I should pursue it or not. 

So I'm just publishing this even though I am not sure if my message is getting through. 

Thank you in advance.

246,"Hello,
My fiancé of 3 years recently left me after I moved with him to his home country and he had promised to file a spousal visa application for me. In the end, I was abandoned and was betrayed as him and his parents tried to ship me back off to my abusive family behind my back and my visa was never filed. I was already feeling lost and panicked and so I tried to commit suicide and am now in a mental hospital in his country. 

I am very unsure what to do as all contact has been cut off from me by him, my social circle has collapsed, and my tourist visa I entered the country on has expired. I have no money and don't even have all my possessions. I am scared that I will be forced to go back to my country and become homeless. 

All I can think of is considering applying for a humanitarian residency permit or becoming a buddhist nun at a temple, does anyone else have any other suggestions? I am so scared and so alone.",05Aug2018,1

248,"I need advice about what to do with my relationship of almost four years. My family won't give me advice, and my friends are too biased to say anything helpful, so I am turning to the help of a third party. 

Basically, we (F 20, M 23) have been together for nearly four years, and I have been considering ending it for what seems like almost a year. We fight constantly, live five minutes away from each other and yet go weeks without hanging out. We have extremely different goals and levels of motivation, and there is a good chance that a year from now I will be living on the opposite side of the country for graduate school. I can't remember the last time we have done anything other just just a quick kiss goodbye. The list just goes on and on. I know I have my own faults but they also don't try to keep this relationship afloat. 

I am not sure if I should try to end things. A lot of other things have been going on in my life that have made me realize what other options are out there. I am 20 and want to have fun while I am young, but I am scared I will regret my decision.

249,"**TL;DR: I have a pregnancy fetish, but I don't ever want kids. Thus, hiring a pregnant prostitute would be the only way for me to satisfy this.**

I'm a single guy, virgin, 23. I am trying to pursue women and get into a relationship, but there's something going on in the back of my mind: I LOVE pregnant women. However, I don't want kids *(don't challenge me on this)*, so it's impossible for me to satisfy this with a future girlfriend/wife. 
I'm not sure she'd want to be a surrogate mother, either. Also, there are so few single/polyamorous pregnant women who would be willing to have sex with me that I'm sure it couldn't be satisfied that way.

So, people of r/advice,

* Do you think that asking my future girlfriend/wife to be a surrogate mother would be an unreasonable request?
* Do I have any options other than surrogacy, casual hookups with preggos, or prostitutes?
* Should I hire one? I REALLLY want to.

**AND BEFORE PEOPLE ASK,**


**1. No, I will not have my future gf wear a fake pregnancy belly. This precludes getting to feel up every part of her belly and her body.**

It's sweet, so we will hang out with them sometimes--but every time we go outside, their radars go off and they come outside and attach to us. We've had kids literally ask if they could follow us around. They know where we live, which is the worst part. They knock several times every day, and my mom's had to put a ""please do not disturb"" sign on our door. These kids have turned our door knob, knocked on our window, yelled at us from outside, hung out on our balcony, knocked on our door so hard it shakes, used our decorative knocker very loudly when my sister was sleeping. We've told the parents, who reprimanded them but they don't care. Me and my sister joke that we're celebrities and they're our rabid fans, because whenever we step foot outside, they come--literally--running.

257,"My best friend has over the past year or so gained a huge amount of weight - he started at 140lbs and now weighs roughly 300lbs. I asked him what was going on because I was concerned, and after a long talk with me he privately explained that he has a sexual fetish for gaining weight or being with large men, and that he's always had it, but never really followed it because he felt ashamed of it. It's a very niche fetish (see [/r/gainers](https://www.reddit.com/r/gainers/)), and I'm not judging him for it, but I am worried about the health dangers of morbid obesity - diabetes and other things.

His long term boyfriend is a healthy weight, and although they seem to have had a fairly healthy relationship, his bf has also expressed worry about it - he loves him but said to me privately that he is unable to see a future with him if he doesn't lose the weight, which I think is fair. He also said that their sex life has withered to pretty much nothing.

I think that, although my best friend has always had a sexual fetish for fat men and has had one night stands etc with them, he chose his current boyfriend because he is much more socially acceptable to be with, as he is in good shape.

On one hand I want my friend to be happy and to be with a fat guy instead so that he can live out his sexual desires, but on the other hand I don't want him to lose his current bf because they make a good couple otherwise, and I don't know if my friend would be even prepared to publicly date a fat man.

268,"Hi. I don't quite know what I'm trying to ask for in this post but here it goes.

I've always enjoyed fantasizing as a kid. I've always enjoyed theatre. I've always basically enjoyed anything that involved playing pretend. Nothing serious, just kid stuff at the time.

Now it's kind of, um, different. I have no idea why I feel the need to do it but I constantly go on websites (more particularly anonymous ones), online forums, etc. and make up a whole persona with major life problems such as mental health issues, addiction, you name it. Any major problem you could think of that could cause anyone to feel a tinge of pity for you, I've probably pretended to have. It's pretty embarrassing for me to admit this, actually :/

One of the obviously many reasons this is dumb and uncalled for is the fact that my life is perfectly fine. I'm doing fine socially, physically, mentally. Yet I always seem to love it when people feel pity towards my ""problems"". I know it's bad and ""catfishy"" and all, but the thing is, I really mean no harm? I'm not trying to gain anyone's information or steal anyone's money, I'm just doing it purely for my entertainment, which makes it even more irrational. See, even stealing someone's credit card information in this context seems more rational to me.

I just honestly don't get it. Why I crave love and pity while I have a perfectly good life, I don't understand. It's been this way for, I don't know, a good couple years? and it really needs to stop. The thing is, I'm not even seeking pity as MYSELF. I'm using other names and personas (not real people, people I've created in my head) in order to gain the pity. And even though I know these strangers online feel pity for my characters and not me, I still strangely enjoy it. It's gotten to the point where I spend so long carefully crafting these individual characters and persona that I can pretty much say I'm good at it now, uh. It taught me how to improvise, if anything. It's gotten to the point where I can actually switch my typing styles to make it way believable, to the point where I spend hours of my day WRITING UP BACKSTORIES FOR THESE MADE UP PERSONAS in order to make it more believable, to the point where I'm honestly also freaked out by my own self? Why am I spending time doing this? Weirdly enough, this post is my true raw self for the first time ever. Nothing made up here, just me confessing some dumb shit I've done and still am doing to this day. And the sad thing is, deep down I know I don't want to stop doing this, because at the end of the day, I know I enjoy it too much.

Edit  to clarify: he has told his online friend about me once early in our  relationship, and she does not think that he is her boyfriend. I do not  think that they are having an emotional affair, but given the context  and the things that have transpired, I am nonetheless uncomfortable with  their friendship. Also, my boyfriend has told me multiple times that he  finds our relationship emotionally fulfilling. My problems are 1) that  he avoided mentioning me when talking to her about the couple's trip we  took and has probably avoided mentioning me in many other scenarios 2)  offered her emotional support when she was pressured into sending nudes  to guys online whilst he shamed me for my sex life prior to our  relationship, 3) reached out to her as soon as i left the country and  told me he looks forward to playing video games with me yet he hadn't  once initiated a video (or voice) chat with me, 4) that the only reason  they became friends in the first place was that his ex girlfriend wasn't  giving him emotional support.

My  boyfriend and I have been in an official relationship for ten months and  are serious about each other. I am Scandinavian, he is British, and we  both live in the UK. His online friend lives in the US. We are generally  happy, support each other, and look forward to a future together, but  over the past few days an old issue has arisen that I am struggling to  make peace with.

When my boyfriend was  with his ex-girlfriend a few years back, he felt unfulfilled and did not  receive emotional support from his then girlfriend, which led him to  seek friendships online. He met a woman, A, on reddit, and they quicklys  truck up a friendship. My boyfriend has specifically said that it was  his unfulfilling relationship that led him to look for friendships  online. During my boyfriend’s relationship with his ex-girlfriend and  after their breakup, my boyfriend’s online friend has been a great  support for him, and he has likewise supported her through difficult  times. My boyfriend felt incredibly lonely, but she gave him solace.

During  the start of our relationship, my boyfriend would talk about her  seemingly non-stop. We used to go for long walks together in the  evenings, and he’d be talking about his online friend, her likes,  dislikes, her studies, her travels, her family, etc. I patiently and  politely listened. Given the context of their friendship (him being in  an unfulfilling relationship and needing emotional support elsewhere), I  became slightly wary about their friendship. I know that they texted a  lot and often played video games together while talking late at night. I  asked him about their friendship and asked if it had ever been anything  other than a friendship. I was not trying to accuse him of anything as I  had absolutely no proof of any wrongdoing on his part, and given that  he was so open about their friendship, I thought it unlikely that  anything was really going on. I was basically looking for reassurance.

My  boyfriend completely blew up in my face and told me I was accusing him  and trying to make him feel guilty about their friendship. This was our  first ever argument and I was quite shocked that he didn’t just reassure  me that it was just a friendship, since that was all I needed to hear.  Somehow we resolved it, but I did not get the reassurance I really  wanted.

Two months into our relationship,  we took a trip to Italy. The trip was entirely planned by me, as he has  barely ever been abroad before. I booked the plane tickets, the hotel,  and organised everything that we were going to do. My boyfriend was  really excited, and during the trip he kept saying that this was the  best trip he had ever been on and constantly thanked me for this  wonderful experience. I was thrilled.

A  few weeks later, we were hanging out in my flat studying, and I looked  over at his computer and noticed he was writing a message on discord  (which is where he and his friend chat, and she is the only person he  chats with there), and he quickly closed the window. I thought this was  odd, but I let it go at the moment. A few days later, when he was  telling me about a picture I had taken of him in Italy that he had sent  to his online friend, I asked if he’d mentioned that it was a trip we’d  taken together. He reluctantly admitted that he hadn’t. I was hurt and  uncomfortable with this given that I had exclusively planned the trip  for us and because I felt it was rude and suspicious that he would  delete me from his descriptions of the trip to her. He had apparently  written quite a few lengthy messages about “his” trip. I told him how I  felt, and he defended himself by saying he didn’t want to “rub it in her  face” that he was having a good time. After a while, he did end up  apologising.

Other things that strike me  as odd about their friendship is the fact that she has never let him see  her face as she is worried that he will think she’s ugly (my boyfriend  apparently found out how she looked from doing a bit of digging and told  me that she had a point about her appearance but that he’d never end  their friendship over that). My boyfriend told me that his friend had  once been pressured into sending nude pics to guys online and that she  really regretted it, and apparently my boyfriend had been a great  support for her while she was struggling with guilt for doing that. On  the other hand, when my boyfriend found out that I’ve had sexual  relationships with ten guys before I met him, he was absolutely  disgusted with me and told me that it made him want to throw up,  repeatedly. The circumstances of my past relationships shouldn’t matter,  but my teens were rough given that I grew up with a psychopathic mother  who encouraged me to have sex with as many guys as possible, amongst  other things, and my father has always been absent. The issue my  boyfriend had with my past sex life has since been resolved, but it  still stings that he would be such a great, non-judgmental support to  her while I apparently made him want to vomit (he also at one point told  me that he felt like I had been damaged by sleeping with so many men –  ouch).

For some reason, their friendship faded away a few months back – he mentioned it in passing at one point.

Two  weeks ago, I went to visit my family in Scandinavia, where I’ll be  staying until September. Before I left, he’d promised me that we would  video chat daily and keep in contact. While we did keep in contact, he  did not once express interest in video chatting with me the first three  days after I left. However, he told me that he had reached out to his  online friend and was looking forward to playing video games with her  again now that they had re-established their friendship. This really  stung. He was looking forward to playing video game with a distant  friend but had no apparent interest in video chatting with me. The  timing also made me feel really uncomfortable – the moment I leave, he  reaches out to a woman with whom he started talking because of his  unfulfilling relationship with his ex. This happened a few days ago, and  I can’t help but feel uncomfortable with their friendship.

He  has a history of downplaying and lying about his friendships with other  women although I have given him no indication that I have a problem  with him having female friends (I sat him down and talked about this,  and after a lot of crying and desperation on my part, he did realise  that it was all in his head that he thought I wouldn’t like him having  female friends in general). Nonetheless, his lying has left me feeling  very insecure in our relationship – the lying has happened over the span  of six months of our relationship, although it hasn’t been frequent.

I  don’t know what to do in this situation. I have been feeling upset for  days about the whole situation and do not feel comfortable with his  friendship with this particular female. If she wasn’t an online friend, I  would probably try to befriend her, but given that she’s an online  friend and that I can’t even put a face to her name (he reluctantly told  me her name three months into our relationship), it feels very  secretive.

Given the entire context, I  don’t know how to feel comfortable with him continuing his friendship  with this female who he has offered much better support to than I have  ever received from him, who he told about “his” trip to Italy by  completely deleting me from it, etc.

Am I  being overly jealous and worried? I am open to criticism and ultimately  just want to resolve this, because it’s having a negative impact on my  well-being at the moment.",05Aug2018,1
273,"I'm 22. 

I'm a mess. I know what I should be doing but for some reason, I don't do it. 

Basically, for the past 2 months, I was getting tired of working at Walmart for 2 years. It's an easy job,  I knew how everything worked, management liked how I worked - but I ended up having to manage 4 departments by myself.  I also felt like I needed to do something else.  I ended up getting a construction job (fabrication shop) with the help of my friend. The job title is: Helper. 

Since I been here, I have been feeling down.  It was one of those things, where you don't know until you try it. Everyone has there thing, but this isn't for me. 

With everything going on, I was thinking about how joining the Air Force can be the best thing for me.  I'm thinking about joining by January 2019, after this Fall semester -  I'm taking IT classes. If it goes good, I'm aiming for a IT/cyber security job in the Air Force. Or I may just stick with the college route.  After these 5 months, I should have a better idea of the pros and cons.

I start IT class next week. I always liked computers since the first day my mother bought a computer for the house. I wanted to know everything about it. I learned how to connect it, learned how to build them, how to remove viruses, etc. I would spend hours just exploring Windows XP.  I recently, been reading a CompTIA A+ book (certificate study guide) and I already know a good amount of it. It feels like a natural thing to study. I spent a couple years learning Automotive Technology and Accounting- obviously wasn't for me, not sure why I didn't start with IT first.  I just really hope I enjoy it because I don't know what else I would do as a career.

I told this to co-workers (about joining the Air Force) and eventually, it spread around. Now, the company basically has me just taking out the trash, cleaning up the oil that leaks from the forklifts, sweep up areas, organizing the stock room and at times, moving pallets around with the forklift and unloading delivery trucks.  I'm the only helper that doesn't really work on projects. Someone told me, I shouldn't have said anything because now people don't want to teach me things since I'm eventually leaving.  

 I mean it's fine because at least I'm getting paid more than I was at Walmart, doing less work. But at the same time, I miss having the pride that I had at Walmart. Everyone liked me, management liked how fast I would stock, calling me asking if I can help the overnight crew, etc. I felt appreciated.  At times, I feel like going back to Walmart but the hours suck - I would mostly get 32 hours but then it'll go down to 15-25 hours. Retail also drains you after a while, so there's that. 
 
 --- 
 
 I just feel like something is wrong me with me. I know what I should be doing but for some reason, I don't do it. It's like I have problems focusing. I'll end up studying for 15-20 minutes then I'll just end up browsing YouTube videos or just wasting time browsing. 

I'll end up being motivated for 2 weeks but then I'll end up repeating the cycle. A lot of people tell me I'm a bright kid and that I have potential and I feel it.. but I also feel like I'm wasting away because something is holding me back. 

 
 I want to be successful. I want to be financially independent, have my own house, and happy with a job I'm passionate about. 

I found out my dad is homeless.. and I feel like I'll be the same way... We are very similar, we have the same birthmark, same personality, etc. We are introverts, really quiet guys, who value their solitude.  We don't talk much though, never bonded, parents divorced when I was 1 years old.  I understand why he is, the way he is. Maybe we have a similar mindset that is holding us back from achieving our goals. I have problems with negative thinking and self-esteem/confidence issues.
 
 Any advice? I'll appreciate it.",05Aug2018,1
274,"I am faced with a major decision this week and want some second opinions.

I dropped out of grad school last year with 2 months to go. I had already completed 2.5 out of the 3 years for my Masters at a very top tier, highly respected school/program.  At the time I was not thinking right and about to enter the deepest depression of my life.  As soon as I dropped out, I instantly felt better and free but my today my decision haunts me in various ways. My family and friends all think I graduated and when I think about applying to the jobs I want, I get very nervous because I think about what a background check might turn up that I didn't actually graduate from the school.  I think about the shame of having to explain I was weeks away from completing something and couldn't cut it. I have not lied on any applications about my graduate degree status but sometimes it is tempting to, and then comes a huge moral dilemma - the school and program I have listed on my resume is a major reason I will be getting shortlisted for interviews, so obviously these companies will expect me to have officially completed the program. 

I dropped out because I entered a very very deep depression and I did not find any support at the school. I had difficulty relating to my classmates, the program was intense (I would stay awake for days on end working on projects) and I had zero friends or support system. I just broke and walked away.  But now as I am coming out of my depression and getting back into living my life and moving my career forward, I am plagued by this decision I made to throw away 2.5 years of hard work and high costs.

Anyway, I reached out to the Dean of the program to close up my account (pay off any fees, officially withdraw etc) and she offered to let me come back in Spring 2019 to finish up my degree.  I told her I'd think about it and let her know this week. I'm seriously torn and have no clue the best course of action.

**Pros of going back to school** - I already completed 95% of the program, it would make job searches so much easier to be able to truthfully say I completed my Masters.  It would also go a long way to building up the confidence I lost in myself after bailing at the last minute.  I have a thing for not completing things properly so this is a pretty shameful thing for me to have to face every day.  Also, it is a top top tier school and I am lucky I am being offered a spot in a new class to finish.

**Cons of going back to school** - I'd be taking on additional loan debt that I'm not sure I can handle anymore. I already have so much loan debt even with scholarships and grants.  Going back to finish also means 4 more months of unhealthy living and competition.  It would mean having to explain to family and friends why I am back in school after supposedly graduating.  It also means putting off an international move I was planning this fall.

I really have no clue what to do here and need to make a huge decision within the next couple days. I figured crowd-sourcing outside opinions might help me better shape my perspective on this.  Thank you.",05Aug2018,1

277,"Yesterday, my brother sold his dirt bike that my father bought him to bond with him, which in turn made my father very unhappy already. He sold it for $900, my dad purchased it at $2,800, something else he was very upset about. Then after getting the money, my brother took a cab to his friends, Marcus's house (16m) where he gave Marcus's dad $300 for weed. He then asked if my boyfriend and I would take him to the mall to get school clothes. He ended up spending $250 on everything, which I don't really even care about. Then we took him back to his friends house after, which I was kinds annoyed by because I knew my parents were gonna harass me with questions about him and if I don't answer them, they'll kick me out or something else equally drastic.

Before I even got home, my mom was consistently texting me asking where my brother was, how much money he had on him, where the rest of it was, when he was coming home, etc etc. When I walked in the door, they both stared at me and whispered about me as I walked to my room. Then came more texts. So, I called my brother and asked if he would just come home and deal with their questions because this wasn't my money or my place to which he responded ""I'm with my friends, it's not my problem."" 

So, now I'm annoyed, pissed, and just overall over it. I'm so ready to tell my parents the truth, but I don't want to ruin that relationship with my brother. It seems like he doesn't even respect me enough to save me the hassle of going through this when it should be him. How should I handle this?

So, a few months back, we both cut out porn in our lives completely. No, we weren’t addicts or bizarre with it. But, most people do watch it here and there, and we thought for the betterment of our relationship we would exclude it since, well, it is getting off to other people. 

Last night, I got home very late. I hadn’t gone to bed until at least 4:45 AM after laying around for a bit. For some reason, I was oddly h*rny. 

*WARNING* Do not keep reading if you cannot take this seriously. 

Anyway, I did not want to watch porn, as I didn’t want to break my streak. But, for some twisted and disgusting reason, the idea of a live video chat came to my mind. I cannot believe I am truly saying this right now, nor can I believe I actually did something like this. 

I found some random, cruddy website online where, of course, people go to be dirty. I knew this was so wrong but for some reason I guess I was so h**** that I couldn’t resist the temptation. 

I am not an out of control girl. I do not “get around”, as I have only had sex with my boyfriend. Actually, I am pretty insecure about my body, which is even more shocking. 

After scrolling through multiple people, I came across a guy whose... uh... “parts” were only visible. I saw a bit of his body, he looked toned and normal. Not some (excuse me for this) old, overweight, gross man preying on younger girls. 

So basically, I engaged in sexting. My face was NOT shown, there was absolutely no speaking, no noise. I could not bear to show my face, or see someone else’s. What you could picture is what was happening. I had been doing the same thing as him. This only went on for about 2 or 3 minutes. Then I left. 

I am absolutely mortified at myself. I basically cheated on my boyfriend. I prayed afterword and still feel so guilty going about a normal day with him, knowing I did this. I have no idea why this temptation took over me. I will certainly never do this again. I am afraid that if I ever told him this it would be the icing on the cake, and even though he has known me for a year and a half now, the person I am will be tainted in his eyes and he will want to find someone new. I cannot lose him. I have no idea what to do.

I met this girl when I was 16, we've talked for an extremely long time. We got the same job together, graduated from school together, I even took her to prom. To this day we are both managers at our workplace. Needless to say I have to see her every day.

Shes been through a lot in her life. Through her house burning down, abusive brothers, rape at a young age, abusive first boyfriend.. For a long time I tried to be with her, tried to show her I truly love her, tried to show her what it was like to be treated right for a change. Two years later Im 18 and shes 19, we werent talking for a while because we didnt know what to say to eachother. I hit rock bottom about two weeks ago and tried to kill myself. She soon found out it was because of her through a group chat, and during my shift she cried to me in the office about how I could do such a thing. Told me she wanted her best friend back, who she could tell everything to. It broke my heart to see that Id hurt what I consider to be my world.

Its been a few days since then and Ive been trying to talk to her more.. Im trying to get over it and make things right. I pinky promised her I wouldnt attempt anything again, and I cant lie to her.

I interviewed for a job a few weeks back and managed to land the job, which is a job that doesn't require any qualifications or anything. I'm useless at creating templates for CVs and Resumes, so I had my friend send me hers and I just changed all of the information to my own. 

As I was editing it, I kept saving different files as I went so I ended up with a few different ones on my computer (Resume 1, Resume 2 etc) and then downloaded what I thought was the finished one onto my phone. I was on holiday for a week and was applying to a load of different jobs, which is how I found the one I'm in now. Turns out, though, that I'd changed all of my details apart from the grade. My friend and I studied the same topic at college (never went to uni) and she received a DMM whereas I received much lower. On the finished product, I simply stated that I graduated college and didn't specify a grade, but I recently found out today that I'd submitted the one that said DMM. 

They're conducting a background check now and I'm absolutely terrified that this mistake is going to mess this up for me. I received my contract and I've actually started the job already, and it listed in the contract what they'd be checking in the background. It included employment checks and history, and then it said the following: ""Qualification checks (where we require a qualification for the role)""

Does this mean that, due to not needing any qualifications, they aren't checking my education history? Should I just wait and see what happens and not say anything about it, or should I come clean to my supervisor and say that the resume I submitted was wrong? The job I've gotten is basically working in fraud prevention and now I guess I've committed fraud, so I'm massively panicking! I have no criminal history and my DBS is completely clean, and I also have glowing references from previous employers. Would any of this help benefit me if this does screw things up?

288,"Hey there, a 21 YO male law student here.
I'm studying in basically the best law school in the whole country.

Well, I used to be such an introvert person.. but when I got to college, I promised myself to be the most amazing person ever, to have many friends, to be the LEADER I always wanted to be.

I runned for the student council in the faculty, and I actually won (after a very hard work throughout two years).
I achieved full popularity, the ""dream"" became true.

And then shit happens, I realized I'm still the same lonely shitty person I used to be.

In my faculty, the student council is composed of three chairs, two for the licence, and one for the masters degree. And as a student rep i was the ""one of the two"" student reps.

Both of the other spots are filled by two who are in a Student Union which have ""ruled"" our faculty since it was established, since thirty freaking years.

That Student Union I ran against (I ran as an Independent student) and ""took""/""robbed"" (According to their logic) one of their spots began to destroy me in every way possible.

They destoyed of my popularity by talking shit against me, ""he's not responsible"" ""he's uneffectif"".

Even one day one student's phone was stolen in campus, and I happened to not be in the faculty at the time, they basically used that argument (my absence) to destroy my reputation.

The students who elected me started questioning my ability to be their representative.

I failed my year. Broke up with my girlfriend, I'm lost.

289,"Man oh man where do I even begin. I guess let's start by introducing myself. I'm about 19 (turning 20 soon) year old male, short (below the average male height), a virgin (what a surprise in this day and age right?) fairly/quite ugly person according to the people I know and in my own personal opinion as well and long story short on what this post is about is me just feeling stuck and alone.

Let me get started on what I mean by those 2 words. Firstly, what's considered earning ""respect"" nowadays is pulling girls and getting laid and yes it would be nice to have some actual action instead of just masturbating, but for people like me, it is honestly next to impossible. People say that physical appearance doesn't matter or something along the lines of ""confidence is key"" but in order to actually get girls, I honestly believe that you need to have some kind of ""desirable"" appearance in this first place which comes down to 3 main factors for appearance - height, looks and physique with the first 2 being the most important because your physique is something you can change but your height and looks, unless you have the money and the courage to do plastic surgery or height lengthening then you're screwed. If you're hard to look at like me then you might as well not bother. Like how is ""confidence"" defined or utilised? - something I am still finding quite hard to believe in if I am honest. Why play hard to get when you're already hard to want am I right? I see my friends pulling girls left right and centre like its nothing and boasting all about it and it just ruins me as a person. Yes, I'll admit that they aren't the most handsome people or tallest but at least they have something in terms of physical appearance. What they lack in height, they make up for in looks and what they lack in looks, they make up for in height. What does one like me, a person who's lacking in all these departments do in order to have some place in society's hierarchy? Every single time I'm out with my friends, girls give them attention and actually acknowledge that they're there but I'm just a ghost, a waste of space and I feel like I shouldn't be there, which is also due to me lacking in pretty much every single important way to my friends with the majority of them telling me to ""move out the way"" to use the toilet - the only acknowledgement I'll ever get from girls.

The brutal honest truth is that no matter how much you tell yourself you're desirable, your opinion doesn't matter as long as nobody else supports your claim. No man is an island and someone trying to convince themselves with their own ideas will never see the fruition of it unless society sees what you mean and agrees with you. A couple of my friends would say ""Oh you won't be single for the rest of your life,"" so why do the girls in the world seem to say and act otherwise, and if I find myself in the situation of shoot, shag, marry, I am the disposable tool that's always shot/killed. Albeit it's a game, it still kills me inside each time. Me describing my own personality would be that I am willing to walk till' the end of the earth for you without hesitation as long as you mean something to me. Honestly, what do I do? Will I just end up being another tool in society's cogs and live this kind of life where everyone seems to progress and you are merely retained as an example of a failed past?",05Aug2018,2
291,I'm 18 &amp; just recently got out of the no experience loop when looking for a job. I got a job about a month ago at a small fast food chain and worked there for just a little over 2 weeks. I got one paycheck. I worked 10 hours the next pay period and the store randomly closed without warning or a heads up. I didn't get my 10 hours of pay which is only $60 but that's a lot to me. I'm already struggling as is. The manager didn't give his personal number out and corporate isn't answering the phone. How should I go about getting my money back or is there no hope in getting it? I know the other employees are out of luck like me so any advice would help us out a lot.,05Aug2018,1
292,"So, long story short, I spent about 11 years after I dropped out of university not talking to anybody at all other than for work purposes. As a result, I have either lost or underdeveloped my sense of humour and social awareness. I have also always neglected aesthetics because my young idealistic self hated them. I have a couple other obstacles: I live in a small town and cannot afford a car. I am short (5'2""). I also cannot stand loud noises.

Recently, I got a good job due to my computer skills. This isn't the first time this has happened but it is the first time in a long time. What is a first is that I got a raise and it's been a few years since I had the option of working less than 80 hours a week. It has motivated me to give up on my lifelong dream of dying of old age; alone, rich, and contented with life long fantasies of not being a stereotypical reddit basement dwelling weeb neckbeard.

I got a hair cut. \~\~Learned to shave\~\~ shaved for the second time. Cleaned my room. Lost weight and started working out. I bought some new clothes. I regulated my diet and finally got some digestive problems under control. But, I'm not sure what to do next to best achieve my goals. Here they are:

1: Overcome my pride. I am constantly being held back by my shame of how I've lived the past ten years. However, I'm not sure how to drop the baggage and look forward instead of back. Especially since it is undeniably all my own fault. So far, my strategy has been to fake it until you make it but this doesn't work very well when trying to motivate yourself to practice skills. In the end, I can't practice for more than 10 minutes before looking at my lack of skill with disgust, considering how I wasted over a decade of my life, and then trying to escape it by doing something that doesn't challenge me. I'm not sure how to get out of this one.

2: Meet new people and make friends. This is especially challenging as a non-drinker with no hobby groups within reach. So far my strategy has been trying to learn how to smile and look for opportunities to talk to strangers. But people these days are pretty absorbed with the internet so it's not so easy anymore. Additionally, the chance that a meeting buds into a friendship is pretty low. I'm not in school anymore where I can expect to see the same people every day.

3: Getting into a relationship. Maybe it's too late for me but I do want to do the whole family thing. I do have a girl that's into me but I don't see myself with her. She's a bit slow and fan-girls over me all of the time which isn't grounds for a healthy relationship. I don't think I would be happy in such a relationship either. I need someone who I can honestly respect. So far my strategy has been to dwell in despair because I can't even meet people right now. I would try a dating site but I feel like I can not offer enough value to be worth consideration. What skills, other than a sense of humour and fashion, could I learn that might increase my value? I feel like I'll need to do extra to make up for my defective height as well. For reference, my hobbies are cooking, computers, linguistics, and gaming and I have broad general interest in all general academic disciplines.

4: Learn skills. Learning skills that are often taken to an art form, like small talk or humour, is a bit elusive by nature. How can I practice these skills without making a fool of myself? Am I doomed to live through the awkward teenage years I tried to avoid when I'm already in my 30's? Sadly, my current sense of humour is either incredibly offensive or relies on self-deprecation which I understand is a huge turn off when meeting new people.

5: Regain my empathy and emotions. Because of my childhood I learned to deal with life by cutting myself off from the world emotionally. On top of that, between reading the news frequently and working in customer service for a few years I've been stuck with compassion fatigue for years now. My strategy so far has been to slow down and take a breather every once in a while. But is there something more I can do to get back in touch with life on an emotional level? I feel like this is also vital for goals #2 and #3 since it stunts my ability to deal with non-verbal communication and actually connect with people.",05Aug2018,1

294,"I posted this elsewhere, but recently just subscribed here so I figured this would be a better place to post it. 

Basically, I have the choice to live with my parents after graduation for 6 months until I start my new job. The problem is they want me to move home and said they won't help me out at all if I choose to stay in my current apartment until then. That's fine and I respect their decision cause I'm not a child anymore. 

My question is would it be stupid to turn down their offer of putting me up for 6mos until I start the job to be happy and independent? I would be supporting myself fully like I will once I get the job, but just as a waitress which obviously will be difficult but doable (I work at the town's most popular bar/restaurant so I know I could support myself. There are multiple mothers who even support themselves off the one job). By moving home I'd also save 6mos of money I'd be spending on rent and food that I could use for a new car, which I'm starting to really really need, or to pay off part of my student loans. 

Clearly, moving back with my parents is more financially responsible. The problem is that I HATE being home. I have a horrible relationship with my alcoholic father and I don't have any friends in that town. Everytime I've visited between semesters I've been miserable, and that's been for a max of two months. I would genuinely be happier struggling on my own, but is that horribly irresponsible and immature? I want to set myself up for success, but not at the cost of months of misery. Thoughts? 

TLDR; I have 6mos between graduation and when I start my career. During this time I can either 1. live with my parents for free where I'm miserable or 2. live on my own happily but be thousands poorer from paying for my own rent/food. Is it completely immature and irresponsible to choose #2?",05Aug2018,1
295,"Okay so I don't know what I'm doing. I started living by myself in a small one bedroom flat in April. 

I'm lazy and didn't want to walk 6 staircases down and up again to throw my trash away (and I'm also I'm kinda creeped out by the guys next door I have to walk by to get to the trash container). So I put 2 garbage bags on my balcony to let future me deal with it. One of them was full of wasted food. I have been depressed for a long time and was doing slightly better. I tried buying more fruits and healthy foods but everything got wasted because I relapsed shortly after and didn't know what to cook with it and at one point couldn't cook with it because all my dishes were dirty (they still are f me).

The only things I'm legitimately scared of/hate is the dark (I'm 18 but I can't help it), flying insects and maggots. I just can't. Writing this and knowing these things are crawling on my balcony is making me feel so fucking disgusted and uncomfortable.

Yesterday I finally decided to throw the bags away (At that point they were already there for like 3-4 days). The bags with wasted food was leaking pineapple juice or something. I saw 'traces' coming from where some of that juice dripped. I didn't think much but I think I already knew but was sort of denying it. I got my cleaning gloves out and a large shopping bag and put the leaking garbage bag in there. There were a few maggots under the bag but not much. I got the other bag and put them in the hallway. I prepared myself to go out because I wanted to do grocery shopping now I decided to finally go outside. Searching for my shoes, tying my hair, getting my bag and keys and such. when I wanted to pick the garbage bags up I heard a weird noise that turned out to be crawling sounds. I inspected the garbage bag and there it was. A bunch of maggots doing their spastic maggot thing in a ball of maggot right next to my hand as I tried to grab the end. I could've grabbed them if I wasn't being so careful. At this point I had jumped over these bags like 5 times when getting my stuff together while dehydrated, haven't eaten at that point and slept for 3 hours. My guardian angel was really pitying me that day I guess probably thinking *oh no what the fuck are you doing?*

So my body shut down and my soul left for a few seconds before returning. I immediately ran to the bathroom to clean the fuck out of my hands and catch my breath. I put on my gloves again and put the bag on my balcony. Then very carefully inspected the other bag and the floor (no maggots thank god). I closed the door to my balcony and began searching online how to kill maggots. It said vinegar could help or boiling them (or bleach but I didn't have any). There were too many and I couldn't bring myself to pick them all up. I also imagine there are a lot more inside the garbage bag. So I have been dumping boiling water and vinegar on the garbage bag (still in the grocery bag btw) a few times a day now. I don't see much difference but I don't think I can kill them all this way. There's a pigeon with 2 little eggs on my balcony an I'm worrying all of this is harming her a stupid as that may sound. The best way to get rid of them is throwing the bag away but I don't know how I'm supposed to do this without dropping a lot of maggots on all the staircases or risking dropping them on myself. 

So does anyone have advice for how to safely throw this garbage bag full of maggots away and to clean my balcony without hurting the pigeon nest?

I already threw the other bag away btw.

**\[TL;DR\] : I live on the fourth floor and I have a garbage bag full of maggots on my balcony and I want to know if there's a safe way to throw this bag away without dropping maggots all over the place or myself. And I also want to know how to clean my balcony without harming the pigeon and her eggs.**",05Aug2018,2
297,"I am going to try and keep this as concise as possible, sticking to several factors. I am a rising sophomore at a large state university in NC. I have been wanting to pursue healthcare my entire life, but more specifically gained interest in the field of dentistry a few years ago while shadowing in high school. I have always been the type to plan as much as possible and research, and this has led me to lots and lots of posts about how dentistry is dying and that its too oversaturated, paired with the insane 400k-600k debt (Hopefully possibly attending UNC or ECU would keep this lower). All these factors make it seem like dentistry isn't the dream career everyone (especially my South Asian parents) had painted it as. 

I really just want a career that has good work-life balance, and is financially secure enough to set up my family well (including parents). Will pursuing dentistry during this oversaturated time mean I can't live in a suburb of a large metro (NY, Boston, Chicago, etc.) or in an area such as Charlotte, NC without sacrificing a lot of potential success? I've also been seeing that the retirement age of dentists is pushing 70, are all these dentists actually fully practicing or do they have associates primarily working the practice? I've just been over thinking my life, and have been getting told that the better jobs and income are in compsci and finance careers. I'm still early enough in my Biology degree that I could switch if needed. Thanks for the input!",05Aug2018,1

If you don’t drive, paying for yourself to get around.

299,"TLDR at the end

I’m 14 year old girl and I’m not sure what I’m feeling I guess and who to pursue. I’m pretty good friends with this guy, probably not on best/true friend level, but I’m able to talk to him about a personal things. I’ve been hanging out with him more often, and so I was thinking of asking him out I guess. On the other hand, every time I go to my best friend’s house, I always talk to her younger sister(13 years old) and it feels like I would rather spend time with her sister than the friend sometimes. Her sister is flirty and is out of the closet as pansexual.
Last night, my best friend had a sleepover with a group of friends (including me), my best friends sister kept flirting with basically all of the girls, especially one that is out as bisexual. Her sister and I have a cool friendship even though we never hang out because I hang out with her sister(my best friend). 
I can’t tell if my best friends sister is into me because she is always kidding, but she’s always asking me if I’m bisexual (which I am, but haven’t really come out yet).

TLDR; good guy friend who I hang out with  vs best friends sister who I only see on occasion(sleepovers), who should I date?",05Aug2018,1
300,"Whatsup reddit,

First world problem here. I'm 22(m) and turn 23 in about 2.5 months. My parents booked a vacation to Las Vegas/Hoover dam/grand canyon and they're basically bringing me for free.

I have a choice to go on vacation, or stay home and work/go to the gym/save for my goals. The vacation is **two weeks** So it'll set me back a bit on what I want to achieve.

Some pros of going:

Giving me my own room, parents are cool and would let me sneak around and talk to girls. Paying for most of my food etc. Never been to the west coast. 

Cons of going:

Taking two weeks off the gym, I could just bring girls to my house and bang them, I won't be able to save up for the things I want. Also schools starts soon, and I don't want to be in vacation mode/be broke/when it does. Also, parents would waste like probably 1500 bucks on me.

I am recovering from a hell of a few years, and I've been doing awesome lately. Do you think I should keep climbing the ladder **or** take time off?

301,"A friend/acquaintance is turning 50 and (months ago) asked me to join him in Montreal for his birthday (I am in DC; he is in NYC).  Based on our travels together in the past, I have made it a rule not to travel with him.  However, I made an exception for him this time since it is a big birthday and he is anxious about this day, as many people are.  I don't get much time off and I am on a budget, so even agreeing this was something I had to mull over and finesse a bit in both my mind and budget planning.

For a while, he had no idea/plans what to do.  I kept asking when he wanted to fly; where he wanted to stay; what he wanted to do.  After a long while, we were able to nail down a date he wanted to go and return; we booked the [nonrefundable] tickets; I made hotel reservations [sharing a room] for the two of us.

And still, he had no idea what he wanted to do/go/see.  He wants to figure it out when he gets there [past experiences- he does nothing except watch TV and drink and smoke]; I want to use this precious time to explore someplace new, learn about things and enjoy the city and what it has to offer.  In short, my vacation style is an explorer; he is the type to sit and drink and drink and smoke.  I am a total morning person; he is a night owl.  In many ways, we are polar opposites.  

I had planned to spend his birthday day doing whatever he wanted- even if it was lounge around- and then take the other time and explore.  If he wanted to come along, I am fine with that; I am also fine with solo adventures.

I just heard from him now-- a hair over two weeks until we start-- and he has now announced that there are up to four other people coming along.  These people vacation in a similar style as him.  He asked if i could find more hotel rooms at that rate [no, it was a promo special] and could the others join us in the room.

I am able to (both physically and mentally) tolerate the length of time with him, but more people is not going to fly.  I suggested that he/we/they look for a different room during the time.

At this point, had it not been his birthday, I would have suggested we do our own separate things, in separate rooms (so he can be with his other friends) and pick a time to meet each day to check in/have dinner/be together.  However, given that it is his birthday, I am hesitant to do this; I feel like I should be paying him more attention.

How do I not be/appear to be a stick in the mud about this trip?  How much time should I be with these him and these new people?

TL-DR: Friend asked for birthday trip; I agreed.  Friend now has changed parameters with more people on trip and has no idea what to do.  Suggestions wanted on what to do/how to handle.",05Aug2018,2
302,"So to cut a long story short about 6 months ago I ended up sleeping with my (then) housemates girlfriend. He confronted me about it the day after and had a pretty emotional conversation. I assumed after that he would prefer if I didn’t bring it up again (he wouldn’t want to talk about it) so I didn’t really mention it, about 4 weeks after he says to me he’s still pissed off that I didn’t make an effort with him (we knew each other for quite a while) after what I did, I deeply apologised again and talked with him about it. After that, we were acting pretty much civil (at least from my perspective), and we were kinda ok, went out to social events with our shared friend group etc. 
Then just earlier today he messaged me out of the blue saying that he wanted to tell me, now we’re living in different houses (moved out at the end of tenancy kinda recently) basically saying fuck you, you still didn’t make an effort, don’t try and talk to me or my (our) friends about it, dont cross me basically.

She is usually drooling, smells of cigs and booze, and wet from tears and sweat. Which gets all over me and furthers my annoyance of being awoken at 4am. I no longer answer the door. 

No matter what, it wakes me up and keeps me awake no matter how hard I try. It is this constant knocking with occasional short pauses. Sometimes it is a very faint and distant knocking but it's enough to rip me from my sleep and each time I'm slipping back into sleep it startles me awake.

 I don’t do drugs or drink alcohol or energy drinks, just water and orange juice.

I was doing class work and my teacher came to my side to give me something he graded but I acted like he had a gun or a knife because I felt a rush of fear. He asked me if I get abused at home as a joke and we laughed but that stuck with me ever since.

They then called me names and made fun of my weight (I was a pretty chubby kid lol). One of the girls went up to me and grabbed my crotch and squeezed my butt. She then put her hand up my shirt trying to feel a non existent six pack. All I remember after that  was me getting on the bus and tearing up.

317,"Hey, I'm just gonna say I'm not depressed or any other thing. Overall, I'm like in the middle. Not sad, but as the title says, definitely not enjoying my life. But of course, I'm thankful for what I have. (excuse my english). And I know this can sound a bit cringe, but you'll get over this.

I'm 16, male and live in a town in Czechia. I'm really shy, but (from compliments) good looking - sounding like a twat for this... Currently I'm studying on a secondary school, which is quality, but I'll have to go to university afterwards. I have no idea which university / what I'll do in the future. I've still got 2 years to decide so school and future is not bothering me as much.

I used to be fat, then i grew quite a bit into a skinny-fat physique, and over a 2 months ago I started my fitness journey. If it wasn't for this, I would hate my life. This is making me at least a bit happy.

But why am I not enjoying my life? Well, because I don't do anything during the day. I'm not broke like some others, I've got some money saved (not a lot lot, but a lot compared to others - only things I buy are things around fitness, branded clothes and sometimes some pc game).

Now, we've got a 2 month - school brake, I've got a whole day for myself. As I said, I work out, help my parents, and once in a while, I do part time jobs. But that leaves me a whole lot of the day free. I've got a nice amount of friends, but they're either somewhere on vacation, and if they're not, they still can't be bothered to go out somewhere. Long story short - they're trolls. It's so hard to get them to go somewhere. The only time they go somewhere is go drinking with some other trash people. That's not for me. At least not every week. It's really hard to find friends now, since for some reason there are 'popular' people in the town which are sooo cocky. other than them, you can't find a sensible person to be friends with - there are either cocky people or no-lifers (me rn).

I find myself wasting so much time on watching youtube videos, or playing pc games with some friends. As I was thinking - this is definitely not the life i want to live.

I've never had a girlfriend - I live a passive life, and I wanted a relationship - but I'm allergic to cringe things. And there is no girl which seemed the right one for me. They were either cringe, bad looking, or something that made me not want her. I've never had an actual realistic crush. I never pushed for a relationship - I've never tried. And now I'm writing this with no kiss count (F). The issue is I'm really shy and I've never went to a party or overall other than school I dont know many other girls. This sounds soo cringe and cheesy, but honestly having a girlfriend would make me happy. It's something that is missing for me. There was one I probably should have tried, since we were getting on well, but I wasn't trying anything and now she has one.

I just want to enjoy life until I'll have my own real problems. And that definitely is not the case for me. Is there any advice ? If someone suggested fitness longer ago, that would be great. I'm either looking for something like that, or any other general advices. What do I do to enjoy life?

319,"Hello, I'm 20 yo female.  


My mother **\[49\]** is a toxic person, my father **\[49\]** works abroad (he isn't at home at the time), my sister **\[28\]** acts almost the same as my mother does. I don't really have anyone to talk to and to ask for help in my family. My mom pretends to be a succesfull woman with her own house, perfect husband, children and grandchildren, but for real she is awful and she disgusts me. When I was little she was beating me and my sister - but sister is okay with that and she forgave her. Well, I didn't.

My mother is abusing me psycholigically, she tends to argue with me even if I'm not the one to blame, she is abusing my cats, tells me no one will miss me when I'm gone, and I will do her a favor when I will finally move out, etc. My dad believes her, no matter what she will say - I am the 'bad one', I'm making her nervous and push her to arguments. She won't admit to anything, denying she would talk any of these things, making herself innocent all the time.

And now I have a dilema. Althrough she is a terrible person she is still my mom. I am supposed to start Uni in October, move out with my boyfriend **\[24\]** to the **City 1**, but I don't really want that. My parents told me they would give me money only if I would move to the **City 1** to start the said so Uni. My bf would have a shitty job, and I will attend a shitty major. On the other hand we can go to the **City 2** \- and that is what I really want, but I didn't get accepted in Uni there. I wanted to make a gap year, find a job and increase my high school certificate score to get accepted to the **City 2 Uni**. 

My mom was hella angry, my dad tried to comfort and help me in my decision, but she was furious - she blamed my boyfriend (they hate each other) for my idea. My dad was able to give me some money to help me out with rent a flat and living, but back then I decided to go to the **City 1** and continue education. 

Now I think it's a bad idea. I don't want to be controlled by my sociopath mother and OWN her anything, I don't want to have any contact with her as long as she makes me the one to blame for everything. I have enough being treated like a trash and dogsbody in this house under her jurisdiction, being criticized and verbally assaulted. I know I will have no money If I would choose what I really want and I know my whole family will be against me once my mother will talk shit about me, I will have literally no one to talk from my family. I'm afraid to be alone.

SADLY, there is more! I have three cats and I must take them with me, no matter what option I will choose. I can't rent a room, because of them, so I need whole flat. They are being beaten by my sick mom, so I don't want to let something bad happen for them (she's not feeding them and she's trying to throw them on the streets).

Should I pretend to be okay and go to the **City 1** with my parents financial support or should I go to the **City 2**, own 0 money, find a job, count on my bf's and his parents, distance myself from my mother and try my best to finally live a happy life?

What should I do? ",05Aug2018,2
320,"Title is enough, but further context follows. This is not my story, but the person involved is not a redditor. That said, as a freelancer this trope is as old as the mountains.

&lt;storytime&gt;

Established artist Blade approaches young but talented artist Amy. Blade says that her field is not lucrative and has no money to pay for Amy's work, but she'd love to use it in a new upcoming piece. 

When Amy responds that she feels uncomfortable giving away work for free, Blade shoots back that when she started out artists created work for the love of the art, not any money involved.

Though Amy would love to collaborate with Blade, she cannot afford to give work away for free right now.

&lt;/storytime&gt;

Niether discipline is traditionally lucrative, so I would have thought the older artist would be understanding. I have heard of people offering ""exposure"" before, but this sort of guilt-tripping about the love of the art is new to me. This all brings me to:

Struggling young artist is guilt tripped by older established artist into giving away work for free. How to respond without burning bridges but also respecting young artist's time and work?

321,"A couple years ago, I was thinking about singing up for a dating site to meet someone.    I noticed I could create a free account and get preview of the women on the site.

Long story short, I ended up meeting a girl so I never signed up.   I did however, notice a woman that I was interested in.   

A year and a half later, I'm single and I happen across her profile on FB through a mutual friend and it appears she is still single.    I jump at the thought that she is still on the dating site but she isn't.  

Do I reach out to her and ask her relationship status out of the blue in hopes that she is still single and looking?      
 If so, how?

324,"Hey all!
I’m seeking advice because I genuinely don’t know what to do for Christmas this year. 
At this point in time I’ve got 2 options. 

A) Go with my family (mom, dad &amp; 9 siblings) to a vacation rental hours away for December 23rd-28th

or

B) Stay home with my boyfriend and his family with Christmas. (His family is very nice to me and practically a second family. His mother does more for me than mine does.)

The pros for option A would be:
•Spending time with siblings I haven’t seen in months. 
•Going on fun adventures in the city we are visiting. 
•Christmas with family

&amp; the Cons for A:
•Family gets loud and rowdy. (When I visit my parents &amp; 3 younger siblings who live at home, I am usually very stressed and super ready to go home after about 2 hours.)
•Not being with my boyfriend for Christmas. 
•One of my siblings makes me very uncomfortable (for good reason) and I do not like being around him. We would be in the same house for 5 days. (He wouldn’t do anything to me and he doesn’t harbor any ill will towards me. It’s really just about something that happened long ago that still bothers me)
•As with all families, there is lots of yelling and arguing and crying to be had. 
•My mother is a Grade A narcissist 

Option B Pros:
•Not missing my boyfriend over Christmas 
•Avoiding all of the family induced stressors. 
•Saving money by not shelling out $200 to contribute to the rental/travel/activities
•Sleeping in my own bed &amp; not sharing with a sister

&amp; the Cons
•Missing out on fun family activities (A few years ago I went to Texas with a now-ex &amp; my family rented a condo for Christmas. I did have regrets of missing all of the family pictures and fun things they did)
•Not seeing any family for Christmas. 


I’ve talked to a few people about this and they’ve offered some options like having my boyfriend go with me as a buffer (which he won’t do, because he’s not big on my family &amp; his grandfather is very old and we can’t ever really tell when it would be his last Christmas. He would be hurt to miss it) 
or traveling myself and just hanging out for a few days of the trip (hard and unlikely because I can barely pull together my contribution for the rental. I would be riding there &amp; back with my parents.... possibly another Con)

I’ve been mulling this over for about 2 months and I’m genuinely stuck on what to do. I feel like both sides could lead to regrets. Any advice would be super helpful.  (&amp; sorry for the huge wall of text)",05Aug2018,1

329,"That's not a typo. A year or so back I felt like I had mild to moderate depression (undiagnosed, but I'd felt that way for some time), but had been deriving a decent amount of satisfaction out of life trying to date. For reference, I'm a 25 year old male who just recently had a first relationship and sex. The details of that aren't important, other than that now I've finally experienced something I'd been pining over for years and years, I feel sort of...grey inside now that novelty has worn off. 

Life in general just feels kind of grey. It's not bad or anything, but I feel like other people have higher highs and lower lows than I do. My emotions just don't really swing much above or below midline. So, I guess I'm just kind of bored with life. I'm making and saving money, I'm doing some interesting things now and then, but it kind of just feels like I'm constantly on auto-pilot. And when it comes to love, I can't help but wonder if that's an emotion I can actually feel. I like the person I'm with, but I don't love them.

Side note that before you comment about that, our situation isn't typical and we're essentially having a relationship with a scheduled end date. She needed someone after a long breakup and I needed the experience of an actual relationship. It's actually been a really good experience for both of us but it's sort of shown me that my emotions are just so...muted.

Sorry if I'm all over the place. I feel like the advice that can be offered probably isn't that much since my problem isn't really cut and dry. But I just don't know what to do. I miss being a kid when everything felt so crisp and meaningful. I traveled earlier this year and it helped recharge me but I feel like I need an actual drive for my life. The only thing I can think of is having children or something, which isn't something I'm interested in for several more years at least.",05Aug2018,1

334,"Hi. I am a 24 year old girl. I DESPERATELY need some advice. I need to make a plan on how to regulate myself and work towards better emotional regulation in the future.

Please please please I appreciate your help so so much 

A BIT OF BACKGROUND ON ME

As I said I am 24. My father left me when I was a little girl and that totally crippled my self-esteem. I have very low self-worth because of that. I had a life-threatening eating disorder when I was a teenager, and I was sexually abused at 15 and raped very violently at 17 - they were just over a year apart. Apart from that I suffered from depression from about the age of 8 etc., I thought about suicide, I had undiagnosed ADHD until the age of 22 etc. I have been through an awful lot of therapy and can mostly cope with the sexual trauma. I have also radically altered my diet and the depression has improved enormously. However there are two things I cannot cope with: my enormous moodswings and the fact that I collapse. That's right, I collapse - I have mystery fainting spells, at least PARTIALLY or MOSTLY for emotional reasons and they can make life hard to cope with. Apart from that I also suffer from quite bad chronic fatigue etc.

WHAT I NEED ADVICE ON

I am trying to make a PLAN so that I can move forwards to emotional regulation. I want to a pick a number of things to do in the day etc. However I am very busy, am about to start an MSc and in general I have really really low energy. However I am willing to do whatever it takes to cope. However I cannot commit to too much because that never works.

Please note, therapy is no longer an option for me, and I also will not take any medication ever again. Having said this, here are some of the ideas I have, based on my really good former therapist and my own plans:

\-Progressive Muscle Relaxation

\-Once a day?

\- Every two days?

\- Three times a week? 

\- My therapist really really recommended that I do this however I find this incredibly hard to do and also incredibly unpleasant and uncomfortable?

\-Writing down one thing I love about myself each and every day?

\-Writing a gratitude journal?

\-'Radical Acceptance' by Tara Brach - this is a really great book on showing up to and tolerating pain, and on mindfulness- it has lots of techniques and instructions on meditations, body scans, self-compassion etc. It looks good but I don't know how to structure working through it. My therapist really recommended it to me, though. I think that it would really help me. \*This is the one I have the best feeling about by far\*

\-I love to sing and I feel so much better when I do it however I often forget to?

\-I love to dance but it often has to be spontaneous for it to work for me.

\-My therapist recomended a self-compassion meditation for me however I find it really hard to do. I was supposed to do it every day as well but it never really worked out for me (like the progressive muscle one, it is recorded). I thought I could make try and do it once a week? Or not at all? 

\- Finally, I LOVE to go outside- I LOVE to go for walks- I LOVE nature but it is very hard for me to plan it... I have kind of given up on that

I need a REALISTIC plan, that WORKS, I need one I can STICK to, I have been trying to formulate it for YEARS and it never works... but once I have one, I can stop TRYING TO THINK OF ONE, and ACTUALLY STICK TO IT... please please please help me. ",05Aug2018,0

I don't want much out of life anymore. Less than two years ago, I feel like I had goals in life. I wanted an apartment, I wanted to rescue dogs, cats,  chickens, and all kinds of animals. I wanted to have a social life but now I don't want any of those anymore. I honestly don't know what's changed. I've grown up super passionate about animals and my dog and I probably have an unhealthy codependency. I used to be excited at the thought of bringing my dog with me to a new state, a new city and coming home to him but I've felt so disconnected from everything the past year. 

So, I guess the main point that I'm wanting to focus on now is, should I continue going to college if I don't want to? I don't want to be in this town any longer, I don't want the job that's directly tied to the degree. I've continued going on because it's only 2 years and it'd make my parents happy.

The used one is from Motorpoint with 10,000 miles on it. Both have the same specs (diesel, same extras, apart from the new one has a rear camera). 

Im going to be paying via a PCP on the new car which is 200 a month for 3 years, with a final payment of 10,000. A used one i’ll get a bank loan which is 200 pounds a month over 5 years. 

The only difference being that if I get a used one, id keep the car after paying off the loan. If I got a new one id have the 10,000 to pay after. 

The new one I wouldn’t have to do any MOT for 3 years. The used one would have to be MOT’d (2016 reg). 

The new one would have a warranty, but the used one id have to pay extra for one. (After the 8 or so months of the remaining ford warranty). 

Which one would make more sense to do? I drive 80 miles daily for work. Im trying to figure out which makes more financial sense, and whether the pros of a new car (warranty etc) out-way the cons of a nearly new one (less warranty, having to mot...)

Everybody around me told me I need to move on and I should find my self someone, to help me move on. I met this woman, she seemed amazing, and I fell for her very hard.

Two months in to the relationship, I caught her messaging some guy and sharing explicit content. The content was shared to me and I found it strange that she would send me something so random, so randomly. After digging deeper, she found that content for the guy she was chatting to, and then decided to send it to me too.

I forgave her. About two months later, I was on the phone to this women and she informs me her room mate has come home and that she'll call me later. It was customary for her room mate to come home at the time we were speaking. However, this wasn't the case. 5 hours later at around midnight, she calls me and informs me that it wasn't her room mate, but some guy that she met whilst shopping out. She tells me what she did with him, and begins to make fun of my manhood in comparison to his and sends pictures. The next day she said she's sorry, she was crying a lot. She said she was high on dope and cranked after drinking alcohol and she didn't mean anything and was very sorry. We didn't speak for about two weeks and then I forgave her. She said she would not speak to this guy again or meet him again and that she would block his number. I'm not one to check phones, or ask if she's done it, I took her word.

4 months later, I was out shopping at the local mall late evening, and I see her room mate. I go back to my car and call her, she answers, the telly is on and she's out of breath - she tells me her room mate is home and that she's cleaning and she'll call me later.

This type of scenario continued every weekend, until I had concrete evidence of what was going on. She admitted that she never stopped speaking to this guy, all for one week and then continued on as usual. She continued meeting him, and within those 4 months, they only had sex once and nothing else, not even oral. She went on to say that this sex was not even sex, and that he raped her. This woman is a strong woman, not athletic, but strong. As well as this, she said the rape took twice on the sofa, so I find it difficult to understand how penetration took place. I also queried how long these rapes lasted. She said one rape was 10 mins and the other 15 mins. This sounds like sex to me, not rape. I also asked her how she could let a man in her life again after raping her? She said she didn't know what she was doing. (Btw, on one occasion, I left my computer unattended whilst doing some downloads and some pornographic popups came up - she accused me of watching porn and didn't speak to me for weeks, and had a complete bitch fit, despite me explaining that this was a popup, showing my browsing history. The weeks were in the 4 months that she continued cheating) - so I question the fact that I made a mistake, or a mistake that wasn't even my fault, and she banished me, but a guy who raped her she continued with? At this point, the relationship has ended for me, and all that's left is the emotional attachment. But I told her I forgive her, to see how far she'd go.

Moving on, at this point she says she really isn't continuing with him. 2 weeks later, I borrow my friend's Snapchat, add her, and start speaking for about a week and she hands over her number, and also sends explicit photographs. Using a spare phone, I message her saying I'll call her at 7pm. At 7pm we're speaking, and I call her on the other phone, and she tells me her mother is calling her and that she'll call me back. Her mother wasn't calling, she hangs up and answer sand I just begin to laugh.

After a week later, I ask her for her Snapchat, and behold, there are no men on her snapchat, just female friends, and male family members. It's clear that she's deleted everything, I check her block list, it's massive. But she forgot her memories, I open them and they're full of explicit pictures right from the time we met until now.The explicit pictures are her with other guys.

In the next week, I am out dining on my mother's Birthday. I eat something and suffer from a life threatening allergic reaction. I am rushed to the ED, and put on nebuliser, oxygen and steroids to clear my system of the allergen. My airways tightened, and I could no longer breath. As I get to the hospital, I become unconscious due to the lack of oxygen. However, I recover in a matter of minutes as preliminary medicine was committed to me at the restaurant.

When I am aware, I inform the ED staff to inform this cheating woman, because I thought she'd be worried. They inform her of what happened, including the fact that I am in a life threatening position and that I became unconscious and that I am on major intensive care medicine.

She doesn't call, they said that she didn't say much. I was in hospital for a week. On the third day, I call her on no caller ID, and she's with another guy. I can hear them having sex. She asks me who's speaking (I think I sounded different due to the oxygen and nebuliser and that I was unwell). I asked her to think who I could be, and she didn't know. I told her who I am and she hangs up, calls me back after 40 mins and begins to cry. I said I know you were having sex, I could hear the groaning and moaning.

I pretend to forgive her again and hang up telling her I need to sleep after taking my medicine (which I do). After one week in hospital I was due to fly out to Europe on a work trip. I spent 4 weeks there and in those 4 weeks we do not speak once. The crazy thing is, my country's embassy contact me that my GF has reported me missing. I call her and she's upset that I am not speaking to her.

Up and to this point, she still hasn't changed, is on various dating sites. I've got my self checked (hiv, stis etc etc etc), thankfully I am all clean.

During this whole period, it's only been a year and a half since my fiancee passed on. I wasn't my normal self, I know I would never have tolerated this if I wasn't in bereavement.

What this woman has done to me has killed me inside. I have no faith in anything. I do not eat, I only drink water. I haven't had a haircut for months, I've put on weight. I've eaten a lot of chocolate. At the same time, I've lost my job, and have no income and I am living on my savings. I had a lovely job, I was earning $70,000 P/A working as a software developer in a prestigious state in my country (you can guess where).

I've also been hurting myself a lot. I've been crying in showers, punching myself, slapping myself. I haven't cut my self but I've been pulling my hair and scratching my face.

I am extremely depressed. I've had suicidal thoughts but I am 100% I will not do this. But it has ruined me. I have never been like this in my life. But this woman has ruined me, emotionally, physically and mentally.

I don't know how to move on. I am fine when I am with other people, I forget everything (until they mention their good relationships lol). But when I am alone, I feel dead.

I know the above isn't very male like. But I come from a very respectable family, where marriage is important to us, working hard in life, treating people how we want to be treated etc. I only ever dated 2 women (this was the second). The first became my fiancee.

A little about this woman, she's a smoker, but I found that she was a heavy drinker and dope user towards the end of our relationship.

I feel dead. Please help. I have no one else.",05Aug2018,1

I’m a broken, angry, volatile, manipulative person and I’m terrified that my life is built on lies and if I tell the truth it’ll crumble. I want to tell my Dad, but I have trouble understanding why I should do the right thing. I don’t really connect with people the way other people do. I feel guilt for what I’ve done but I think if I confess I’ll lose everything. I can’t justify more lying and I can’t justify telling the truth.

So me and my ex broke up over a year ago but continued having sex. I would always tell myself I’ll stop going back but I never did. He broke up with me but it ended on neutral-ish terms, but I never fully understood why he did. He’d tell me I was perfect, he still loved me etc but then I didn’t understand why we broke up. Fast forward now I’ve had 0 symptoms of pregnancy and my period is usually irregular.. turns out I’m 20 week pregnant, a lot of places are reluctant to give me an abortion.. what I wanna know is.. how can I get over my ex while having his baby, I want us to have a good relationship for the child but I’m still so hurt and it’s hard being around him. We’re basically like best friend but having his child is confusing my brain because we’ve been acting lol couples again.. I wanna distance myself and not get hurt or set unrealistic goals.. should I distance myself from him and only speak/meet for scans/appointments or should I just enjoy my pregnancy with him and worry later? I really need help of how someone would try to get over someone while having a good relationship with them.. thanks ",05Aug2018,2

360,"It seems I've been posting in this sub a lot lately. Oh well here I go again. 

So I have a daughter and she is almost five. Her dad and I split right after she was born. He is extremely mentally, psychologically, and emotionally abusive. He never technically laid a hand on me because he knew better than to do that. For years I have dealt with harrassment, constant threats, and just all around assholish behavior. I already know that he does this in an attempt to have control. I don't do well with that kind of shit. We have gone to mediation and it was all for nothing. He is one of those people where we do things his way or he goes out of his way to make things as difficult for you as possible. Believe me, I still wonder what his appeal was when we first got together. I couldn't go to my grandfather's funeral because he threatened to press charges if I wasn't there to pick up my daughter the following day. The funeral was 400 miles away. He refuses to ever compromise and make things simple. Everything has to be a dramatic event. I just started a new job and I am broke. He is demanding that pay him for expenses for our daughter or he will file for the full amount of child support. He never paid the full amount in child support. Believe me, I've sought out legal assistance many times and they all pretty much say the same thing. ""You can't change him."" So basically I feel like I'm stuck in this position for the next 13 years. This is gonna sound incredibly fucked up but I've legit had the thought of giving up custody just so he would be out of my life. I love my daughter more than life itself but I am exhausted. I've spent years in therapy for PTSD, Anxiety, Depression, and on top of that my hair began falling out due to the stress of the situation. The only thing that has kept me from doing it is pride. I kept thinking ""you can't let him win."" He has her the majority of the time because we both agreed (shockingly) that his school district would be the best for our daughter, so now he has the ability to get child support from me which I am honestly terrified of because I am barely making it as it is. I've constantly thought of ending my life but haven't because again, pride. I'm just lost and defeated and exhausted. Help",05Aug2018,0

It also smells like burnt plastic everytime he goes into his bathroom and the fan is turned on. I also saw some mail that showed he owes 10k on our house and a guy recently came to inspect the inside of the house.

Theres not alot of information on to know why the guy was there but would it be because of the bank wanting to take the house back?

She invited me to a party and she confessed her feelings about me while we both intoxicated and locked outside by her friends, and I felt I deep down had feelings for her too. I got her number and we went on one date. We both had time and I fully understood my feelings for her but I made the mistake of ruining it by not texting her that much after. She must have moved on as she removed me from social media and never texted me again. I realized that it was all my fault that I had ruined an amazing relationship and a potentially amazing relationship and it’s been eating me up for a long time now.

366,So basically I have been a porn addict. It started a couple of years ago when I started to work as a teacher. There are many factors to it but my anxiety and stress is a huge factor. The first years I worked very hard. I was up most nights just working. The problem was that I did it while watching porn and jerking off. My job causes me a lot of stress and anxiety and to deal with these feelings I jerked off. I could stay up late at night working and watching porn. It was like watching porn and jerking off kept me up in the night. Some of my best works was done while I was doing this. Yes its super creepy. Last year I wanted to stop and things have gotten better but one thing I did was that I stopped working at nights. This meant I didnt work as well as before and my boss noted it. They havent complained but everyone has noted how I havent been working as before. I tried to do it before putting grades in the end of the year and as soon as I started to work I felt the anxiety and stress and I started to read erotica and jerk off. I am soon going to start working again. I want to do a good job the year to come but I am so scared that I wont have the stregnth to say no to this. I wanted to start working during this summer but just thinking about it creates urges in me to watch porn and masturbate. I dont want that. What can I do?,05Aug2018,0

She was my stepdads daughter. In some eye this may be fucked up and we have no relations and nobody knows so its not rly an issue. Recently her dad got transfered to Phoenix, AZ for his work. I went with them for 2 weeks and stayed there since id be moving with my mom down there too. 2 weeks later im back in my hometown and i just feel lonely and lost. I cant figure out what im missing in life.

370,"Originally posted to /r/relationships and /r/abuse.

After 1.5 years with him and packing up and leaving everyone and everything in my home state to move 300 miles away with him I finally mustered up the courage and self respect to gather my things when he left for work and leave him this morning.

I’m giving it at least a full day to sink in. He’s got anger issues that I know make it impossible for him to productively process anything for quite a while. We wouldn’t have any kind of useful conversation at this point.

So far, since he found out at about 5pm today I’ve gotten 11 missed calls, two texts, and one voicemail.

The first text was at 5:44, between calls and just said, “please call me, I love you.”

The voicemail at 6:21 was teary and he asked me to just talk for a minute and he told me me loves me.

The next text reads, “We don't have to talk right now, but can you please just let me know that you're OK? I'm worried.”

The relationship isn’t salvageable, he was abusive verbally and emotionally, most recently creeping into some occasional physical abuse. In hindsight it was clearly escalating.

I walked on eggshells most of the time hoping I didn’t accidentally anger him over something trivial, real or imagined. I couldn’t eat what I wanted, wear what I wanted, do anything to the new apartment, go places I wanted, talk about my job because it was at a place he hated. His racism, bigotry, homophobia came out in full force once we lived together. If I did cross this imaginary line he’d completely shut down on me for days at time. I tried to avoid conflict at all costs, preferring to actually communicate effectively and calmly like adults and actually fix the issue. He made it near impossible. Situations would escalate without much provocation. Before I knew it he was calling me ‘bitch’, ‘whore’, and telling me I was a broken person because my mother passed when I was an infant.

My question is what to expect from him next. I haven’t answered him yet. I just left a note when I left earlier, “I’m sorry things couldn’t work out the way we so badly wanted them to. I hope one day you find peace, happiness, and success.”

What tactics will he use? What’s his next move? He’s still in the apartment we both rent that we’re responsible for for the next nine months, how do I go about resolving that? What do I say to him about why I left?

TL;DR what are my next steps in response to handing my abusive boyfriend so I can deal with bringing our relationship completely to a close?

Edit: since my original post he called me again this morning and contacted two mutual friends, both didn't tell him anything but told me he called them. His sister (whom he's refused to communicate with since her birthday in March when he refused to acknowledge it any they've been on rocky ground since) messaged me through Instagram to say that he's worried and he's ""the best person [she] knows and most definitely deserves answers."" Though I know he's put her through the ringer as well.",05Aug2018,3

THEN he comes back with a state trooper. I go watch the camera and long and behold it was his money, however now he's saying he lost even more here.

For most of the party she only talked to me and it seemed like she was into me (though I am pretty bad at reading people). Her sister Olivia, who I am friends with told me that she REALLY likes me. Whether that means just as a friend or more than that I don't know. So the issue is that I am in college and shes a senior in high school and doesn't yet know what school she wants to go to.

The first one is that Emma currently lives across the state from me which is a good 8 hour drive and the second one which  is the biggest one is that Olivia recently told me that Emma was into another guy awhile ago but doesn't think that anything will happen between them because if there was then it would've happened by now and she would've known by now.

379,"So, this is a bit of a long one so short version at the end.

When I was five (14 years ago) my parents got divorced, it was a healthy break up and, as far as I remember, went very smoothly. I settled into the life of moving house every week to spend time with both my parents equally along with my older sister (she was 7). Jump forward about 3 years and my dad meets someone new, let's call her HC. She was also divorced and mother to three children (one older than me, one the same age and one younger, the youngest is extremely autistic). Jump forward several extremely unhealthy break ups and reconciliations and when I was twelve Dad decided to turf up from where he was living to move in with and marry HC. Go forward another couple of years and my little half sister, H, is born. Even though I already dispised HC and her kids for various reasons that could probably fill several chapters of a book I decided to swallow my pride and roll with it because I loved that little ball of screaming poo. Jump forward just six months and HC and Dad have a massive row and the police end up being called. It boils down to then threatening to arrest my dad if he didn't let HC go with my little sister and myself, my dad and my older sister were all in tears because we were convinced that would be the last we see of my little sister. Dad decided it won't be and decided to fight for custody. It takes a couple of years and many loans but eventually he does it! Here's the interesting bit. My dates here are a bit hazy but at some point and I'm fairly sure it was within the last two to three years, HC shat out another child. I was led to believe that this was the offspring of the father of the original litter, I was happy with that and content to spend my days hating HC. Eventually I begin to suspect that my dad and HC are back together again but I can't be sure because by this point I had started boarding college and last September I moved to Scotland (my family are in South Wales). I met the most amazing person here and we will be getting married this September. Tonight, 5 August, AFTER the invites has been sent out, my dad reveals to me that a DNA test has confirmed that HE is the father of the latest offspring. 

SHORT VERSION:

My dad divorces my mum and gets with another woman who messes him about and ruins our lives. He has a daughter with him whom I accept as my sister but then tares her away from us. She had another child who it turns out is also my dad's and it may have been concieved during the fight to win custody of my little sister.

My question to you is this:

Should I have any right to be as angry as I feel?
Is it acceptable that I don't want this other child at my wedding?",05Aug2018,1

385,"Hello lovely people at reddit.

I'm feeling a bit torn at the moment. I'm a 23 year old student self-funding my way through a second degree in modern languages (French, German and Italian) and linguistics. I have about 2 years left of my degree, so far my grades are excellent and I'm balancing work and studies quite well for the most part.

I have a part-time job in a very upmarket supermarket / grocery store where I work two 10 hour shifts on the weekends. My degree is mostly by research and distance learning so I am pretty flexible with my timetable, and where I need to save money each year to pay for university I often take up more hours to put money aside. This arrangement usually works well, though occasionally I have periods of time where I feel very overworked and stressed out, as the availability of overtime can be quite random and so there are some weeks where I work 20 hours, and some weeks where I work 60+ (management are kind, but turn a blind eye to how many hours I willingly sign up for).

The store I work in is in a fairly well to do and cosmopolitan area. Because i've mostly worked in customer facing sections for the last 4 years, and because i'm multilingual, i've been offered a small promotion in a customer facing section, which wouldn't involve any extra stress on the job, but would increase my hours permanently; from 20 hours on Saturday and Sunday, to 36 hours Thursday-Sunday (9 hours each of those days). So i'd work 4 days a week instead of 2.

I'm really in two minds about whether or not to accept this promotion. On the one hand, it would mean a much better regular income, so I wouldn't get as stressed out around Christmas, summer etc. where I make myself ill doing too many hours to desperately save for uni. But on the other hand i'm worried about working 4 days a week permanently while i'm still meant to be studying for my degree.

If you were in my position, do you think it would be more desirable to have a more regular week of working 4 days a week every week, or do you think flexibility is more valuable and I should stick to working 2 days a week, and occasionally doing an insane week or two of working 7 days a week? It's important to note I go to classes on Mondays and sometimes Tuesdays, and work never clashes with university in terms of my timetable.

I'm on this thing that they do in the UK called NCS.

390,"I had a very dysfunction childhood and after a very isolating and dangerous few years in my teens my parents finally split up.

After graduating from college I moved to a different country because I know if I remained in my home country, I would have ended up successfully killing myself. (My home country isn't that great for women lets just say)

So anyway, my mother after splitting up with my father has never really moved on, she doesn't work, relies on social welfare and claims various health issues, now she actually does have a life threatening medical condition that I also have, but the healthcare she gets is very good and she has some issues but it also suppresses your immune system, the most recent being a digestive issue, but she barely eats, the most sometimes being two slices of toast but she is able to drink at least one bottle of wine pretty much daily? Which I don't really understand but hey....

My dads family are old school hardcore catholics and there was a lot of violence for him growing up which also continued to me growing up so that cycle continued and well they viewed my mother never in the highest regard because she came from a working class background. Meaning that myself and my brother were the black sheep merely for being born. Growing up I had so many snide comments made about my weight from my dads sisters, from the age of 7 which has somewhat helped me end up the way I am concerning my self image and self hatred. I have never been overweight but started puberty very very early so from a young age I have been dealing with a wide variety of random stranger sexual harassment. I certainly didn't need to commented about it as well from my own family.... This is also probably stems from a catholic thing as well cause original sin blame women/girls for having bodies etc etc.

As for my mothers family, well I just have a lot of questions about their childhood. My mother praises my dead grandfather ie her father as being an amazing lovely man, yet all of her siblings are quite mentally fucked up. I never met the man so I cannot say and from others i met they say the same thing who met him but I just feel theres something amiss fundamentally particularly with how my mother has become....

I grew up in a very poor part of my country and went to college and did rather well through my own hard work, while my brother dropped out of school at 15 and developed addiction issues to coke and alcohol. He like my mother never seems able to hold themselves accountable in order to be willing to change themselves for the better.

I have been through a lot of therapy as a teen and in my early 20s and family therapy was ALWAYS suggested but my mother refused, this frustrated one psychiatrist in particular and he told me I was the bravest person he knew, which floored me then and still does. My brother after an issue with the law was ordered to attend anger management and he was told by the practitioner there as according to him, that he needed to move out of my mother's home in order to curb his anger. I don't know if this is true but who knows.

My brother wastes so much money on alcohol and drugs but never seems to be considerate or responsible. he never thinks about his own actions and the long term effects of them, and I always seem to end up trying to sort out his life for him which i cant be bothered doing anymore cause he is a fucking 20 something adult and is never grateful for anything I do or try to sort out for him.

I have begun to understand that my childhood with my family has greatly impacted me and fucked up my romantic/platonic relationships and I am so concerned that I am just going to have no one if i cut off contact because i am unlovable because I am damaged goods.

I am planning on writing my mother/brother and father a letter stating why i want them to be better healthy people because they deserve it and for also my sake if they care about our relationship. Because well I was the fucking one that bothered with therapy and made the necessary changes to improve myself etc.

I am quite scared but yeah don't really have many options and while it feels like a last option it really is my only option it feels.",05Aug2018,0

I have no place to go, no job, no form of transportation. I have absolutely zero skills (I don't even know how to cook if that tells you anything) and my only job experience was working at a certain fast food place that rhymes with Rickdonald's for not even a month. I should have stuck with it, but I was undisciplined, had no patience, and just couldn't take it anymore. I won't do fast food ever again though. It just freaks me out too much. Can't seem to handle being around so many people.

I am currently living at my grandparent's house, but they will be going to assisted living soon. After they move, I have no idea what I will be doing or where I will be going. My parents are currently housing my brother, his wife, and my nephew and their house has no more room in it for me. One aunt is planning on roaming the country and my other aunt won't let me stay with her.

I am thinking that maybe I should just kill myself at this point, because that makes the most sense to me. I don't really have anything to lose and it's not like I have anywhere to go or anything useful to do. I feel like I am just a waste of space and oxygen.

As You can read in my previous post, Im not doing very well. My only friend left (Im in a work with live-in conditions) and Im not doing very well. I find the rest of the staff fake and I dont want to hang out with them. So that leaves me alone in a 7 days a week job in a roadhouse so, nothing close. I dont leave because money is good and Id never be able to save this much. Thats why Im looking for an online friend. I dont post it on /r/r4r because Im not looking for someone to flirt or to exchange pictures. I just need someone that I can share my daily life and also talk about how I feel. I can appreciate having someone to advice me about how to deal with my life. 

Im sorry to be picky, but id prefer someone near my age (im 31) and males because I tend to connect better with the opposite sex. Also Im a good listener so if you are dealing with some shit I can also lend an ear and we can figure out together how to live better.

397,"So theres a girl that I knew for like, basically a whole school year and one summer vacation, but we mainly started to talk over the summer vacation. We had a class together and we mainly talked because we worked on a project together along with some friends, and after that we started to talk a lot I guess. Like after class, we would walk together to where we get picked up and would talk for upwards of like, 45 mins and 20 mins at the least. One time my friends and I were going to the movies and I invited her, and we met up at 2 PM. My friends and I were in a Target and then she comes, so she and I just walk around the Target, her and I, just having fun and looking at random stuff and laughing and having a good time. Then we go to the movies, we got popcorn and sat together and made jokes throughout the movie (Mainly was me making her laugh but we both did that, just I was doing it more). Afterwards, we all, my friends included, walk around the area of stores and movie theather as a group, going in and out of stores and having fun. Like we went a PetSmart and she was going where I was going, like from the cats to the hamsters, without me asking her to come to me, as she just came with me. And we went a Best Buy and we played some Mario Kart, which she beat me, and she watched me play some Mario Odyssey, whichh she called me trash at. Then our friends left and it was her and I looking in the bargain bin for movies to make fun of, which we did for like 20 mins. Skip some time and our friends all leave the area to go home, except for her and I, which we stay at the area and walk around for like 30 mins and talk, just her and I. While yes, there were some times when we would be silent, we would look at eachother and smile and then soon after would pick up our conversation again.

She and I text but its not like, throughout the day and its not a lot but its a good amount. Also, during the summer class, we had to get partners and our teacher would pair the kids, and we got paired alot to which we just made jokes while working together. And this was for warmups, and when he didnt let us go to others, some days he would make kids call on someone else, and she would always call on me to say my answers and I would do that as well.

My friends and I were going to hang out again, and I asked her but she was going on vacation that day, so I asked if she wanted to hang out the day before then, to which she said yes she does, but she will have to ask her parents. Her parents said no, she leaves for vacation.

Im asking for advice on how to ask her out, as I have never really asked any girl out to be my girlfriend. I have had 2/3 girlfriends before (one was just for 2 weeks and we did nothing so doesnt really count) and every time, it was the girl who really started it or told me she had feelings so I would say ""Oh then lets do something"" and yea, except one time, this one girl and I had a mutual friend who hooked us up and as a joke I asked her out and she said yea even though we were technically dating.

Also, related to this sort of, all of those relationships failed, lasted for three months, which was the longest, and my other one was about a month. And I just told a different girl not too recently but kind of recently that I liked her for almost a year, and she said that while she used to feel something and that she wishes she can make me happy, she cant and that she wants to stay friends, which I said is perfectly fine, and helped me move on from her I guess.

So any help to a guy trying to ask a girl out to be in a relationship, such as what to say?",05Aug2018,1
398,"Looking for encouragement, support, advice. Please. 

I'm 35/F, in the past my relationships have been long-term monogamous, I'm not used to being single.  
As someone who's very socially isolated and struggles to make connections with people this has been really hard.

I was with someone for five years, it was long-distance and we'd planned on getting married so I could immigrate but something got in the way so for a time we barely saw each other - we still talked daily, but that's not the same - I was in limbo and when we broke-up (Sept 2016) I found myself firmly back in my home country with nothing. It was the biggest mistake of my life. During that time I had no male attention, although of course I wasn't looking but I think it speaks for how difficult it is for me to meet any guys who might be interested in dating me.

In the last two years this is how my dating life has looked...

**Date #1** \- Via dating app. In November 2016 I went on my fist date, ever (previously relationships had come from friendships), it seemed to be the perfect first date as we got on so well and had so much in common. We kissed at the end, for weeks either side of the date he'd been texting daily, he asked me on another date but I couldn't go as I'd already promised to help a friend but I said I'd go on a date another time and we continued to talk. He went quiet after a few days.

**Date #2** \- Via dating app. Seemed a perfect match on paper, good date, but no chemistry for me and he didn't want kids which is a deal breaker, also TBH I liked another guy I went on a date with around the same time (#3). I ended it.

**Date #3** \- Via dating app. Dating him for two months, tried to keep things casual but turns out I can't do that and I just felt unusually anxious in this 'relationship' with him...it turned out he was a narcissist: while together he was lovebombing and while apart he was gaslighting, he was trying manipulate me into an open relationship. I ended it.

**Date #4** \- Via a one-night-stand. My first on-night-stand, I'd have been fine with leaving it at that but he insisted on taking me out on a date, a week of texting/calling and effort convincing me he'd treat me well. He ghosted after the first date.

**Date #5** \- Via dating app. Dating him for two months, casual as he had a lot of personal issues at the time, I tried to keep things chill but he was basically a bit of a mess emotionally and so emotionally unavailable. I ended it.

**Relationship** \- Via dating app originally, but didn't get together until a year later when met at a Meetup. May 2018 we got together, it felt like I'd potentially found The One and he seemed to be right there with me so I didn't have to fear being too full-on, I'd never felt so safe and so valued. But we started having augments that stated from tiny misunderstandings, arguments included him not listening to me and pulling things I said apart, he started to gaslight and when I tried to talk to him about it he dumped me. He got nasty and cut me out of his life like I was nothing. He ended it after two months.

Now...

I'm not even in the mood to date, never mind the thought of having to have a 'rebound' before trying to find 'The One' again...I half want to date just to meet new people and get the rebound out the way, but I also of course want The One to happen already! I know it's normal to worry you'll never find anyone as good as your ex but honestly the last relationship felt like nothing I'd had before so I do really worry I'll not find anything like that again. Add to this the fact I'm socially isolated so it's hard to meet people, let alone people I can get on with and who I could then go on to have a relationship with. Dating apps seem like the only way to meet someone, but I've had little luck with those (only a handful of messages, which don't get past the initial 'How are you?' etc. small talk), they're also full of people like those I list above.

People's advice is 'learn to be on your own'...I know how to be on my own, but that aside it's not like I have time to faff about 'finding myself', I feel like I've got to get back out there but I also feel hugely discouraged.",05Aug2018,2

I usually tell my parents to tell him to stop and I have occasionally (although extremely awkward and embarrassing) have asked him to stop.

He still does it sometimes though. I always cringe when he's about to do it but it really seems like a habit.

Everytime when he doesn't have anything he just instinctively puts his hand in his boxers.

He has a developmental disorder so I thought, at first, that he just didn't know how to communicate socially and needed a conversation partner. But getting these messages over and over for years reached a breaking point for me.

403,"For the last three months or so, I've been working for a landscaping company close to my parent's house while I've been home for the summer, since I go to a school that's 3 states away. It's been going well, and I'm happy with how my financial situation is, even though it's a little rough, but for just starting to do work regularly, it's good. 

But I've noticed something about myself that is not going very well. I think of myself as a very creative person: I write music, draw large scale maps, create languages, and play sandbox video games. But lately, I've had very little motivation to do any of that stuff. I'll try to do something for 30 minutes, but I just get burnt out so easily and just watch YouTube for hours doing nothing while I can't think of anything creative to do, or if I do, it's just a fleeting thought that just goes away after 5 minutes. This has been going on for at least the past month, and it's gotten me really down. I'm not so I feel like I used to be.

Couple other things that might be important: I don't really consider myself either introverted or extroverted. I'm kinda both, depending on the day. I don't mind being alone, but social situations don't drain me out. Probably the best I've felt this summer was just a week ago when I got to see a friend from school after not seeing him for 2 months, and I almost feel like I'm just counting down the days until August 26, the day before school starts. The other thing is that my family does have a history of depression and related issues. I'm pretty sure that has little to do with it, but it does seem like it might be connected to how I feel. I know men can get depression (if that's the right word?) and it's much harder to notice, but it seems pretty far off.

408,"I've run into a problem and I don't know where I'm going wrong here- so please set me straight.

I started nannying for an aunt and uncle that I adore- like, they were basically my pseudo parents for the longest time. Well, they have four kids (going on six), and since no one is older than first grade, and I babysat in the past, they asked if I wanted to nanny full time after college.

I happily agreed to this- I love this family (would take a bullet, hide the body, pledge my loyalty, etc etc). I asked for a rate of 15 an hour- which I was shocked to find out is grossly underpaid for the amount of work I do and number of kids I watch, but I didn't mind because- again, they've done a lot for me.

So pay day comes in, and my uncle is almost a hundred short. I told him that wasn't okay, we had an agreed pay, and I am a kick-ass employee, so he needs to give me what I earned. I thought that was super reasonable and not an issue. But he turned the whole conversation around on me, basically said 'if we went through and looked at all the times we've been generous to you, I think you'd see that you owe us', and made me feel like I was somehow being super ungrateful for everything they do for me.

I watch four kids soon to be six, I clean the playrooms when the kids don't pick up, I clean the kitchen, do dishes, laundry, and any extra chores my aunt can think of to help out. I'm feeling super hurt that he basically called me ungrateful for what is essentially fair pay, and I don't know if my anger is justified or somewhere along the way I DID turn into an ungrateful bitch.

I am supposed to start medical school in a month, and if I get arrested there, I can kiss that opportunity goodbye.

I am also on really good terms with my parents. I was younger and less mature when I went there last time, but they would never have imagined that I could do the thing I did.

I would never do that again, but if you surprise your parents so much once, they'll lose trust in you.

They have spent a lot of money on the trip though, and if I fake an excuse not to go, I will feel awful. I also really don't like lying anymore.

410,"There are several reasons I’m no longer happy with my boyfriend of three years. Too keep this short and not overbearing, I’ll try listing them as a bulleted list.

 -He cheated on me over the course of three months with his ex-girlfriend three months into our relationship (didn’t find out till seven months into our relationship).

-Caught him flirting with another girl in his phone seven months after that.

-Caught him flirting with _another_ girl in his phone eight months after that (last summer). (Since then no other cheating behaviors have taken place to my knowledge.)

-The sex is bad, I never finish and he never takes the initiative to rectify that.

-We are constantly doing things he wants to do, but he never does anything I want us to do together.

-I do the majority of the house work without help.

-He lied to me about doing drugs 4x. 

-We have poor communication  (imo) and as a result I have this deep feeling of not feeling understood. 

There are good things about him. He’s remorseful about cheating, claims he loves me and only wants to be with me. He is kind-hearted and sweet. Still, all this has made me unhappy. I want to leave, but his brother just died and he’s very depressed. I can’t abandon him in the midst of this. Also, the highs are good, and the lows are bad. The food makes me want to stay, but I feel like these little bursts of happiness aren’t worth the overwhelming feeling I have of being unfulfilled, unhappy, and unattractive (due to cheating).

The first 2 years of our relationship were incredible. She was so happy her eyes and smile were always so bright. Eventually I got caught up with a bunch of stupid friends. Getting drunk and doing dumb shit, letting girls groom me. I had a bunch of whores (sorry for my language but they were) on my snapchat.

I do not blame anyone for my actions. I take complete responsibility. I was peer pressured but at the end of the day it was my decision.

Am I right to be annoyed at Emma a bit since like she’s known me since I was 4, I’ve always been there for her, been at the hospital everyday when she’s had her kidney transplant and since (waking up at 5:45am some days) am going though testing to give her a kidney (this girl didn’t even message her while she was in hospital) for one and isn’t taking my side or even being there for me, and two is saying she will support me in what I choose as if there’s a) one option that’s right and b) that I have any options in this situation or am I being annoyed at Emma just because I want someone to be annoyed at",05Aug2018,1
