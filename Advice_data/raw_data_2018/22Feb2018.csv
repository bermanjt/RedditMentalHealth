0,"It all started out when I was about 12 and developed severe depression, which came with anxiety and IBS, I'm 18 now. I've recently left off for college and my life is deteriorating, I'm currently at the lowest point of my life; I haven't showered in more than a week, nor have I brushed my teeth, merely because of my depression that has sucked the life out of me. I also believe I'm developing body dysmorphia as a result of my lack of growth and rapid hair-loss, I feel cheated, robbed of my youth, with all the odds stacked against me. I've tried speaking to my parents about it, but them coming from a country and culture that doesn't believe in the importance of mental health, I get yelled at and constantly called a failure. The fact that I hate the country I'm studying in and can't find an ounce of passion for the subject I'm studying makes me cry myself to sleep. I've always been passionate about medicine, studying science in school and always excelling, trying to get through my depression, but I completely lost it that last year of high school and barely scrapped it, getting into medical school with the minimum grades required, despite being the top student the year before. I've currently experienced less than a fourth of my expected lifespan and I'm contemplating suicide, I've failed every single exam I've sat so far, and am expecting to fail all the exams to come, I've also failed to attend many of my lectures, which is on my permanent record and I've got plenty of exams and meetings to attend about my attendance and performance, I'm definitely soon to be kicked out. Nothing is going well for me in life, literally nothing, my health, both mental and physical is worsening by the minute, as I said earlier, I'm being robbed of my youth at such a young age. I'm at the verge of suicide, I've tried counselling and it did nothing but reinforce my suicidal thoughts, I've tried literally everything, but I'm quickly dying on the inside, and not even my family is there to help me. You guys are my last resort, I'm scared of myself, how I've managed to mentally overcome the primal instinct of survival by always contemplating suicide, with ease. What's the purpose of life at this point if I'm enduring unwanted suffering?",22Feb2018,4
2,"Whether you agree or disagree with gun regulation, I don't care. I'm not asking for advice on that, I'm asking for advice on protesting.

With that being said, here is my dilemma.

I go to a large high school that is well-known in the community for how many students have mental health issues. In the wake of the MSD School Shooting in Florida, my school administrators have done little about the aftermath of the situation. Today, they banned the discussion of the event between students; anyone who talks about it or anything relating to it is threaten with detention and suspension. 

Needless to say, several people were pissed about this.

With the rise in students performing walkouts around the country, I decided that I wanted to organize one with the students at my school in protest of both the administration for their pitiful response, and to the actual political part of the situation. However, my school has prohibited this conversation AND I've never organized a protest before.

I'm looking for any advice at all on how to go about this. ",22Feb2018,2
3,"Hi all,

A friend of mine is finishing her teachers certification program in Texas, and the school she's working at is causing so much stress that her autoimmune disorder is having extremely frequent flare ups. She has to complete her first year to get her certification, but the job might actually kill her before she finishes the year. Does she have any other options beyond quitting and scrapping all the progress with this program?

Thank you!",22Feb2018,2

7,"Hello Reddit, 

I was recently accepted to medical school and while I'm ecstatic that my dreams have come into fruition, I am terrified of my future as a medical student. I'm fearful that my low self-esteem and self-confidence will only be amplified by the pressures of medical school, particularly through group interaction and not knowing enough when speaking with patients. I'm afraid that these kinds of interactions will snowball into an extremely unhealthy levels self-loathing... 

I would consider myself a perfectionist, and I think that is a huge part of the problem.. I think I've conditioned myself from a young age to always feel like I'm being judged and negatively thought about (thus driving me to ""do better and try harder""). The drawback to this is that it causes me to freeze in groups of people I am not familiar with and to often-times stumble on my words, making me seem/feel incompetent, further snowballing the situation even more....I know I am an exponentially more intelligent person than I make myself out to be...  Additionally, I take too much of what people say to heart. 

I want nothing more than to be the best physician I could possibly be and deliver high-quality care for the people that need it. I know that medicine is for me, and is the career path that I want to pursue but I need help with overcoming these feelings. If I don't, I'm afraid it will all consume me during medical school, which is becoming increasingly team based....  What can I do to confront my feelings of incompetence, low self-confidence, and self-loathing... I really want to try to resolve this so I can be the best person and doctor I can be... Thanks guys..

8,"I think that my wife's wedding ring was stolen by my sons friend. My son had a friend G, over one day and while they were playing in his room, my wife took off her rings (two of them) and set them on her dresser to do some dishes. She didn't put the ring on right away and the friend goes home. The next day my wife realizes that her wedding ring is missing but not the other one (they were right next to each other). I have confronted G but she denies taking it. G is only 7 and lives very close to us.

10,"Hi, for some context, I am a 16 year old female. My friend is also a 16 year old female. For this we will call my friend K. K and I met online around 5 or 6 years ago and have spoken virtually every day ever since. I used to really like her and was very supportive of her. Her mum had cancer and died in 2015 so I always tried to be there for her. K got into a relationship with another girl (who she also met online), managed to break up with her but still misses her. Now she's dating a boy who is a bit older than her and rather forceful. She also does dangerous things like driving in cars which are essentially death traps (apparently no seatbelts and she said she almost got in a crash). She says all these negative things about her boyfriend and I keep telling her to break up with him but she says ""nahhh lol"". To make matters worse, K believes she is depressed and self harms. So basically this girl hasn't got an easy life which is why it's hard for me to stop being her friend. I don't hate her or anything and I feel mean saying all this but I have my own issues and I genuinely believe K doesn't care at all. For example, my cat is very sick and so is my mum and I've been telling K but she just says ok and starts talking about her own problems again. I feel like this girl is using me and I do not want to be her friend anymore, but I'm the only person who she can talk to and I don't want her to go and kill herself (which she keeps saying she will do, sometimes joking, sometimes not). I have hinted many times that I think she should see a professional rather than me but she won't, everything I suggest is met with ""maybe"" or ""no"". I have enough on my plate right now and all I want is for us both to be happy, and I want her to meet some new friends so she doesn't rely on me anymore.

Again, I don't mean to sound harsh, and I know that people in this sort of state need help but I don't think I am fit to help this girl. I just want to focus on my own life and get on with my studies etc, instead of constantly worrying about if this girl is even alive or not. She literally just told me she's going to self harm then go to bed!! I'm gonna go insane because she won't stop despite me telling her to!

I choose it since it was good money and kept me balanced and trying something new since school had hit a plateau  and I wanted something that was out of my comfort zone.

27,"First off, I'm an adult (24). I'm living with my parents temporarily after illness and incidents of harassment with former roommates, and am a full time student, not a freeloader. I'm not some rebellious child who went  and got a piercing illegally or anything like that. Also I have a lip piercing that I've had for almost 6 years that my parents are used to seeing.
I got my septum pierced about two weeks ago using my own money that I earned at my job. Neither of my parents like body mods, but my dad realises that it's something that I like and he doesn't think any less of me because of it.
My mom on the other hand has treated me like a stranger since I got it done. She refused to even speak to me for several days, and now she's just saying hi when she sees me like I'm a stranger passing by on the street. No emotion, monotone, no eye contact. She's been very open about her feelings about people with piercings, and thinks that body mods mean you're a criminal. I never expected her to like either of my piercings, but I feel like it's unfair that she seems to think I'm a bad person because of them. She's known me my whole life and knows I'm not a criminal. She hasn't even reacted positively to me doing well in school anymore since getting this done.
It probably seems like a silly and childish thing to be upset over, but I don't like how my mom will barely look at me and when she does she looks at me like I've done something terrible or she's afraid of me. It seems like she thinks that me getting the piercing is a personal attack against her, which is absolutely not the case. It hurts.
Has anyone else had similar issues with parents reacting poorly to a piercing or tattoo? I know most parents aren't necessarily happy about body mods but of all my friends who have them nobody has ever had a parent give them the silent treatment for it.
She wasn't happy with the lip piercing either but she wasn't as mad as she is now. I'm not really sure how to go about this, since I know if I try to talk to her about it she'll just storm away mad and won't talk to me for the rest of the day..",22Feb2018,3

32,"Hello all. I apologize for the length, I just wanted to provide enough detail to get a better understanding of this situation. 

Here's my situation: My sister (the primary caregiver) and I are trying to accommodate our diabetic 71 year old mother with mild dementia. In 2011, our mom had pneumonia and ended up having a stroke and a heart attack. Since then, life has changed. Mom can no longer drive, her vision is very impaired (the stroke destroyed part of her vision and she has macular degeneration). My sister ended up becoming power of attorney and mom cannot take care of her own financial affairs. She's currently bankrupt (which happened later on after the stroke). My mother lives with my sister and bro in law with niece and nephew. 


I live an hour and 45 mins from my mom and sister. I visit them every two or three weekends. I used to visit once or twice a month for longer periods of time, but to try and be fair to my husband and be helpful to my sis on the days mom is home, I lean towards weekends. 


Leaving so often has caused some problems in the marriage. My husband has voiced the fact that he doesn't like when I have to leave and he feels like he's the dispensable one in the matter. He has been patient, but even when he holds it in, I know he's upset about the situation and it just gets awkward. Part of his frustration is also because he knows mom doesn't take care of herself properly. He already is stressed with work and this has caused extra stress. It's not easy when my time at home isn't quite guaranteed. I'm basically on call and it's disheartening when I have to drop the news that mom is sick/at hospital/it's my time to go help with mom/dr. appointment and I have to leave. I do my best to try and avoid talking about my family's tension and health issues. I don't think he truly gets that we are stuck in a rough place. If I could fix it all, I could. 


1. Nursing homes are very expensive and she doesn't qualify for a nursing home at this time. She's currently under bankruptcy, so that makes things very tricky. 

2. She can't live with us because my husband smokes and we don't have the type of things she would need (walk in shower, an extra room, higher toilets, etc.) 

3. Getting a private nurse to come and help can be quite costly for what we would need the nurse to do.

My mother and sister have a lot of tension due to my mother constantly complaining, not taking care of herself how she is supposed to (sometimes doesn't want to check her blood sugars, sometimes gives a hard time taking medication, not drinking enough water, wanting to eat the wrong things, not exercising, etc.) and giving attitude every now and then which is mostly unwarranted. Mom is depressed, but she would never admit it even though she told me she doesn't want to live how she is living anymore. She's very good at putting up a front for others, but immediate family knows how she really is. 

I hate hearing my phone ring or hear a text prompt mainly because I expect it to be a combination of news about something mom has done, venting or something health related.


We are younger caretakers (32 and 38) and we dealt with this earlier than the average caretaker. My sister is handling so much and I'm doing what I can to try and help without upsetting my husband leaving so much, and without upsetting my sister where she feels she is doing this alone. Things have not gotten easier at all. I'm sorry this is so long.

38,"I've had insomnia as long as I can remember. Usually it's nothing too bad, and was solved by good sleep hygiene. Currently I am 17 and a senior in hs, and insomnia is starting to consume my life. I am not certain why it became worse, but around 6 weeks ago my insomnia became very serious. For around 3 weeks straight I was literally unable to sleep without laying in bed for 5-10 hours. I would just lay in bed with my eyes closed and try to sleep, then end up not getting any sleep at all not being able to go to school because of how tired I felt. For the past 3 weeks, I've been drinking night time cold medicine (nyquil) to go to sleep during weekdays, but when I don't take it, it still feels impossible to sleep without being awake for a very long time.

I'm at a loss and I don't know what to do, as it is ruining my school life with how much work I am missing. Also, I'll just list out the different things I do as part of my sleep hygiene.

Running 2-3 times a week. Gym 3 times a week. Only use my bed for sleeping. All screens turned to night mode at 11pm. No screens for at least 30 min before I sleep. No caffeine past 2pm. I have a consistent time I go to bed, but the time I actually fall asleep varies greatly due to insomnia. I've tried eating a big meal before sleeping, or not eating very much before sleeping, both don't help. I eat a healthy diet. I've tried getting out of bed after an hour of no sleep and just relaxing by listening to music or meditating until I'm tired, but I still can't sleep when I go back to bed.

I used to be the friend who would get in such lovey-dovey moods and send you paragraphs about how much i love and appreciate you because of how much love i felt inside. I used to be a hopeless romantic, thinking of falling in love one day, daydreaming situations with my dream guy. Now as I’ve gotten older I don’t feel as empathetic. I feel that the only reason why i pretend to care for my friends is so that I don’t end up alone, which is one of my greatest fears. I have periods where i feel so alone i cry thinking about my future and how no one is ever going to love me because I can’t love them back. I strongly believe i’ll never fall in love because i feel no connections with any of the people I’ve talked to.

45,"A little backstory, we've been dating for almost 7 months and we love each other, but we're always fighting about my current job. She wants me to quit and obviously I don't want to.

A bit about my job, pros and cons included. 

Essentially, I'm a door knocker for a solar company. It's commission only, no benefits (if I don't work I don't get paid), hours are 11-7 and there is no hourly wage.

I enjoy the job, because it gets me out talking to people, helps with my confidence and anxiety as well. I help the environment and help owners get a solar system on their roof. We put it on their roof at no cost and only use the money we save them to pay it off, so there are no out of pocket expenses or outlay fee's. As a normal rep, I'm making anywhere between 600-1000 dollars a week. Highest being $1455. 

I've recently been promoted into a mangers roll, so I need to train and develop other people to thrive and succeed. I've also now for a base wage, of $400 a week. I enjoy this position because it gives me a sense of how to manage, be organised and could potentially to future positions at other companies. 

Obviously if I have a shit week, then I don't get money. Her main concerns are that it's not a fixed amount of money I'm getting per week and that it's a seemingly ""dodgey"" company, which I assumed at first, too, but later realised it isn't.

She also hates everyone I work with. Her reasons being that ""if I hate them I won't fight with you as much', which is a valid point, but she's also insecure and if I even talk to a female co-worker, she'll flip out and say ""why don't you go hang out with your hoes"".

How to I get her off my case and to just accept that I like this job, without breaking up with her. Or any criticism you guys might have as to why I should quit.

47,"So I work at a school and I just put in my two weeks. The reason I put in my two weeks is because the head of the school treats the children in questionable ways, specifically her verbal tone with them. She's just straight up cold to them and always seems irritated. At some point you say ""fuck this, I can't work in this environment"" and you bounce. 

Well, I have two more days left and we have been SUPER short staffed which has amped up the behavior that is causing me to leave. At this point, it feels morally questionable to continue there, and I hate being a part of something that makes me so unhappy. 

I ALSO am true to my words and try to always keep my commitments, and I absolutely adore the children. I really don't want to burn any bridges. What should I do? Stay for the next two days and suffer mentally, or bounce and let the children and my school down? ",22Feb2018,3

53,"It was early 2016 when I downloaded Kik for the first time. This guy I’m going to call J hit me up and we started talking like friends. He seemed to want to explore his sexuality, but still having doubts about being straight... J was really kind and gave myself so much attention. We traded some pics but he was just too good to be true. He even sent me (non-sexual) videos but never doing something I wanted him to. 

The thing is: he ghosted for like 2 months or so and then came back with less romance and more sexting. He always wanted me to send nude pics or videos and I wouldn’t say no. By that time, I was already falling in love and feared he would ghost again if I didn’t do exactly what he wanted me to.

Time goes on and he started to send messages with less frequency. But he came back asking to videochat while we were naked. I was hesitant but didn’t say no... Again. Turned out he was who he said he was, I couldn’t hear his voice because I was so uncomfortable doing that. Knowing he was the guy in the pics made it even harder for me.

After this day, he would spend less time online but whenever he was on Kik, I was supposed to send him whatever he wanted to. He did send me some pics and videos as well, so it wasn’t that bad. A few weeks later he said his mom was so mad at him for being on Skype with guys (yeah he said guys, so probably I wasn’t the only one).

After that, he would contact me once or twice in a month and by October he disappeared from the app. I started looking for him online and found many of his social media. I got really obsessed with him. I just discovered his phone number, his address, where he studies, major... Everything I could find online. I guess just to make me feel a little bit closer to him? Maybe.

After a year trying to find other guys online and offline, I decided to send J a message asking what happened and he didn’t even remember me. He said he was drunk and my name didn’t brought any memory... He was really kind (for someone talking to a stranger lol) and the next morning he literally stopped answering. I was wondering if he was afraid of this ‘stranger’ or he just remembered me and didn’t want to go into it again. 

I believe the reason why he wanted to go online to search for boys was because he came from a very homophobe family. On the other hand, I went online because I just couldn’t find someone offline and was tired of failing. I guess my loneliness made it worse, so I really fell in love with this guy and don’t know how to stop thinking of him. I don’t even know if I should...",22Feb2018,2
54,"Hi, I'm new to this sub so sorry if bad formatting.

I'm currently in 9th grade at my high school. I have a ~96 average, take all honors and am advanced track for math. I take 3 main extracurriculars and am part of a few clubs as well as Vice President of the Student Council. I recently got a 33 on the ACT and 1440 on the 10/11 PSAT.

In my school, I'm planning to take about 5 AP courses by the end of junior year (physics and math related), and I know I will have enough credits to graduate by that time. I simply don't see the merit in staying in high school an extra year when most colleges don't ask for a senior transcript. I also feel that the extra year of extracurriculars won't make much of a difference seeing as I take so many already.

I'm planning to go to a STEM or medical college (not sure yet) but I'm going to UWM for undergraduate seeing as I'll probably get a full ride scholarship.

55,"2 weeks ago my ex dumped me in front of his family. We’ve always had a rocky relationship. The first 3 months of us dating, he cheated on my 3 times. I forgave him then right after I moved in with him. Deep down I knew he wasn’t the one for me, but we made it work. We broke up again but then got back together. After that, it was all good. He was my best friend, we had fun but we always argued all the time. But I was so used to him and the home we shared that I never thought of leaving him. He told me all his secrets (when he was 24 he used to sleep with men). BTW I am 22 and he’s 28. So we had many differences. With his family it was very hard to get along with, they never made me feel welcome but they were still nice. Anyway, he pushed me to become a better person get a better job. He would also put me down all the time, calling me trash a “spick” a nobody and to him that was his way of helping. I was never happy. But again I stayed because I was so used to him and we’ve been together for 2 years. Throughout that time, he would tell me how all he ex’s were crazy how he cheated on them (and of course add me to tat list). I was bored with him but I was so used to him. Mentally draining and hurt, I didn’t give up on him. I met almost all his family, we hung out with his parents a lot. From the outside we looked perfect, but inside he mentally abused me. It wasn’t up until 2 weeks ago that his brother, his GF and his parents we all wen to happy hour. I got so drunk that I accidentally hit him hard and he got pissed. We went back to his parents and he broke up with me through his mom. Me and drunk and embarrassed started crying how he’s always abused me and how he slept with men (this was benign stupid and petty at that point). I would’ve never said that to hurt him or his mom. They all yelled at me and told me to get out. He packed my stuff like trash and his dad called me an Uber to my parents. Since then, I’ve cried tried getting him back (he’s already found someone and he straight up told me he’s being talking to he for a while). I’m still hurt. Less hurt than I was 2 weeks ago. His family blocked me. He hates me. He kinda texts me but either being nice, telling me to die and forget him or about the new girl he’s met. It hurts me how he’s going to fall in love while he broke me down. I already know we’re not meant to be. But how do I get past this?

They next they will post about how comical life is and how pointless their existence is. This has been going on for a couple of years now.

I’ve applied to transfer this fall, but I’ve been hit with a bit of dilemma.

To give you sort of a short background; I was raised by an abusive narcissistic grandmother. I graduate HS 2 years early last year, and have been in community college ever since.

1. Lie and say I’m transferring to an in state school. Take the train under the guise of heading to campus, but in reality I get off and go to the airport.

2. Sneak out and never return without a single word. Not too hard since she sleeps deeply, and I could waltz out the door at any given time without her knowing.

3. Actually tell her where I’m going, but don’t talk to her ever again still.

72,"I'm coming up on my 25th birthday this year which I think is a major catalyst for my feelings of disrest. I feel like I should be much further ahead in my life than I am.

I graduated college a few years back with a bachelors in Psych. I began working in the field as an aide to kiddos with Autism in a school system right out of college, and was actually accepted and attended graduate school to become a BCBA. For my last 2 years of undergrad I thought this was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, but upon beginning the graduate program I panicked that it might not actually be what I wanted, and dropped out after one month. I continued working at the school for 2 years, and just recently left as the pay was pathetic and unsustainable.

In early November I started a new position elsewhere as a Behavior Therapist for children on the spectrum, and I am finding that I really dislike my job and find it hard to motivate myself to go every day. I am feeling incredibly burnt out, and not at all passionate about helping these kids, which is very unfair to them as they deserve someone who is able to give their all. Lately I've been feeling like I want to pursue something completely different than what I am currently doing.

But the problem is I have no idea what that ""something"" is. There is nothing in particular that I feel very passionate about pursuing. I have no idea what other positions I could even search for or apply to as I've only ever worked with the developmentally disabled and I feel like I have zero relevant experience in anything else. I feel like if I even landed an interview for something, I'll have nothing relevant to talk about. 

I think I'll need to go back to school for a degree in something else, but I have no clue what I would even want to go for, and don't want to waste more money on something I'm not 100% sure about. I honestly really regret getting a BA in Psych as it is absolutely useless.

On top of that, I hate where I am currently living. Because I landed a job right out of my undergrad, I stayed in close vicinity to my college town. Even though I don't love this area, it was okay at first as I made several friends around here, but lately everyone has kind of gone their separate ways and I feel lonely often. I'm not particularly fond of my apartment, but I am lucky enough to have incredibly cheap rent ($250) and it is not an option to rent elsewhere on my income. 

My only other option would be to move an hour away back home with my parents to save money and figure out what the hell I am doing. I am reluctant to do this, as my boyfriend of 1 year lives in my college town and this would mean transitioning to a long distance relationship. I'm not particularly happy in my relationship right now as it is, and I think the distance would break us.

So Friday rolls around and we did it. My hymn isn’t intact because idk it just isn’t but I’m not loose lol. So it didn’t hurt when he put it in. But it didn’t feel good at all.

Not to mention Mr. It’s Important didn’t put any time or effort into me. I realized all the way at the end I didn’t even like him as much as I thought I did. 

He left and then I balled my eyes out. I genuinely considered that I was Asexual because I hated it so much. Im repulsed by the thought of sex and the fact that I even did it. I can’t get turned on and I feel dirty.

I am dead set on going to college, but I can't decide exactly WHERE to go. I want to go to school to become a band director in Texas (where I currently reside). I understand that my family we will never become rich off my salary, but music is a passion of mine that I want to make a career out of. Anyways, these are my options and I'd like you all to help me determine what you believe the better choice is.

Option A: Attend local community college ($60/cred hr) for a year with full (maybe) reimbursement.
 After this I would transfer to a school nearby that offers a full ride scholarship if you meet certain requirements (GPA, financial need, etc.)

I like this option because I can stay home close to my job and avoid going into debt. We also have people we trust nearby that can help us with our baby. 
I don't like it because it'd take a couple years to get our life started as a family. The cost of housing around my area is higher than we'd be able to manage, so taking this route means we'd stay with our parents a few more years.

Option B: Go straight to MSSU ($200/cred hr and no student fees) in Joplin, MO with free housing (1st year guaranteed, not sure about others) and a partial scholarship. I met with an instructor at the school who was willing to take me in his home for a few days and get a feel of the campus/area. 

I like this option because it allows me to experience life in a different state. There's not much financial risk involved. I get to attend a small university for 4-5 years. Not every student gets the chance to attend school out of state w/o worrying about housing costs.
I don't like this option because my girlfriend, who will move there with me, won't get to be there with me to decide if she will really want to move. I have to commute 4-6 hours to get back to Texas to go to work and for my girlfriend to visit family.

(Edit) Also even if I ask people to text me or hmu, no-one does and a lot of people just end up leaving me on read because I end up running out of things to talk about, this whole ordeal has really started to take a toll mentally so I feel like I'm the one at fault.",22Feb2018,2

100,"Before I get into anything, I should let you know I’m currently manic (I have bipolar disorder) so this may be all over the place. Some sentences may have grammar or spelling mistakes. I apologize in advance.

Here’s the situation. I’m a college student and am currently employed by an on campus organization through the work study program because of my lack of funds. (I work at a radio station) Because of my schedule I’ve had to cut work days down to just 1 a week, 3 hours at a time. I’ve only been back at work for 3 weeks after winter break ended and I missed last week because of what I’m
About to explain. Lately, over the past 6 weeks or so, I’ve had symptoms of hypoglycemia. Tbh Lord knows what it could be. I’m dizzy, lightheaded, fatigued, shaky, I feel faint often, regardless of what I eat (which is usually sugary foods because I still haven’t been treated for this yet) and stuff like that. You know the feeling you get when you’re really tired and your eyes start to kind of focus in and out? That’s what I feel like most of the day. Nothing is getting better. I’m miserable because of all of this. The only time I’m not feeling symptoms is when I’m laying down, and even then they’re slight. I’ve been to doctors and I have an appointment coming up, but until then I have nothing to help me. I also fell while walking off the bus and down the stairs today because of how dizzy I get. I often find myself drifting off and at least once or twice a day I have to lay down so I don’t pass out. I’m also having lapses of memory, where I go an hour or so and have no idea what just happened the entire time. 

 I have to work tomorrow, however I’m still feeling awful. Obviously it’s not contagious, but I still feel as though I won’t be able to live up to my full potential if that makes sense. I’m afraid of being fired, however I realize that I’m a student worker and I’m protected under the disability laws on campus, which they are aware of. I’m also criticized by my mother whenever I miss something because I’m sick. But she also expects me to go to class if I have a fever. As much as I hate this job (I really do. It’s awful. Add that to my horrendous work load and a full schedule along with psych issues.. you get it), I do need it because I don’t have any outside support from family, money wise. I’ve been dealing with a shopping addiction so not having any extra from paychecks is distressing (not end of the world but it’s still difficult with an addiction of which I’m being treated for) but at the same time it wouldn’t be any different than how I’ve been living since I got back from winter break. I’m clearly manic here I’m sorry. I guess I just want some advice. Should I call out tomorrow? Really struggling here. As you can see. ",22Feb2018,2

102,"Another crap school year. I told myself this year would be different, and Id have at least some friends. I dont want to be super popular but it would be nice to have my own group of friends. I litterally have none. I also think I have social anxiety disorder. For example, I literally ate my lunch in the bathroom ( disgusting  I know but desperate times call for desperate measures) until a teacher caught me because I would always sit by myself at lunch. Even when on rare occasions when girls invited me to their table I’d never have anything to talk about because they would talk about people I dont know or topics that dont interest me. It would always be so awkward for me. Now I go to the library and never eat lunch. Sometimes the kids will be too noisy or the librarian will have a class already in their so I go in the bathroom for the rest of the lunch period. 
  Whenever we have to work in a group assignment Im always the last picked. Sometimes the teacher has to say something and its embarrassing. But I get it. People think im too boring and quiet. But im really not. I like to talk , and laugh. Id really care about a person that was my friend. I hate being such a quiet introverted person. I get jealous seeing girls joke around, do each other’s hair, hug, tell jokes, talk about meeting up and having sleepovers. They dont know how lucky they are. Just being close to a girl makes me feel happy and fantasize about us being friends. Id do anything to have just one best  friend id really care about. 
 I hate being quiet so much. I get nervous and have to mentally prepare myself for saying just one sentence when i work with a group. I have a lot to say, jokes to tell, opinions to give, so mich to say. I feel like it would be weird to just randomly join someones conversation. Like, how do I even start talking to people to begin a friendship? Most already have established friend groups. Girls talk about people I dont know so how could I even join in? What are some good ways to start a conversation and get to know a person better so I can make friends? Please help. I dont want to be like this anymore. Its miserable and my one of my worst fears is growing up all lonely and introverted. I dont want to regret middle school and highschool. This is not the life I want to have.
Oh and another problem I have is when girls do talk to me, its just small talk that wont get anywhere in a friendship. Its very frustrating. Im tired of not having any BEST friends! I want things to be better next year. I want to end this cycle of years with no friends. Leave your advice please!",22Feb2018,3

I just wanted to know if I was in the wrong, since they react so negatively every time my light is on.

i've been really antsy about moving out, especially lately. i would only sign a 6 month lease, i'm going to school in september and wanted to give it a shot before then. i figure i would be able to pay up to (but hopefully not) $800 a month, given that utilities and services are included. some local 1 bedrooms or studios ive found online are $650-700.  if i move, id have to start paying auto insurance which would be another ~$200/month. the money saved with public transit does not compete with my time saved driving. i would also need to set up my own internet (another $50/month according to local rates). im fairly thrifty so stuff like bathroom accessories, pots, pans, kitchen utensils and all the usual furnishings are not something im concerned with. my home space is some what cramped and most of the time i feel very unproductive/uncomfortable. i think moving out would be a good feel for independence, even if only temporary. 

on the other hand, would it be better to just continue saving my money and using the rest towards a car? my dad can get me a deal for $4000 on a car he feels is reliable (hes an experienced mechanic). maybe im just too heartset on keeping that $4000 in my account? it also puts a momentary damper on my potentially moving out, as id have to resave for a deposit. the coupe car is not really my style as i know this summer i want to go on trips and will encounter gravel/steep mountain roads. 

a lot of the time i make decisions based on impulse/emotions. i know my wanting to move out is really just wanting to be on my own/do things without bugging my parents but am i romanticizing it too much? i can further explain this, just dont want to make a wall of text. 

i hope ive been concise enough about the situation. please, any advice, questions and recommendations are greatly appreciated! thanks. ",22Feb2018,2
108,"So my roommate has been through quite the rough patch this past year. He had a nasty breakup with his girlfriend and dropped out of college several months later. He’s still working though, but he told me he’s planning on just not working and being homeless for the rest of his life. He hasn’t cut his hair or shaved in months. He said he doesn’t want to work for anyone and he’d like the free time, and when I asked him what he plans on doing in his free time he said he’ll just be on the computer and read stuff. I asked him what he plans on doing if he gets sick or injured and he said he’ll just kill himself. 

I’m really worried about him since he basically seems to hate life and doesn’t give a shit about anything. Everyone he’s told has been against this plan but he’s not one to listen to others. I’ve also suggested counseling but he wouldn’t listen to that either.

I’m really into the outdoors (hiking, kayaking, rock climbing). I love dogs.. way more than the average “dog lover.” I’m extremely conscious of the planet and do my best to limit my personal impact and footprint. I also really love functional and sustainable products and design. 

Ive done a lot of thinking about what my strengths and weaknesses are to try to find my path. I’m great at editing/revising others work and enjoy helping others succeed. I’m a thinker and researcher so, usually I can come up with a solution to any problem. I find it easy to empathize with others and understand their wants and needs. I’m creative but not necessarily an artist. I have the ability to come up with a lot of ideas and sometimes they’re whack but end up being really good ideas. I’m fast paced but I know how to slow down when needed. 

I care too much most of the time and I’ve found that it causes me a great deal of stress. I don’t fair well with extremely tedious tasks or with tasks that require constant repetition. Im not fond of writing. My attention span can be short if I don’t find something interesting. I learn really fast and don’t like dealing with extra fluff. Once I get something I like to move on immediately. 

I’ve also thought about what I want. I want to be doing research and creating something that does good. I don’t care a ton about how much money I make as long as I’m not living paycheck to paycheck ($50k-$75k). I don’t want to work for a company that doesn’t care about the environment. I’d love to have something that provides unique challenges every day/week/month. 

Paths I’ve considered:
UX Design (though I don’t enjoy the UI parts)
Product Design (love the idea phase but not the graphic design parts)
Environmental Engineer 
Something dealing with sustainability maybe with materials 
Chemical Engineer

117,"This whole thing is dumb. So, my boyfriend is and has always been obsessed with being 'healthy'. He only eats organic food, has specific ideas about what is healthy and what isn't (no mac n cheese even if its organic), etc. Recently he started intermittent fasting because he saw on some videos on youtube that it is supposed to be really healthy. 


This was the first thing to make me uncomfortable. As it is, he is ridiculously small. Now, I don't mind, I love him as he is. But he is only a few pounds away from being underweight and I know that IF causes weight loss, so I started to worry. 


Now he has started excersizing along with fasting. And his weight went from 132 to 129. This really freaked me out, and I talked with him about it. The thing is, he doesnt see the problem. He actually thinks he could stand to lose weight. He seems to want to gain muscle, but he eats so little (despite his claims that he eats a LOT... he eats almost the same as I do on a good day, which is still very little) and I've told him he cant gain muscle unless he eats more than he burns, but i dont know - he doesnt seem to hear me. This might be in part because he considers himself some kind of health expert when it comes to this stuff. He also has said that he wont lost weight, that he never has really, and he knows his body, etc. 


Even his doctor said he needs to watch his weight, because it shouldnt go down, but he doesnt seem to care at all and its infuriating! He said to me that he wouldnt mind being underweight just for the novelty of it. I... this really pains me. I dont know what to do with this. I dont want him to become underweight. I told him this is disordered thinking and he laughed it off, and again inget the feeling that he isnt listening or understanding my concerns, but i dont know how to convey them otherwise.


On top of all this, ive been struggling with what im scared to call an eating disorder of my own. Since last summer i have already lost 20 pounds from my new habit of fasting and restricting. I blame it on lack of money and this is partly true, but it is also very purposeful. I want to eat nothing, i want to be very thin. Im now down to 120 pounds myself, smaller than ive ever been in my life. I start getting better and being happy with myself, but now with all this stuff with my boyfriends weight, its almost as if I feel threatened or something by him. My brain makes me want to stop eating for days fow whatever reason when my boyfriend and i talk like this - maybe to make him see that what he is doing is wrong, or in a bid for attention, or I dont know. If I fully understood it, I might be able to better stop it.

But then, because of this, I wonder if my rapid change in weight and focus on eating virtually nothing has negatively influenced him, resulting in what we have currently... what if his new eating habits and weight loss are actually his own subconscious ways of trying to get MY attention and care? I dont know, but it cant go on like this.


Any and all advice welcome, thank you!!

The root of the conflict is over some minor mistakes on some of these orders, I would like to preface this with a bit of background information. I VERY rarely mess an order up, and if I do I always take steps to try and resolve the problem no matter what it is. Unfortunately shit does happen, and sometimes it's out of my control. A customer might change their mind at the last second/forget to mention something on their order. Alas I'm only human, I'm not a mind-reader and I'm also not afraid to say that I make mistakes just like everyone else. I'm also very new to this job (A grand total of 4 weeks to be exact) and despite all of this being common knowledge at my work place, the co-worker in question treats me like an idiot and is always rude and condescending. He makes very snide comments when I ask him questions about the food like ""You should know this already"" or other such gems like ""jesus, why didn't you ask the customer it was for here/to-go?"" after they change their mind (despite the fact that I ALWAYS ask, and repeat back the orders in full, just so he can't bitch about it)  his demeanor makes me feel like I cannot reason with him, he's totally unapproachable. At first I thought it was just me, and I tried to be understanding and work with it. However, it turns out at least 3-4 other people have had the exact same problems with him. I have raised this issue multiple times now with him AND with my managers and they all seem unwilling/incapable of doing anything about it.

One job which I applied to (which was a chemical manufacturing company) required me to fill out a 9 page application form, which I printed off but I never got around to doing it. After being turned down or ignored by every job that I applied to I decided to go around town and ask in person if any job positions were available, which is how I got the job I am currently in.


 Fast forward to last week, and one of my coworkers asks if I applied for a job, which I replied yes to. I then asked if somewhere in particular had gotten into contact with her, but she said she wasnt allowed to tell me.


 Fast forward to an hour ago. I get home from work and my mum asks me if I applied to a chemical manufactoring company. I said yes and I now knew who it was because I only applied to one company which had anything to do with chemicals. She said they were going to give me a full time job but they didnt because I didnt complete their application form. I then asked what else they said but she said it was confidential.


 Im just wondering why they would tell the people around me that I could have had a job but not contact me directly.

124,"I am having a very difficult time trying to figure out what I want to do in life. I just turned 26 and I thought I’d have a career and be on my own by now. But that’s far from where I’m at and I’m scared I won’t figure it out. 

I have a degree in biology and I do not want to be a biologist or a doctor. I have student debt and I need to start making a proper income to pay it off. But there isn’t much I can do with a biology degree unless I go into more schooling. I didn’t get that well of a GPA because I was young and never had real responsibilities before until I got into college and it was difficult for me to adjust. Going into college I had no clue what to major in and didn’t know what I wanted so I chose business pre-med. I took a semester of business and realized stocks and margins and all that business stuff was something I probably won’t be good at. So I switched to biology and assumed I would get into med school. During class, all the material made since and I did well on the homework and quizzes. However, I didn’t study for exams because the thought of it stressed me out and I procrastinated. So I didn’t do too well on exams, which led to the meh GPA. During that time I knew it would be hard for me to get into med school and just the thought of med school and exams and matching and the possibility of not matching to a residency or doing well on the USMLE was just too much for me. And then the life of a physician didn’t seem appealing either. At the time I thought I’d be married by now and possibly starting a family. 

So I graduated and didn’t know what I wanted to do. I barely knew anything about physician Assistant (PA) programs but decided that is what I would do instead. I took some post bacc classes and did much better than undergrad because I was able to handle the stress better. Then decided I still have no clue what I wanted and moved abroad for a year and taught English. I had the best time of my life abroad and didn’t want to leave, but I had student debt that ESL teacher salary couldn’t pay it off and moved back to America. I didn’t really like teaching English because I suck at it, but helping the students grow made me happy. I might not have been a great English teacher, but I tried my best. I don’t think I’m creative enough to have stimulating lessons. 

I’m back in America and still hadn’t  seen what a PA does and everyone thought I’d be decent at physical therapy (PT) and I blindly agreed. I started volunteering at a rehabilitation center with PT and occupational therapy and realized I’m not into it. This was hard and I was even more lost. A year goes by and I got a job at a medical office that had two PAs. I got to witness first hand what they do and I thought I could do that. And I applied to PA school knowing I don’t have a competitive GPA and didn’t get in. I don’t mind applying again and even a third time, but I don’t know if I want it bad enough. I just know I wouldn’t hate doing it. And that doesn’t motivate me enough to spend countless hours and thousands of dollars for an application. 

So this is where I’m at. Not sure at all what I want to do and in debt living at home at 26. How do I figure this out??

One of my friends texted my parents about the bedbugs and were told to tell the front desk which we have yet to do. One of my teachers who is chaperoning also switched rooms after finding a bed bug. any tips on solving my problem?,22Feb2018,1
135,"I live in the state of Ohio. Recently I started homeschooling when I was half way finished with the 7th grade in a public school. I was getting excellent grades, I always been a honor roll or a straight A student and always had no trouble understanding what we're learning about. I always caught on quickly to our subjects. I had to start being home schooled because I dislocated two knees at school so I wasn't able to take a long walk to the RTA a transportation to school. I could've took a school bus but they wouldn't allow 7th grade and higher to ride on the buses because of a new law. They knew I wasn't capable of walking everyday and in extreme weather with two dislocated knees and crutches but, they knew that. I couldn't get a ride to school either, and our car transmission broke. So that's where I started homeschool. It wasn't easy, my grades were dropping I couldn't understand what we were learning about. They'd show us a equation and expect us to know it all it seemed like. There was no teachers to walk through it with you, you'd have to email them and wait hours or even a day or two later. When the teachers responded they never seemed to help, they always told me to contact our provider and that was useless. One semester they made me restart my entire homeschool when I was finally doing good because they said I was getting horrible grades, which I wasn't I even showed my parents I had good grades I had one B and the rest of my courses were A's. Then they said I stopped doing my work and that I had no history of doing my courses online though I did, so  they gave me a third chance again. I was doing my work and honestly, again it was too difficult and assignments weren't turning in they kept not popping up for the teachers so I had to keep redoing them and getting zeros because they wouldn't show up. I was failing miserably, again my counselor for homeschool Ms.Church gave me a week to try and redeem myself, and she said I wasn't turning in work which I admit this time I wasn't but this is the first. I don't want to make excuses but I'm so unbelievably stressed and I feel so dead to even wake myself up in the morning, I just go back to bed to not have to deal with anything going on, so I ignored my school work this time. I had such a smart brother he was like a walking encyclopedia, he was so creative and he wrote stories like no other, he was phenomenal at drawing, he's really humorous and a cool kid, he is 16 now. He recently in september he was cracking up till the point he's hearing voices. Getting help him was difficult this is the second time he is back in a psych ward, this happened so suddenly. He was diagnosed with Psychotic Depression and honestly, I felt so bad for him all I can do was chase him around the house and cry and try to comfort him while he's screaming on the floor all day and saying bizzare things how he's going to die so a few days ago he got back in to the psych ward and found out way before he cracked up he was doing many drugs with his ""friends"" like LSD,Xanax, ambien and ect. I live with my grand parents with custody, I have a bedridden dying grandfather who can't move and is on tube feedings so I have to help out a lot, my grandmother is a good women and everyone depends on her todo everything for them and provide everyone money and she is stressed herself. My father with no custody lives with us and we can't seem to get rid of him he's a mentally ill guy himself and traumatizing he is bi-polar and he talks to himself all night and yells loudly to people that aren't even there at three in the morning and he's violent. We've called the cops many times and that's doing no use, we would have to go down town and get him evicted but we don't have the extra money to do so. I have a uncle living with us who constantly threatens to kill himself, he use to be a really kind guy and he was going to college and he was just the kind of friend everyone needs to be there for them, but he started cracking up over electronic stuff and being paranoid.I have many other family issues going on and people with mental issues and I have no friends anymore since I left to do homeschool, I suffer with bad anxiety and I can't handle school I'm surprised I was even coping with doing public school so amazingly but now that I did homeschool  there was too much going on to cope with it so today they kicked me off homeschool earlier. I'm going to fail the 7th grade since I missed so many days and no work and school is about to end so I was wondering, is it legal to just stop attending any school for the rest of this school year and when school starts again, I'll redo the 7th grade and yes I am willing to redo the school year I need to own up to my mistakes because this isn't like me, my public school teachers will even be surprised. I won't be signed into any school either and not attending I'll just be waiting till the next school year starts and then I'll go back to my old public school. So it that legal or not? I don't see the point of going back to school and finishing the rest of the year when I already for sure failed, and could just redo it all when school starts again?",22Feb2018,0
136,"I took a look at myself a little while ago, and I realized that I have a lot of hobbies and projects I would like to get into and learn about. I went out and bought a lot of books on different things I want to learn or get into. As Ive been reading them, I cant help but get overwhelmed by the information, or distracted, and give up. 

1. I try to give about thirty minutes each day (up to an hour) for each thing I want to learn, but I wonder if this is the best way to study. Should I keep fitting them all in every day, or would spreading them out more be better?

2. Should I focus more on learning a particular hobby/project one at a time, or keep trying to learn them all at once?

3. I take notes while im reading, to try and help me retain the information better. While I feel I retain more from what I read by doing this, it definetelty makes it a little more tedious. Is there a better way to absorb the information?

Any other tips would be really appreciated!",22Feb2018,1

138,"Hey there!

So I am a new, budding artist. My work is *mostly* around fantasy such as video game characters and fantasy landscapes. I really want to try attending a local Con to sell prints of my work but I am super unsure of where to start or the potential cost of getting prints made.

I work in ink, watercolour, and acrylic. Most of my work is 11in.x15in. but I also have a couple really sweet 5ftx5ft+ canvases of landscapes like Skyrim, etc. I'm not too worried if I can't have prints of something that large, I can always showcase the original.

I know a booth at the Con is $350 CAD, I don't know what to expect for cost of prints or the amount of prints I should have for one image. Any advice would be amazing!

140,"I am trying to move April 1st, I should know if I got an apartment I applied for last weekend within the next day or 2.

But shit with my roommate has gotten very out of hand. Last night I was contacted by a gay autistic man that we've both known for years. He told me that up until recently my roommate would sneak out to his house and pay his phone bills and buy him video games, in turn my roommate would beat the shit out of this guy and choke him and spit on him and call him a faggot. I dont know if they had sex, but the worst part is that my roommate has this guy convinced this is some sort of loving relationship and the guy is just lost and slow and doesn't know any better. Apparently my roommate told him that if he tells anyone, he's going to kill himself.

I dont know if I should bring this up to my roommate or not. I would definitely wait until after I move if I do. A good friend told me that if I don't I will be a snake for the rest of my life. My brother (former childhood friend of my roommate) said that he's probably closeted and if I expose him or bring it up he will be traumatized.

I am completely lost. On one hand I don't think this behavior or manipulation is appropriate whatsoever, on the other hand I dont want a suicide on my hands. My roommate recently got a girlfriend and blocked this guy, and said he ""never wants her to find out about him"" which kinda seemed extreme, but now I understand why he feels this way. I am so confused as to what to do. ",22Feb2018,1

146,"I seem to be doing great in my life academically. I’ve earned a masters degree from an amazing place. Had lots of fun over the years. But now having graduated and not being able to find a job has put me in a very bad state of mind. I’ve my college debt to worry about and am ashamed of asking money from my dad for about 23 years now. 

I get it that this is a transition that everyone goes through. But I don’t want to end up depressed and thus let go of opportunities that come my way.

148,"My boyfriend, a few friends and I are a going on a trip to Vegas in a couple of weeks. One of my friends decided to cancel, leaving a spot open. This spot was given to a guy that I briefly talked too for about a month. Nothing serious at all. He’s a mutual friend of everyone but my boyfriend, and he didn’t even want a relationship with me. 

So my boyfriend finds out and he freaks! He went on to say that the fact that the guy was going on the trip with all of us was disrespectful to him and that it was going to do nothing but make him (my boyfriend) awkward and uncomfortable. He then gives an ultimatum. “If the guy you liked goes on the trip, I’m not going. It’s me or him.”

I didn’t even invite the guy! So I have absolutely no real say on who goes and who doesn’t. I love my boyfriend with all my heart and he knows that. I would never initially do anything to hurt him nor would I sit back and let someone disrespect him. And when I ask him what about this situation makes him so worried or so upset he can only answers with a simple, “ I don’t like it.”   

I personally don’t see the problem. And that fact that I can be totally chill, level headed and not at all suspicious or jealous of him working at the same job as his ex that he lived with and dated for a year everyday; I don’t know why four days around a guy that I never even had real feeling for, or a guy they never had real feelings for me, would make him so uncomfortable. 

Am I being insensitive? What should I do? I’ve been so stressed out and so depressed and just really need a little vacation so I really was looking forward to this trip and 100% plan on going. I just hate for something like this to ruin a good relationship because I have no feelings for the guy whatsoever and I always do my best to make my man feel loved.

I’ve always wanted one, but now as I’m here with the order in front of me, I’m second guessing myself. 

On one hand, the money won’t last long in 2 years when I’m in college, so I can at least enjoy it now and then have a desktop throughout college as well. 

On the other hand, that money could be used for a car down payment, assuming I will need a car where I’m going, as I might not.

I used to feel excited, everything was so much more entertaining, and I just felt content and generally just good. Obviously not 24/7 who does, but things just felt right. After I started high school (I'm a senior now) things slowly went downhill, then got really bad, then started to normalize more. Now I have been told by therapists and psychiatrists etc. that it is depression but I am not like the typical depressed person I hear about.

160,Please take this seriously I’m really confused. I’m a 32 year old black man. I have no problems with homosexuality at all but this seems different than that. So i work at a place and there are two guys that consistently basically hit on me but more predatory. So one guy he stares at me so hard it feels like Superman heat beams coming out of his eyes. Like looking at someone is one thing but this man stares and even when i make a effort to say “ what’s up man” he just lustfully keeps looking. We’d be in the elevator and he’d stand really close and stare at me not saying a word and i know being a man it should be blah blah blah but it’s such a fuckin weird feeling. The second guy is a upper management guy. Every time i see him he says things like “ hey you i missed you yesterday” and he ALWAYS finds some way to touch me or my chest or rub my shoulders or something. One time he brushed past and touched my ass. Like i dont wanna hit him which is my natural reaction. Not hit him because of or if he his gay ( he’s married be there are rumors he’s atleast bi) but because he repeatedly touches me everyday. What should i do ?

This is a post about one such person.)

OK! SO. 

Be me 4 years ago: 25/f, no prospects, no job, no education, depressed, overweight and anxious 24/7. Keeping a blog on tumblr, and chatting passively with people in my same fandoms. Strike up a sort of friendship/acquaintanceship with another queer girl (about the same age) that lasts for over a year. Said queer girl is pretty great, though she lives approximately 2,000 miles away from me. We don't talk every day, but we relate to each other hard on being certain issues (the terror of growing up and being expected to be an adult, the impossibility of dating, of being overweight and trying to love yourself.) We might also occasionally flirt from time to time, possibly? 

(Possibly. Maybe. Flirting with other girls is dumb is stupid, how even do you do this. The point is she called me cute a few times, and she said a few times that she was glad she knew me, and that we were friends it kind of gave me all sorts of rediculous rainbow heart eyes, etc, etc.)

Be me 3 years ago: 26, and an absolute fuck up who doesn't know how to be a person, and who decides to completely abandon that blog on tumblr and just kind of quietly set fire to that part of my internet socializing. Let depression swallow you whole, and make vague assurances to people (though not her included...) who reach out that 'No, I'm ok, nothing is wrong, I'll be back, haha.'

(Never actually go back.)

Be me now: 29, and getting my shit together. Employed, making active efforts to loose weight and be healthier, and happier, and to love myself... Occasionally check on her blog from time to time, and even though she doesn't post, know she's still around by the fact that her 'likes' page is occasionally updated. 

... Is it weird, to drop her a note, now, 4 years removed, like 'Hey, sorry I disappeared, but I kind of miss you, even though we weren't even really that close.'?

I mean, I'd be lying if I said I didn't still have a mild crush on her, or rather who she was back then. I don't expect her to still be the person she was then or even single, but it would be nice if I could add her on snapchat or something just to kind of... See her around, and the person she came into being.

(Part of me knows that's probably not healthy, and thinks I should just let this go and be realistic.)

So I caved to peer pressure of my now ex boyfriends mom and destroyed his phone after she told me to.

I was under the impression that his mother had paid for and was paying for the phone.  It was actually his father and stepmother paying for it.  His mom ended up telling them that I destroyed it (leaving her involvement out out it) once I pissed her off.  Now they want me to pay the full amount back.  

Personally I don’t want to pay them back because of what they have put me through and the fact that their son destroyed my laptop (by accident they all say) the day after I got it fixed and I ended up having to drop out of school because I couldn’t hope to stay caught up and all my finished assignments and notes were now gone.

I’m not saying I wasn’t in the wrong, because I was but I see it as I wasn’t the only one pressing for the phone to get destroyed.  I want to offer to pay half and his mom cover the other half or not pay it at all.

Let me give some background. Me and some friends are going to festival in a few months time. We booked our tickets and extras back in November. We avoided mentioning it to this friend as we didn't want him to attend. 

Why we didn't invited this guy. Hes the type of guy who as soon as he gets a girlfriend he disappears off the face of the earth. You could be best mates one day then the next hes gone, as soon as that relationship ends he comes and barges his way back into the group. Hes also very demanding/needy and if you tell him ""No"" then he will winge and moan until he gets his way.

The event was sold out but now some tickets for the event have become available and now he wants to come.  

The majority in the group don't want him to attend but we don't know how to say this without completely destroying the guy.

174,"TL;DR at the bottom) I went on 3 dates with a girl, Jan. We talked a lot. On the third date we hooked up. I like her as a person but Tbh she just didn’t make me feel good. I got bad vibes from the experience. I haven’t seen her since we hooked up a month ago. We both seemed to ghost eachother. But she would reach out sometimes and I’d reply. It’s obviously done now right? Well Jan posted some stuff on Instagram a week ago (Valentines Day) and it was like “when you hit it off but then they stop talking to you forever” memes. Now, I’m not a smart man but that’s very oddly specific to our situation. 

Add to the mix that I’ve started seeing a new girl, Angela. Angela makes me feel good but we are just friend right now. I want to ask angela out soon. However, Angela has a friend she sometimes sees known as Heather. Heather is BEST FRIENDS with Jan. I didn’t really know/consider this when I hooked up with Jan. Jan obviously feels...something about what happened. Heather might tell Angela I hooked up withJan before I do. Should I attain closure with Jan and/or tell Angela about it if she agrees to start a relationship with me? When should I do this?

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180213005702/en/Terror-Risks-Europe-Increase-2018-Islamic-State%E2%80%99s

ISIS fighters are returning to europe - plus getting released out of jail, to join the thousands of other muslims on terror watch lists. (the mi5 released a report about the thousands of muslms on a terror watch list not breitbart or somewhere)

There's probably going to be more terrorist attacks. Why aren't people more worried? Especially as it's so easy for a terrorist to run people over.

And no offence - but with thousands of muslims coming into europe monthly, no end in sight to the migrant crisis, there's just going be so many more problems - terrorism wise - cultural wise too as mass migration doesn't lead to much integration. What with mass migration and their high birth rates, plus europeans having low birth rates, they can easily start to turn european countries into muslim countries over the next few decades.

Yes I could get hired by a company or Civilian contractor without the degree but what then? Eventually I’ll reach as high as I can go in that company. I’d need a degree to advance higher. Yet once again, I cannot convince myself that a college degree is worth it.

193,"Hi all
Not sure if this is the best subreddit for this topic but I’d appreciate any input as I’ve been thinking about this for some time.

So for the past 15 years, it’s just been my mother and I (20F). My parents divorced when I was very young, and my mother has never been with anyone else since. I’m an only child. I’ve been attending college off and on, but at the moment I am working full time and do not have plans if going back to school as I like the path I am on with my current company. 

Ever since graduating high school, I’ve had hopes of getting my own place (rent), and living alone. I really enjoy being alone (something I attribute to being an only child and having spent so much of my time alone growing up) and being independent. My mom and I get alone, but we argue almost daily about trivial things such as cleaning. I’m definitely not the neatest person around, and that really gets on her nerves. Of course there are other things as well such as what time I come back home and stuff too. Of course living at home has its pros, saying money, getting home cooked meals all the time and more 

With my fathers death, I have enough money for a down payment on a condo or money for rent to get myself on my feet.

I’ve tried bringing up me moving out, but she always says how’s she’s not ready to have me leave yet, and somehow always manages me make me feel guilty. However the thing I do not understand is that if she’s always complaining about my lifestyle, why can’t I move out? Do I have the wrong way of thinking? 

She doesn’t have many friends here, so I guess she wants me to stay with her so she’s not lonely.  But how long do I have o stay with her for? Forever? Do I have to sacrifice my own independence and desires? Am I heartless for wanting to be on my own? I’m sick of people saying things like “are you really going to leave your mom?” to me when I tell them how I feel. 

The only pro I see to keep on living with my mom is to save money as if we lived together we could split rent/a mortgage instead of both paying ourselves.

198,"Need help deciding how to interact with the woman I was once in love with from here on out

TL;DR 

I am very conflicted on how I should treat my ex-girlfriend and our relationship, what I do now will probably affect a lot of my life from here on.

So, my girlfriend of 3 years and I recently broke up, she wanted to be with a guy she's dated in the past etc. 
Our relationship didn't end badly, we still talk almost daily and make jokes about what we used to be. She's not a perfect girl, or even a great one, but I was able to accept her flaws and needs and was ready for marriage etc. The other guy isn't a bad person, but I was present in her life when they were together in the past (and I am not confident it will succeed now)

My problem is how I am dealing with the end of our relationship. I can't allow myself to hate her for trying to find a person who can make her happier, but it's very hard for me to know that her ""happiness"" isn't me. She doesn't have many friends, and we still talk for hours a day (she tells me about her problems, share stories, I try to get her in a better mood, etc.). I can come to terms with her and the other man being happy together, but I've known her long enough to know that, in her eyes, I am still a serious part of her life. 

I am seriously troubled by my desire for our past relationship to be successful, her desire to keep me involved in her life, and her problems I've always been there to help her with, laid against the looming failure of my efforts to be the right man, her lack of regard for what ""we"" now mean to me, and my own desire to be genuinely happy. I love her, and even if I can seriously move on I don't know if I can ever fully stop caring about her and her wellbeing. At the same time, there's no way I can sit around and wait for her to want to be with me again (We had a serious discussion about our breakup, and basically she made the choice where we would spend the rest of our lives together, or she would go after her ex). 

With that in mind, what should I do? I've thought about severing all ties with her, but she's still an important person to me and I know that she still needs my help in her life. She knows I don't have any plans of getting back with her (since she chose the other guy over our entire future) so I don't think she's keeping in touch with me as a fallback. I don't have a problem with making the hard choices here, I just can't figure out what choice is the best on my own. ",22Feb2018,8
199,"Hi!

Basically I moved from South England up to Scotland to take a course. I love it up here, it's cheaper, the people are nicer and I feel like I genuinely fit in better. It's a better quality of life and there are more opportunities: I have the benefits of city living without having to commute into London. My partner also likes it and is doing the first job he has ever enjoyed. It feels like this is the first time in my life when I have been consistently happy.

I visit home every few months and I also call on at least a weekly basis (sometimes more). But, I still feel guilty because my Mum and I have always been pretty close. Really she was more like a friend and we would hang out a fair bit.

- My mum is single (she was with my step-father for over 10 years then he cheated and left and she hasn't really recovered enough to find someone else/she says she doesn't want to meet anyone)
- She has my teenage brother with her who has  Aspergers (he's pretty high functioning and has a good social life)
- She has a lot of close friends, and her parents live close by (though they are pretty old)
- She has a job and lots to do and seems to be in good health. 

But she still keeps asking when my course will be finished, even though I've said we are going to live up here for a good few years. 

We might move back when we have kids, but living where we live now gives us the chance of actually buying a property, which would be pretty impossible down South. 

I'm confused about how much responsibility I should have towards her. Should I have to live somewhere shitty just to be close to my family? Do I have an obligation to keep her company?

Edit: she's also the kind of person who doesn't say things outright but says one thing and feels another. She says it's exciting I have moved away and she is happy for me but she might not mean it.

Currently, us members of our school group have a problem with our leader. To sum it up, she absolutely loves to use the ""I do almost everything so you don't have the right to criticize"" when we try to talk about her mistakes and likes to complain about being tired all the time because of us.

Like today, we had a project in which she bought the materials for that project. Those materials (clothing) are expensive unless the buyer knows how to bargain (we were going to use those only once anyways so who cares about quality). One of us (who was more experienced in bargains) wanted to do that but being untrustful, she was irritated and told us that she'll do it herself.

When our leader got the clothing for a high price (thus wasting a lot of money) and we pointed it out, she went in a tantrum and said that we were ungrateful, that she does almost everything (remember, we try to help her), and told us to ""not use it"" if we were to complain.

Also, during our other projects, she would complain about being tired (she has like 4+ hours of free time with plenty of sleep time) or hungry (only drinks coffee and does not eat) and apparently ""got sick"" because the project wasn't going so well.

And despite our countless attempts at talking to her, she is still stubborn and will constantly spout out the same excuses.

Her attitude as a leader really, really annoys me and my groupmates. I'm afraid this problem can affect our future projects if it is not solved.

230,"I got 2 cats from a friend back around 2006ish. A boy and a girl, Jimmy Choo and Melody. Jimmy was the best, sweetest, dumbest, greatest animal I've ever met and ever loved. When I had to put him down last year, I cried for a week straight. His sister, Melody, is sweet and loving to me, but an absolute witch to every other person she's ever met. She likes my mom and will tolerate my fiance, but since her brother had to get put to sleep, she's been more stressed than ever.

About 4 months before her brother got put down, we adopted a homeless puppy we named Momo. Momo loves Melody, Melody wants Momo to die in Hell probably. With the combination of Jimmy being gone and Momo stressing her out just a little more, Melody has resorted to pooping outside of her litter box... For the past 6 months. 

I've tried all the tricks in the book. Moving the litter box, keeping it pristine, calming spray pheromones, locking Momo out of the room, switching her food, all to no avail. She just won't stop making wonderful molten lava shits out of the litter box and on the carpet.

I took her to the vet and she's in perfect health, just signs of stress. I have no idea what to do now. My fiance is close to giving me an ultimatum, and I totally understand it. Melody is a HUGE pain in the ass, and not a nice cat to boot. If I give her to somebody, she may well just keep being a bad cat, and it would be such a massive strain on her that it would be borderline cruel to do. I'm not putting her to sleep because she's perfectly healthy, and while I don't love her as much as I loved her brother, I couldn't bear to kill an animal without reason.

Does anybody have any advice? I am totally lost as to what to do with her.",22Feb2018,0
231,"A little background for you...

I work as a sales coordinator for a hospitality company (private events/catering). I’ve been there for two and a half years and manage multiple clients
and a few larger accounts. I am well-established and liked by management and my coworkers. There are others in the company who could take over my job when I leave but it would take a bit of training and on-ramping to make the transition smooth. 

About a month ago, I was recommended for another job that is pretty much my dream position at a very reputable company. I went on a couple of rounds of interviews, and let the new job know that I’m currently employed and would need to give two weeks’ notice if I was offered the position. 

I got a text yesterday evening letting me know I got the job - however, they asked if I could start immediately. I told them I’d like to give two weeks and they asked if I could shorten it to one week. I let them know that I would speak with my manager the following day to see what could be done, and maybe I could start training a couple of days next week at the new job to help expedite the process. 

I’m about to go in to work this morning and I’m afraid I won’t be hired by this new company if I’m not able to start at the new job immediately or only give one week notice,  but I also don’t want to burn a bridge with my current job. 

What are your thoughts on giving just one week? ",22Feb2018,1

234,"Throwaway for safety. 

For the past year, I've been working in a startup-type environment. I started out in a pretty junior job and really loved the team and the working environment. All except for one senior management person- but I had little to no contact with her so it didn't really matter. The salary for this junior position was also quite good.  

Startups being startups, money got tight and some seniors went part-time to help save cost. This, along with mounting pressure from unliked senior management lady led to the resignation of four people, who have since left. The remaining team members had to pick up the slack, and I took over a more management-based position from one of the people that left. Now my contact with unliked senior management lady has improved tenfold, and I hate every minute of it. I went from loving my job and the team/environment to dreading waking up every morning. I often cry about work and this unhappiness I have is creeping into my relationship and into other facets of my life. 

My current issues with work are: 

-My contract was not updated following my job change, and I'm now doing the work of a senior for the lowest pay in the company (that of a junior's)

-Unliked senior lady is constantly micromanaging our team and changing our priorities, then becoming upset when timelines and estimates have to be extended. 

-Unliked senior lady will change her mind about a project when it's 70% complete and we have no choice but to scrap what we were doing and re-do it (this happens continuously, but she'll never admit it and blame us for the time it takes to fulfill her wishes)

-The entire remaining team is unhappy and demotivated, and I can't change this. She will contact these people in the middle of the night and weekends with no forewarning. I have no idea how to stop this. 

-My job feels more like I'm a personal assistant, instead of what my actual job description is. None of my suggestions are taken seriously/implemented.

So what I really want to know is if anyone has advice on what to do with this. Do I stay in this job that makes me miserable for the experience and the junior-based pay I have right now, or hand in my resignation and freelance within my skillset until I find another job? Is her behaviour normal for management?",22Feb2018,1

236,"Okay, I'm a 16 F in junior year. I have these two friends. They are dating, and I've felt like I'm constantly being pushed to the side. I tried to talk to them about it once and they ignored me and told me I didn't have a right to feel the way I did. I just moved on and this year they are continuously ignoring me and not listening to what I have to say. They are very stubborn, refuse to see my side of things and are very mean to me (personal attacks) when they don't want to be wrong or listen to what I have to say.
     We had to do a project together for an after school business club called Deca. They roped me into it and I didn't really have a say in what I wanted to do. I did not want to work with them because whenever I do, I have to do all the work or else it won't get done. For this after school club, 'we' had to do a 30 page write up and presentation about what we did to help the school with financial literacy. Three days before it's due they decide to have us meet to discuss it. Two days before it's due and I'm the only one to work on it all day. One day before it's due (yesterday) and they decide they don't want to do it because I asked them to help me. They asked our advisor if they could drop the project because they didn't want to do it anymore, now that I've asked for help. 
          A fight breaks out and personal attacks are made, and they claim they didn't try to help because I wouldn't let them. They never asked if they could help. They then decide to remove me off of the shared document because they want to 'do it themselves'. I am very academically focused, and this could help me get scholarships and get into a good school, so I want to take it seriously. They want to finish it in a couple hours and half ass it. We have different priorities, clearly. Finally after numerous hours of fighting they say, ""well do a really good presentation and you can do the paper"". This seems like a fair trade to me and I agree. I then look at the finished product and it is 8 slides long. I am extremely frustrated because it looks like minimal effort was put into it, and I want the judges to be impressed and wowed by our presentation, not given a half ass version of what it should be. Their response was that it was because I nagged at them, and they don't have to ""conform to my standards"" for the work. I am frustrated, I have been friends with them for almost three years, but this has happened with multiple projects and I don't know what to do.

I didn’t get home till about 3 a.m. apparently (I live with my girlfriend so she heard me come home) and apparently we started having a huge fight about me coming home so late and being so drunk when she had to work the next morning. 

Again, I don’t remember anything past 12 a.m that night but she says that in the heat of the argument I hit her across the face and told her to “shut up”. 

She says that she was so shocked she just went to bed and I then passed out on the couch. 

She went to work the next morning with me being none the wiser. When she came home she told me everything that happened and I immediately felt this pit in my stomach and shame like I’ve never felt before. 

She told me that she gets it was a mistake but that if I ever do anything like it again she’s leaving and she is going to have to rebuild her trust with me.

After finding out she had a boyfriend, I sorta stopped talking to her because I really didn't want her to think I was on her like that So I didn't progress the relationship anymore. 

Yesterday happens and she is late to class. She usually talks to a friend but I assume he wasn't there either. There were a lot of open seats, but she decides to sit next to me.

252,"Tl;dr: the title says it all. I’m not sure if it’s the self-consciousness on my end, or if I haven’t been demonstrating any self-awareness. 

Context: I’m in my first year of medical school, and part of our coursework entails going through patient ‘cases’ in small groups (~12 people) that are designed to help us review/integrate what we’re learning in lecture. Each small group session is lead by 2 student leaders who have had to do a ton of research in preparation to teach everyone else. A preceptor is also present to bail us out if needed, however we are never formally evaluated for these sessions. 

I have really, really bad social anxiety for which I’m currently being treated, so speaking before the group is not my favourite activity (however, our active participation is expected/you’re flagged if you don’t try to contribute, so I force myself). Preceptors have also been known to call upon individual students to answer questions. How I’ve been dealing with this thus far is by preparing for every small group as if I were going to lead it, so I can guarantee if called upon I will have something on hand to contribute. It’s also proven pretty good for my learning/retention. 

Here’s the thing: the cases are really complex and though we’re all supposed to read through them in advance, most don’t (we don’t have a ton of free time after class). So often the student leaders will pose question after question, and receive no answers from the group (eventually, preceptors will start calling on individual students). Consequently, I’m almost always the only person to have an answer for many of these questions. Last small group was particularly bad (we’ve had a very content-heavy week so few had even skimmed the case), and I probably ended up answering something like 75% of the questions. 

It’s not like I “want” to speak up during these sessions - I usually hang out and wait for quite awhile and if no one else has a contribution will put something out there.  I also won’t respond to easy questions (so people who haven’t had a chance to review still have reliable opportunities to participate). As long as I say 1-2 useful things per session I’m fine (as long as I don’t get flagged for non-participation, I’m happy). It’s not that I care about impressing preceptors (or my group) either. I just hate, HATE the awkwardness that ensues when the student leads pose repeated questions to the group and receive absolutely no response/participation. Been there, done that, and it makes orchestrating a useful group (that gets out on time...) next to impossible. It’s also upsetting to see enthusiastic preceptors (whose area of specialty is always related to the case) get disheartened by the seeming lack of interest by our group (when it’s really not that at all). 

That having been said, I’m not sure that my motivations are clear, or that I’m not coming across as a supremely irritating know-it-all. The social anxiety/self-consciousness doesn’t help either - I’m really introverted and while I’m really friendly I haven’t really made a lot of close friends in my small group since starting school (everyone is more of a friendly acquaintance). Part of me wonders if my contributions are getting annoying, or if I’m coming across as a know-it-all. It also doesn’t help that my interactions are often (objectively) awkward. Another part wonders if it’s not worse to deliberately leave our group leaders/preceptors hanging, or to pretend I don’t have anything to contribute.

I guess I’d really just like your opinion on the matter (am I being a know-it-all? Could this behaviour be irritating to other students?), and any advice you could offer (should I change the way I approach small groups? Or interactions as a whole?).

How does one get over being used and then dropped by a friend when you know you didn't do anything wrong and they are dishonest when you ask them what happened and why they did it?

The Story:

My husband and I were friends with this couple and we hung out a lot together. Right out of the gate, they wanted to spend every weekend with us, and we obliged and enjoyed their company. We thought we found lifelong friends.

While I still am friends with the wife (though not close like we were in the beginning), the husband has basically dropped us as friends and replaced us with OUR friends whom we introduced them to.

It cuts like a knife every time we see and hear evidence of them hanging out together and obviously excluding us from invites. 

We can only guess as to why he suddenly dropped us. Our guess is he wants easy, conflict-phobic friends who he can use to get things from (he has said that his favorite GOT character is Little Finger, because he exploits everyone to get to the top and he sees this as admirable). Our other friends whom they absconded with are passive, b personalities and always available to help him in his projects.

But the guy only *really* dropped my husband AFTER pretending to want to rekindle the friendship, asked us if we can help them move, we did, and then he totally re-dropped us!

Emotionally this has been very difficult, especially for my husband. He thought he and the guy were becoming very close friends. He thought he found someone he could confide in and was led to believe by the guy's early behavior that he wanted to cultivate a strong friendship, too. And then when he could no longer get things from my husband and they had a couple conflicts (which the guy refused to hash out with my husband), he just dropped him. 

Has this ever happened to anyone else? How do you emotionally recover from it, especially when you now have friends in common? 

I keep getting myself worked up about it and feeling foolish and angry and bitter. I would love to just completely cut him out of my life, but since I am still friends with his wife and we have friends in common, that isn't going to happen. ",22Feb2018,3
267,"Question is in the title. My mom passed from brain cancer at the start of the year. The same day, the woman I [27M] loved told me she [31F] was seeing someone else. For some context, her and I had been seeing each other on and off for a year. I loved her very much, far more than anyone else I have ever met before. She came with me to see my mom so many times in the hospital. I helped her all year when she went back to school and finished her degree. She would call me constantly every single day and night. We would go out for walks or to the movies or play video games or just drive around for a while. A lot of nights were spent hanging out at her house. Yes, we slept together a few times. She was going through a lot of personal troubles during this time that I cannot get into for privacy reasons but they always seemed to be the reason we could not be together.

This is the woman who took my dying mother’s hand, looked her in the eyes, and promised she would make sure I was ok when mom had passed. Then she stabbed me in the back on the very same day my mom died. I don’t care that she wants to see someone else. I love her, and if someone else can make her happy then that’s fine. I’m upset because she lied to me. I was there to support her for some of her lowest moments in life but when I truly needed her, she left me for someone else. She knows I had been cheated on many years ago and that it took me a long time to get over, but she still emotionally cheated and manipulated me.

274,"My mum got divorced from my father late last year and it really was quite a messy one. My dad basically upped and went without notice one day after an argument and the next thing they know, they're split and my dad has a new girlfriend. 

Since then, my mum has been pretty upset (as one can imagine) and it really shows at certain points. She was financially dependant on my father since she spent most her life raising my siblings and I, although she has always had a part time job around our school hours and full time since we've been adults. 

Another problem is that she doesn't really have any friends that she can go out and see for reasons similar to the above; she always complains about not having friends but then is never willing to go and make any as she's generally quite shy. As well as this, her only relatives besides us are my incoherent and dementia-ridden grandmother and our stuck up aunt that lives pretty far away. She also has pretty much no hobbies any more...

So what advice do I actually need? Myself and my brother are always there for support and what have you, but there's only so much that we can do. Really, I just wouldn't mind hearing from people if they have any ideas how I can encourage her to get out and try new hobbies or meet new people, or ultimately just be happy in herself. She soon has to take a weeks holiday from work and she's a little upset she doesn't have anything to do and no one to do it with. ",22Feb2018,1

She meets guys and hangs out with them, no big deal, however their relationships are never sexual, she only hangs out with them, things like movies, dinners, and just chilling out with them.

But she doesn't go without sex. Instead of sleeping with one of the guys she hangs with she sleeps with random strangers, not often, but she's done it enough that I started questioning her actions. There's only been one incident of her sleeping with a guy she hung out with and in that case after it happened she cut him off completely, just ghosted him.

I've never seen someone do this before and am curious as to why she does it, men she hangs with she won't sleep with and men she sleeps with she won't hang with.",22Feb2018,0

My fiancee, also 25, works full time in the private sector and makes around $33k/yr gross. We have about $6,000 saved up, with some more coming in when I help my family sell the house I've been helping fix up.

I plan on living here for a while, and some of the mortages I've seen for houses in the $100k-$120k range are about as much as our monthly rent, sometimes even cheaper. We already do most minor repairs around the duplex.

I just have no idea if its feasible to buy a house, and go back to school, or if we should keep renting while I go to school, and try to buy a house after I'd graduate.

Right now, I don't have any student loan debt, but the cost of going to law school for 3 years is $84k (without any scholarships, teaching assistant work, etc).

279,"My husband is a combat veteran. He has diagnosed PTSD and TBI, and undiagnosed (because he lied to the VA about how bad his symptoms were) anxiety and depression. He also has an alcohol problem as a lot of military guys do. We've been together 7 years, since before he deployed.

Basically he can be a total dick and says and does things that are unacceptable. Like we wouldn't be having financial issues if I had abortions like he wanted. Blows up over insignificant things, makes me feel like shit, controls what I can and cannot do, and (before I put down an ultimatum about 1.5 years ago that said either quit drinking so much and treating me like shit or I would have to take the kids and leave) he would get in my face, back me into corners and scream at me, has pushed me down while pregnant and forced me to have sex with him (once while awake, and a lot of times while he was asleep. He has a lot of sleep issues).

He has taken my ultimatum seriously and is working on himself, being a better Dad, applied for voc rehab, etc. He is doing a lot better in regards to his anger and alcohol problems but still needs my help with a lot of things like short term memory, emotional regulation, sleep (which is totally fine, I have no problem doing that and never have).

My problem is I have a hard time trusting and opening up to him. I gave my whole heart to him when we got married and basically he's shit all over it for the majority of our 20s and now that recently he's working on himself, he wants things to magically go back to the way things were and for me to be gushing with adoration. I know I love him as a person, I'm just not sure if I'm IN love with him anymore. I'm definitely trying to let him in and be more affectionate. We have sex all the time, he feels like it's ""making love"". I don't have that connection anymore.

My question is this: am I justified in not feeling able or eager to put myself out there again? I'd like to spend the rest of my life with him but realistically, less than a year ago we weren't even sure if we were going to stay married and I was afraid for my physical safety. Or am I a selfish, cold bitch for being hesitant? Any advice or anything would be much appreciated.

291,"Okay, so the title doesn’t really give a lot of description as to what is going on. 

I’m a traveler, a vagabond. I go place to place, forests to mountains; all over the country. I recently got out of a 2 year relationship, and that completely destroyed me. I’m better now, slowly pushing myself over that hill, I’ve been through worst. 

I’ve been visiting my family for the first time in three years, and I’ve been saving up some money to make getting back out west easier. I met a girl out here in the meantime, but there are certain things that keep crossing my mind. 

1. I’m not completely attracted to her. Pretty self explanatory. 

2. The biggest problem in my last relationship was communication. Within these last several days I’ve seen this girl, she’s had me repeat several things, details, stories, and acted like it was the first time she heard me say it. This was prevalent within my last relationship, and it was something that ate away at me. I’m not sure if this will be a problem down the road, but I don’t think I can deal with that. Perhaps she doesn’t listen, perhaps it’s just the beginning and little details don’t stick easy. 

3. She will be dropping out of college to come with me. She’s failing her classes either way, and she had a scholarship which means she doesn’t owe a lot of money for the semester. She has several years to pay it off. 

4. She will be homeless soon. The house she’s living at isn’t working out for her, and I think she’s about to get kicked out. This is the reason why I dropped the possibility of traveling with me. 

I had told her originally I had to see if we clicked before I brought her with. I’m not sure if I’m clicking with her but last night when we were together, she had asked me if this was for sure a thing. I’m not good with letting people down, and I had also been drinking that night, so I said yes, but I’m having missgivings. 

Not sure what to do at this point. I’ve been slightly avoiding texting her back. I don’t enjoy hurting people but I don’t want to find myself half way out of this state and make the decision that I can’t stand her.

296,"Some context: The 3 of us decided to all move in together in November, since we all wanted to save money. We live in a 2BR, 3BA; so big enough that we dont always bump into each other. Anyway, my boyfriend already lived with her in college and vouched for her. It started with small things. One time, my boyfriend got me candy canes and I left them on the kitchen since I dont like storing food in my bedroom. The next day, 3 of the candy canes were already gone. She didnt tell me she was eating them until there was only 4 left out of the 12 candy canes. I let it slide, since it's just candy canes. 

But here's when I started getting annoyed. Every time me and my boyfriend go grocery shopping, we buy ice cream. We buy a quart each since we like different flavors. Any time this happens, when we go to bed she would start eating our ice creams. At first, it was okay, we dont kind sharing. But she would eat ALL of it in like 3 days. Again we won't know until theyre all gone, and she says sorry replacing it. I pointed it out to her and she said, ""I know I have a problem with sugar.."" She has depression/anxiety and I guess it helps. But it's already happened so many times in 3 months. She did it again recently and replaced our ice cream with shitty, cheap ice cream. And that pissed me off more. 

I talked to my boyfriend about it and he thinks I'm just overreacting and need to be understanding about it. I have depression too but I haven't resorted to eating 2 quarts of ice creams that aren't mine yet. I am honestly scared of buying any more desserts with fear of her just eating them all. I told my boyfriend that I am nearing breaking point and already know I'm not renewing the lease with her. He just said, ""we'll see how we're doing by then."" I just can't live with her anymore. Not only that, she's also super lazy. But I get it, it's her depression/anxiety, I guess. 

I guess what I'm asking for is: How should I go about approaching her if I wanna ask her to stop eating all my food without hurting her feelings, knowing she's already vulnerable? (Sorry for the additional mega-rants. It's just I feel like I'm alone on my side about this...)

322,"TLDR: if you know you will be homeless in 5 weeks, what should you do? No savings, been unemployed for over 3 years. 

Backstory: 

My semi-abusive ex has been living with me rent-free for 4 years. He has no savings and hasn’t worked since 2014, and he has no friends in our city. His family is abusive enough that he’d rather take his chances on the street than turn to them. He has been cheating on me constantly since forever, and I guess he assumed that I would keep forgiving him (an idea that I continually reinforced by taking him back). He thought wrong. I wanted to kick him out that day, but I figured it’s been so many years of this bullshit that I could tolerate having him around until a doctors appointment (his first in years) we’ve had scheduled for months at the end of March. I just want him to get help. I feel responsible because I let him get so dependent on me, and enabled his behavior for so long that he never became functional enough for what I knew would happen eventually. 

In the meantime, I want him to spend all day, every day preparing for his upcoming homelessness. I have kept him here for so long because his well-being was my ultimate concern and I knew he wouldn’t be ok without my help (the psychological abuse shows - he basically conditioned me to feel his pain, since whenever he was unhappy he’d hurt me). But I want him to do the work. I’ve done so much to try to help him, spent so much time and money putting his needs before my own (which I recognize I’m still doing) that after I finally boot him out I want to be able to tell myself I gave him a month to prepare, so whatever happens now is none of my business. But he’s so mentally ill and compromised that he seems paralyzed in panic. I just want to give him a list of things to do and then make myself scarce for a month because I can’t stand seeing him like this.

Because of this, I was put in a different type of class, where people who usually have difficulties or fail years because of skipping school too much, or disrespecting teachers too much, or actually have difficulties, or in my case, none of the above but absolute carelessness and laziness, and complete incapability of paying attention to anything in general. Basically not doing anything in class. In this sort of class, we are literally taught the same lessons as if in a normal class, but supposedly we should have fewer students in class, like 6 or 7, so that it is easier for teachers to give us more attention and teach/help us, and grades are divided 50/50. 50 for behaviour and 50 working in class. However, we're 21 students and teachers couldn't care less. I've been in this class since 6th grade.)

Right now, I've only been able to pass these years because, before this year, behaviour used to count 60% on the grades and the rest was 40%. Now, it's 50/50. But it's not that what I'm concerned about. In my situation, it doesn't seem like I'm ever going to be able to go back to a regular class, and then college.

What I've always wanted to do though, is building and programming computers. I've always been interested on that, and it seems that I'm never going to be able to, because I've been an idiot this whole time and I realize this is my fault. However, today, my mom told me that where she works, they teach people to do exactly what I'm interested on, and they start sometime next week, and if I miss that, I'm not gonna be able to join them for the next 3 years. She tells me that they need people, and that they pay. They'll pay little, but if I succeed, I can get a job where they'd need people who have that experience and I would get well paid. But I'd need to quit school for that. And that's something I don't want to do. I still believe I have a better chance of getting something better, even if I fail school, when I leave. Right now, I'm thinking of still staying in school, to see what happens, and in the next 3 years, if I didn't get something better, I'll take that chance again. She says she can guarantee that I can join them in the next 3 years, but doesn't agree that I should wait. She told me that I should go there tomorrow and check it out first to see what I think about it when school it over. And I'd like to see other people's opinion on this. I do want to improve in school, and I have improved, but in order to go back to a regular class I need to take exams. And I doubt I can take these exams, because they require a lot of knowledge on two disciplines, one of them that I'm the worst at is math.
I'm sorry for the long text here, and I'd like to see your opinion on this. Thank you in advance.",22Feb2018,1

333,"Hey guys, 

So, the title actually says it all but I will give you a little background. 

Basically I live in a (newly renovated) house in the middle of a city center. Having lived in the center for almost my entire studies, I know mice - unfortunately - come with the territory. I used to live in a student house one street away from here and there were always mice in the kitchen. I'm kind of okay with that, but then I never had one in my bedroom.

I've lived in this new appartment with two other girls for over a year and as I said, it was newly renovated when we moved in. We didn't really have mice in our house until last fall. Obviously I wasn't thrilled to see mice but again, I know this is inevitable with (old, even if they are renovated) houses in the city and since they hung out in the kitchen, I was kind of okay with it. I should also mention I plan on moving out soon so I didn't take steps to fix it.

However, last monday morning (at 6 AM), I woke up to 'something' eating 'something' in my room. I immediately knew it was a mouse - obviously - and as I turned on my light, I saw it sprint from one side of my room to the other. I was absolutely mortified. I spent about half an hour on my bed (thinking I heard it chew something under my bed) and had the hardest time dealing with it. I vacuumed my room at 6:30 AM, ran to the bathroom as soon as I could and got out of there.

That evening, I was exhausted from having been woken up that way and to top it all of, we went on a hunt to look for all the holes in the kitchen (and in my room, which I located quite quickly) and we closed the holes with a cement-like substance. 

That night, I slept horribly. I slept with earplugs but I woke up every 30 minutes and felt horrible and kept imagining I heard mice in my room. The next morning, the holes were still closed and there was no mice poop or anything so I know I imagined it, but I still felt horrible.

The past few days I've thoroughly cleaned my room, I've plugged in an ultrasonic mice repellent machine, I'm picking up some (used) kitty litter from a friend to spread around the house and I've bought (animal friendly) mouse traps. I haven't put down the traps yet though, because I'm clearly trying to keep them from my room and I'm scared to drag them back in by putting food (albeit in the trap) in my room. Note: there is no food in my room now. Also, I'd love to get a cat but my roommates don't want one, unfortunately so I'm dealing with what I've got.

The past two nights I slept at my boyfriends house but it's time to face the music so I'm in my bedroom right now but I'm terrified. I've really never been scared of anything before (heights, spiders, those things don't really phase me) but I'm just so scared that I'll wake up to a mouse again. I'm really not so sure what I'm scared of, I think I really dislike their speed and how you can't catch them. I guess I'm also scared they might climb on my bed or I'll wake up to a bunch of them. I don't really know, but I do know I feel horrible. I've vacuumed my bedroom every day since monday, I'm terrified to even go into my bedroom and stomp before I enter, I'm scared to turn on the heating (don't want to make it comfortable for the mice), and I can feel like I'm really becoming obsessive about this. 

The thing is, I always spend a lot of time in my bedroom. I'm not a super social person and after a day of work, I just want to chill out alone. That means that if my roommates are in the living room (and they almost always are), I just go to my room to chill there. It's really the only space I've got in this world where I can be alone and read, relax and be myself. I have no other room where I can be alone and now I just feel like I'm horrified of that one sacred space that allowed me to relax. Now I just feel horrified, exhausted and like I don't want to come home anymore.

So, long story short, I could really use advice on how to deal with these mice, both mentally and practically. I'd just like to not be so scared and just be able to sleep. I feel like if a mouse wakes me up, I'm allowed to be terrified, but to be so scared that I can't sleep four days later is just a little over the top. I'm going to wear myself out and I don't want to do that. 

Thanks in advance.",22Feb2018,2
334,"Hi everyone,

First, I'd like to apologize if it's the wrong sub. I thought about r/locksmith but it is obviously not for advices, rightfully so.

To shorten the story up, my wife and I were victims of a classic fake locksmiths' scam, who just destroyed our lock and then asked to be payed more than 1k$ to repair the door. We refused, so they left without repairing the lock. 

We managed to lock the door again so we'd be safe for the night. But the joke is on us, now we can't reopen it and are locked inside!

It is 10:10pm here, so we can't afford calling another actual locksmith. 

We will of course do what is needed tomorrow morning, but, in the meantime, if anyone knows any tips, so we can actually get out of our appartment and go to work tomorrow, that would be really, really useful.

I'll add pictures of the door and lock, if it helps, feel free to ask if you need more informations:

Thank you!



**TL;DR** : Locked in our appartment, can't pay locksmith, need to go to work tomorrow

***EDIT*** : Getting late here, we’re giving up for tonight. I think we got what we’re suppose to look for but didn’t manage to use it the right way. 
I’ll update tomorrow when we finally get out haha Thank you all!

***EDIT 2*** : *WE’RE OUT!* 

We called someone in the street to come to our door and give us the small pieces of the lock that fell outside. I used one of them like in the picture below to activate the lock without the cylinder. It made almost no noise, but it actually opened when I tried! Hallelujah!
It seems the lock is not broken, only the handle so we’ll only have to pay like 30 bucks. 

**Thank you very much** again to everyone who tried to help us and to everyone who were concerned about our safety, that’s awesome!

335,"Backstory: i graduated highschool with 2.7 (german grading system) which is above average considering that i was still 5th best of my class. It was a highschool for technology and i graduated with specialisation in computer science. 

However i noticed that i don't want to work in computer science and started to focusing on my childhood dream of becoming a doctor. But i didn't had a chance with the way that study places are given here.

I had to do an assessment test shortly after. And the first result was that i should become a federal police agent/detective (Kriminalkommisar beim BKA für euch Deutsche). I never had the wish to become a police officer so i was suprised. But while thinking and talking about it i realized this might be the career for me.

But the next 11 results were different medical doctors specialisations so i focused on medicine. I worked over 1.5 years but two days ago i got a offer that would almost certainly let me study medicine starting in october.

But since then i had my doubts. i planned to go to the BKA if my plan to study medicine would fail. But now i have trouble to decide which career i want. 

The issue is that my motivations for both jobs are similar e.g helping people, doing reserach, excitement, having a prestigious job, and generally doing whats right. 

And now i need advice from some new people because my friends and family say that "" i should do what my heart tells me"". And i really don't know how to decide this. ",22Feb2018,2

To give a little background information, I recently went through a nasty split with my fiance of several years. My relationship with him, up until the dividing issue, was solid. 

I have just discovered that my best friend spent many months telling my coworkers that my relationship was illegitimate, that I was only dating him because I pitied him for his looks, and that my fiance and I were really just platonic friends but that I agreed to get married out of desperation. (To be clear, none of this is true - although others do find him to be unattractive in a conventional sense, I did not. She was projecting.) As a result, as I have now learned, my LEGITIMATE relationship became a workplace joke, and everyone has been mocking me and my fiance behind our backs for a year, including my bosses. This also includes people who I excitedly called after getting engaged and people that I had offered positions in my wedding party to. To make things worse, the fact that the relationship ended is being blamed on me being shallow about his appearance and is being used as vindication for these rumors. Not that it matters, but it ended for a plethora of deeply ingrained and painful issues, none of which were in any way related to appearance. 

I feel so betrayed by this friend that I can't imagine ever reconciling. I am preparing to completely cut her from my life and just want to know if others would do the same, or if I'm overreacting to average workplace drama.

I need help and tips to be able to help my bf. 
They are transgender (FtM) and have been going through the slow process of being diagnosed as transgender. If and when the process finishes, they'd be prescribed hormones, be able to get surgery, and the state would recognize them as male. 
Issue is, it's a slow process. And he has suffered from depression for a long time but never getting proper help for it, and now it is particularly bad, affecting our everyday life and his school success. He hates himself, he hates his situation, he has panic attacks often, and he barely finds any reason to exist. He desperately wants to push me away so he would stop bringing negative shit onto me. (I don't want to break up, I want to help him cause I love him.) He needs to get help for it, but he can't as if he gets diagnosed with depression, the transgender process will come to a halt (or be cancelled) as they will say because he is depressed he isn't fully in his senses, and due to that the trangender thing is not real. Fact is he is depressed because he is transgender (not solely because of this) and transgender because he is depressed. He needs them both fixed at the same time. And if he does go get help for depression, he will probably have to stop/pause school, and that isn't really suitable in our situation. (Got a student apartment that we will lose the right to if the studies are paused/stopped).

353,"I really need to fix this. It gives me anxiety and my reaction to the anxiety is just to get fucking pissed instead of being comforting. 

For some background, the reason I’m like this is because I associated with shit people on the internet for way too long. I used to talk people out of suicide on social media and eventually some of them became my friends (I am mentally ill as well). This was the theme with every one of them, but if they had a bad day, it meant I was either going to be up until 5am the next day talking them out of killing/hurting themselves until I was so exhausted I couldn’t deal, or I was going to be up fighting with them because they were dickheads when they were angry and I was exhausted and didn’t want to deal with it. 

So now every time people in my life (who aren’t shitheads) are upset, I get defensive and put up a wall. Even if they just say they’re not feeling the best, my body will immediately flip the fuck out. Because bad days and bad feelings meant a lot of fucking work and pain and shit for the years that I let it go on. I want to be helpful and care when people are upset again. I used to. But now it just makes me angry and anxious.

Back with the last mentally ill person I decided to be friends with (and in no way saying all of them are like this, I just have shit taste in friends apparently), when she said she had a shit day it was a death sentence of bullshit. And I could do absolutely nothing and still do it wrong. Towards the end, every time she’d say she had a bad day or she wasn’t happy, I would throw up. And I didn’t want to. It just happened, anxiety thing I guess. It happened so much it was almost every day and I planned what food I ate around knowing it was going to come back up later. She’s the last person I talked to and was close friends with besides my boyfriend, who has been there since I was friends with that person two years ago. 

How do I make the reaction go away? At least I’ve stopped throwing up but I still get nauseous and nervous and angry. I want to be helpful I don’t want to be shitty.

355,"I desperately need some advice on my current roommate problem. I think they might be deadbeats.
So I'm fairly young, and just recently graduated from high school as the valedictorian. For the past few months, I and two friends have been planning on moving to a big city. They had planned on moving to this city for a while, and I jumped on the chance to have roommates that I was on good terms with. The only problem is, I don't think that they are taking this seriously whatsoever. Both of them graduated a year before me, and neither of them have jobs or go to school (local community college). I have a part-time job, and have maintained my usual good grades as I wrap up my AA degree. In addition, I'm about to get a second job so that I can save up more money before the move. Whenever the three of us go out, I usually pay for everything, because neither of them have money. I'm also the unofficial bookkeeper, as I'm the only person bothering to keep track of the things that we need to make the move, as well as who bought what ( if it's not me, it's their parents). 
But I knew most of this going in. What's really worrying me is what happened last night. We were shopping for kitchen goods, and I wound up buying everything, save for some small utensils that one of roommate's family members had to buy for them, because they did not have money. Despite this, I was constantly overridden on major decisions by them. For instance, they wanted wood cutting boards. I said that wood was a breeding ground for germs that would be difficult to wash, and suggested plastic. We argued. They claimed that a lemon was sufficient to sanitize the board. I knew they were wrong, but they overrode me, and I wound up buying bamboo cutting boards.
I must've spent at least $100 in all the shopping last night, and then I had to buy us all food. Which they were too broke to afford. We used my car to get around.
They want a nice two-bedroom apartment in a large city, which is going to eat up most of my paycheck even divided three ways up. When I've tried to talk about this, they shrug me off.  
(tldr; they have little to no money saved up, neither of them go to school or have jobs, constantly override me, rely on their parents to pay for everything, and seem to have no knowledge of how far a paycheck goes.)
I don't know if I should back out or try to talk about it, because these are my friends. But I'm very tired of feeling like I have to bankroll this entire thing or else nothing gets done.

I am on stuck mode and don't know at all what to do, I want to move out to get a life but i don't know where to start. I don't want to be a person who missed too much on his life.",22Feb2018,4
364,"I would love to work in aviation industry, but it doesn't exist where I live. There is one company near me, but they very likely won't have a need for my current experience (I am a senior expert in software development). Even if they some day were willing to hire me to do something else it would mean a significant salary cut as I would be a junior in the field.

It would be so easy if I could just relocate, but I have a family and I have already decided that they are more important. There are many reasons why relocation would be a bad idea for my family, even if it made my dreams come true.


I have made up my mind about the relocation and I don't doubt that decision, but I can't just forget what I am leaving behind. This may sound an awful job for some, but by relocating I could get to write code for fighter jets and ride in the back seat of the jet to test the code while the pilot does aerial combat exercises (I know some might like that ;-) ). I talked with them, but all work must be done in specific secure building, so remote work is not an option. The other company near me does helicopter pilot training with a $10M full motion flight simulator. Unfortunately they just use the simulator, not develop it. I talked with them, but they don't need my current skills and the maintenance work they have pays much less + it's shift work as they are open 24/7, so we would struggle to have enough money and the shift schedule might be pretty bad for the family too.


I don't mind skipping the rest of the aviation industry, but fighter jets and helicopters are simply too cool to be just forgotten overnight. The feeling of joy when I found out there's the simulator company in my city was beyond anything I have ever experienced about anything career or work related matter, but unfortunately the feeling of despair after I learned they didn't have suitable work was equally crushing.


I have managed to corner myself to senior software jobs, but I know it will work out okay as soon as I manage to get the demons off my shoulders. I am struggling to see things in a way that would allow me to concentrate on all the nice and good things I can have even if I don't get this one thing (which many others also won't get an opportunity to do even if they would love to). I was part of a startup that just failed, so I am looking for a new job. I can accept the next senior position, but I know it will be difficult to view it as more than a temporary thing before something magical happens and I get an opportunity to fulfill my dream.


Do you have any advice or know any books, blog posts, videos, etc. that could help me deal with the situation in a way that allows me to make the most of what I have today and be happy without fulfilling this very unlikely dream?",22Feb2018,3
365,"So last summer I started having some issues with my eyesight, like distortion, not blurriness. This hasn’t really gone away, and now I’m starting to notice that if I’m not looking directly at something it’s kind of difficult to see. I can’t really remember if things used to be precise if I wasn’t looking at it, because I never really thought about it. Also, things far away are getting harder to see. Should I get checked? I’m sure a normal person has a very precise, large FOV so I’m confused and scared. Looking for advice. ",22Feb2018,2
366,"Okay so before I get the “you’re being too insecure” replies I’m already aware of that but let me tell you guys how this came about. Me and my girlfriend met in high school and she was always a no bullshit type of person. She’s been cheated on before and has only had one other boyfriend which is the guy who cheated on her. At the beginning stages of our relationship along the first year we were on and off due to small little incidents where she would get mad at me for going to parties, hanging with my group of friends which included girls, etc. in reaction to me doing that stuff she would threaten to cut/burn herself and she actually went through with it a couple times. I would also find out that she would talk about how hot my best friend was to some coworkers and her friends. She says she did all that stuff because of how I acted and treated her by going to parties and having girl-friends. I gave her the benefit of the doubt realizing but then ignoring the red flags at this time. Okay so fast forward 5 years we’re now in our 2nd year of college and haven’t really had any problems up until recently. Over the last couple years she would question any text I got but in a jokingly matter and I would do the same occasionally. At one point we exchanged twitter and Instagram passwords just to prove we have nothing to hide. I didn’t want to get into the habit of snooping so I rarely did because everytime I did I just know it felt wrong. Their were no red flags or unusual behavior during this time. Okay so I rarely go on Instagram anymore if at all and twitter is the only thing I really go on. Once or twice I would favorite a couple friends pictures on twitter who are girls but I don’t talk to at all. When I did that she would confront me on it and tell me that me liking their pictures was kind of inappropriate being that a favorite on twitter means that I’m trying to get their attention. So I respectfully told her I wouldn’t do it again and I was sorry. 

Okay so now this brings me to the issue at hand. I’ve just snooped on her profiles twice since we exchanged passwords but that was a while ago so I decided to log in and take a look at what she’s been up to as I’m sure she does to me as well. I see a Instagram message of this guy and the message is a “TBH” and he’s basically saying in the message that she’s fine and an amazing dancer and that she and him should smoke sometime. I do a little bit of research and this guy used to stay with my girlfriends best friend, and my girlfriend would occasionally go over to her house some nights and hang out. Okay so I see this message and see that she doesn’t reply and I’m like okay fuck it, everything’s good she didn’t reply, it’s all good. That was 3 weeks ago. So yesterday I decided to snoop back on Instagram and see if this guy and her communicated again being that my girlfriend has no guy friends and she’s never told me about this guy. I open up the messages to see that she and him were messaging back and forth. He messaged her first saying how he was thinking about her and how he saw her like some of his posts on twitter so he decided to contact her and ask what she’s been up too. She replies with small talk blah blah blah talking about school and work. Then he starts to ask her deep questions like what is it about dance that she loves so much and she starts opening up to him about why she does it.(I know, this guy right?) Mind you we have a strong connection and talk about all sorts of stuff but when I try to have deep intellectual conversations with her like this she always gets mad at me. So they talk back and fourth about dance and then I check it again and the messages are gone. 

So at this point I feel like a jackass for snooping but oh well now I know this, and I decide to look at this guys Instagram and see if she’s been liking his photos. I look and every photo she’s liked it just has him in it and sometimes with his shirt off and such. This guy isn’t all that but he’s definitely not a ugly dude. 

Now being the skeptical guy I am and me not liking hypocrites, I confront her about her liking a lot of his pictures and why she’s doing that but the second I favorite 1 girls picture on Twitter she confronts me about it. She then tells me who he is and why she likes his photos and assured me that nothing is going on and that I have nothing to worry about. Her excuse is that whenever someone likes her photos on Instagram she likes theirs back just to be nice. To me that’s fine, my only issue is to why I can’t do that but she can. I keep pestering her and she starts to get defensive about it and tries to derail the conversation a bit by saying this is weird how I’m confronting her about this. I hold off on confronting her about the deleted message so I can try to make her confess on her own that they messaged each other. I tell my girlfriend every single girl that slides in my dm or sends me a text and tell her exactly why they contacted me. She doesn’t really do the same and she would not fess up about this guy. I still haven’t told her I saw the messages because I don’t want her to feel weird about me snooping around her profiles because I don’t think she even remembers I have her password. 

So my question is although I snooped, and I know I shouldn’t be doing it, am I in the right for having a problem with this? Am I right in the fact that she’s being a hypocrite? I know this guy is a problem and clearly trying to hook up with her so Should I be concerned about her continuing to talk to this guy? I’m a goal oriented person so I don’t like my time being wasted in relationships but at the same time I’ve been through so much with this girl and care for her deeply. Please tell me what y’all honestly think and what y’all would do if you were in this fucked up situation. Thanks for hearing me out ",22Feb2018,3

We go to the same college so we have the opportunity to hang out quite a bit, although we really don’t. We’ve hung out three times this semester (it’s been about a month) and when we’re together he seems to be pretty interested in me. 

We’re both generally pretty awkward people, but when we hang out it seems so normal and easy (at least for me.) We’ve kissed a couple times and everything seems good. However, we don’t really talk much anymore. We’ll say a few things to each other every day, but other than that we barely talk. I haven’t seen him in a couple weeks and I just can’t tell how he feels. 

I’m not sure if he actually likes me (or potentially could like me) or if I’m just someone for him to have around when he’s bored. I feel like I genuinely do like him so I’m not sure what to do. I definitely want to see him again soon but I’m way too scared of possible rejection. I don’t even know what I would say to him.

So, I know this guy who has no real world experience, although he has degrees. Learning and knowledge is important to him, or so he says, and he likes to fancy himself an academic, but he has no papers published, just degrees (coursework only) in philosophy.

Now, he has ended up in a rather monotonous office job doing rather monotonous cubicle work, and spends almost all his time at work and at home messaging people on the internet, getting in silly debates, getting too wrapped up in arguments etc.

He has often lied in these debates about being more accomplished than he is, claiming to have papers published (he has none), claiming to have a better job than he has, etc.

I really want to help him. I think it is almost like an internet addiction, and I don't like seeing him so bitter and resentful and sad when I think he might have the potential for more.

I would like to motivate him to write some papers (all the time spend debating nobodies online he could have easily written some papers), or to grow his career by focusing on his work not the internet, or perhaps by learning a new skill...anything really. He seems stuck in a rut and I would like to help him break it.

375,"Ok so I'm a college student living with 5 other people in 3x3 townhouse. I came here with 4 of my friends from high school and thought that it will be sweet if we live together, which turned out to be one of the worst choices I ever made in my life. Everything was fine for first 2 months after getting the house, but one day my friend suddenly decided to bring his girlfriend without discussing with me. To give a basic profile of her, she is a high school dropout, has no job, and came from out of state. Apparently she came here to escape from her abusive family, so I kinda understood the situation and let her stay in the house for a while. The shitty thing is that she now has absolutely no desire to move out, basically sleeping in the living room and using my bathroom. After month, I tried to talk to my friend because he's the one responsible, but he repeatedly avoided the conversation by giving vague response and sometimes even get angry because he thought I am being rude to her. All I want is that if she wants to live here, she needs to get a job and pay rent. She is an adult and has to take care of her own shit.  Furthermore, another friend from high school also wanted to move in, and two of my roommates casually agreed without ever telling me. They simply though that I would also agree just because we were good ""friends."" He also doesn't pay rent or utilities. At one point, I was so fucking pissed about this whole situation and held a meeting to figure something out, and after that, no one is willing to talk to me, having their own little party. Eventually I decided to move out with one of my original roommates who had a same feeling with me, but we still have 6 more months until move-in since student apartment we signed will start right before the fall semester starts.
What should I do at this point? The friendship from high school has shattered already, and I just think it's unfair for me to pay full rent if people who don't pay nothing are taking all the benefits and violating my privacy. ",22Feb2018,2

Anyways, Mike tried to jump off a bridge yesterday before giving us a hint by texting “do you think the height of this bridge will kill me?”. It was during lunch and we ran to this bridge that was 5 min from our school. We tackled him and police came and took him to the hospital for treatment.

Problem is Mike was always babies within our friend group and throughout his middle school years by everyone and used to getting his way and all the attention, (which I know is completely normal for his circumstance). But he wasn’t suicidal til this year.

Mike was never lonely as Timmy, Paul, John, and I always hung around him in class,at lunch, and after school talking everyday, (never aware he was suicidal at all). He was always the centre of attention because he owned the discord server we were in and better than us in league of legends. 

We got in a heated argument in a LoL game on Monday because of a misplay and later mike lost it and texted I was the reason he was suicidal in our group chat.

“Do you ever feel guilty? You make me feel worthless when we play and I go to my bed and cry myself to sleep and cut myself, go fuck yourself”. 

This was when our friends and I realized he was addicted to games and couldn’t take trash talk in game, even though we all trashed talk each other as we knew it was a joke cause we laugh it off.

It’s as though he tried to make it seem like a dramatic movie by texting Johnny that he’d not commit suicide and then follow up text with, “promises are meant to be broken” an hour later, then the next day sending the height bridge text I mentioned earlier.

We’re all really scarred and haven’t gotten sleep and are not sure we want to visit him. We’re worried cause we’re his friends but angry that he said it was because he got no attention when he was the centre of it all between all of us and his parents because we knew them personally.

381,"TL;DR: Long distance friendship fading, can't think of things to talk about and growing apart over time. 

I've been online friends (and in a relationship with for a time) with a girl since late December of 2016, when we met on Steam. We used to talk all the time (pretty much all day, every hour) up until summer of 2017 when a lot of (irrelevant) things happened regarding her depression. From about November 2017 to January of this year, we had talked as if we were dating, without the commitment basically. But, as of now, we've started growing apart it feels, we seem to be less connected and even she feels so. I asked her if she was satisfied with the friendship or if she wanted more, of which she wanted it to be better. The problem, I can't think of anything to talk about or ask about or anything, so I've been stuck kind of sad and not knowing what to do to get the friendship (or possible new relationship) back on track since (being friends from different countries; Me in America, her in Brazil) all we can really do is talk, and though we both have a big interest in video games, her bad internet and crappy laptop prohibits a lot (I've heard from her that Sao Paulo, while a big city, is expensive and hard for her to afford anything better.

**Original:**The title pretty much says it all I guess. I'm not sure if she still loves me. She always says she does when I ask. We held hands with each other not too long ago. 

But here's what makes me suspicious.

She admitted she liked someone else. Once I told her I made a list of pros and cons for a breakup, and whenever she does something weird she says, ""That's another thing to add to your list!"" Then she doesn't show the same signs she used to that she liked me (acting nervous, wanting to be with me a lot, etc)I feel like I'm not loved anymore and she's trying to nudge me to go. 

She also admits she gets bored when we talk. Tbf this is both our faults (me not knowing what to talk about and her not allowing me to talk about the vast majority of the stuff I'm interested in. (Very few people are interested but they usually try to listen and allow me to talk about it.) But... I feel like if she wants to talk about more stuff and not allow me to talk about the stuff I like then she shouldn't expect that to happen anytime soon.

Tl;dr: I don't feel like I'm being loved by her, I feel like she's nudging me to leave, and she doesn't allow me to talk about a lot of stuff I'm interested in, all the while talking about her interests a lot of the time. But she means a lot to me and I love her so much.

384,"I am struggling with how to prevent or handle getting a bill for a tuition reimbursement that I legally will owe to my soon to be ex-employer.  I am trying to figure out how to best approach this.

Should I not bring it up and hope they forget, talk to my managers about it and get their advice, or reach directly out to HR?  My concern is bringing this up will eliminate the chance of them overlooking this either intentionally or inadvertently.

Details:

Basics:  I accepted a $6K tuition reimbursement on 6/17/17 which states that I need to remain with my company for 12 months following or repay in full.  Further stipulates that my last paycheck will be held in payment.  It does not say payment in full.  I am leaving on 3/21.

Details: 

I paid the reimbursed semester on 1/27/17, completed the semester on 5/10/17 and submitted my request on 5/22/17.

I have been working for my company since 5/2013 and have enjoyed working there.  I live 108 miles away so a 216 mile round trip commute has killed me over the years emotionally and financially.  I originally planned to move closer once both my kids were in college, but I became engaged to a local teacher where I live so moving is no longer an option.  Furthermore, my mother also has alzheimers, stage 4, and I am trying my best to help my Dad through this.  Not to mention completing my MBA.  I go into the office 4 days per week and my routine is waking up to leave by 6pm and often getting home around 8pm.  

I found a really interesting position came up near me working for a community college.  I accepted the position which is actually paying $15K less than I make now, but I feel it will fit better with my life now.  My managers understand all this and sympathize, but we are a satellite company in a small/large company (1000 employees worldwide).

387,"Hello,

a bit of backstory. I was working for this man at an arts festival two years ago, and during knock off drinks we were alone and he started divulging his secrets. He was talking about a show that he did where a girl sitting at the front was very 'sexy', and he later found out that she was only 14. I asked him if that changed his perspective, and he said no, she was a 'sexy 14 year old, and if she wanted, he'd do her.' This was extremely distressing to me as he is in his late 40s, I have been sexually assaulted in the past, and that type of thinking is why my life has been at a standstill for years. 

I asked him if that was normal to him, as I expected finding out about an underage status would be an 'oh fuck' moment. He said he finds young children attractive, and any man that says they don't is lying - he'll go to a swimming centre and get excited about the young boys and girls in their swimsuits. 

I began to get angry with him asking how he could even say or think that, how could you think such thoughts about a child? He blamed it on genetics, stating his father was arrested in america for molesting a student.

Now he's in my city and I'm so anxious around him. He does children's shows and I feel sick to the stomach. I don't know what to do, he has told me and i'm not sure who else knows. But my heart aches and my anxiety is through the roof knowing that he has these feelings and he may act upon them, and I knew all along and didn't do anything.

I finally broke down and ended it with him for good. I called him and he said”you made your feelings perfectly clear”
Then 7 hours later he gf another chick all over social media(he doesn’t know I see it) He warned me he has other options too 🙄 he said he wants someone to have a normal rship with. He’s tired of meaningless hookups ... I guess he’s figure out only insecure and lonely men do that
He told me before they’ve seen each other longer but he feels a spark with me that he didn’t feel with her, but he knows she wants to be his girl and cares about him.
Now what shocked me is she is really hot like I am stunned at how pretty she is and if I admit I feel a little surprised he can get a girl that pretty (he’s attractive but I’m more attractive) I’m lmore conventionally attractive than her, but she is a very beautiful women..

I know he is taking her to this club night he likes this Saturday that he told me about that plays the music he likes and they are going to have a ton of fun together and it hurts me

393,"My girlfriend and I have been planning a vacation for this summer with my best friend and her boyfriend (we are all good friends). While hanging out, my best friend somehow correctly guessed that I was planning to propose on this vacation and I was too dumb to vehemently deny. I say I was dumb because obviously news this juicy doesn't stay under wraps for long and I get a text from her boyfriend. It turns out he was also planning to propose on this vacation.

So we are both kind of stuck in this weird spot. We are thinking that no girl wants to have to share her proposal day with someone else - it's supposed to be her special day that happens once in her life and having someone so close to you also have this day is kind of thunder stealing. We also think that even if it isn't the same day, having two proposals on the same vacation feels like it might make one feel cheapened. I think you could feel bad regardless if you were proposed to first or second. 

Are these emotional speculations accurate? How would you feel if your best friend was proposed to on the same vacation? wtf do we do?",22Feb2018,3
394,"I recently started meeting with a therapist and she asked questions about serious thoughts of suicide. And I attempted suicide a short while ago. She says she’s obligated to tell my parents and put me in a hospital if I show any signs of suicide, I told her I haven’t. Should I come clean? I just really don’t want my parents mad at me and to go to the hospital. And I don’t think its anyones business to whether I stay alive or not.",22Feb2018,3
