0,"So here's some background. My mom has back problems and diagnosed with MS, brother recently passed away so my dad is mentally checking out. My sister had to drop out of college because they found a tumor in her head, and my mom has to take care of her. My entire family is stressed, and here comes my Aunt and Uncle who recently got kicked out of their apartment because they could not afford it anymore, and moved into our house against our will. My parents are too stressed to have them here, and they have been here for almost a year now. My parents have tried to get them to move out, as well as my other uncle who tried helping them move out in anyway possible, but they keep refusing and getting defensive instead of looking for help. My aunt got a cashier job and my uncle now works in one of my parent's stores (my parents own a small business and work 12 hour days 7 days a week). 

So here are some of the problems. My aunt and uncle don't really help around the house or anything. They sleep in my room and I sleep on the couch. They are known to be very lazy workers, which is why they lost their apartment in the first place. Now, their daughter, who is in middle school, lives in our house as well, and there is no one to take care of her. I usually end up feeding her when I am home from college, otherwise I don't know how the fuck she survives. My mom also has to take care of my grandmother who lives with us, so I don't know how she can put up with having a whole other family here at the same time. Their business does not make enough money to support 2 families, so this definitely is not sustainable. 

Where do I begin to even look to find a solution to this situation? Are there any government programs that will help them get back on their feet and into their own place? Having my uncle work for my parents is not accomplishing much, he is not a hard worker, he is just there to watch the store for a few hours a day otherwise my parents would not be able to sustain the work schedule.

1,"""The first time I saw you



I knew you were the one



Your blue eyes were the first thing I saw



They glow in the dark and give me the light to see your warm kind heart



Your smile gives me happiness and joy



When I'm feeling down- your smile, heart, and laugh kick out the bad



When you are sad or in pain


I want to press a kiss on your lips and protect you from all the evil

2,"I would appreciate if you give me a general answer to this, but I was wondering how to do this in school. I was always the kind of ""responsible"" student and the vast majority of the people aren't that way, and often I'm seen weird, but that's not the point. 

In the past other people usually asked me to give them my homework to copy, give them the correct answers in tests and that sort of things.  And I always accepted because I have a low self-esteem I guess? I don't really know. 

Now I am in a new school, and the majority are that same way. We haven't started for real yet, I mean, we are not doing homework nor works or tests at the moment, we are in our first weeks. But I'm afraid this will happen again and I don't want to be the the ""helpful"" one all the time without appering to be rude or selfish.",20Mar2018,3

5,"Currently, I am in my forth week of uni. Fresh out of highschool. And I hate it. 

I hate every second of it. I cannot find the will or the motivation to be interested in any of my topics. I thought I wanted to work with animals when I was older...but now I'm wondering if I had just jumped at the first idea that had seemed remotely interesting. 

I have until the end of next week to decide to drop out or post-pone my study. And I don't know what to do. Its driving me insane. I feel like I'm not ready for university, that I need to take some time to be myself, and live my life. Get on top of my depression and my eating disorder. 

But I'm scared of being seen as a failure. I'm scared that I will postpone, only to find that Im going to end up doing the exsct same degree. I'm scared that I won't find something I actually want to do. 

I'm just scared. I have an appointment with a counsellor on monday to discuss this. I was so sure that dropping out was the right decision, but suddenly I'm full of doubt. I don't know what to do. Please help? ",20Mar2018,1
6,"So when I was 14 I met a girl. She was great. We became friends pretty gradually throughout the school year, and I caught feelings. Then I moved out of state. We kept in contact despite that, and we got really close. I never stopped being into her. A little over a year ago, when I was 16, I laid it all out for her. She was my best friend, and she knew I’d been into her in the past. At that point we both had feelings and we just never did anything about it. It went without saying. I told her how I felt. I meant it. A few weeks later I realized how shitty a long distance relationship would be, and I cut it off. She was devastated, as expected. I felt awful. I still do. I went off and got into another thing with a girl from my hometown, and I really don’t know why. It sucked. I lost her friendship because I was a horny dick and felt like I was standing up for myself by cutting her off. We reconciled that summer, so after about seven months of not speaking. The feelings I had for her never went away. I felt like I deserved it, to not have her, because I fucked up before. We talked everyday again, and it was great. It would never be the same ever again, but I accepted that. I was just ecstatic to be her friend again. Then, she got a boyfriend. He’s a wonderful guy, we played baseball together right before I moved away. I’m so happy for her and him. She has someone who won’t hurt her and he has my best friend. On Halloween this past year she texted me after a few days of not talking to me that she was cutting me off. Said it didn’t make sense for us to be friends anymore because I lived far away. She called me an obligation. I think about it every day. I think about her every day. I miss her terribly. I don’t even know if I love her, but shit if you feel this way for like four years almost that has to mean something, right? It physically pains me to long for her to talk to me again. I have no motivation and i was in a rough place before but this has really exasperated it. I’m sick of wanting someone who doesn’t want me. I can’t blame her, but it still sucks regardless. I will never shake what happened. I have trouble eating, sleeping. I just coast through the day a lot of the time. I lost my best friend. I’m afraid i’ll never feel this way about someone ever again. I can’t bring myself to be attracted to anyone. Only one person has gotten hold of me as much, and that was in july, and it didn’t end well either. I want to be in a relationship and feel important to someone, and to feel safe. I’m tired of being so down that I can’t get out of bed in the morning. I’m tired of telling my therapist about this girl every time I see him and trying to wade through everything I feel when I don’t even understand it. I want to be okay with being with someone else. I want to be sure of myself when i find someone who cares about me, and I want to find someone good for me again. I’d be lying if i said i surround myself with girls that i’m on the same wavelength as most of the time. I just feel like i’m chasing another April. But the problem is there’s nobody but her. There’s only one her. I want to stop trying to find another her. I really want to feel attraction to people again. I want to be happy with someone. It’s the worst part of all this. So, everyone, how do you let go and become attracted to other people again? How do I ditch all this shit because it’s honest to God the worst pain i’ve ever felt in my life. Not that i’m very old at all but you get it. Thank you so much, sorry for the longass post. ",20Mar2018,1

12,"This has been eating me up inside since everyone I know seems to be getting into relationships, and I don't understand if I'm doing something wrong.

Let me start by saying I'm a 20 year old male who has never been in a relationship. When I was younger, I just never really cared to be in one. I mean, I wouldn't have minded being in one, but no one every really caught my eye. Some girls did, but I didn't talk to them, and the ones that I did talk to, I didn't really care about.

Now, I'm twenty and I really want to be in a relationship, but I'm wondering if something is wrong with me.

I'll meet some girls that I think are cool, but it's not like I really care to pursue them. I've never met a girl where I was like ""WOW, I REALLY want to get to know this chick and possibly date her and win her over"".

When I meet someone, its mostly like "" Ya, I guess shes pretty cool, maybe if I got to know her better we could date or something"". This is how I am with almost every girl that I could possibly date. It's like, ""maybe if we got to know each other better or something"".

This leads to two things:

I think that other people relationships start out with this instant ""click"" or genuine ""love"" of the other and it takes off from there. This makes me think that something is wrong with me since I have never had this.

On the other hand, I think that people meet and just slowly get to know each other and fall in love. This then leads me to thinking that I just need to know the other person better and I try to force myself to fall for them and talk to them.

Am I overthinking this? What the fucking hell.",20Mar2018,5
13,"I(Male in highschool)want to ask a girl to prom. My problem is that she doesnt know im into her and im not sure if that's an ok time to ask.

22,"I did 2 years of a maths degree before failing one of the exams at the end of the 2 years (wasn't doing well in any of the modules anyway though tbh). I got this result last September, and I've basically just been leeching off my parents since. Up until about a month ago where I quit playing league of legends and realised all the time I was wasting/how much I was self sabotaging myself.

Since then I've been trying to think of a path for my future and I don't know what that is, I've never really known what I wanted to do tbh.

One of my thoughts is to go back to university, this time a local one that is 15 mins away instead of 5hrs to try another degree. I'm nervous to do this because I know how depressed I got attempting my last one, but maybe if I do stuff differently i.e. properly engage with the course instead of spending all day in my room playing league and living by myself instead of going into halls I'll be mentally much better (as well as being closer to my family/pets).

The other question here is whether or not I try a different subject, economics, as I have maths/business studies A levels. Problem with this idea is that I've used 2/4 years of student finance and I can't get 2nd year deferred entry for a subject that isn't maths, which would land me £9k in tuition fees. It's worth noting my dad has offered to help with fees but I feel bad about taking that much money and am scared that I'll hate the course after taking that much money.

Aside from uni another idea I had was to try and learn programming, which I'm currently doing with javascript. I feel like I need to be doing something more proactive though than learning a skill I might be able to turn into a career in the future.

I'm trying to find a min wage job in the meantime, but I'm not even having success applying for supermarkets etc which is super demotivating too.

I really don't know what I should do here any advice is appreciated, hope I articulated my thoughts well enough to understand.

24,"So, I went on a date on friday and it went pretty well considering we met online. The conversation went pretty well and wasn't that uncomfortable so I am interested in seeing him again. Anyways, we have been messaging on whatsapp, which allows me to see when he is online and if he re-reads messages. I was the last to send a message saying that I had a good time. He has been online the during the weekend and the app showed me that he has re-read the message a few time. I wanted to say something but I wasn't sure if I should ask him how his day was or ask him to grab a drink later on in the week. Should I just ask him about his day or do you think it is weird that he has not messaged me back?",20Mar2018,2
25,"I’ve told her what happened, and she was the first person to come over and be with me the next day. At that point, I hadn’t been able to process what had happened.. all I knew was that I was a) still drunk at 3 that afternoon and b) that I just felt gross and something was really really wrong. 

I didn’t call it rape at that point because I was in denial and it had been one of my really good friends, no way he’d betray me like that. But as the days went on, I couldn’t sleep, I was having nightmares and panic attacks. He texted me two days later and I promptly deleted and blocked him on everything and haven’t spoken a word to him since. 

I don’t remember much about that night other than he had to physically carry me back to his place where I proceeded to vomit uncontrollably for a long time. I woke up with no pants on in his bed and had to ask him if we had slept together, and he laughed it off and said “yeah for a little bit but I stopped because I didn’t have a condom.” 

He drove me home, and he had one of those pocket breathalyzers on his key chain.. I blew a .09 at 10am that morning. 

I’m a completely different person since that night happened. I don’t drink much, even with people I trust more than anything in the world. Sometimes I start crying if I have been drinking and my boyfriend and I start having sex. I think I lost a lot of my happiness and I’m still trying to re-find the person I was before it happened. 

I told her it was rape since then and she knows exactly where I stand on that, yet continues to see him sometimes. It’s hurtful and confusing. Like I said, she’s my best friend and I can’t imagine a life without her in it but I’m also so so hurt and I feel like this monumental event that changed me so badly has been swept under the rug.

Bob and I recently have been hanging out a lot more and we have been texting, snapchatting, etc. a lot more. He also has been complimenting how I look and this is kind of weird but seemed to stare at me a lot. A few days ago on the way home from a school trip where we took charter buses, Bob and I cuddled the whole way home. After the trip, we both admitted we were really confused with our feelings. I confessed to Bob that I really missed him, and he told me I should back off and we should give each other space. 

Then, after hearing from some friends that Bob had a crush on a girl, lets call her Susan, I decided to ask him if it was true. He told me it was true, he likes this girl Susan. I immediately get heartbroken, but more than I have ever been before. I don't know if it's because he basically lead me on with the cuddling, or if it's because I just got out of a relationship and I miss having a guy to comfort me, but for some reason I really can't get over this.

We recently replaced the timing belt, water pump, battery, front o2 sensor, spark plugs, and probably some other things I can’t remember right now. Well of course the check engine light is on again!

We took it to a car shop again and they gave us a list of things it needed done, including replacing the front o2 sensor and timing belt. They said it also needs a new cam sensor and the back o2 sensor needs to be replaced. The total estimate was around 2000 dollars.

We’ve been having another issue too that sometimes when we start the car, and we start moving it in the driveway, it will shut itself back off shortly after. It doesn’t happen all the time but we’ve had it happen two different days. I looked up that issue online and it seems to have nothing to do with the parts that the first car place said we needed to get fixed.

Anyway the short story is we are really stressed. We’ve been saving for over a year to get a down payment on the house we’ve wanted and this car seems to always be causing problems.

I live pretty much alone because my father works away and only comes home about once a week to check in on me and buy me food. I haven't talked to my mother in about 6 months now due to a bunch of arguments and fights that pretty much added up to one big fight that led our relationship to break.

I lost all of my childhood friends due to us going to different schools and losing interest in each other. (I Still occasionally talk to one person I've known for 7 years.)

And today i just found out i will be kicked out of my highschool for having extremely bad grades. And the school has ''Too many students'' for me to study an extra year(like most students with bad grades in my country).

I have grown up loving lacrosse. My whole family is loaded with lacrosse players. I genuinely love the sport, but the time and energy it sucks away from every other facet of my life makes me despise every second I spend out on that field. 

I am a straight A student, and I refuse to allow myself to make anything less. I work my ass off to receive the quiz and test grades I need. Not only that, I like figuring things out and learning. So although it may be hard sometimes, I enjoy it.

41,"So I was renting a room out of a house from an old man. The old man was a little off (always stayed indoors with his cat, senile) and so the man’s thirty year old son took care of who rented, screening people, collecting bills, and so on.

I lived there for a year and a half and was on good terms with them until the day I moved out. Often made small talk with the son when seeing him in the common area, and he seemed really sad when I got a new job and moved out. I was told I would be mailed the deposit. A month later, the deposit wasn’t mailed yet, and I contacted the son. He ignores my texts over the course of 2 weeks. I then try to message him on LinkedIn and find out he has unfriended me there. Finally, since he has his own website (he is a software engineer at Disney, I guess he also hires himself out for side work?) I finally contacted him through the website. FINALLY he responds and says I won’t be getting a deposit back, claims I didn’t clean up after myself and all my $500 was used.

First of all, I not only cleaned out and vacuumed the room, I even vacuumed the inside of the closet. I was only renting 1 room out of their house. I even wiped down the sink counters of the common areas that I hadn’t used in over a month, and moved out 2 weeks early. The guy used to text me regularly, and there was not a peep from this guy that he was unhappy with the way I left the place. It was clear that he saw an opportunity to keep my $500 deposit now that I had moved out and jumped at the chance to do so.

So what can I do? I work in IT at a prestigious medical school so I have to be careful not to send the guy texts arguing with him. I feel like even if I sued him he wouldn’t pay up, I thought we were on really good terms (he would offer to let me into Disneyland for free because I was “one of the few people he cared about” just 2 weeks before I moved out).",20Mar2018,2

I don't need the money back urgently, and truthfully can wait until the actual event, but I feel like I need to stick to my guns or it can lead to being taken advantage of in the future.

When is an appropriate time to get pissed without damaging the friendship? I don't believe they will skip on It, rather they just plan on giving me the money at the very last second ($154 each so $308 total).",20Mar2018,4
46,"There is this one guy I have known for like less than 2 years, and he always acted like he had my back and was giving me advice for girls that I had crushes on. I told him important things about me like my crushes and situations I have been in. He though hated when I messaged him, and he really wanted me to stop. Understandable . Then a couple of friends told me he had been shit talking me with his friends and saying a lot of other insensitive mean stuff, and that I should not be around him because he is actually a bad influence. He also lies and denies telling people things about me, but gets mad at me when I white lie. I know I can't stop him from shit talking me though. He is a fake friend, and one of my friends told me I should slowly cut him off. I agree but don't know how to do it. I don't want him to know that my friends told me about him. His birthday is this Thursday though.

I experienced a few months in later 2017 where I was working a few hours a week, which screwed up my ability to receive unemployment.  Result?  Poor.  If I applied for disability I would just get laughed at.  Whatever I have hasn't been figured out yet, but it acts like lupus.

I am going to have to pay the IRS $1500 for the 2017 tax year (self-employed), which I currently have, but barely.  I'm barely affording my apartment.

56,"tl;dr I was bedridden, am not bedridden anymore and living in the city. Does anyone have any advice on how to meet people?

My story has many ups and downs, but even just 1 year ago I was living with my parents and could barely get out of bed because of disability (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome). I'm feeling much much better now and am able to get out and about multiple times a day, as long as I take precautions and rest up before/after. Because of this improvement, and also lucky jumps in the cryptocurrency market, I was able to move out into San Francisco, for the very first time living on my own.

Now my problem is, even though I have some money now, and all the time in the world, I am completely unsure how I can meet people, both romantically and just for friendship. It's been years since I've had honest to goodness companionship, perhaps not since high school when I was 17. I'm pretty out of practice outside a handful of online dating encounters that didn't go anywhere.

I've tentatively started going to bars, but I can't drink very much because I don't want to risk going backwards medically, and frankly I haven't ever really liked alcohol anyways. I play music, so I've talked to a few people I've met out at bars, or online on craigslist, but most people are working and can only play a few hours a week at most. I also don't think I could join a travelling band and tour around the country or anything like that, I'm pacing myself and at the moment just going around the bay area at most right now.

It's hard to explain how isolated I was and still am. I stopped playing video games and binge watching Netflix as a result of trying to better myself, but now I have nothing to do and no one to talk to for hours, days, weeks at a time.

Any thoughts at all would be very welcome.

60,"Hello advice! I’m a first time poster on here so I apologize if there is anything incorrect with the format of my post. I began a new job about 2 months ago for a small distribution business who needed supply chain assistance desperately. We currently have around 1000 products which we sell. I am technically my own department as a buyer, inventory planner, supply planner (for select customers), and product manager. In the two months i’ve been working I have set up individual part details entire ERP system, issued new part numbers / product codes to every single item we distribute, assigned reorder points for each item, and calculated demand for each item. I even built an automated buy recommendation excel file based on if the items fell below their ROP’s for while I’m implementing the new ERP system. All of this while buying in acceptable  inventory levels and providing information for customer service and sales reps. Supply planning for to assist our suppliers when to produce, and inventory planning with our customers.
I’m having trouble directly with the controller. Our controller was given free reign over what went on in our business until I began working there, and now feels threatened. She has prevented me from completing my work in a timely manner multiple times. For example, I have yet to be given an account on our ERP system even though I’m the buyer and in charge of setting it up. Customer service reps already have accounts over me despite my multiple requests. We have training sessions and I need access to follow along. Also, I was not given access for an entire month to see open purchase order details to which only our controller can assign access to. The controller has threatened to fire me in front of other employees...over excel sheet format. The controller had also screamed at me and told me I’m done and that they wish me the best of luck after one of my coworkers reported her to the business owner for threatening my job publicly.

I need advice on how I can effectively communicate to the controller and owner how important and difficult each of these tasks were to set up for them as I am on a “three month trial period.”  I could also use some insight as to how I can portray the different positions which I fill as a buyer, supply planner, inventory planner, and product manager. These titles were unknown to them before I arrived. Also, I am receiving reduced pay until 3 month trial is up. I just moved into a new apartment and if I lose this job I’ll most likely be forced to move out as I guarantee the controller will fight me getting unemployment. ",20Mar2018,2

Soon after this guy was trying to get my attention. I've had guys aggressively hit on me before so I assumed that he was as well and thought that ignoring him was the best solution since it worked before; I even walked to the other end of the stop. The guy followed me then stood in front of me.

I decided it would probably be best to take an earphone out but before I could he took my earphones out of my ears. He asked ""Did you take my phone."". I got kinda scared, for no real reason, and tried to back up while shaking my head no. 

He then stood really close to me with one foot in between mine and said, ""Then why you listening to music then?"". He repeated that question a few times and I know I should have said something but I didn't know what to say. I kind of just stood there while he stared me down. I wanted to use the mace I carry but it was in my breast pocket and I didn't want him to think that I was reaching for a gun.

For science fair this year, I studied and experimented with different designs of Aerocontrol devices.  This was my first year doing any of this and it caught the attention of someone high up in a prestigious company. 

Thus, two employees (Senior HR and a lead engineer) came down and visited me to express how impressed they were and how I had a lot of potential and invited me to some awesome events.

They gave me their emails and the lead engineer gave me a phone number to contact.

69,"I'll try and be brief. 

I work for a call centre as a stopgap, and was recently turned down an internal interview for a job my experience would have been perfect for.  The job involved process improvement, efficiency analysis and some other stuff.

I took it on the chin, I need to make rent, so I will just go in and do my job as I did before.

After that setback, I decided that as I used to code a while (10 years or so) ago, to get back into it.  I had a project in mind.

Most of the call centre work is based in Chrome tabs, and one of our most laborious tasks is arranging returns with various couriers.  They each have their own layout.  It's basically a solid couple of minutes of copying / pasting each time.

So, I made a Chrome extension that does it for me.  Here's what it looks like: https://i.imgur.com/O9p3bBt.png

It just reads the class info from the page it's on, puts it in an array, redirects to the appropriate page and injects the array fields into the correct places.  

Took about a day, and I found it a fun project.  It was a problem to solve.  That it was about work is an aside.  I did this on my own time.  I did not use company data, resources or time.  Apart from having a view of the data so I could get IDs etc.  There is also nothing in the company handbook about installing software, let alone a Chrome extension. 

Word spread that I had this thing, my colleagues are nosy and look at my screen the whole damn time when they're bored on a call.  They saw me do a return in 5 seconds flat.  

Word got to management.  They're interested, and would like to test it and potentially deploy it as standard.  

I said no.  On the project notes page it is stated the extension is not for commercial use without explicit permission from  the author.  They don't have a copy of it anyway, but I'm sure IT man could grab it if he wanted.  I doubt he'd care.

I'm still pissed about not even being given an interview, and they want me to give them this thing?

Apparently I am just showing off.  Fair.  

Now they're going through the IT handbook to figure out if I am allowed to run JavaScript I have written, on a work computer. 

Feeling bitter.  Not sure how I should react?

tl;dr:  Got refused an interview, proved myself otherwise with a useful project, management want it for free and I refused.  Now things are weird.

Throwaway for this one. I have been offered an internship that I would love love love to accept. Right in my field, and with a great company.

74,"Backstory: This girl bugs me all the time, constantly tries to have sex with me because we do every once in awhile when drunk. She's known to have sex with a lot of people in my town. So Sunday morning pretty drunk she comes and we have sex for about 20 seconds because I start sobering up and instantly regret, I pull out and cum all over her backseat. Before having sex I distinctly remember asking her if she's still on the pill which she replies yes. After sex she then says without me even mentioning it that she'll grab plan B later. Fast forward to Saturday night, exactly six days later.

 I had blocked her number some days ago so I can stop having her pester me all the time because it began feeling stalkerish and I was extremely uncomfortable. She snapchat messages me and asks if I blocked her I replied no, she then comes out saying she thinks shes pregnant because she missed her period. Things not adding up for me which she said that night:

1. Said she started a new pill oh so conveniently that day or the day before, she never stated which day.

2. Originally says she took a test already then later on in the convo says she plans to take a test the next day.

3. Says she'll get a abortion for sure.

4. Explains that when this is over she doesn't want me to resent her or hate her.

5. Says if I want she'll just leave me alone with this and deal with it herself.

Fast forward to the next day, says she took a test and got a faint line. She explains how she spoke with her doctor and the doctor said she's most likely pregnant and she will make a appointment to see her. 

I'm not very worried because I'm pretty sure she would get a abortion if she is telling the truth, considering she isn't a idiot and is working towards being a doctor and is very smart but at the same time I think this girl is mentally ill or something. But what I'm wondering is a few things:

Can a pregnancy test even be that accurate this soon? She has yet to show me any proof of said test, but I'm afraid to ask for any because I really believe shes mentally unstable and I don't want to cause a breakdown or something of that nature putting me in danger. What steps should I take to ensure I can keep her calm and stable but at the same time get more answers?

I then inevitably reflect on my past week, then month, then year, and always come to the conclusion that time's going by way too quickly. I regret that I somehow made it pass by in such a way. 

It scares me, to think that X amount of years has already gone by. I also always end up feeling extremely sentimental, and I guess in moderation, this wouldn't be a problem but every day, I get the same feeling of regret and sadness.

I had hoped it would change when she had a baby but unfortunately that’s not the case. she has always had issues with personal hygiene and just cleanliness in general which always bothered me. She only showers twice or 3 times a month. She and her boyfriends house was always filled with dog shit, roaches, bed bugs, lice and all the creepy crawly things that a home should not have. I was always uncomfortable being there and prayed that things would change when the baby came and it didn’t.

My sister has been in a relationship with her current fiance for almost 10 years now. They have an okay relationship, there is an obvious emotional disconnect and they tend to argue over silly things (she likes order and cleanliness, he tends to leave messes everywhere).

Should I move on to Company F where I will have a guaranteed stable schedule but the job might suck and the pay is 50 cents less than the other company?",20Mar2018,2
87,"Taking a small trip to Denver, Colorado for 3 nights. Doing this as a little experiment to see what it’s like going on vacation solo. I know it’s nothing crazy like going to a foreign land where I don’t know the local language or something like that. But if I end up liking it, that’s something I’d like to eventually do. 

The good thing is after those 3 nights, I’ll be flying to Los Angeles to meet up and stay with an old friend that moved out there for the second half of my trip. 

Usually when I go on trips it’s with family or friends. 

A little bit about myself: I’m 25 years old. I’m in school for Nursing. I’m male and from New York City. I like to drink and smoke here and there. I don’t mind the bar scene but I’ve never went to a bar by myself before. I’m all for it though.

88,"I recently got news that my girlfriend got molested in her sleep by her younger brother. He's going through puberty and has been very awkward lately, and out of the blue he acts out like this. They share a room due to a financial situation and lack of rooms, and he crawled into her bed at night. I am absolutely disgusted. I feel horrible that I had no influence over the situation and that this happened to someone I love.

I am fucking livid right now and I know I'm being irrational, but I want nothing more than to hurt him. Her parents have decided to put him in therapy but I feel like that's not going to fix any issue. Like it's a band-aid solution. 

I KNOW that my desires are wrong and that I need to give him a chance, but from what she described it as, he knew what he was doing. He apologized when she woke up. What horrifies me is that he could have been doing this for weeks or months.

I just have a lot of thoughts and needed to put it down. I've been told that ""everything's going to be okay"" but I really don't know anymore. I can't confide in anyone I know so if anyone can just tell me that I need to relax or that I'm right, it might make me calm down.",20Mar2018,5
90,"A bit of context...So I basically just fucked around my first two years of high school, I guess I always thought I was the “dumb kid”. But this year (I’m a junior) I have really got my ass in gear and have been taking it seriously. My GPA for junior year is about a 3.7 but my last two years have been abysmal. My cumulative GPA was a 2.2. I took the ACT and got a 26 and then took it again a few weeks ago and haven’t gotten the results back but I’m feeling really good. I think I did significantly better than before, but who knows what will happen.

I have goals and aspirations for the future; I want to go into politics. Mostly foreign relations of some sort. I’m in track right now and I’m in a club called model UN where we do simulations of situations they might see in the UN. I also want to run for student government next year. For the first time in my life I’ve been motivated and I want to get into a good college.

I’m going to keep taking the ACT until I get a 30, and it’s not that far of a reach. If I do get a 30 is there any way I could get into a good college with my GPA? My dad makes pretty good money so my tuition, housing, and books aren’t that much of an issue, he won’t be paying for all of it but I’ll definitely have some help.

97,"Okay, some background. 
Me and this girl (well call her abby) dated for a very short time ab a year and a half ago. It was fun while it lasted but she ended up leaving me for another guy (who was, and still is, to an extent, a friend of mine). It was a really rough time, but I got over it in about a week and a half. 

FF a year later and me and one of her friends (well call her Jenna) start hitting it off on our HS band Florida trip. Things get really good and Jenna and I end up dating. During this relationship, Abby and I became good friends again (she would tell me stuff Jenna told her about me). 

I ended up breaking up with Jenna for mostly irrelevant reasons except one of them was I started liking Abby again. A lot. I felt like it was going to cause a lot of problems down the road for Jenna and I so I ended it to save us both a lot of trouble.

Anyway, ff about a month later and I’m over Abby again, and I start dating another girl (well call her Mary). Mary and I do good for a couple weeks but she decides that she isn’t ready for a relationship and ends it out of nowhere. This was a shocker to me, so naturally I turn to Abby for advice on dealing with it

This is where I start to fall in love

Keep in mind, this whole time, Abby is dating the guy she left me for, so things are really strange, considering she had a bad habit of calling me “perfect” and “the cutest guy she’s ever met” (although I have a hard time believing those are genuine). 

Now, about her boyfriend (well call him chad, for obvious reasons)

He’s a giant asshole to her. Borderline abusive at times. He’s been unfaithful multiple times and has physically thrown her to the ground multiple times because he’s wanted to see something on her phone that she wouldn’t show him (but she’s not allowed on his phone). Overall giant asshole and bad boyfriend.

We used to talk about him a lot. I remember once telling her that things are only gonna get worse and she agreed wholeheartedly. But she just won’t let go, because she feels pressured be her family, who loves him probably more than she does, and who’s spent probably &gt;$1000 on him. 

Anyway, this led to me a couple days ago finally telling her how much I liked her. It was a big paragraph about how I wasn’t telling her to break up with Chad but how I liked her a lot and just wanted her to be happy. It changed nothing. Keep in mind, I’m in high school. I see those two every day, hugging and kissing each other goodbye at the end of the day. And lemme tell you, that shit stings. A lot. And it hurts to even think about her with another guy

This led to me essentially telling her “look, you’re fed up, give him to Monday(today) to decide whether you stay or leave” 

She stayed

This fucked me up a lot because I knew how bad the relationship was and I was debating just calling her an idiot for staying but I refrained. I opted for telling her in full detail how much I loved her and how it hurt so much to see her with someone else and how I couldn’t talk to her anymore because it was a constant reminder of how close but yet so far I was from the woman I loved so much. She said she understood and would leave me alone 

This was about an hour ago, and I already regret it.

So, how do I fix this. How do I get her to see things from my POV on how bad and borderline abusive her boyfriend is.

98,"I'm so sick to my stomach since I just found this out only a matter of an hour ago so excuse any rash comments I make or bad grammar. When I was 18, I was drugged and sexually assaulted by a guy from my town. My now current boyfriend (I was single at the time of the attack) was friends with the perpetrator, but after the incident he seemed to stop talking to him. About 3 months after the sexual assault, I started dating my current boyfriend, and we have been together 5 and 1/2 years. 

A friend of mine from high school just sent me a screenshot of my sexual predator's Facebook profile picture from 3 years ago, picturing my boyfriend, and my sexual assaulter standing next to one another at some festival where my boyfriend went to college. This has me rethinking everything. I would imagine someone who loved me would avoid this guy at all costs, not be out at a show with him. It's super uncomfortable for me to even bring this up to my boyfriend, but I'm thinking he probably has loads more secrets he's hiding from me, making it really hard to trust him. 

Am I overreacting? Should I end this relationship because of a photo from 3 years ago? Do you think my boyfriend actually cares about me to even have the tolerance to stand next to someone who has traumatized me and brought so much suffering to my life? 

Tl;dr my boyfriend of 5 and 1/2 years was photographed 3 years ago with my sexual predator (attack happened months before my boyfriend and I got together/they were friends but stopped talking after the incident). I just found out about the photo today. How should I react? Is this a real, mature reason for the relationship to end? What do I do? ",20Mar2018,2

I need your opinion comment below 👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻 

I have so much things going on in my life. School, work, business. And I feel like, if I could focus on something I would get huge results in long term. Right now, I can’t afford it. But I also, can’t just sit and not do something.

There are so many successful examples such as @apple @virgin and even @instagram they all started as side hustles. 

2 ways have their advantages and disadvantages. However, doing it on side grants you a security, which most people value the most. No one wants to eat ramen 🍜 But ramen is good:) 

Since I don’t have a choice right now, I launched my Jean’s brand as side hustle.  I would really appreciate if you check it out link [Bedew Denim Jeans 👖 ](https://kayagroupusa.com/)

100,"So I'm a 19 year old college student who works retail.  I'm basically working full time now (I've averaged about the same number of hours as my supervisor), and I seem to be doing alright in school and staying sane.  I'm just wondering if it's a bad idea to officially have myself placed as a full-time employee.

It's looking like a supervisor position might open up at my job, and I know that I could get the position if I go for it, I'm just too scared to really commit to doing it.  I only have class tuesdays and thursdays, and online class.

This position would seriously solve a lot of my problems.  I don't have a safety net since I can't really move back in with my family, and the pay raise that would come with the position would let me have a bit more security.

However, my bosses would want me to have open availability that could mess with school.

So there is this cute girl who I work with that maybe I would like to try and talk to.

Once I found out she had a bf I just got over her and remained nice to her as she would come go around my section.

Later today I discovered she is like 80 percent single.  I discovered her on tinder ( swiped no just to avoid awkwardness ) also my friend found her too and I can't find any photos of them together anymore on his fb. 

is there anysmooth way to start talking with her again or somehow fr on fb? her and I have a mutual friend that I see photos of them together on my wall.

110,"I apologize for how long this is.

I am a PhD candidate and I began my PhD program 4 years ago. I am bisexual and was dating my college girlfriend. I was stressed out about being in my first year &amp; was stressed out with my girlfriend (she moved to my new city without telling me, couldn't find a job, had no friends besides me). Many of the other first year students dealt with stress by drinking a lot, exercising a lot, or eating a lot (or not eating at all). Regretfully, the way I dealt with my school + relationship + financial stress was seeking out risky sexual encounters. 

I was hooking up with a man in my department, who also had a girlfriend. After about a month, we ended things and I told my girlfriend. We didn't break up initially, but we stayed together. Around the same time, I became deeply infatuated with a married person in my department who was about 10 years older than me, who was already cheating on his spouse with another female student.

He and I ate lunch together, often alone or nearly so. We spent time in our lab together talking all the time. Our banter was witty and flirty and light and fun and I 100% used this as a distraction from my girlfriend and from the stresses of my research and classwork. My friends noticed us flirting and called me out on it, but I loved the notion of being associated with him in that way. He was hot and smart and funny and a prominent researcher. 

Each year most people in my field attend an annual conference. At the one in 2015, the man and I were on the same plane there. I was sending him silly emails (that he responded to) and then eventually asked for his phone number. He gave it to me and we texted a little bit. By the last day of the conference I stupidly made my move. I texted him to ask him if he wanted a distraction later that night. I proposed that if he did he could meet me by the elevator. And he did. We took the elevator up to his hotel room. He asked me why I was there and I told him that was a stupid question to ask. I insinuated what I wanted to happen (sex) and he started to look sad and made a bunch of excuses. After some pathetic negotiating on my part he didn't change his mind. His hands hovered above my hips and I closed my eyes and I knew he wanted me to leave so I left the room. 

The few months after that were minimally awkward but then he took a position at a another university that summer. 

My ex girlfriend and I are now broken up and while she knows about the physical infidelity with that other guy, she doesn't know about that night. After I got back from the conference, I was so sad. She and I didn't sleep together for maybe 6 months after that. 

I am deeply remorseful about the way I treated my ex-girlfriend and the way I treated myself. After she and I broke up, I found that I use casual sex, dangerous sex (i.e., no condoms), and consenting to sex that I am less than enthusiastic about when things are stressful at school. 

It took a lot of self reflection and some therapy but I finally see that there are other effective ways for me to deal with stress that will make me feel good about my body and myself, that don't hurt other people. 

Even though I've seen this man since that night, and things were fun and flirty and like nothing ever happened, I literally I have thought about what did &amp; did not happen in that hotel room every single day since March 2015. 

I am seeing this man at the same annual conference in a few weeks after not seeing him for 2 years. Yes, I know I can and should avoid him. But some sick part of me loves the flirting and loves being his ""friend"". 

How can I stop wanting the high of talking to him? How do I stop thinking about that night? How do I move on from this so that I can have a future healthy relationship with a single &amp; emotionally available person?

113,"This past weekend my fiancé and I went to a city a few hours away for a small getaway. We stayed in a modest Airbnb as we both are on a budget. Turns out it was a “converted” garden shed. It did have a bathroom and a kitchenette so it served the purpose despite the fact that if you were on the bed you pretty much had to make eye contact with the other person on the toilet as there was no divider. 

I never met the host because the shed was self-contained and we didn’t really need anything. We exchanged a couple of texts but that was it.

I very much believe in leaving a place the same or better than I found it.we always clean, bag up the trash, fold dry towels, hang up wet towels, and make the bed before we leave anywhere. I worked as a maid for 10 years so I do know how to clean effectively. I’ve always gotten comments from hosts saying that they could hardly tell that I had stayed. 

However, today she posted a review saying that it “looks like [fiancé and I] had a good time.” I was shocked because it seems like she’s trying to say we left a mess or trashed the place. I definitely do not want this comment associated with me. I’m 24 and in college so I’m already trying to fight the stereotype of young, irresponsible college student. 

I also have severe anxiety so I did run the comment by several friends who agreed on the implications. Because of this anxiety I’m just kind of at a loss as to what to do about it. Does anyone have advice on this situation?

But the thing is, I met a guy who hit all my right buttons so I decided to give it up to him. And obviously it was anal. He treated me completely like a girl that night until once, when he had me sitting on the table and was pounding me; then her decided to jerk me off till I shot cum over my breast and face.

116,"Hello everyone! 

Currently I (26 F) work at a small callcenter office that does work mostly on job sites around the country. I've been with the company 2 years and since I started it's almost doubled in size. It's mostly phone calls and paperwork, which is pretty easy, but it get extremely high stress at times. Like most of the time. However, it does pay pretty well. 

My problem is that this stress is really starting to wear me down. I can't get a good night's sleep because of the nature of parts of this job - something can literally go wrong all the time. I'm seen as a ""manager"" without really being a manager so when things do go wrong I immediately get most of the blame. I'm also solely responsible for keeping track of all of our 300+ independent contractors monthly records, which is also a huge responsibility. I've asked multiple times over the last 10 months if I could get some help with it, but each time I ask the owner says she only wants one person doing it so she knows it's getting done correctly. And this project will just keep getting bigger and bigger with each contract the owner adds. I don't know if all of the stress and sleepless nights are really going to be worth it?


I do have dreams of just leaving this place and getting a job that I'll actually be excited to go do. I know there would be a different kind of stress involved with a new job but...I think it might be worth it? 

I guess my question is this: Would you give up a job that pays really well but you absolutely hate to find one that maybe doesn't pay as well but you could actually see yourself doing for years to come? Has anyone gone through the same sort of thing? If so how did it turn out?

117,"So this is my first post ever and I made my account just to ask this question. I'm a junior in college majoring in math. I have five more classes until I graduate. My dilemma is that I never really liked math from the beginning and I'm feeling really burnt out now. I had no advice in choosing a major so I really don't know why I chose math, but I've already come for so far. My parents were giving me the advice to just get a degree, it doesn't matter what it is in.
I feel like I should continue but I honestly hate it. I sit in my classes and feel that it's all so pointless. I realize now that after graduating I don't want to do anything related to math. I want to write books. I've written a few things, but I want to get more serious, study the art, and try to get published. I try to do it now, but I get so tired from school. It's always on the back of my mind and it fills me with so much anxiety to the point where I can't even write comfortably even though I want to.
I feel like I'm wasting my time and money if I continue. Since I've started college I've lost a ton of sleep. I don't feel good anymore and I have a lot of nervous break downs at night. I live in my parents house, so I commute and work far from my school, so hanging out with friends is hard and I never really clicked with anyone anyway. I'd rather just work on my writing.  The issue is that if I quit or take a break from school,  my parents will make me move out which I can understand. But I'm really scared about this. I don't know a single thing about supporting my self on a cashiers salary. Is that even enough money? But I just don't want to stay in school anymore.
I'm sorry this is long, but I really need advice. I can't think straight and I'm tired of feeling miserable. It's hard because I've always been the good child, the one who always got good grades and did what my parents said.  I don't want to disappoint them, but I don't want to waste my time and I want to do something that gives me some sort of purpose. I'm close to being done with school, but I don't know if I could even finish strong. I'm open to any advice. Thank you.",20Mar2018,2

Now my new issue is saying it to others when I'm upset and do not mean it at all. What I really mean is that I simply want them to leave me alone with all the drama because I do not know how to handle it. I have been raped, abused, assaulted, bullied, stalked-the whole nine, and I honestly cannot handle difficult folks anymore. For example, I was playing one of my favorite games yesterday and suddenly, a group of people just started going in on me for no reason, for real. And I basically said that I hoped they all die and I feel so guilty; I swear I did not mean it. I could cry right now I'm so disappointed in myself and my language.

122,"Long story short, I moved out of state with my best friend, boyfriend, and a friend of his who I know but am not that close with. We'll call the friend Bilbo. Now Bilbo does not seem to understand other people's need for privacy and alone time. Every time I am in the kitchen or living room he will come out and either stand right next to me if I'm cooking, or stand behind the couch if I'm sitting on it, all the while being completely silent. It plain makes me uncomfortable and often times scares the shit out of me because he's so damn quiet. And when he's not being silent, he's making loud and often rude commentary about whatever I am watching. Ex. ""YOU KNOW that this show only has a laugh track because it's not actually funny"" okay who the fuck cares dude, I enjoy it so leave me alone.

Bilbo also comes into my and my boyfriend's room without asking/ knocking and when he is not wanted in there. It should go without saying that if someone retires to their room that they don't want to be bothered. Yet he insists on walking right in and just standing behind my boyfriend and I while we are on our computers with our headphones on. He will come up behind me and read over my shoulder(which is one of my biggest pet peeves). I feel like I can't go anywhere in the house and not be followed by him. Except maybe the bathroom...for now anyway. I have tried my best to just deal with it because I know that he's a bit socially awkward, but it has reached a point that I am uncomfortable in my own apartment. I am nervous to approach him about this because he has proven to be very defensive in the past and I don't want him to get angry. I also don't want to hurt his feelings.

123,"I was born and raised in India and for the past 4 years have been living in Los Angeles and pursuing an education here. I also have been in a relationship for about 4 years with my boyfriend who is American and of Mexican/Ecuadorian decent - we have been living together for 2 years now. My boyfriend has also been my best friend throughout my journey in this new environment - just as I moved to LA from India, he moved to LA from Houston and every since we met, our journeys blended together and we have stuck together ever since. We love each other and intend to marry each other as we have similar goals in life and similar lifestyle choices - for example, we both want to travel a lot and be self-employed in the long run, we both want to have kids etc.. Living together for two years, we have seen each other's good and bad sides and still want to do this together as our larger goals and values remain intact and as we love each other. We also have a similar childhood history in a way as I lost my mother very young and he lost his dad young too - so we relate to each other on many levels. So what is the issue? My family of course. In a typical Indian fashion, I did not tell my family about my boyfriend until 2 months ago as my family brought up the idea of my marriage. I intended to tell them when I graduated, as they may meet him as well when they come to my graduation ceremony - however since they brought the topic of marriage a semester before graduation, I decided to spill the beans on what I had in mind. Having lost my mother young, I was raised by my grandparents mostly and my dad too on the weekends. The three of them did a wonderful job providing for me and raising me. However, when I broke the news to them, my grandparents did not take the news well at all. My dad took it a lot better having been through my mother passing away, his second marriage ending up in divorce and currently on his third marriage - all of them being arranged marriages. My grandparents, especially my grandfather, are a whole another story - being raised by them, I always felt a generational gap. I could not stay out late and all that jazz. I know they sacrificed a great deal to raise me and know they love me and I love them back tremendously, but I don't think I can live my life by their rules anymore. I know they want the best for me, but the truth is they don't know what is best for me. They think I should marry an Indian hindu guy with a great job and lots of assets so that I have a happy and comfortable life in the future. My boyfriend is neither Indian nor Hindu (although, he has offered to adopt hinduism to please my family) nor has a job (he is self-employed and makes a decent living doing so) nor is he in line to inherit a bunch of assets from his family, yet, I feel like I will be more happy living with him. Why? Because I know that he would support me in living my life in my terms and he doesn't always listen to me, but always values my opinion. We both want to build self-sustaining businesses/investments that would allow us the flexibility to travel together (my boyfriend is already in the process of doing it) - I won't have this marrying a guy with a 'stable high paying job'. I have tried explaining to my grandparents the way I see it - letting them know that my boyfriend is willing to adopt my family's religion/culture. However, they cannot open their mind and see my point of view - they just see that my boyfriend is not Indian/Hindu and does not have a 'stable white collar job' or significant family assets. That is all they see - they think my life will be doomed as a result. My grandfather doesn't even talk to me anymore and my grandmother doesn't sound too happy when I call as she used to before. They are both old and I worry for their health and hope to fix our relationship and help them see that I will probably be happy on this path. I won't be the first in the family to marry inter-racially, however, my grandparents have always been disapproved of it and it must drive them nuts to see their grandchild who they raised walking a similar path. How do I make them see the light? How do I maintain a good relationship with them? I don't want to break up with my boyfriend due to this (I realize I have a whole life ahead of me and I cannot make a decision just to please my grandparents who are old, they don't get to live with this decision, I do), yet I also want to have a good relationship with my grandparents. I appreciate all advice/thoughts/opinions from other Indian people or people who have encountered a similar situation. Is there light at the end of the tunnel?",20Mar2018,5
124,"Long story short,

I had posted an advertisement on Craigslist looking for musicians in my area to collaborate and write music. I specified to work with people in my age range and listed 18-26 years old as the reference on the ad.

I received an email from a 16 year old musician who wants to write music. I want your thoughts on this because I am a 23 year old male. Would it be weird if I were to hang out with this kid and make music?

126,"FYI it's abit of backstory I need to tell, so bear with me lol, 

Hi y all I m in a bit of confusion here... I met this guy over a year ago here at my college and I always thought he was cute but never really paid him no mind we were really just acquaintances throughout the year. 

Late last year was when I seen him again and we started conversating. Now ever since January we ve hung out and had fun outings and such. The last time we hanged out together was just over a week ago and and he gave me special beads to put on my keychain and told me he ""only gives them to people who are important to him"" (not gonna lie I felt so special in that moment) 

We don't talk much through text and phone calls cause he doesn't like texting a lot and neither do I lol.  Though whenever we do hangout we always have at least one meaningful conversation outside of small talk and stuff that interests us
But he's been so nice and kind to me. 

So is this just him being super friendly? Or does he possibly like me? 

Please help me understand, people of Reddit :O",20Mar2018,2

131,"Hi Reddit! I always thought of myself as an introvert due to my quiet, shy, and socially anxious demeanor. I've come to realize this isn't the case and that I am 100% energized by social interaction. I love spending time with other people and if I could constantly be in the company of loved ones and having fun, that would essentially be my dream life. My current life is comprised of staying at home (in the process of finding a job) and spending time with my fiance. While I love seeing him, it's not enough social interaction for me. I visit my best friend about once a week for a couple of hours. I'm feeling extremely isolated and lonesome and am aware that this isn't the kind of life I'd like to be leading. I long for a life where I am surrounded by friends and family, but with my shyness and lack of connections, I'm not sure how to create the life I know I'd prefer. I grew up surrounded by family and this difference in lifestyle is very lonely to me. Do you have any suggestions for cultivating a more ""extoverted"" lifestyle?

**TL;DR** Extroverted but shy and currently isolated due to circumstance (though I live in a large city). Any recommendations on how to create a life where I am surrounded by friends and family, despite being socially anxious, without spending a bunch of money? ",20Mar2018,4
132,"Jeeez guys it's been 25 years and I still can't seem to get a date. Y'can't talk about this stuff in real life to anyone because if there's nothing quite as unattractive as being lonely and complaining about it. So here I am on a throw away lamenting my problems to you random strangers of reddit....gotta get these feelings out somehow.

I'm honestly at a complete loss now. I've been single my entire life, and I was hit with a rude awakening in college when I realized (after a girl who'd rejected me in highschool let me know) that I basically had no hobbies, ambitions, or opinions. I was just latching myself onto women because I was alone and sad and I wanted them to ""fix"" my problems by being with me. I felt like they were the solution to allllllllll my issues, but surprise surprise guys, no woman is going to come into your life and baby a person with nothing to offer. So I get it, I was just a shell trying to fill myself with someone else and that's...sssss....well its a little unattractive.

That being said, I changed, a LOT. I've taken the advice people always give you; ""better yourself"" ""get hobbies"" yadda yadda yadda. I've since learned how to control my anxiety, I've developed better social skills, I dug myself out of my depression, I'm going to school full time for animation. I'm a composer, an artist, a cook, and I'm pretty damn funny if I say so myself. I've built up my confidence and best of all I've done these things for ME, not as some convoluted ploy to attract women.

And yet....seriously, still, nothing. Nothing guys? Not a single person wants to go on a date? EVERY girl I meet just wants to be friends with me? I mean I get it....not every one is going to like you, sometimes you just don't have chemistry, but shit guys do I really have chemistry with NO ONE? I mean it feels to me like if nobody likes you after 25 years then its not the chemistry or the women that are the problem...its me! but I can't for the life of me figure out what it is I'm doing wrong!

What is it that I have to do? Do I have to go to the gym? Do I have to join more clubs? Do I need to find and develop even more skills? It just doesn't seem fair that I see people all the time who don't put any effort into bettering themselves, glide right by in the relationship process with no problems whatsoever, while I have to make myself perfect before anyone will consider me boyfriend material.

It doesn't help that we live in an era where most people my age feel like the only person that matters is ""you"". Most of my peers (and most people nowadays for that matter) don't tend to care much about ""relationships"" and just kind of blow them off like they're not important. ""you should just concentrate on yourself"" ""forget about getting a girlfriend and live YOUR life, she'll come eventually"" ""If someone likes you great, if not shrug oh well""

These are great opinions guys, but personally I LIKE coming home to texts from someone who isn't my mom who actually cares about how my day went. I like the idea of going to my girlfriends house and laying in bed with her while I sketch or do my homework. I get butterflies when I think about giving cute kisses to someone on a regular basis, and hanging out at some fast food restaurant in the middle of the night while we talk about our days together. Sorry to burst your bubble, but I'm a romantic....so the ""all you should care about is yourself"" ideology that's floating around so prevalently doesn't really ""fit"" me.

Obviously ranting over the internet isn't going to really change any of this, but God damn....I've just been in my head about it for so long...feels good to just let go for a bit...what on earth am I doing wrong? I just don't get it...",20Mar2018,19
133,"So for the past 5 months all I've been wanting to do is play video games every night or whenever I don't have exams coming up. I haven't felt motivated enough to do more than what's necessary when it comes to schoolwork. I want to change this.

We're going to thoroughly finish the math homework, as I tell myself. We're going to watch a YouTube video about this topic I truly don't understand when we get home. Then when the next day comes, I just feel so uninspired. My desire to be an A student just vanishes somehow, and all I want is to waste my time playing either Dota 2 or Overwatch. I'd hate myself at night and regret why I haven't started my check list for that day. The cycle repeats...

My boss has been picking at me, trying to find out if I want to stay as a full time employee after I graduate. Every time he asks, I say yes, because I don’t have any other job offers up to this point.

The thing is, I really don’t enjoy the work. It’s doable, and I’d do it for the right price, but there’s a lot of things about the job that I don’t enjoy.

If I get another opportunity somewhere else before I get an offer here, how would I inform them of this without completely burning that bridge?

And what if the salary they offer me is too low?

140,"Well, here I am. I am obsessed with being cheated on and I'm scared. My boyfriend gives me numerous reasons not to trust him, which seem minor, but they are putting doubts in my head. I already posted here, asking for advice. He planted a seed in my head. Long story short he told me that men were allowed to cheat if they were providing for the family and women weren't. But it wasn't him, no, he's an exception he said. That left a bad taste in my mouth.

I've always been scared of cheating. And once my first boyfriend did it, I was in depression for a year. They way he did it was so brutal (I had to listen to him and his new girlfriend have sex every night, because we lived in the same building). I don't want to go through that again. 

My boyfriend, let's call him Sam, has an ex that he broke up with a few months before we got together. He quickly told me he loved me, he told me no one ever made him feel like that and that he has never loved someone as much as he loves me in his entire life. After some tme we had a pretty rough patch. We went through it. 

I have little things that are stuck in my head. Little things that he does sometimes that make me doubt him so much. Maybe I'm exaggerating. 

Here's some backstory: 

There was a period that we lived together. During that time Sam didn't touch me. He obviously wasn't feeling attracted to me, he wasn't treating me very well. When I asked him if this was the case, he denied. At the same time we had some issues concerning him liking explicit pictures of semi-naked girls on facebook. I felt like shit. I felt ugly, worthless and disrespected. He couldn't understand why I was feeling bad about that and he refused to at least ""unlike"" the pages, because other people, and especially me, could see it. No, he didn't want to. He has a fear of being emasculated, of being told what to do. I was not telling him, I was showing him how hurt I was. Some girls might be okay with their boyfriends liking pages like that, I am not. And I found out that he preferred pleasing himself to these pictures instead of touching me. I felt sick. 

That's not the main thing though. Once, in the beginning of the relationship, after class we were talking and Sam was looking at his watch. He wanted to get rid of me, he told me he was waiting for a friend (a male friend). And I told him that I could wait with him if he wanted to (I knew he was going to see a female friend, because he texted her non-stop before that) and he kept trying saying no. I turned around and saw that female friend who hid behind a car and waited there, but when I pointed that out, he was like :""Oh, really? How strange?"" and then he told me to go... 

There wasn't anything going on with his friend, but I was feeling very bad about the whole situation and I knew she wanted to be with him. Well, they grew apart, she started judging him and writing long facebook messages about the things she didn't like about him. There are a lot of times when he tilts his phone and is being shady. And (I know I shouldn't have done it, but it was killing me) I snooped. I didn't find anything. 

The last thing that made me really angry (and I'm sorry if I sound like a pre-teen) was when he liked his ex girlfriend's profile picture on facebook. Now, I know I may sound paranoid and ridiculous, but combining that with all of the things above made me feel awful. I asked him about it, why did he do it, was it so important for him to notify that he still likes her? And he just told me: ""Of course I'll like it, it's a beautiful picture."". It was just a picture of her being dressed up in front of a white wall. 

I am obsessed and it's not healthy. I feel ridiculous sometimes because of this raging jealousy and I don't know what to do. I need a wake up call, a slap in the face. I feel like I'm being unreasonable. 

P.S. Sorry for any mistakes I make, English isn't my first language.

143,"I'm from Germany and need to travel a total of 3 hours per day to get to my job. My job is lackluster, I don't have much to do except for doing small tasks here and there (which is justified, I'm just an apprentice right now so they wouldn't let me do bigger tasks), and I feel very anxious when talking to people. I don't even sit in the break room with my coworkers during the one-hour break I have (due to being under 18) and instead wait it out for them to come out and me to go in and have a break in complete silence. I can't drive a car yet because you need supervision when driving a car with 17 and can only drive freely with 18.

I've two questions; First, am I socially anxious because I've Aspergers Autism or is it just natural? I've been working for 8 months now and nothing has improved.

Second, should I ditch my job? I bought most things I need, and money has never really been a problem to keep myself float.

I'm just at a loss and don't know if I'm doing anything wrong or right. Each and every month I ask myself ""should I really do this?"", ""why didn't I go to school instead?"", ""will I disappoint my parents knowing I've been doubting myself for months now?"".

We have some things in common but I just don’t think we have the compatibility for any sort of romantic relationship. He asked me out again this morning and I’m not sure how to respond. 


I’m really not used to the whole casual dating thing - so maybe there’s some obvious ways to handle this that I’m overlooking, but I honestly have no idea how to turn him down in a kind and non-awkward way. Advice?

167,"Hi. I’d really need some on in this problem, so thank you in advance.


TLDR: Bf is very depressed and mentally tired, been for years. He takes so much classes (takes 2x amount of studies every semester) and works at 3 different places, which stresses him out. He has completed one university degree, is finishing the second and applies for a third. The degrees are demanding, such as STEM degrees. So he would get a job with any of them, but they also fulfil each other so it cannot be said it’s “pointless” to study these 3 degrees. How can he help himself and I be there for him?

Background: met my bf in university, become best friends for a couple of years and started dating a year ago. We have lived in different cities for a couple of months because of studies and visit each other biweekly, which suits us well.

**He told me that the ultimate reason he overachieves is that people expect that of him.** I guess this started at high school, and continues to university where people speak of him as ""that super sudent who works super hard"" etc. This makes him anxious and he feels that he can't stop. His parent also has belittled him through years and he is kind of the scapegoat of the family, because as the oldest of the siblings he got a lot less help and time from his parents than the younger siblings. So, he also wanted to show his parents that he can be successful without their help. A lot of this problem stems from his childhood.

He is so intelligent, quick witted and strongminded that he has been able to do this speed for a couple of years, but he is getting more and more unhappy. He has seen a psychologist (a couple of times?) and taken some medication to depression, but quit both because he thought that therapy didn’t help because he can “tell the psychologist what he wants to hear” and that the meds took away his sharp mind (which is an important trait of his persona). I have tried to get him go back and get professional help, but he is unwilling to do so.

He expects this pain of completing everything and “not letting people down” to stop when he “has achieved his goals” and gets to be a stay at home dad. This is something I want to give him in the future, but it would be at least 6 years from this because I want to start my career first, and he doubtfully would make it so far without crashing badly.

When he tells me couple of times a month how unhappy he is, he expects me to console him. I find it hard to only tell him that everything is going to be fine, when I hope that he would do something for himself, such as see a professional as I pleaded. I know that a person has to want to help himself to get better, and honestly I don’t see that in him. 

This man is dear to me and I want to do everything I can to help him. He has given me endless support when I needed it and is a great friend. Being without him would be devastating. But it hurts me to see how unhappy he is with his life and frustrates me that he doesn't show will to help himself.


I would hope to get some insights and possibly some help on how to deal with this. Ask if anything was unclear. Thank you.

172,"Long story short, we met in tucson AZ when we were 22, and moved out to VA together for his job shortly after that. We recently decided to move back to Tucson for a great job opportunity for him but I guess he had been unhappy in the relationship, and in general, for a while and decided that before our big move, he wanted to do it without me. A ""clean break and a fresh start"" he said. I thought we were going to get married in a couple years. Definitely spun that car around went COMPLETELY the opposite direction, eh? I feel awful, as a person, and a partner, and human. 

Not only am I completely, totally, utterly heartbroken, I also don't have anywhere to go. I don't have family or friends that can take in an emotionally shattered person with no formal education, no plan, no savings(once I get out to wherever I end up going) and a (non-negotiable)cat. Because NoVA is so expensive, I couldn't make enough to really contribute. He has been covering most of the bills while we were here, and I saved what I could, but it's not enough to get me anywhere and still have a cushion. I dont even know if it could get me to a city and still have enough to rent an apartment. I don't have $3500 in lines of credit, but I'm at about $900 in debt to one of them right now because of pre-breakup emergencies and having to by things for new new room, like sheets and whatnot, since I got a smaller bed than the one we shared. I was working on paying to off, but now I'm making minimum payments and hoping for the best on that. I'd REALLY like to avoid using credit cards because they have a really high APR. My credit isn't phenomenal, partly from hospital blls and partly from just not having any credit in the first place when I got the cards. I'm aslo working full time for the next 4(possibly 2) months, plus a side gig as a hostess at a bar, but honestly I don't know how much more I'll be making since i was already doing 3 shifts a week at my main job, and the side gig doesn't pay that much more than the regular job. I feel so lost. I need a plan, but I don't even know where to start. 

We're still living together(again, no place to go!), and making an attempt to reconcile, but I don't have much hope for that working out.

I don't know what to do. I don't know where to go. I have time to make a plan but no idea where to start. The only two things I know is that 1) I've just lost my entire life, the future I've been building towards, happiness, hope. I'm not willing to lose my cat too. He's a paperwork'd ESA so I know at least I can get fees for him waived on an apartment, and he's well behaved so he isn't going to trash the place, just my furniture :|. 2) I don't want to go back to Tucson if we don't reconcile. I have a couple friends there, but if I ran into him, especially with a new girlfriend I would not be able to handle it. I know it's literally the cheapest city in the country to live, but I just can't do it. 2a) Also I'm heat sensitive, so if I can avoid the 115* heat that would be nice.

How do you have your entire world come crashing down around you, and pick up the pieces and find a new life, logistically? where do I go? How do I even choose a destination to land, and find a job, especially when I don't have anything besides ten years of retail, ""some college"", and ""knows some ASL"" on a resume? And a non-negotiable cat. and medical care. I'm bipolar, and have to keep my meds stable or things could get very bad very quickly.

I don't have much in the way of valuables, but i do have a car in good working order, so i can drive myself wherever i need to go. It's not worth much either. I'm downsizing as much as i can so shipping will cost as little as possible. Basically I have a bed, clothes, some books, a few vinyl records(maybe 15 total), and some sentimental items I'd really like to keep.

Also, any advice on that whole whole 'focus on you! figure out who you are!' thing would be nice. I've spent most of my adult life with this man, and I don't really know who I am without him. I love him so so much, and I guess I really fucked this shit up if I didn't notice that he wasn't happy. I just come home from work, usually sobbing in my car the entire way home. I don't sleep well; I wake up crying a lot, and honestly, I don't really know how I'm still moving through the motions of my life. I work full-time at a goddamn upscale lingerie shop during bridal season, and that already made me want to set myself on fire before, but now its like salt in that wound every time some excited, young bride-to-be comes through asking for advice on her wedding dress solutions, and 'which lingerie is sexiest?' 

Please be gentle, I'm still reeling from all of this. I have a psychiatrist, and I am in therapy, and it's keeping me on my feet, and helping me move through this as much as I can. I just really need help and don't know where else to turn.",20Mar2018,25

177,"Hi guys

First things first: I’m posting from a throwaway for obvious reasons. Also, I’m going to try and keep this as short as possible, but I’ll add a TLDR at the end.

I’m struggling with depression. One of my parents recently passed away, and obviously this is putting a lot of strain on my mental wellbeing and my life in general. I feel as if I have nothing to look forward to. Going to work and having a break over the weekend feels the same to me. I’ve always been an ambitious person, but I find myself doing the bare minimum at work, and I don’t have the drive to do much more. Despite this, I have been trying to stay healthy. I have been sticking to a regular exercise routine and eating healthy.

Also, I have to support my sibling, seeing as no one else really cares enough to help said sibling deal with the loss. This support includes emotional and financial support (the sibling is in college). This sibling doesn’t feel comfortable asking other family members for help, and, to be honest, it doesn’t look like they care much.

On top of all of that, my partner is constantly telling me that I need to talk to her about my feelings. When I do, she makes suggestions, and if I don’t agree with them she starts fighting with me. When I tell my partner I’m not coping with having to look after everyone, she gets upset and feels as if I’m attacking her personally. Also my partner gets jealous of the support I’m giving my sibling, saying that my sibling is taking advantage of me, and because of this I’m not supporting my partner enough, especially financially (she wants me to spoil her more).

I feel as if I can’t cope with everything. I can’t look after everyone and myself, but if I don’t, things will fall apart. Also, though I am depressed, I’m probably not a suicide risk, because my partner and family wouldn’t be able to deal with that.

I would appreciate any advice from anyone on how to deal with my situation. Thanks

179,"So to start this off, I should say I used to be really, really fat. I weighed around 28 stone this time last year and I've managed to reduce that down to 13.5 since then.

Honestly, I didn't do that very healthily, I was in a really awful place in my life due to losing my job and long term girlfriend (im over this phase of my life now) and I took drastic measures to improve myself. One of these included not eating very much at all. For a few months I would eat (at most) 600 calories a day, often, less. Now I'm at a more healthy weight Ive decided I want to stop losing weight so drastically and I'm trying to improve my eating habits, but the phone issue I'm having is that I feel genuinely really awful about myself when I eat.

Say for example, I was to eat a ham sandwich. Nothing massive at all. When I look in the mirror I feel waaaay fatter than I should after eating only a sandwich. I mean I think I can actually see the change In my body size, and I can feel it on my body too. 
on top of this I lose all self confidence, and feel really insecure. The only days I feel really confident and happy with my body are the days I don't eat. I've tried forcing myself to eat regularly every day, but I just don't have an appetite, and I feel much happier with myself if I just don't eat. How can I try and overcome this?

195,"This is gonna be pretty long, so be warned. Also sorry if there's weird grammar - not a native english speaker).

So there's this guy who went to my school last schoolyear. However, he was expelled at the end of the year because he didn't pass math. During the second half of said schoolyear, I realized I had a crush on him and I'm pretty sure he liked me back. We exchanged wholesome memes and he was being really sweet to me irl too, showing some signs that I interpret as him liking me. I didn't act on it though, because I had never really had a crush before and was overwhelmed by the sudden feelings. I just was (and still am) not ready for all the super couply lovey-dovey stuff I seem to think relationships are supposed to have. It terrifies me.

We talked quite a bit and sometimes exchanged sweet texts (which would get me really freaked out, but in a good way). For example, right before the summer break he asked me for some notes, so I sent pictures and he replied with a thank you and what would directly be translated to ""hugs-hugs"". During summer I found out from Instagram that he had a gf who he had been together with since a bit before the end of the schoolyear. 

So I spent the summer and up until last week getting/being over him, however I still had some feelings left. I just didn't think about him every day anymore, because he was in a relationship and I'm awkward and shy as hell anyways. Still talking to him wouldn't have helped with getting over the crush, so we didn't talk at all.

But low and behold, last week (at 0.45 on a schoolnight...) he sent me a funny video out of the blue. When I woke up I was shocked but also incredibly excited, got those butterflies I imagine everyone gets when they get their crush's attention. So I replied and also ended up asking how he had been (spoiler alert: bad, mental and physical health issues). We ended up talking for an hour or two about our lives+mental health and it was actually really nice and I felt calmed/peaceful (??). He also told me he was bullied at our school and I was one of the few who was nice to him ((which is sad but I felt like 😇))

And that was about it. We haven't talked since last week but I miss him a lot. About the girlfriend topic, I did a small Instagram stalk session and both of them have deleted a few pictures of them together. But the girl has one selfie remaining, so idk what to think really. 

And about the crush situation, I miss him and would love to talk to him more, but idk if I want a relationship. I probably shouldn't think ahead this much. After putting in this much work getting over him, I think I kinda am over, at least in the romantic sense. For now.

So now that you know all that, do you think I should text him? I'm reaaaally not keen on meeting up (just yet, bc I'm awkward and don't want to make it into a big deal) and I want to keep the texts real but not overly heavy, I guess just to know how he's doing and bc I find that he's a sweet person. Should I open with a meme/funny video? It seems to have been a working conversation starter and I'd love to cheer up his day, if nothing else. (Any meme recommendations? :D )

206,"So here's the bigger story. For more than 6 years now I've been working for the same company. I got hired fresh out of school to work in my field. Now in leading the department and working 4 days a week. I love what I do, the responsibility and my coworkers. Payment has always been troublesome as it was never on time. I don't mind it being late as long as I still get it once a month. Last year I had to stay home on 5 different occasions as I didn't get my money in time and couldn't buy gas to get to work. Which also means I couldn't buy groceries. 
In December I also had to cancel my vacation as I didn't have any room to save some money and we got an unexpected bill. In January I had to stay home again for lack of gas.
This Friday I will need to go for gas again and he still hasn't paid. 
I also still need to get two months worth from last summer. And haven't gotten any of this year's payments. 

Now normally it would be an easy enough decision to just quit and find something else. 
But here's the things that make it difficult. 
First of all, I make the most money as my husband is studying and doesn't have much time to work. 
Second, there aren't any similar jobs in my field of work in this country and I'll have to get a different and lower job in the area. (In live in Europe)
And third, if I quit, that almost certainly means the company will go bankrupt. It has excisted for over 20 years and my coworkers have invested a lot of money too. I'm not the only one who has money trouble. I'll be responsible for the downfall of the country. Two people will lose their company which is their whole life. And 7 co-workers will lose their job. 

My idea was to wait and see if I have to stay home again on Friday and if so have a serious conversation with my boss that it can't happen again. If it does happen again then I'll have no other option but to quit. A girl has got to eat right?

Does anyone have any better advice or things I could do or say to not have it end this bad for everyone? Anything is welcome.

Is rent to own a good option? How do I know the house is a good one?

212,"Like the title says, I was in a Lyft that struck and killed a bicyclist on St. Paddy's day. Well, it would be more accurate to say that the bicyclist hit the vehicle because he T-Boned the side of the vehicle when he shouldn't have been crossing the road. My guess is that he was drunk. 

A girl who was also in the Lyft happens to know the girlfriend of the guy who was killed and he died in the hospital this morning. His funeral arrangements are being prepared and I feel like I should go, even though his death is my fault in a very roundabout way (I called the Lyft but I don't have any guilt about it because there's no way anybody could have predicted this would happen and I was not driving the car).

213,"I ran away from home a few days ago. I don’t have a shitty life or shitty parents, my mom and I actually get along okay. But recently we’ve been arguing a lot (especially this past year) and I’m tired of it. Our living situation is quite... cramped. We live in a crappy little one bedroom apartment with my two little sisters. 

I have my own car so that’s where I’ve been sleeping, changing, and basically just living. I have money saved up enough to make it until I get a job. I basically have it all figured out in terms of how I’m going to live (I’m planning on moving to Chicago from California). 

I really just need advice on how to get over the guilt. I’ve changed my number, deleted all social media accounts and cut off all contact with my family members. I find it’s easier to move on this way. I do plan on coming back to California once I’m done with college and have my living situation really figured out, but until then I don’t plan on talking to anyone. I’ll maybe send anonymous post cards every once in a while so they’ll know I’m thinking of them. What hurts the most is my sisters. I practically raised them (mom was a single mom and always had to work), so I truly love them as if they were my own daughters. I don’t want them to forget about me. 

I don’t really know what I’m asking here, and I don’t need anyone preaching to me about how surviving is  going to be harder than I think it is, because I know that. I just need help with the emotional situation I’m in.

215,"Hello everyone as the title says i just spoke with a friend of mine yesterday and he has informed me that his job is hiring in a different state and i would be a perfect fit for the job(he messaged me today and said he already spoke with his boss about me) but the main thing is that he has already bought me a plane ticket and sent me all the information WHICH IS IN 4DAYS with 0 notice whatsoever.

A little bit of backstory
He was the person that just does whatever he feels was better for him at the time usually with no planning and it usually turned out great for him(im not sure how he does it) He is currently making $23hr at his current job , which is where he is trying to get me to go which is double what i make now.

The problem is that he is a giant opportunist , whatever is better he will immediately try to go for it (there is nothing wrong with that) but he doesn't care about anything else at that point. 

Ex 1: Whenever he wasn't doing as well with some problems he called me and asked if he could stay with, which we don't even live in the same state and get an apartment together, planning everything out , setting up the flights and no joke 2 days later he says he is moving to another state with his new GF

Ex 2: He was job searching in his new location and basically begged his new roommate for a job and whenever his roommate after a week nonstop got him a chance he didnt care anymore skipped the interview moved out because he found something better.

i just get very confused and question him but congratulate him on overcoming those problems as its nice to see friends succeed but the way he does it doesn't sound right to me and check in about once a week to see how he is doing.

The biggest problem im having is:

1. I will have to leave my family with no time to say anything

2. Things were finally going ok with my job(its not much but people love me there and I met wonderful people aswell and about to get a promotion which ive been working for but it still doesnt match the job offer at all

3. I just finished purchasing furniture/gaming desktop/personal internet( and was finally at the point where i could start saving/studying for my A+ cert (my goal ATM)

4. I would have to cancel everything that just started and basically start from scratch

5. How do i know he wont just leave this job/change his mind in about 1 month and say he found something better and just leave again.

6. I extremely dislike owing people debts and if anything ever did happen and he happens to ask me for money....well you know

Would really appreciate the advice or what would you do in this situation",20Mar2018,1
216,"So I have recently accepted the fact that I’m gay. I was in denial for a long time and nobody knows. Not my family, friends, nobody. 

I decided to experiment with an acquaintance that I had met at a bar a few months back. He had expressed interest in me at the tims but me being in denial about being gay, turned him down politely. 

Flash forward to last week, I decided to look him up on Facebook and asked him if he would be interested in getting drinks together as I’d recently come to a revelation about my sexuality. He was understanding about why I denied him initially so we ended up meeting at a local bar for some drinks. 

Long story short, we both ended up getting pretty tipsy and he invited me back to his place. I was nervous but also excited at this point to finally maybe get some experimenting and experience to see how I felt. 

So we get to his place and things start to get hot and heavy so to speak and at first I’m really enjoying it.  But I start to freak out and ask him if we could stop and if I could just crash on his couch for the night since I didn’t want to pay for a cab or walk home alone drunk. 

He stopped and I ended up passing out on his couch pretty fast. About two hours later from what I could tell, I woke up to this heavy presence on top of me and not to get too graphic, but he had my penis in his mouth and had his fingers near that place in my rear. 

I immediately freaked out and asked him what he was doing. He said he thought I would like it and he had been wanting to do it all night. I pushed him off of me and grabbed all my shit and walked home, I didn’t even care how late it was, I just wanted to go home. 

I don’t know what to do about this. He has been messaging me asking what he did wrong and if we wanna get back together again. I feel guilty and naive for asking to crash on a strangers couch and that maybe I asked for this by initiating intimacy in the first place. 

I can’t tell anybody about this because nobody knows I’m gay and I don’t know how to even process this or how to feel about what happened. I’m just feeling lost. I don’t think I could handle going to the police and explaining everything because of the fact it was a gay encounter. 

What should I do? I’m kind of scared and he keeps messaging me to meet up again and people have been concerned about me but I can’t tell them because I’m not out yet. 

Tl;dr: I had a confusing experimental gay encounter but I think I was taken advantage of but I can’t tell anyone because nobody knows I’m gay. ",20Mar2018,3
217,"I went the other day to ask how I see a Psychologist, I think I have a Personality Disorder and get depressed as a result of it. He gave me a leaflet for another service that deals with common mental health problems, outside of the NHS and said there's about an 8 week minimum waiting list for the their talking therapies.

Seriously? But I didn't say that, I smiled and took it and apologised because I'm a people pleaser and wanted to get out of his way. 

So I'm thinking, shit, if I call them, I've got 8 weeks or more of having no desire to do anything and to not give a shit if I live or die.

The only way these people take you seriously is if you're wanting to commit suicide. I don't even self harm, self harming is gross to me and I've never understood it (no offence to those who do it or have done it), the thought of cuts makes me feel ill, I'd never do it, I'm in enough mental pain without physical pain making it worse. I do however, fantasise about dying in an accident or illness so it's not my fault. That way, if it's my time, I can just let go without the guilt. Death has been interesting to me since I was young, I'm so curious to see what happens when we die (that's never going to change, even if I want to live). 

When I was in University and I got depressed, I rang up the student wellbeing service and got counselling the very next day, and used the service for 6 weeks! Why is it so hard to get that service outside of being a student? This is why people end up giving up.

So what do I do? I'm not going to lie about having suicide plans because that's the kind of shit that would get me sectioned and then I'd just be stuck there for life, because I'd find a way to be happy there and realise ""Hey, I don't have to have a job or do anything here, this is great!"" 

I just want a professional to talk to and tell me if I have PD or not, and help me believe life is worth living and that I should want to do things instead of sitting at home and doing fuck all, all day, then going to bed.

219,"So I’m already 33... I have a chance to retrain and follow a dream I’ve had. It will take 4 years to retrain... (basically I went to uni, got a job, worked, had a kid, got locked down to providing and now I’m unhappy in my career, it’s the pits). Since then I’ve found something I’m passionate about. 

It means a complete change of career from a science degree working a steady job with a good income to a forensic degree with way too many graduates and not enough jobs.

I’ve been working 10 years. My house isn’t worth what I paid. Which really really sucks. 10 years of income. Wasted. I tried switching workplaces and I still hate my career. After some mentoring from three people they all said follow your dream. Sell the house, simplify and do what you love, not what you’re good at....

Has anyone else chased a dream knowing they would have to give up almost everything to make it happen. It’s scary and I wish I had more support. My whole family passed away, my parents and siblings. It’s just me and my wife and our son.

I’m terrified if I do this that once I start that’s it... I’ll be 37 before I get an income again... we’ll be living in a cramped unit with two or three kids.

Has anyone retrained this late for a dream and did it work out? Did it not work out? Do you have parents who did this? How did hey turn out?

Can you build a career in a different field in the remaining 30 years?

What are all your thoughts,",20Mar2018,1
220,"I'm 22, female, and just utterly lost at the moment. About a year ago, I graduated from my undergraduate university and went through the tumultuous process of applying for grad schools. And lo and behold, I got in to my top choice! But because my interests are split between veterinary medicine and research and I wanted the time to actually get clinical experience to solidify my career goals/be able to potentially apply to vet school, I decided to take a gap year and decline the offer from the school.

This gap year has been the most challenging of my adult life. It took forever to get placement in a vet clinic, and I was dealing with the new pressures of adult life while simultaneously working in food service (ew) until I got in at the clinic. Now I love the clinic, it's the best job in the world and I finally know that I do want to be in vet med, but it was a long haul to get there.

On top of that, I miss undergrad with a passion I can't even describe. I knew it was coming even as I feared up for graduation last year, but it has been so terrible. That school was the first place/time I discovered self confidence, friendship, purpose, excitement, etc. in my entire life. I loved it with my whole heart. And I'm aware that college is not the real world - it's a suspended reality that everyone has to move on from. But most of my friends were younger and still attend the school - heck, even my boyfriend still goes there. I'm in the same city, so I'm constantly surrounded by reminders. 

Adult life is lonely - that has been the hardest part by far for me - and the pressures of bills and rent are much more terrifying than grades. I have no money, so I can't afford to do any fun ""finding yourself"" gap year activities. My car breaks down every other week but there's no way I can afford a new one. I can't get a dog - a dream for adult life that I've had forever - because realistically I can't afford it and I don't even know where I'll be in a year. I can't move forward at all, or use my adult freedoms to pursue anything I love. And I love the clinic, but I've gotten all the experience that I need for vet school and now I feel like I'm stagnating. I want to move on, to be challenged and learn and grow.

So I decided to apply for grad schools, round two. I wanted to get a masters to get the few remaining prerequisites for vet school and pursue my remaining research interests. I thought it would make me a stronger vet school applicant, fulfill me intellectually, and return me to my preferred home of academia.

But, surprise, I didn't get in anywhere. I applied to my top choice again, got to interview, loved every second of it - didn't get in. Didn't get in to my plan B's - programs easier to get into than my top choice, which I already know I was (at one point) strong enough to get in to. I truly don't think my rejection was because of my decision to wait a year, because the faculty seemed to all respect and admire my decision to wait and solidify my interests. It just seemed to be a more competitive pool of applicants this year. But my boyfriend, who applied to the same top choice school, did get in. 

Of course, I am beyond thrilled for him! It's incredible, and I am so proud of him. I honestly feel no negative feelings toward him. But the weight of seeing our dreams of studying together, moving in together, etc be crushed because of my own inability has been hard. It's not like I didn't know this could happen - it's a dangerous game to stake your future on something like that, after all, and I knew it. But I am so very sad. And as he goes through the process of getting ready to go and eventually moving away, I can't imagine that I'll feel great watching it. On top of that, I am nervous about being a long distance couple for the first time.

So now here I am, feeling crushed by all of these rejections. My whole life I've been academically successful, and much of my self confidence has been built upon this platform. But now, with all of this, I'm losing grip on that. As I look back on life I am beginning to recognize more places where I have been academically unsuccessful that I just wrote off on bad luck, but now I'm wondering if this is actually a trend. Maybe I'm not good enough to go for the sorts of things I want. Maybe I'm not as smart or as qualified as I thought. 

I'm grieving my past life, the future I had planned, my self confidence, and my relationship with my boyfriend as I've known it. As I look forward, I'm trying to plan instead of mope, but that's hard too. The next step may be just to apply to vet schools - I need 1-3 more classes as prerequisites depending on the program, so I'm considering trying to take those and work full time in the upcoming semester. I've considered applying to schools in my home country, which offers MUCH cheaper tuition and fewer prerequisites and has a semester that starts next February and next fall, but I'm terrified of leaving everything I know to move back across the globe. I don't know how to balance work and taking classes (much less how to pay for them). And now I just feel so defeated, like I'd never make it into vet school anyway. And the grad school process was so stressful that I just don't have the heart/energy to throw myself into something that won't even free me from my current, stagnant predicament for a year or more. And the idea of not being able to make long term plans until I know for sure about vet school makes me want to just give up and cry.

During this time I've tried so much to stay happy - I work out, I go hiking, I read interesting pop science books in fields other than my own to continue learning, and I try to get as much sunshine as possible. I've tried very hard to maintain regular contact with the (few) friends from college that still want to hang out with an old timer like me. I feel like I'm doing everything you're supposed to do. Normally I'm very easy to please, and simple things like that make me very happy. But it's not working anymore. I'm tired, the thought of my own worthlessness is omnipresent, and I don't find joy in much. And I can't even come close to afford therapy (which I enjoyed very much when I was in college and could get it for free). I applied to foster kittens from the local humane society (since I can't have my own dog...) and even that application was ignored. :( I'm so sad all of the time, and I just don't know how to get out of it. Looking forward, the future seems long, and exhausting, and unfulfilling. 

Out of the blue, a different faculty member from a different school reached out to me, wanting to know if I was interested I joining his lab - apparently the PI from the lab at my top choice passed my info along to him. But that university is in a weird area I have no desire to live in, and the program isn't a good one, so even that doesn't feel like a good opportunity. Because of that, it hasn't lifted my spirits at all.

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Is it normal to be this depressed after graduating? (Or after being rejected from grad school?) Any advice or even just commiseration would be so welcome. Thanks in advance!

TLDR: I didn't get into grad school, and the weight of adult life is crushing. Help?",20Mar2018,1

I know he has good dental hygiene and he is very handsome but to be honest, it does kind of bother me.

222,"What I wanted to say in the beginning of my story is, that I know how horrible I behaved, and what I'm going to tell you is by no means justifiable by anyone or anything. 

To clarify, my parents divorced when I was six, and for four years or so my mom got a new boyfriend. 

My mom has always been a bit weird in a fashion, which means that she always trusts her feelings when something is about people, if she sees something a special way, it has to be that way and she won't believe anyone telling her otherwise (Although she is right most of the time). I am the complete opposite of that, I am really insecure about my feelings and don't trust my judgement about people. I have also speculated a lot wether I am on the spectrum and am still not a hundred percent sure that I am not. 

When she was with her boyfriend for about half a year, when I was 13, she accused me of flirting with her boyfriend. I didn't feel anything at that time, but I know my actions could have been interpreted in that way, as my body often does these emotional and gestural equivalents of brain farts. As she asked me about it I of course denied everything, as I wanted to stick to my version of everything, but as a lot of fights aroused from it and she didn't even look me in the eyes anymore I admitted to having at least felt something and after that everything cleared up relatively quickly. 

An additional important thing is that I was never really nice to my mom, I always put her below me in front of others and dealing with her felt like a necessity I needed to do to stay alive. I felt like I was younger, smarter and more beautiful than her, also due to the aforementioned incident, but I now know that I never was and never will. I don't even know whether I'm capable of loving anymore. 

Now for a few months or so my moms boyfriend started something that I think you can compare to flirting, mainly intimate looks when he was over. And I, as an angsty teenager who can barely keep friends, let alone get a boyfriend, was so thrilled and incredibly stupid that I jumped in head first. Which means: I reacted to it.
Her boyfriend and I never made out or anything, we didn't meet alone, we didn't even text, the only romantic contact we had were small gestures here and there and little inexplicit but flirty talks when my mom was away smoking. 

A week and a half ago they split up over something else and my mom got sick over it. The day before yesterday she brought the topic up again and since then everything has gone deeper downhill than I ever imagined it could. In short I confessed her everything and understandably wants me out of the house now. That is fine, as I can live with my dad, although I don't really have contact with him anymore.

She recently was on spring break (we are both undergraduate students) and she basically we went on a 4 day bender. I did not really have any problem with it (it was a little annoying to try and communicate with her but I was fine with her enjoying herself, she does well in school and deserved to have a good time). I am not really a jealous type, I was just more worried about her safety more than anything. The last day of this ""spree"" she sent our group of friends a snapchat video of her snorting coke. I asked her directly if she snorted coke, to which she responded that she did and she did not seem to have any remorse.

230,"**TL:DR** version first: 


Been part of an incubator, running business and working for the company. Another ""incubee"" feels that I am of no worth only due to not having optics on me (They are an accountant). Communication is not very good and tasks aren't always communicated. New hires have been offloading my tasks (Admin, Evaluations, General Coordination of events) and my workload has become less and less. The new hires have been ""tainted"" by the accountant and my own feeling of job security and satisfaction has become a hostile and tense environment. How do I handle this where I can move forward and reclaim my stable and trusted position as well as run my own business?

**Not TL:DR:**



January 2015 I was offered a failing business. I also just happened to become involved with some folks that were starting a small business incubator. It seemed like one of those ""providence"" situations and I lept in feet first.

Over the course of the next year my business was further and further into the red and I had to eventually become a one person operation. With that I had several challenges and obstacles getting help from the incubator that I was paying rent and mentoring fees for. Long story short, I became an employee of the incubator and my business was purchased by the owner of the incubator as an attempt to offset my cost and keep a salary.

During the tenure I delivered on many tasks, coordinated many functions and events, ran projects, took on research and, helped the owner all while running my own business. Sometimes things were good and productive and sometimes things weren't. All in all my performance and tasks remained in a positive light with the owner and so has my personal relationship as well.

I had come to find out that over time, from the outside looking in, the accountant had been offering negative council regarding my actions and worth from within the incubator. The sourness of this person is primarily self created. The owner understands this and fills me in regularly. This has been the case for 18 months.

As of November there has been 2 new hires that this accountant runs personally. The demeanor of these individuals is clearly tense towards me even though I have had outgoing and fun conversations with them. One main thing I see on a regular basis is if I do some task or handle some inventory or set up an event or area, they go behind me and ""redo it"" or completely change all of it, even while I'm in the process of doing it. Communication of new events or ongoings at the incubator is now on the other side of a metaphorical brick wall. I have attempted to take some things over and delivered on those events with way above average results. The owner knows this, and is in my corner still, but will not have confrontational discussions with the accountant nor the new hires in an attempt to remove toxicity.

Now as of today, my admin account for the company email has been ""asked for"" and to ""talk to the accountant"" which as you all will surely see is a negative. It has also been told by the owner to me that the accountant is no longer in any operational role or capacity regarding the incubator and is now on their own. The new hires are absorbing the workload of the accountant going forward

I want to stop the toxic nature of events, I want to feel good about what I do, and I need to feel like I'm able to work with the new hires and have success going forward. I know it can be done.

P.S. My father also was an associate in a huge Software company in the 90s, and he left it so that we could live near the beach, It all failed and he has been kinda miserable ever since.",20Mar2018,0

242,"So i'll try and keep this short, but I have a problem with porn.  Ever since I was 13 i've been watching porn, pretty much daily. Recently my porn consumption has skyrocketed and I find myself watching it for most of the day and masturbating at least 2-3 times a day.  I don't even enjoy it anymore and find myself dissapointed and sad whenever I watch or give in to temptation. 

I've tried several times to quit.  I've deleted my porn collection only to just use streaming sites and such.  I Put parental blocks on my computer, only to spend a few hours disabling it to watch porn.  Talked to counselors about the issue only for them to tell me its not a problem. Joined the Nofap subreddit, but they were waaaayyyy too religious and weird about the whole subject for my taste.  Tried to bury myself in hobbies and studies, but always seem to find the time to watch porn late into the night.

I'm not sure what all I can do now.  I'm staying positive about the whole thing, but I dont know how it'll last.  My triggers seem to be boredom, loneliness, and rejection.  The triumvirate of negative feelings lol. 

Just wondering if anyone has any nuggets of advice for me. I'd appreciate any kind words of wisdom right about now. Anything to keep me going and kick this habit I've created   ",20Mar2018,11
243,"I am incredibly confused about my sexuality and gender identity after many years and I am seeking to reddit to say if anyone can provide some useful insight.

I am AFAB (assigned female at birth), and on the outside look like a pretty, curvy / muscly cis-women. I have always known I wasn't straight, as have always been sort of fascinated by women and also dated them. But that is not where the confusion lies. 

My first encounter with self questioning occured when I watched 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower', and found that I absolutely connected to the gay relaitonship on there in a way where I was so intrigued, so personally touched, and so fascinated as to how this gay couple related to eachother. Other massive doses of confusion have come form Call me By Your Name, The Way he Looks, Moonlight, and many other gay films. I lust for and crave for the connection that two men have between each other, not necessarily because I think it's a connection exclusive of two men, nor because I think there is necessarily anything fundamentally different between the way these categories of 'men' and 'women' relate to each other. Simply, when I see heterosexual love portrayed in any movie, or even out in the streets, in families I encounter etc - the way these people relate, the way they love, and just the connections I see between are man and a women are not what I see myself in at all. Not because I want to avoid the patriarchy or something. I just feel like I love men, and want to be loved like men, just like two men love each other. WHATEVER the fuck that is. 

I adore transgender women, gay men, men who break the binary or just wear make up for the hell of it - anyone who is comfortable, brave, and interested enough in not caring about the gender they were socialised into. I find that incredibly sexy. 

But I have so much inner conflict, because I want more than anything to be a little boy who is loved by another boy, but then comes the trans issues - can gay men love a trans man, sexually? I feel like the body and the penis are massive draw cards, and maybe having a vagina is too much of a push back. Maybe bi sexual guys, is there anyone out there who would even be interested enough? What does transitioning to T entail? 

Such a personal spillage and overload, of which I would love personal messages, advice and experience + stories and any recommended reading or youtube channels, twitter channels, or anything of the sort. I hope to hear from you, RedditItes. ",20Mar2018,0

They asked about job history, and I only told them about my last job. When pressing for further information, I told them that was the only job I had worked at. The interviewer said they felt my past experience qualified me for this position, and The interview offered me a job so long as I passed a drug test and a background check.

I am 18 years old, I still live with my parents and as a result, I am still on their health insurance. I’d like to get on birth control, but the conversation I had with my parents didn’t go over too well.

Regardless, I’d still like to see my doctor as I’ve been prescribed birth control before already (the pill) but want to switch to an IUD as it’s safer and more effective. The only thing I’m concerned about is what information I need from my parents to make the appointment without asking them. But I don’t see a regular doctor, my family is military so I go on base to receive my healthcare. 

Is it anything special? I know that the insurance is Tricare and I’ve been there before so would I have to fill out any new forms? What about policy numbers and social security numbers? I know mine, but my father is the one in the military, not me. So does that have any bearing?

I know I can go to planned parenthood, but if I went there, I’d be going under the guise that I don’t have health insurance and the appointment/service could cost me $500-800 rather than $150-250.

254,"My SIL texted me starting with ""hypothetically"" and then asked if she and my brother got a dog, would I be interested in watching it when they go out of town.

I want to just say no. But I feel like I'm being selfish/hasty. I used to watch their children on a regular basis, and stopped mostly because I felt like they didn't respect me and my boundaries. (The adults, not the kids. The kids were great.) They were often asking me to do things I had told them I'm not comfortable with, like watching their kids' friends who came over, or taking the kids places. (I practically have agoraphobia. I was only comfortable with being home with their kids. No other kids, no outings, etc. They knew this. I was very clear about it.) 

But I did a lot of things I didn't want to do because I suck at saying no. It was a very stressful experience and I feel like I went *way* out of my comfort zone to be their nanny, but that boundaries were constantly pushed, and that they generally had a sense of entitlement about the whole thing.

So now, a dog? They travel a lot. They only have their kids half the time. The dog they would have all the time, so that's a lot of petsitting. I just see it being very stressful for me. 

But I know she's not asking if I'll watch the dog ""every time forever"". Or for any kind of commitment. I feel like I'm over thinking and already assuming that they're going to be asking for too much. I feel really selfish thinking of it this way. Plus, I love dogs! I work with them. I bet I'd love their dog. But not having a ""service providing"" relationship with my brother and SIL again. 

I don't know how to reply to this text without sounding rude. Even just saying ""No, I don't think I can."" seems like it would offend them. Like they'd be thinking ""Wth? Why wouldn't she watch our dog? Just hypothetically? Like not even once? She's so selfish.""

I tried to write out a few different replies, but couldn't decide on anything and kept just leaving it unsent. She texted me on Sunday, and then this morning (Tuesday) she texted ""So I guess that's a no. Lol"" because I haven't even replied yet. I feel really bad about that and need to figure out some way to respond.

I'm just so stressed! I feel like I should just say ""Hypothetically yes"" and then I can still say no whenever I want or if the dog is too much of a handful or has behavior issues or whatever. But I also feel like I'll end up going along with a lot of things because I suck at reinforcing boundaries, so I'll just be stressed out taking care of their dog all the time. And then it feels like that's *my* problem and not theirs. I should learn to say no selectively and not just need to say it across the board. 

I'm probably reading way too much into this one hypothetical question, but I just cannot find the words right now. I don't know what to say to her. Please advise! 

(Sorry for being so rambly and frantic, I'm so anxious right now.)

**Tl;dr:** I think I want to decline someone a favor but I feel selfish and like I'm way over thinking it.

**Update**  
Thinking of sending this. Is it just stupidly vague? ""I'm sorry, I can't commit to anything. But it's probably a no because my life is pretty dog-heavy already!"" 

I feel like a hard no would just have them be like ""What? Why?"" And when I was their nanny we talked many times about my boundaries and it was always in one ear and out the other, with them just asking me anyway to do the same things I expressly told them to stop asking. And them seeming to have the impression (well, actually outright saying at times) that it was good for me to be pushed to get over my anxiety. I feel like rehashing it will just frustrate them or make them feel like I'm being a baby or trying to guilt them by bringing up things that they said/did that upset me in the past.

**Update 2**   
I just sent this: ""Lol, sorry! I kept putting off the reply because I was stressing about letting you down. My bad!""

So I now realize that I didn't actually say no. But she said it was a no and then I replied with that. I just feel so poopy and wish she didn't ask me. Or that asking me wasn't weird because if another person did I'd probably be like ""Sure! What kind of puppy?! When are you getting her? What names do you have in mind??"" I feel like I'm being all cold and selfish and I don't want to be like this.

255,"I'd first like to admit that I probably have less perspective on the world than most. I am a 19 yo college kid with VERY little fast food job experience. I'm sure this question has been asked tons of times.

I'm currently in the middle of my 2nd semester of freshman year of college. I'm taking my prerequisites right now. However, every day I come home from school feeling like I could have put the time I spent in class towards something else. I feel like I am wasting my time even though this is supposed to be the path to success, as I am told by my family and peers for the entirety of my life.

 I'm really interested in fitness and nutrition. I think that it's really important to take care of ourselves so that we can be physically and mentally healthy in the marathon of life. Too many people suffer from diseases that are caused by bad eating habits and lack of physical activity, some of which are in my family. I don't want to see more of my people, my family and fellow Americans like that.

 I'm not sure how I can turn that interest into a career, but I feel like I should be focusing solely on my dream. I want to believe that if I do things that only relate to what I ultimately want, it would lead to something better, better than going to school just for some degree.

Is this reasonable?

257,"This is so pathetic but its been bothering me for like a year at least. When I was a senior in high school a girl asked me out. Before that I was this incel floater who didnt have a huge amount of friends and had obviously never had a girlfriend. I didn't really see the pros of it, or what the point was. Every one of my friends whos had one seems to have constant problems. She asked me out, we kissed, she was amazing, we dated for like two weeks, but I broke up with her because for whatever reason I assumed that she is preventing me from self improving. The biggest draw back was that I found out I slept better with her than I did by myself. I've had really bad depression for most of my life and the inner hate monologue I have going on in my head shuts off when I was with her and I can actually sleep. I also have a porn addiction, which is completely from trying to cope the feelings an actual women would bring me, or at least come close. 

I've tried to be more social, I've tried to get with a few girls. I forgot I look like an incel and have shit social skills so that doesn't work. I live a life of self hate and loneliness. I tried to message her a few times in the last six months but she doesn't check her messages very often so I've only got one response which was actually pretty positive but a friend talked me out of going there on the grounds that, ""I could get soo much better, move on"". I still feel like its over, I should be getting over her, but for some reason I can't.

She started sc me again about a month back, and things seemed to return to “normal”. One day at work she noticed I was off and asked me about it, and I told her how I felt and how I wanted to give it another shot. She told me she really needed to think about it and I said sure take your time. It hasn’t been weird and she actually seems somewhat more engaged when we talk since then. She went through some more stuff about her ex shortly after and I was there for her. It’s been like three weeks since I told her how i felt and I don’t know what to do.

259,"My girlfriend regularly suffers from short periods of depression and anxiety but recently (with university finals looming) things have been getting worse. I feel like this is partially my fault too; last week she had a bad day and I tried to help her through it. When she’s sad she can often be confrontational without meaning to be. This comes in two forms: 1) The suggestions I give to help are labelled as being stupid 2) Any indication of lack of talking/support/engagement with her problems is taken as being a sign of me ‘not caring’. So I found myself caught in-between a rock and a hard place, scared to say anything and scared to say nothing. At the end of the day, after her mood had picked up, she asked why I was so tired and I told her the truth about how I found it difficult to help her when she’s in a bad place. I think this came off as me painting myself as the victim, which clearly isn’t true considering what she’s going through. We had an argument and she said from now on she’d keep her mental health to herself. 

She had a similar episode today and she didn’t want my help, just to be alone. 

I’m worried that I’ve caused some permanent damage and I don’t know what to do to fix it. I genuinely love her and want to help her but I don’t know how.

For the past say, 4 months, I can't stop thinking about death and it's getting worse everyday, to the point where last night I had my first real panic attack. For some background on myself, I've experienced depression and anxiety quite severly in the past, but the past 3 years have been the happiest of my life, I can barely imagine ever feeling that crippling depression again, I've never been so socially and self-confident before and I'm proud of myself. So there's no reason to be thinking like this. This is what it's like - It started just any night I couldn't sleep - I would get to thinking about dying and the absoluteness of it would just become incredibly lucid to me. I WILL DIE. Only sure thing in the world. And experiencing this thought didn't so much as make me feel scared, but I would feel this mad undescribable panic as thought I was dying in that moment. I'd go dizzy and gasp and involuntarily jerk up as though drowning. Fast forward to now and I'm having that reaction every night and now in the day. If I read the world 'death' or 'so-and-so died today' I get the dizzy panic 'shit, I'm dying right this second' jerk. And for some reason if I think about the fact that we're on a planet in space I get the same veritgo/drowning feeling. Then I started to become overly aware of strange things like my tongue in my mouth and thinking of phrases like 'he swallowed his tonuge'. Last night (and right now, which is why I came here) I felt as though I kept forgetting how to breathe, like I couldn't feel my heart beat so it must have stopped, tight chest, thinking 'I'm going to die any second'. Panic. That's the thing, it's not so much fear (until now with this heart beat thing), but just strange obsessing and that dizzy gasping jerk I do. 
I've tried to figure out what could have caused this. The only possible explanation is that my SO is a lot older than me, so perhaps his age is reminding me of mortality.

One time she brought her computer to do digital art and sat there for - I swear to god - half an hour with the art program open and stared at the screen doing nothing, probably because I was sitting there watching her. I've never seen her start an image, she's never shown me her process, and i'm starting to get real tired of her shit.

264,"This is my first time creating a post on Reddit...I'm seeking any advice or help anyone can give me on this situation, and seeing if this has happened to anyone else before??

2 weeks ago I was making dinner for my husband and I. I had a tray of cauliflower baking in the oven, and was going to boil some water to make pasta. I turned on the front right burner to medium heat and as I turned towards my sink to fill up the pot of water the burner exploded. The sound was like someone had shot a gun off in our condo. A metal piece from underneath the ceramic stop top bursted out with so much pressure that it pierced a hole in our ceiling bulkhead above (about 5 ft) and came back down on the stove. I felt an intense heat but didn't see the flame as my back was turned to the stove, but my husband said it reached the ceiling and was about 2 ft wide. Our smoke alarms went off immediately. My hair was pulled back in a low ponytail and the bottom 6 inches were singed off along with the shirt I was wearing. Our condo manager and security came up moments after this happened and took a report. They said they had never heard or seen anything like this. There was grease and shards of glass EVERYWHERE in our condo - on our ceiling, all of our walls in the kitchen, our appliances - everything was covered in it. The force was big enough to knock the pictures off our wall on the other side of the dining area. I feel incredibly lucky that my face wasn't over the stove top.

Has anything like this happened to anyone?

2 repairmen hired by Whirlpool came in to assess the damage - both of them had no idea as to how or why this could have happened.

The oven was bought and installed by the condo developers when the building was built in February 2014, so the oven is only 4 years old.

Whirlpool has been less than pleasant in this whole situation. It's been almost two weeks now without having been able to cook any food or hearing what they're going to do about all of this. 

We contacted the CSA (Canadian Safety Association) to report this - because above all else, if Whirlpool is selling faulty exploding stoves, we want people to know for their own safety. What if there was a child in the kitchen at the time? If my face was overtop of the stove who knows what could have happened...my eyesight could have been impaired.

Should we lawyer up? Again if anyone has been in a similar situation please share your experience! Thank you in advance!

So I thought I'd try a different approach and go with an apprenticeship, trouble is I started searching fairly late and the one I wanted the most (IT Technician apprenticeship) was out of my reach since I hadn't worked in a computer shop before. I ended up applying for anywhere in my area and I got a response from Audi (not for the technician course that I had applied for) I got offered to do a parts advisor apprenticeship, with little other options and getting sick of being at home all the time I decided to go with it; trouble is that I have zero knowledge/interest in cars (I don't even have a drivers license). When I started it was okay my colleagues there are great with the exception of my manager who can be empathetic at times but at others he drives me insane. Then, after a  few months and as time went on I noticed that maybe I had made the wrong choice again, people were quitting around me and budget cuts had been circling around, even my mentor who I get on the most with doesn't want to work there. I've now go to my first training course for my job role and I feel like this has just strengthened my feelings and I now feel like I want to be somewhere else. I've heard from other apprentices from different brands that they have better wages and work less time despite being in the same position but you can also tell that they're more passionate towards cars in general.

Right now, I've been stuck debating in my mind what to do. Im worried that if I did try and quit that I would have to pay for all the training fees and that's something I'm not in a position to do. I really don't want to spend another 2 years doing this. Even if I did quit I really don't know what to do next, like what would be my best option? Would it be to go university, get another apprenticeship or becoming a trainee of some sort. Another struggle I have is trying to figure out my future the whole ""What do you wanna do in 5 years?"" question still is a struggle for me to answer as I would love to do nothing more than travel but that's just not realistic. I mean what would be a high paying job path?

274,"So for the past 5 months all I've been wanting to do is play video games every night or whenever I don't have exams coming up. I haven't felt motivated enough to do more than what's necessary when it comes to schoolwork. I want to change this.

I start making check lists of what I should do the next day. Okay, we're going to study a couple sections from the textbook tomorrow. We're going to thoroughly finish the math homework, as I tell myself. We're going to watch a YouTube video about this topic I truly don't understand when we get home. Then when the next day comes, I just feel so uninspired. My desire to be an A student just vanishes somehow, and all I want is to waste my time playing either Dota 2 or Overwatch. I'd hate myself at night and regret why I haven't started my check list for that day. The cycle repeats...

I just feel that I need something that's inspiring that will stick for a while, not just randomly for a short amount of time.",20Mar2018,1

276,"I heard the curve helps you a lot, and from what i understood from the syllabus, 70% of the class gets a C+ or above and a C is a ""basic understanding"" of the class.

I got a 50% on the final, 25/50, the average was a 58%. We also had a take home midterm worth 50% of the class, i got 33/50, in total i got a 58/100. I've honestly never disappointed myself like this, lowest test grade i've ever gotten was a C, but in the end i usually ended up with a better grade. Even after i failed a midterm last semester, i turned it around for the final and got a C+, but not this time. It sucks because i busted my ass off studying, did a lot of practice problems that were mostly numerical, but the final had few numerical problems, and more hypotheticals and most problems that i practiced solving had coefficients instead of numbers.

I really hoped i could get at least a B- in the class after the curve, but now i'm hoping for a C+ if anything, i really hoped i could raise my GPA. I know uni is supposed to be hard, i expected it, after a semester i knew it, but i feel like it's more the entire class gets f'ed over not just me in particular. I felt good going into the final.

TL;DR: technically failed a class and final, but might end up with a C because most of the class did poorly, it doesn't sit well with me

278,"So here’s my story, I had played baseball for about 9 years consistently since I was roughly 5. I actually was pretty good and far above average. I hit over .500 in my 13u season of travel baseball. The following year I decided to play for an elite team. I tried out for said elite team and made that team. I went to a couple of practices and pussied out. My family then moved away to a different state. I took a year off from baseball and played 16u travel baseball. I didn’t play high school. I then played 17u travel baseball the following season, last summer. Didn’t play high school. It is now junior year and I just got a job at a local place. Theoretically I could still play this year if I quit said job or told my manager I’d have to work around baseball. I really miss baseball and my heart lies with it but I love having my own money to spend. What do i do? Do I just give it up this year and try next year?

 Anyway, today I rang back again &amp; got through to them. They were a 'Letting' company in London &amp; the lady on the other end of the line stated she hadn't rang me at all and that she works for a guy (Maybe she was secretary) and she couldn't see any reason as to why her boss would be ringing Ireland at all.

285,"Regardless of how you feel about him, Steven Crowder has taken inspiration from a subreddit and turned it into a real-life situation with his ""Change My Mind"" series.

With the release of the trailer for the Fred Rogers film, I'm inspired to make a real-life ""Off My Chest"" table. I want to invite people to sit down and speak to me privately, like a confession booth. I would just sit in silence, listening, or speaking back to them if they want me to.

I really want to make Fred Rogers proud by being a good neighbor to college students who might need it, who might be walking around holding pain inside of them.

Of course I realize this might have problems. I don't know exactly how I should go about this. Some questions I'm already thinking about:

1) Would the college even allow this in the first place? I'm inviting people to talk to me, so I don't see how there are any consent laws to consider. Would I need to keep my identity revealed? I kind of wanted to remain hidden behind a barrier so the people sharing themselves wouldn't have to see the person they're talking to. Same as a confession booth.

2) What would the method of communication be? I was thinking a card table with a barrier between us, with maybe a tin can telephone type thing, so they can hold the can directly over their mouth, preventing anyone around them from listening. It would also be kind of a reference to the purity of childhood. Maybe that's good, I dunno. Is there even any other way I could do this? Walkie-talkies would be omnidirectional. I'm looking for a method of communication that would prevent people around us from hearing, but I would hear just fine.

3) What would the sign say? I'm thinking something like ""Need to say something? Get it off your chest. I will not judge you.""

Is there anything else you can think of that I should consider, or any problems you foresee? As far as whether people actually participate or not, I don't care about that. If nobody does, message received, and I won't do it again.",20Mar2018,20

I need advice on how to tell someone to leave me alone. I started a casual relationship with my now ex after a chance meeting. They seemed kind at first, but that is about it &amp; not enough reason for me to stay with someone.  We never intended on getting serious for an array of reasons. We had some good times, but ultimately that is all it was since we do not have much in common. There are more things separating us than uniting us. We both had concerns about the relationship so we talked it out, decided there was no reason to keep it going, &amp; they seemed to understand. I have bipolar II, and am emotionally unavailable at the current moment. I have not expressed to this person that I am bipolar because I do not feel comfortable enough with them to share my true self, however they know I am going through a rough patch. My problem now is that I do not think they handle rejection well. They really want to stay friends, however I do not wish to keep in contact. I do not know how to tell them that for fear of setting them off. (For the record I have not experienced violence from them but I get a very uneasy feeling about them.)

After a month or so, I ended up meeting this girl on tinder. I really wasn't looking for anything crazy, but someone new to talk to. To get back out there in the dating game. Well after weeks of talking via text, phone, and facetime, we decided to meet. It was great and we've had some really good times hanging out. 

Fast forward to last week and we were hanging out for my birthday and she brought up wanting to have sex after being worked up from making out and what not. For me I wanted to wait because I have some strong feelings for her and didn't want to complicate things just yet. She seemed to be surprised, said it was fine and we both fell asleep. The past few days, talking with her seemed a bit off. There was something wrong and I felt like I possibly made things weird between us. So I brought it up to her and she said it was disappointing because she's very sexually adventurous. She is also trying to get used to these emotional feelings and wants to slow down the emotional stuff.

I'm trying to wrap my head around all of this because well I really like her and don't want to give up, but I feel like I maybe setting myself up for heartbreak.

however, he is also known for having a very large ego. he is very good at making others feel worthless, and uses his intelligence to do so. for example, he could say something like “wow, did you seriously not know about ____ and ______?”, or “did *you* get in the state finals ben?” (he did). usually when other students make minuscule mistakes such as misplacing an object or incorrectly solving a problem he ridicules them, calling them “fucking idiots”. i remember a specific incident when he told me friend that he will never get a girlfriend because he’s “ugly”. he says all of this in a sarcastic manner, but that doesn’t make it okay. he is in no way humble about his achievements and believes it is good to indirectly show them off (like posting pictures of trophies on snapchat, or looking my way when he does something correct, as if he wants validation.)

it is important to note that he has a history of depression and self doubt. i have no idea if this means that his behavior is okay (i am suicidal and i never seem to brag). we have been together for about three months. in private he is the sweetest thing, complimenting me and such. but in public he is unable to control himself. i love him so much, but this stuff he does is definitely a turn off in this relationship.

i am not sure if my opinion on his behavior is biased or not, since i have extremely low self esteem and his words usually hurt me. i feel extremely worthless after seeing him in school when he acts this way. i am somehow unable to cope with the fact that he allows himself to be so visually narcissistic. i am equipped with the knowledge that he could just as well be saying these things to me, but he treats me differently because i am his partner. 

i don’t know what to do about this. maybe i am just overreacting because of my crippling self worth. but many people have called him rude as well, so i do not believe that is the case. i don’t know if i should talk to him about this, because when he brought it up during one of his depressive episodes (he called himself a mean and cruel person) he did not seem to take it well and did not take action upon his behavior.

I have a bit of a problem and I hope you guys can help me out. I started studying computer science in Europe in 2016 at a university which is known to have a very hard computer science course. I came from a completely different field of work/studies. I completed a 3 year apprenticeship in an economic job but after working for a very short time in that field, I decided that I want to do something that really interests me. I then decided to start studying computer science at a university. And I have to admit that it's a lot of work but I'm doing relatively good, I'm definitely above average but I also think I'm studying way more than the others. 

I'm have a clique in university that I'm always hanging out with. They're all very smart, most of the times getting better grades than I am. Except for one guy, who has like 100% the same background as I have. Same apprenticeship, same age, same school career. We're pretty much on the same level knowledge-wise, we're getting the same grades almost every time, except he's a bit better than me. And I don't know why, especially because he's a fine dude, but I can't stand it to get a worse grade than him. I really don't know why, I just can't stand it. When we had an exam that went really bad, and he also tells me afterwards that it went bad for him, I feel SO much better about my own performance, I'd even accept it relatively easy if him and I both failing at an exam. 

I feel kinda bad for this. I'm not the envious guy usually, but I somehow am so much when it comes to him. It's sad because we spent some fun time the past two years. I don't know why I feel this way and I just want to stop measuring my own performance so much with those of the others. It even goes so far that I don't want to help him anymore in some situations, because I don't want him to be better than me, and I'm such an asshole for actually doing this.

Let's call him Friend A. I've talked to him (Friend A) about a lot of personal problems and he's been there for me. One of the things I talk to him (Friend A) frequently about is my difficulty in finding a senior prom (high school) date and in talking to women in general. He (Friend A) knows that I struggle with this, and that I like a girl (a junior in high school) in one of my classes. In this class, I have to do a lot of work with this girl as my lab partner, so I've gotten to know her personality. I also thought that she liked me to some extent because we had similar TV show interests and she smiles at me in the hallways. Recently, this girl texted me asking me if I had a different friend's number (lets call him Friend B) because she needed to talk to him (Friend B). I didn't have his (Friend B) number, but I gave her his (Friend B) Facebook contact information. The next day, I found out from Friend A why she needed to talk to Friend B. She asked Friend B to ask if Friend A would be her junior prom date. Friend A said yes. Initially, I didn't really know how I felt about this, but I think I'm feeling jealousy, heart broken, and backstabbed (from Friend A more so than the girl I think). I think I feel this way partly because Friend A is much more popular than I am, Friend A always gets asked out and I have never gotten asked out. But, I think the main reason I feel this way is because Friend A knows that I like this girl and was planning to ask her out to senior prom, and yet at the same time said yes to going with her to junior prom which meant that I couldn't ask her out to senior prom. I also think I feel this way because whenever I knew that Friend A and I both liked the same girl, I would always talk to Friend A a lot about it to see Friend A's reaction and if Friend A would be okay with it. Even though I got the idea that Friend A would be okay with it, I never acted on it. But, when Friend A was asked by this girl to junior prom Friend A immediately took the offer without even talking to me. To be honest, I feel a lot of guilt for even having these emotions since I know that she asked Friend A and not me, but I don't know how to process all of this or what to do with it, so I'm asking for help from the internet.

I do have quite an issue with anxiety, though it doesn't affect me talking with people very much. I am social, but just not effectively social if that makes sense.

How do I learn how to make people feel comfortable and how to understand how to empathize more effectively? Are there any books about this that don't focus on like ""leadership"" or team building?",20Mar2018,34
326,"So to start off i am not very good at keeping or making friends. Sometimes ill admit its my fault but sometimes i feel its the other persons fault. So i am really trying to make friends in my classes (i am in college). I have this video editing class and i do not talk to anyone in that class. I have had the small talks with people a couple times but those did not amount to anything. Until last Thursday, we had an assignment where we had to group up with someone to do some voice over thing, so believe me when i heard group up i felt so anxious. I knew i had to get it over with so i ask someone who was on the side of the middle row where the teacher walks (pointless description i guess). He agreed and we headed off to the sound booth room. it was a bit awkward at first like so silent and only exchanged like a few words at a time awkward. Now normally id still be quiet and nothing wouldve came from this but i pushed myself to ask question. So i asked the usual college questions, What classes are you taking, what year are you in, etc. He was pretty good at keeping the convo going. We even laughed at each others mistakes for the voice over. Skipping to the end of class we both walked out of the building and we kept talking for about maybe 5 mins on movies and Netflix shows and we even exchanged contact info. ( QUESTION IS HERE) Now i am asking how do i talk to him again and how do i maybe ask him to be like my partner in class like sit near me and basically help one another if that makes sense. Just how do i talk to him cause i know ill tell myself ""if he really wanted to talk to you he would by"" and thats not good so how do i do this with out being too pushy or sounding creepy. i have class with him today at 6. 
- P.s. Sorry for the long back story.",20Mar2018,4
327,"Tl;dr: I hate the way my life is going. I wasn't happy in my until recently romantic relationship, I'm not happy professionally, I don't like where I live, I'm unhappy with my emotional state, a lot of things... I want to change things completely. Where do I start?


So as the title sums up, I'm just unhappy with how my life has proceeded since graduating college. What follows are some backstory and reasons for why I'm unhappy with things as they are.


* Backstory: I graduated college in May 2016. I moved away (about 100 miles) and worked for about a year at an Apple Store, and was okay with that. I went back to school starting August 2017, and that's where things really started to go south.


* Relationship: This is the first piece out of all of the things I feel that are making me unhappy that I've actually addressed. I was in a relationship with my ex-gf for 3.5 years. The first 10-12 months were good, but it went downhill after that, and it went on for way too long. There were a lot of issues in the relationship that really hurt me in a lot of ways. My ex-gf is a good person, but she was like a little girl in a lot of ways. Super insecure, everything was always a problem, she was always playing the victim with everybody, verbally abusing me, telling me my interests and ways of doing things were stupid, etc. Just a lot of things that were not good. I finally ended it about 2 weeks ago. It wasn't until after I ended it I actually felt the toll it took on me. It still kind of sucks right now, but I've never felt so sure of a decision in my life. So I feel like this was a positive step 1.


* Professional life: I went back to school for a PhD because I didn't really know what I wanted to do. This was a stupid decision. After almost a year in the program, I realize now I hate the subject. Also, my department is riddled with toxicity, both between faculty members and students alike. I'll be out of the program in about a month, but once it ends, I have nothing else to do. I need to figure out next steps. I kind of know what I want to do (psychology/mental health counseling), but I'm kind of scared to take the risk considering what I've been through with this program.


* Where I'm living: Out of the past 7 years, I've spent 6 of them in my crappy college town. There's not a whole lot here other than the university. I don't want to stay here, but I don't know where to go. I don't want to go back to where my parents are, however.


* Home life/support system: Currently my support system consists of my parents and my two best friends. My mom is awesome and a healthy support, but my dad is borderline personality, which makes going home very stressful and at times it just rips me apart. Also, my grandmother and aunt are very overbearing, which makes going home when I'm stressed that much worse. One of my friends is in a similar position to me, but also caught up in his own codependent struggle with his parents. My other friend has been in undergrad 7 years and is about to move in with his girlfriend and her child. He puts all of his energy into that relationship, so I feel like once she does move here, he's going to forget about everyone else and I'll rarely see him again.


* Emotional issues: Anxiety is a big problem right now. I believe a lot of it is situational due to the current scheme of things (ex-girlfriend, school, family, feeling generally lost), but at the same time, it just feels so real that I feel paralyzed and like I can't make any moves to get out of it. Medication is not an option for me for medical reasons, though I am working with a therapist to combat it. But every time I feel like I make progress with her, I feel like other stuff in my life knocks me 2 steps back. The anxiety mostly manifests as feelings of panic or fear of panic. Also, and this is probably a deeper issue, but at times I just feel so unsure of myself and like I can't do life that it comes out in other ways too, like social anxiety.


So these are the things that are bothering me, and I just feel ridiculously trapped/lost... I don't know how to get out of this cycle and change things just because it feels like there's so much that needs changing.


Does anyone have any advice or similar experiences? Seriously, anything will help.

328,"First of let me start by saying I dont ''hate'' my neighbors I just find them very irritating etc

Anyway so my Dad and I moved to a different part of the country about two years ago previously we lived in the city, but currently we are living in the country outside of a small town. Everything was fine here until about 4 months ago when our new neighbors moved in they live up the hill from us and a fence separates our land.

So were to start, first of there dog they own a very small dog and we own a medium sized dog, every day they go to work and someone comes to there house that they pay to look after the dog maybe a family friend or something, but every day when they leave work there dog just comes over to our house and a lot of the time my dad is out so I end up looking after it aswell as my dog it gives my dog something to play with but hes been sick recently and runs out of steam pretty quick and because its younger than him it really irratates him while hes trying to rest, its also a problem for me as I'm trying to do work on my computer and things like that. What amazes me is that someone is getting payed to do nothing during the day while there at the house ''looking after the dog'' because it just comes over here and I feed it and give it water etc etc, I honestly feel like saying to my neighbors you should be paying me at this point since I'm doing all the work and its taking up my time from my actual job, man the person working there has the easiest job ever literally do nothing and get payed, yesterday my dad and I got home and I caught the person who's meant to be looking after the dog climbing through the fence and perpously  leaving the dog on my property for my dad and I to look after, my dad doesnt do anything about this or talk to the neighbors about it because hes to easy going and doesn't want to upset anyone.

Problem two, the neighbors kids its at the point now were they just come over whenever they want, there ages are 4 and 10 so very young, and once again my dad is to soft and lets then come over and even feeds them until there mum or there dad comes over and says ''cmon kids lets go home'' and most likely picks up there dog too, listen I dont mind kids there alright you know? not a big fan of most kids but there just kids, but man there irritating all they do is come over make a mess wear out my dog  and eat my food, not to mention the screaming I dont know what it is with little kids these days but if I started screaming and making scene my parents would just be stern and tell me to cut it out and stop it and I would, but they just come over and scream non stop its very hard to work and focus when thats happening, another thing that happened recently was my dad started giving away my star wars figures to them, I'm not a kid anymore obviously but those old figures are very collectible I'm not some nerd or something but man I really did like star wars and I saved up a lot when I was younger to buy all that stuff and now its just being given away, when my dad was giving them away I heard one of the kids say oops I broke one and my dad went ''oh thats fine there only silly old figures'' yeah that silly old Darth Vader figure from the 90s was only worth $400.

Side note for some reason they have a bunch off imagrents living out there house not sure why but they do and they do house chores etc and just let there dog roam around non stop so not to happy about that lot, god knows why you'd want 4 imagrents living at your house. I'm not racist just confused really.

I don't mind looking after peoples dogs if I'm given a heads up and if I get asked ''hey I'm going to be busy would you mind looking after my dog'' that would be fine. Its also worth mentions that my dog doesn't go over to there property or anyone's to mentions without me being there or if ive has permission.

Another thing mentions is that I could see something bad happening in the future, because one day I woke up and my dad had gone out, so I got out of bed (I sleep pretty much naked) and went to the kitchen to make a cup of coffee that when I heard the neighbors kids they must of just come over in the morning and started playing outside my house, anyway since were out of town my dad keeps all the doors unlocked because theirs no risk of theifs or anything since were like a subdivision out of the way of everything, anyway those kids could of just walked in or seen me naked at pretty much any point that day, luckily I heard them and got dressed but still the last thing I'd want is to get out bed naked and to stumble upon a little girl while naked like I dont want that to be some kids sex ed you know? like Jesus that would put me in a pretty shitty spot and I could even get into shit if they told there parents even though its not my fault at all.

So anyway, any advice would be greatly appreciated not sure how to handle this situation.",20Mar2018,3

331,"We’ve dated about 3 mo. 

I broke it off with him yesterday. He didn’t really do anything wrong I just couldn’t fully trust anyone and don’t wanna be in a rship. He held me and hugged me and wouldn’t really let me go. He kept saying please please please He cried hysterically in my arms and said he can’t lose me, he can’t take anymore heartbreak, he doesn’t want to live, he loves me so much, he will get down and beg if I want him to and I said plz no. 

He said he would do anything to make me happy and he’s a fantastic bf. He said he didn’t do anything wrong. He let go of me and cried so much into his pillow. I felt so bad I started tearing up 

Then I asked if he knew where some of my things were and he said “That’s your priority?” And threw/hit something bc there was a loud noise. I said I’m just being practical because we have to break up and he said no we don’t. He got mad at me and told me I shouldn’t have went through his phone etc etc bad things I’ve done and I got scared so I ran out the door.


I realized he left his suitcase in my trunk. He asked for it back and I said I’m happy to bring it over. 

I just know he will try to break me down if I see him. He’s sent me a ton of texts today and yesterday. 

Here are 10 screenshots to explain why I don’t wanna see them https://imgur.com/a/ESkSH

Just wonder if it’s ok to leave his stuff at his doorstep when he is asleep or not expecting but home so it doesn’t get stolen(he lives in an apartment)  and text him it’s there, make sure he got it, and drive off so I don’t have to see him, 

I asked someone and they said that is like an f you statement. I don’t want him to think I’m saying f you to him. I want him to know I care, and always will, but I just don’t want to go through it all again

335,"So I've been in love with this same girl for about 7 years but by ""love"" I don't mean in a loving relationship. We first met in high school and starting talking for a few weeks before I finally told her how I felt. Things were great she felt the same way, but as time went on (as any high school girl would) she got bored and started seeing someone else, although we always stayed in contact and from time to time we'd kick it off and hook up again. Eventually this led to me and her having this absolutely FUCKED friendship sometimes platonic and at times just fucking around  out of lonelyness.
For the longest time I was okay with this kind of relationship but as years piled on (22 now) my feelings for this person grew more and more, I was a part of her family.. her life and she was a part of mine. 
When I was 18 she moved off to college and had her first serious relationship with a really cool guy. I was very jelous at first but was months went by I just learned to let it go. This is OF COURSE until her life seemingly fell apart and she moved back home to live with her parents minus the now (ex-boyfriend). 
You could only imagine what joy I felt to receive that message on that rainy morning. 
So she's been back a few months now and we've been together essentially the entire time. We get drunk on the beach, go out, hook up ect.. but a few weeks ago she made it clear that she still after all this time doesn't want a relationship with me but also doesn't mind the way things are now....
Two days ago she called me to tell me about how she hooked up with this random guy she met at her new job, sex was great and all that..

Hearing that shit made me feel all kinds of depressed/jelous and I feel like I probably don't have the right.. after all she isn't my girlfriend and never was.. but at the same time she is someone I've known practically my whole young adulthood and obviously I love her lots. At the end of the day though I'm not going to go through with this pain again.. not after all the previous years of her going back and forth from me to a newfound ""lover"" lmfao
This new thing with her job just bothers me so much.. I've literally taken this girls virginity and now all I can think is how nasty it is... like I feel disgusted when I think about all the different dicks that have shown her a good time.

So what's you guy's advice. Should I explain to her that I can no longer be ""friends"" with her or do you think this is just some psycho post breakup slut faze?",20Mar2018,2

337,"Hi everyone!

So I'm in a bit of a pickle in terms of what I should do about my internship this summer. Sorry for the wall of text...here's the situation:

I interned at a company (Company X) last summer. I didn't quite enjoy the work as it was a lot of desk work and not as much interaction with those we were working with as much as I wanted. I think the company knew, though, and tried to make it more interesting by allowing me to sit in on conference calls, meet with team members, access pretty important documents, etc. I really enjoyed the people and the culture, though. I got along with mostly everyone, and the company really welcomed me with open arms. I technically have an offer from them for this summer, because my supervisor reached out to me at the end of my internship (and between last summer and now) to let me know that they would love to have me back this summer. The nice thing about this internship was that it wasn't too far from home (so I could drive home every weekend if I wanted to), but still far enough where I had to live on my own and commute (adulting!)

That said, I'm not sure if I want to limit myself by staying with this company. I applied to about 10 other companies this week and have yet to hear back (it's only been about one or two days since I submitted my applications). The work sounds more interesting and engaging than what I did at Company X, which is why I'm drawn to these other internships. However, many of them are pretty far from home (6+ hours, some out-of-state). While I wouldn't necessarily mind the distance, it is pretty scary to think I wouldn't have that option of going home when I want to. Additionally, some of the internships are either unpaid or only part-time, whereas ideally I'd like a full-time, paid internship (which I would have at Company X).

Now...the dilemma. Company X posted an advertisement yesterday looking for interns this upcoming summer. I haven't yet followed up with the technical offer from them. I'm not sure what to do! I don't want to burn any bridges by contacting my previous supervisor, tentatively taking on the internship, but then later backtracking and declining the internship for another one.

Should I wait for these other companies to get back to me and move forward with that process in hopes that I'll land one of those internships? Or should I just play it safe and ensure that I even have an internship this summer by going back to Company X?

To recap:

Pros of Company X - I know I like the company/culture, it's a good distance from home, it's paid and full-time, could build my network and work there post-graduation

Cons of Company X - the work wasn't as exciting as I would have hoped

Pros of other internships - work seems more exciting, could expand my network

Cons of other internships - I may not even get them (leaving me with nothing for this summer!), I may not like the culture, I may not get along with the people, I may have to be super far from home, it may not be paid/full-time

Any advice on what I should do? After typing this out, it looks like the pros heavily outweigh the cons to go back to Company X...but I'm not sure. Any advice? What would you do? Thank you in advance for your insight!",20Mar2018,3
338,"As the title says, I had sex with one of my friends not too long ago and I'm not really sure where to go from there. We're not very close friends and we don't really talk that much in school or on social media, and not even when we're hanging out with our mutual friends for that matter. But, we did have sex, and we do show physical affection to each other as well by doing generic couple shit like holding hands and kissing, so there is at least something there. The thing is, I don't know where to take the relationship. After we had sex, I wanted to be in a romantic relationship with him, but after reflecting on how we interact and socialize with each other in non-sexual ways, I've come to realize that a romance may not work. But then again, it may develop into one later on. My alternative is to keep the relationship as it is: casual friends who fuck each other to appease our wants for physical affection. I'm very confused and indecisive as to where our relationship stands and where it should and could go, and I want some outside feedback.",20Mar2018,3
340,"I am an 18-year-old female and I recently lost 50 pounds. I'm 5'3 and currently weigh 121 pounds but the reception to my weight loss has been surprisingly negative even from my family. My mom tries to get me to eat more than I want to and constantly comments about how skinny and unhealthy I look. She also told me that its ""extremely unhealthy"" that I wear the same size as my 12 year old sister (who is already 2 full inches taller than me). My teachers have been asking if I'm starving myself and one even showed me a picture of Lindsey Lohan when she was anorexic and said ""is this really what you want to look like?"". There was even a cyberbullying incident where a girl from my school (who I think I should mention is extremely obese herself, and a feminist SJW type) Started commenting mean things on all my pictures calling me flat chested and anorexic and gross and telling me to eat a burger and saying guys don't like girls who are as skinny as me and stuff like that until I blocked her and reported her to the school but they didn't really do anything. I lost weight because I got off a medication that made me gain weight, not because of anything unhealthy and I am just naturally a very small and petite person and, when I'm not on that medication or over eating,  my weight tends to settle around 120-125. I'm not starving myself. I eat around 2000 calories a day like I'm supposed to. I have a BMI of 22.1 so I'm nowhere near underweight.

342,"Middle 3 long paragraphs are explanations of what's going on for me right now you can skip if you'd like not all that important. I put + over them

Truthfully I cannot stand myself. There is nothing good about me. I'm ugly as all fuck, personality is weak, I can be funny occationally, I'm mean, I'm nice, I have no talents, no real friends, nothing to offer, always the last resort, don't know anything about anything. 

Before I explain myself I do go to therapy and she barely helps at all, she recommended medication which were going over this Friday which I don't think will change much at all.

First of all, I do have a few friends but I'm pretty much a last resort for them I'm sure they'd much rather hangout with other people than me. Some of them are car people, and know all about that type of stuff I know nothing about any of it and I always feel lost. Other are druggies which I know a fair bit about but not a lot so I get joked about a lot when I ""act"" like I know what I'm talking about. They joke around with me a lot always treat me like the bottom of the barrel. I always slip up and tell them something to use against me to try and humor things up. I wish things were different.

+
I've never had a girl friend and I know nothing about how to get one cause I've never tried before. Last year this one girl approached me and she is very attractive, and used to ""like"" me but since I turned her down and didn't know what I was doing she stopped liking me. We still talk, hangout, even sometimes try to advance a little further than normal. But she makes fun of me sometimes because I'm a pussy when it comes to all of that, I don't understand hints, I can't take anything seriously. Worst part is I'm obsessed with her and she has no clue it's as bad as it really is. She the only girl I've ever gotten and held onto, the only one I've kissed. And she doesn't even like me just plays with my head and I'm pretty sure she gets a kick out of pleasing some ugly ass fucker like me. I get made fun of for hanging out with her even though she's really attractive, and for being virgin too.

Idk what to do my home life doesn't help at all, I never talk to my family, I have a large family that's strict and bent around good family image, and morals and stupid shit. Majority of my family is girls too, that I never talk to. My parents are divorced I live with my mom and step dad and they are both a little crazy we live in a shitty house in the middle of nowhere with nothing to do around and no friends nearby. Btw were not poor but pretty damn close.

 I can't have fun, I can't enjoy anything, I sit in my bed all day scrolling up and down on my phone waiting for a ""hey"" or text from somebody to make me happy for a minute. Nothing seems worth it anymore I just wanna give up. I really think my biggest problem in my mind is how ugly I am, if that changes I'd be so much happier i think but it's the hardest thing to change and it won't happen. All I want is to have friends who actually give a shit about me, a girl I like back to care and want to be with me, to have talents like basketball, bmx, rapping, know about cars/fourwheelers and shit, and etc. To have a normal family that's not always on edge, a house I'm not embarrassed of, have money, and all sorts of other stuff but I can't. It won't happen it's just not gonna happen. Nobody knows I'm depressed people have suspicions but I've never said anything and I'm usually mostly happy. But whatever advice you can offer thank you

343,"So he started off as a neighbor, and we became friends. He decided to rent out a second room, so I moved in. He moved out two months ago, and rented out his old bedroom (there are now three tenants).

Well, he keeps showing up and letting himself in unannounced. I figure maybe it's a cultural thing, he was born in Iraq, and I think this is the first house he's ever been making payments on.

Problem is, for one, me and one of the other roommates are both super uncomfortable about him just coming in the house when we aren't around. We know he does it when nobody is here, too, and I think purposely avoids letting anyone know. He wants to check on the house that we're taking care of it, so we kind of let it slide at first.

However, he's been complaining about there being cigarette butts on the back porch (the one roommate said he smoked before he even moved in, and they're in an ashtray, not just all over the place). Then today he calls me, saying he doesn't want any dishes in the sink, and if we keep doing it, he's going to raise the rent.

Now, I fully recognize I have some issues with authority; I listened and just grit my teeth, saying ""yeah, okay"", but in the back of my mind I was pretty furious. We each pay pretty good money for our rooms, and we cover electric (he covers internet; me and the other roomie suspect he may just be chilling out here through the day on his days off, because he moved out to live with his parents).

So, while I acknowledge that it wouldn't hurt to keep the kitchen spotless at all times, I don't feel like it's his place to be making demands about that. And his coming and going without telling anybody is clearly illegal.

But...

He is my friend, and I don't want to ""blow up"" on him, at least to the point of being unreasonably angry. But I also want to stand up for myself, even if it means finding a new place (something I've been planning to do in a few months anyways).

How do I approach him about all this, in a manner that isn't going to sound like we're ""ganging up on him""? Part of it, I also worry, is maybe he lets himself in because he still feels like it's his house, and doesn't realize it bothers us?",20Mar2018,2
345,"So I'm extremely torn on a massive life choice. Just for reference I am a woman in my early thirties.
I am currently a specialized arts teacher at a school I enjoy. I love my job but the area I live in is ABYSMAL. I've lived here 5 years and haven't been able to make a single friend, plus there are no amenities/things to do yet it is very expensive (I live alone and am always struggling financially). I do have a boyfriend of one year who lives 3 hours away, and we visit on the weekends.

Because it is so expensive here and due to the fact that I'm so bored/depressed/suicidal I decided to move in with my mother who lives in another state at the end of the school year. I figured I'd be able to save up money, have more emotional stability, I have a friend who lives there, and there are lots of fun things to do there.

I've committed to moving with her, but I've not been able to find another job and that STRESSES ME OUT. I cry every day, have been losing sleep and my hair is falling out because I'm not sure what to do. Again, I LOVE my current job and students so leaving it is hard for me to begin with, and thinking about working at a grocery store or going retail makes me have a panic attack, but at the same time I feel like this place is slowly sucking out my soul. My mother says that something will come along when I move with her, but I'd very afraid that it won't.

Also my mother and I don't really get along well which contributes to things not working out. I have a mental illness (diagnosed) and I suspect that she has the same one (un-diagnosed) so she can be unpredictable.

I have been offered a job with a major airline as a flight attendant, but I don't think I could handle the lifestyle and massive pay cut, although everyone is encouraging me to live with my mother, commute to Atlanta (3+ hours) and fly. I love traveling but  thrive on structure and routine.

Now a coworker has offered to let me move in with her for much cheaper than where I live currently. I'm wondering if I should just stay in my nice job, live cheaper and go on a hella rad vacation every summer, or if I should move in with my mom and have zero financial security, but live in a city with lots of things to do and enjoy. Either way feels like lose lose to me. 

This problem is all that I can think about, it consumes me and I cry at least twice a day because of it. I feel like no matter what I do I'm going to ruin my life. 

My mother is flying in today to help me pack all my stuff and I'm so scared to tell her that I'm unsure of what to do. She gets VERY angry and even told me to kill myself once. I'm so not sure what to do.

350,"Hey,
I've heard a few conflicting opinions on at what point seeking therapy is appropriate, and I wanted to know if I would be wasting a therapist's time.

I've been lucky in my life in that I haven't yet had to experience depression or any other awful mental health problems, but I've been grown more continously stressed for the past year. I feel constantly trapped in my thoughts and am still carrying my over-sensitivity that I've had since I was a young child (I can't defend myself against authority figures in a conversation without tearing up and crying right after they've left).

I don't know, I've been feeling more shit recently and despite having many friends and a caring family I don't feel comfortable confiding in them about anything emotional.

I just want to know if it would be worth talking to a therapist because I don't want to if it means taking up a slot which a person with a serious mental health issue could use.

Thanks fellas.",20Mar2018,2
351,"I can't get over one girl after she rejected me. I feel sometimes sad. She said that I have to get over her and I need to understand that we're JUST friends. I don't know if It's because of it or anything, but lately I have come across again with feelings, like feeling useles, sad and lonely, like everyone hates me. I should focus on the important things right now, such as school, but I just can't stop thinking about her and she goes in my class, so I'm stuck with her almost every day, not that I don't like it, but I don't think it helps me at all. After all I'm just a silly 16 year old and it probably won't matter at all soon, but it feels so BIG right now. Music is the only thing that calms me right now, I just can't focus on school work. Yesterday I kind of forced my problems on her on snapchat, she said ""goodnight"". I think she's trying to be mean to me, so I wouldn't like her anymore. I don't think we would be such a great couple, because I'm really weird with her alone. She's trying to avoid moments when we're alone. She doesn't go with me anywhere with me anymore, none unless we're with our other classmates. I just CAN'T get myself together right now! I hate all this. She's religous and I'm not, there's also that, and It's very important to her. Recently I was in an one week youth exchange and I missed her so much. I'm late in school now also. I want summer break again when there's no stress about studying. Also I can't stop worrying about everything. Im socially awkward and I don't talk much, but when I do it doesn't come off so great and then again I hate myself, even if I kind of don't. I don't know how to feel or what to do. I just feel so alone in all this, tho I have some good friends, but it feels lonely. I don't want to go to school, but I want to see HER. Reminds me of my previous years when I faked sick a lot. Sometimes I can't be honest with myself, I'm not usually realistic of the situation on what's going to happen. I always imagine everything so perfect, that I won't worry anymore and be talkative, but nothing changes by the blink of an eye. I should be studying right now, it's 1 am, I have a lot of homework. BUT I JUST CAN'T. I want to ignore everything, but it wouldn't take me to a better place in school. I can't stop worrying, after all the worrying it seems impossible and in the end I don't have anything done. I don't want to force my problems on anyone and I can't really open up in real life, so I'm here.",20Mar2018,3

She's very depressed and doesn't think anyone will want to hire a senior.

358,"My best friend simply treats me differently from all her other friends. Whenever we hang out I feel like there’s a time limit, once it’s up she can’t wait to be gone and eject me from her presence. This isn’t the case with other people, where she purposefully stays up past her own set bedtime just to talk to them and socialise, while I always have a nagging feeling that she can’t wait to get rid of me, but I don’t know if this is genuine. I do think that she should develop other friendships as part of any healthy human being. What I don’t think is right is that I should be treated as expendable and sidelined, but I don’t know if this feeling is valid or not. I know that a couple of weeks ago I confronted her about not being more proactive in scheduling meet-ups and she’s been receptive to that, and I really appreciate it, she’s made a huge effort towards it. However, this still nags at me - am I in the wrong and being too clingy here, or is this something I should talk to her about? 

The other thing is that conversation doesn’t flow as smoothly as it used to, and I find myself struggling to maintain a conversation with her. She says it’s because she has “nothing to say” in response to my comments, but I don’t feel that way - her conversations with other people flow smoothly as ever. She also doesn’t share many details or her own life with me, like hobbies, interests and events going on in her life, making the conversation even more awkward. My brother once told me that I could view her as a best friend, but she doesn’t have to feel the same way, and I’m starting to think he’s right. I really do love her as a friend and I’m trying to change the situation, including my attitude towards it if needs be, but I don’t think she appreciates my company and my presence. In fact, I get the feeling I’m unwanted. I guess the central question is: am I an annoyance? Am I something that she just feels obligated to spend time with and not actually has the desire to do so? I certainly feel like it, and my intuition tells me so. 

Sorry for the long essay, but I need advice on what to do now. Do I approach her with this mini essay? Am I just being a bad friend and should look more closely at myself? Especially - am I demanding too much? Should I take a step back and reevaluate our relationship? Thank you for reading through this. ",20Mar2018,2

Therefore, for every assignment that involves writing (essays, reflections, etc.), she has her mom do extensive editing, to the point where her mother will rewrite sentences for her rather than just give her general suggestions. Although she is my friend, I still get a little mad that she gets such good grades on these assignments yet only average grades on exams where she cannot ask her mother for help. I also don't have such an advantage because my schoolwork is nothing that my parents/family would know about or be able to help with. Therefore, is this considered academic dishonesty or not?

363,"My younger brother has had huge problems with drugs in the past. He started smoking weed when he was just 15 and since moved onto cocaine and speed. I lived with him and my mum through the years and he was awful to us. Always punching holes in walls and trying to fight us. 


Anyway, I recently moved back in with them and he has changed massively. He is the shell of a former human. He spends all day doing mindless things like puzzles and watching tv with my mum. He has no friends and never contributes to any conversation. He has been prescribed with what I can only assume is diazepam and is on a 2 year prescription. 


I'm not sure how to treat the situation, it makes me so sad to see him so lifeless. I guess that's the advice I'm asking for. Is it wrong to just let him go through with the prescription? Should I intervene or is it for the best?",20Mar2018,3

365,"Short background.  Ive had emotional issues for a long time.  I met a friend who I love dearly and we got along great for a couple years.
Then i got too clingy.
The more she pulled away the more panicked i got.  ...yes classic stupid move.  I kept trying to figure out what i did wrong and fix it.  
My writing got more needy.  I apologized for everything i thought i was doing wrong but still clung.
Im not sure when i started doing it but my writing crossed from merely needy to emotionally abusive and manipulative.  I still didnt see what i was doing.
I would write things that only served to make her feel guilty but i justified it as being ""open"".

Ive been in therapy for depression but the thing that opened my eyes was a third party telling me that things i wrote were insincere.  I asked why and was given a gift of seeing my actions from others eyes.  
I now see how i messed up.

I want to tell her i now know what i did, to apologize and then leave her be.  The problem is ive apologized so much and the thing about emotional abusers is they use apologies to further manipulate.  Id like her to know i finally get it and i do regret being so clueless.

I dont intend to say anything till im sure WHY i want to apologize.  I dont want any more selfishness to hurt her further.

Just looking for opinions.  Preferably from people who have dealt with people like me.  I am aware that she has no obligation to accept or even listen to my apology.

369,"When we got together, we were both assholes. I lied a lot, she used me for money and so she wouldn’t be alone, but over time, we grew out of these habits and were happy, even lived together for a while. But for the last year or so, since she started her senior year of college, she’s treated me horribly and demanded I change things about myself to fit her mold of what she thinks I should be. We’ve talked and talked and fought and fought about it, to the point where I actually broke it off with her in a fit of anger in dealing with her making a scene in public in front of her family. 

A few weeks after, we talked again and she apologized for how she was acting and we were back in a good way at first, but she claimed we couldn’t be *really* dating until I started anti-depressants to control my issues. This alone was kind of a red flag, but I dealt with it because I love her and I lost so much last year between my nephew, grandfather, and aunt that I just really couldn’t stand anything else and maintain a healthy mental state. 

Fast forward to now, around four months after all that. I’m on anti-depressants and they aren’t helping much, and she’s been getting other dude’s numbers but allegedly not going out with anyone, she constantly dangles the “we’re not dating” bit over my head despite constantly acting clingy and coming to me for support and expecting me to put her above everything else like I used to, and she has freaked out every single time I have plans that don’t involve her. Just last week, she freaked out because I was spending time with my mom and her new boyfriend instead of going to see her, and she complained that I didn’t want to stay on the phone with her the whole time I was there because she was sick and lonely. 

This morning, she asked me to cover over immediately and spend the night because she didn’t feel good, but I already had plans made last week that I had mentioned to her already involving one of my friends from high school, a girl. She knows this girl, we’ve all hung out together before and she knows that there is no attraction between us at all and never has been, but she said that me going out to hang with her was “shady” and that “everybody knows what guys like *you* do when you’re out”, despite the fact that I’ve very rarely gone out without her or someone from her family and literally never could have before we were together since I was only 20. She was being manipulative, again, disrespectful, and rude, and treating me like garbage because she didn’t get what she wanted, I guess. I stopped talking to her after standing my ground and using her favorite card of “we’re not dating” to justify it, which I probably shouldn’t have. 

I just don’t know what to do from here. I feel like the way she’s treating me is too much to deal with on top of my current issues personally and within my family, but I’m so scared to cut it off because I’ve seen myself with her for the long haul since just after our first year. She knows everything about me, she’s been there to help me become a better person and stop lying about everything, she’s dealt with my ups and downs for years and I don’t trust anyone else the same way anymore. I just need some help figuring things out and I’d really appreciate any insight from people who were in similar situations at one point, or who have dealt with others in situations like this.

384,"TL;DR: Can't emotionally or financially support mentally ill brother, seeking facility, program, or advice to help.

My older brother was diagnosed with schizophrenia and psychosis in his junior year of college. We have reason to believe (his friends coming forward, physical evidence, etc) that he became involved in hallucinogenics about six months before his diagnosis. Everyone involved really only knew a part of the story, so we have no real way of knowing for sure what substances he took and in what quantities.

He has been in... 5? in patient programs? I think? Some of those he volunteered to be admitted to, others he was legally admitted by the police. It is ALWAYS the same routine. He meets with a psychiatrist/psychopharmacologist for all of ten minutes, they prescribe him a new anti-psych pill or give him an anti-psych shot, they keep him in the hospital for 7-10 days, and then turn him loose to us.

It is getting to the point that he will refuse his anti-psych medication and has started to lead a very difficult life. He has been arrested for criminal trespassing three times, charged with destruction of property, banned from a half dozen establishments, and brutally assaulted me or my father (to the point of broken bones, lacerations, concussions, etc). The legal fees and medical bills are becoming more and more insurmountable, and opening the front door to cops got old really quickly.

My father, who divorced our mom, has been tirelessly trying to keep this entire situation afloat. I'm in college now and can't directly help, and I know that my father has fallen victim to alcoholism. He also very recently lost job (and soon, our amazing health insurance that has covered a majority of my brother's expenses!)

What the hell do we do? He's my brother. We can't just turn him loose on the streets. I'm holding out hope that he'll be okay one day--maybe not the person he was when we were growing up, but he'll be okay. What can I do? What facility will host him? Are there programs for him to learn to be more independent? 

We can't live like this. Please help us.
