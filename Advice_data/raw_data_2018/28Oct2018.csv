3,"So last night, my boyfriend and his friends and I went out to eat last night to celebrate his birthday. One of his friends decided to throw another informal little thing for him today but I ended up coming up with something from the restaurant or something because I feel like crap. Now my boyfriend is mad at me because his mom is going to be there and we see her once every few weeks or month but we live just a few minutes from her and can always visit her whenever we want. I feel like complete shit and he’s making me feel ever more so like it for feeling sick. Am I in the wrong here? Should I have just sucked it up and still went? It’s hard for me to get up without going to the bathroom ",28Oct2018,1

6,"The girl I like sent me a text tonight. It essentially said that she really really liked me and not to tell her boyfriend. Naturally, I was fucking thrilled.

I told her the feeling was mutual and I asked her how long she had felt that way, after ten minutes of contemplating how to respond.

She replied that it was a dare, she was lying, and that nobody else saw my response.

What the fuck do I do now? Bear in mind, she and I have been super close friends for like 2 years now but she's been with this guy and I was with someone else before. She is probably one of the only if not *the only* person in the world who I can rely on to have my back and shit. I care about her more than I care about some of my relatives. My attraction to her slowly developed and lately I've been thinking about her so much.

So what do I do?

First, please don't just say ""just leave her"" because I know her. I know that she was pressured to do this by others and she probably feels bad right now. She's probably my closest friend. At the same time, what the fuck man?! How the fuck does she want me to respond? You have to understand that reading that text was the happiest I have felt in fucking months. Now, I have no idea what to do.

Thanks in advance.",28Oct2018,1

&amp;#x200B;

So a little background about myself: I am in my mid 20s, BA in Psychology from a reputable university. Parents aren't really in the picture so there's hasn't been much if any guidance. Everything I've done up until this point has been pretty much on myself. My research assistant contract job at a private university just ended. I was mainly doing Human Factors work and eventually entirely grant management. I had a bad time with it and it left a fairly bad taste in my mouth. It wasn't all bad, but I didn't end up doing what I was told I was going to be doing. There were also some big office politics going on between the department and where I was working. I had no idea about any of it upon hire and got threw under the bus because I was expendable. That's behind me now, I left on good terms, moving on. I am currently looking for a new job and I am at a loss. when I look at these job postings I am qualified for, none of them seem like anything I would love or enjoy doing. I got into my degree because I love people and I love to hear their stories. I love to collaborate and be creative. I myself am a creative person (I've played and made music my whole life and I love it dearly). I have a good brain and want to use it. All these jobs I'm seeing just seem dry and devoid of that creative and human element that I cherish so much. I don't think I would be a good fit for any of them. I don't know what to do. Am I looking in the wrong places? I just want to be in doing something where I can be creative and surrounded by like minded people. I want to be appreciated not tolerated. I just don't know whats out there. So if anyone has been in my shoes and walked a little farther down the road than me, I'd love to hear your story and how you got to where you were going. Thank you -SF",28Oct2018,1
9,"So I have this one friend that I have known for 3 years. But just this year we are alway fighting and when I make up with her ( mind even if she is the one how started the fight I would be the one to go up to her and apologise) she acts all dry and mean to me and I just don’t want drama or to fight with anyone. I made up my mind to stop talking to her last Monday and I told her why she had a brake down . And she got 4 other people involved with what I told her and one of the people was yelling at me and asking me why I mad her cry. I didn’t do anything bad so I told her what happened, but that didn’t help she got louder.

10,"Hey everyone. I'm a 21 M in school majoring in biology and I have a stable job, a good home, a great family. But I still find myself depressed whenever I see happy couples. 

And before anyone thinks I'm being a dick, I'm genuinely happy for every single one of them, it's that I dont ever remember being that happy in a relationship. 

And I dont know if I ever will be, or if I will even be able to get into another relationship. I've been single for a year and a half. And while its definitely been a great experience for me, I just miss it sometimes and dont know how to handle these emotions.

13,"hey all, just a warning this is going to be a long post, context is important and i dont think theres much i can leave out. tl;dr at bottom

my name is jett, im 21 years old, chronically ill, and lgbt, and im poor as all hell, trying desperately to get my shit together. i live in new jersey, usa. if anyone relates or knows of anything, anything at all that can help me get on my feet even if it doesnt seem big, i need all of the help i can get. 
in my childhood both of my parents were really abusive and neglectful, emotionally, physically, even spiritually (my mom brainwashed me into an especially bastardized view of roman catholicism, i now identify as atheist, it ocassionally still weighs on me). my dad bailed when i was in my teens, and my mother kicked me out shortly after turning 18 with only $8 in the bank. im very frugal, and i had savings, but she stole from me, my school effed me over on classes and i had to pay out of pocket for summer schooling as a result (details unnecessary but will explain if asked), and this sleazey mechanic my mom made me go to over problems with my truck fucked me out of over 2 grand. when she kicked me out i had a part-time minimum wage job, side job in highschool. i lived in my car for four months before landing a place and had help from my amazing and suportive friends for my rent and the like, but i still lost a lot of weight since i cant afford to eat right and had to get what i need to manage my chronic illness. after finding a place i immediately found a full time job, ive been through a few different ones since, working nonstop to just barely make ends meet. my depression and anxiety are a burden on me and i frequently work to and even beyond burn out just to afford my rent and bills, with very little money outside of that, and every time i manage to save i have an emergency and its all gone again. i dont have a higher education, i cant get one because it would require me to work less and id lose my housing and be unable to pay my bills, i cant seem to get a higher wage job with my illness, education, and age. i have tried time and time again. im an artist, i have made some connections to try to get a tattoo apprenticeship, i know its unpaid work during the apprenticeship but id be garunteed a job after making better money. im trying to find ways to subsidize myself while doing the apprenticeship and working (its less demanding and more realistic for me than school, especially with my mental health), i have no credit, i cant afford to save enough to get a credit card to build credit, i cannot move anywhere more affordable without it, nor can i save for a security deposit to move anywhere cheaper (not that theres much). most states also still dont have protections for lgbt people and if i tried to move to a cheaper state i risk losing work over discrimination, and lose the support of my local friends. ive tried getting food stamps and assistance, no luck yet but i am still trying. i dont know what to do. i often and honestly feel the rest of my life is just going to be working myself to an early death. unless wages go up, or housing costs go down, i genuinely have no idea how i am going to ever save enough money for an education, my illness bars me from most trades and better paid jobs, i dont have health insurance (cant afford it, had to leave my previous job due to discrimiation that was leading up to getting me fired, if i didnt bail when i did, and lost it) and my heart condition is rather expensive to care for, but if i dont care for myself i cannot work. landing an apprenticeship of some sort really seems to be my best bet, but with the unpaid time i will have to cut back on paid work a bit and i dont know how im supposed to do that. i dont want to spend the rest of my life like this. i often feel like a failure, and i genuinely feel my life is ruined simply because my parents hated me and shouldve never had children. i dont have any local family to help me, i cant move, i can just barely save money and seem to have emergencies whenever i do, i cant find a better job, i cant afford a car to travel to one, i dont know what to do. how do you fix your life when youre still this young and so low on options?
im looking for grants, aid, scholarships, ive even tried for donations, i do great work and nearly every job ive had has loved me, but the burnout from the lack of food and constant working is making it harder by the day. i cant even fall asleep at night from the stress, which is making everything worse and less managable. its hard to stay positive and to not feel like im doomed because of my awful parents, and the garbage wages i am recieving and have recieved. it feels like the world is punishing me just for existing most days. do you know of any programs that can fiscally help me, as a sick, queer, young person whos escaped domestic violence? any way i can help to subsidize my rent and bills while i take on an apprenticeship so i can make more money? or even something that can just give me a little in the bank for whatever emergency comes up next? 
i have an amazing partner who i love who is doing his best to help me but he is also chronically ill (his illness is different and less prone to barring him from work) and while he makes more money than me its not a large enough margin for me to stop working for school. what do i do? how do you fix your life when your parents have sabotaged you from the very start? i want so badly to do better, i know i can if i can just go somewhere with my life, i want to stop being so burnt out, and commit to a career or education that will help me free myself from poverty. my public school was absurdly overpopulated and neglectful of ""problem kids"" like me, so my grades were awful despite my efforts, which virtually rules out scholarships and college. i really think becoming a tattoo artist is my best bet right now, ive wanted to be one for years, art is the only thing im good at, and ive found someone who is interested in my work, and i know its a trade i can manage with my condition since its not hard labor or heavy lifting. ive also looked into cosmetology schools, but they are also expensive and demanding. how does a young person make it in this situation? when no one will hire me even though i am capable and just need a little boost, and a little belief in my ability from someone?  I dont know how long i can keep this up. its already been three years and the weight loss and burn out are becoming worse, and its getting so difficult just to get up and work. do you know anything that will help me? i already do side jobs and try to sell my art and photography to help me, all of my skills are in line with careers that dont often make good money. 
my luck is so terrible. please, any advice from someone whos been in similar and made it out would be amazing. i cant cut any more corners im already at the bare minimum and im still not able to suppport myself properly. what do i do? 
thank you for reading. 
jett

tl;dr ive escaped abuse and im trapped in poverty and i cant find better job options due to my heart condition, which causes me to have blood pressure drops resulting in fainting from cardio, labor, and even stress or my period. im trying to find financial aid or assistance in any form so i can get into a better position and make more money so i dont have to work myself to death. please, i need help.",28Oct2018,1

I have my undergraduate degree in Civil Engineering (want to be a structural engineer) so the job market exists pretty much anywhere. I currently live in CT, USA but lately have just been really wanting to experience something new. I'm thinking moving out west/south-west within the country would be interesting and will give me a new perspective on life and how some of the rest of the country lives. The problem is, with this excitement/desire to move there is also a lot of hesitation and fear. I've never lived anywhere other than CT for more than 4 months, and will be leaving behind everything and everybody I know. It's pretty much guaranteed that regardless of where I move I won't know anyone there and will be starting brand new.

I don't have too many friends left in CT and although it would be nice to be around my family, we're not really so close that it's a driving force for me to stay. I'm just worried about leaving everything I know. What if I hate where I move? How do I narrow down where to look to move? Every place I look has such mixed reviews on whether it's a good place to live or not. How do I know what a good or bad decision is?

Since then she’s been trying to guilt me into taking her back, casually mentioning her want to self harm, and even mentioned something I didn’t know: she has attacked her siblings before and she wants to actually murder her parents. She hates my brothers with a passion, and wants to harm her classmates. I’m the only one that she’s not violent towards, but she’s still *super* inappropriate towards me with the jokes and the questions and suggestions.

1) If I do this there’s a chance she’ll hurt herself or others
2) I’m super dependent on our friendship, to the point that if I don’t talk to her for a day I get majorly depressed and upset.

A couple of months ago my partner told me he wanted to be single. He wasnt happy with his current life and wanted to change his lifestyle. He wasnt happy being unemployed and he wanted to do some travelling etc.

We lived together, so it made it harder. 1 day later, my flatmate breaks the news that shes decided to break up with her fiance. What I wasnt prepared for was my ex partner admitting he liked her 1 day later, as he advised me he was planning on having sex with her when it was possible, shed already told him the same. It was literally a month of watching him ask her out to do things with him all the time (when he hadnt taken me on a date in over 3 months), them just disappearing together for hours on end, hugging her in bed and on the couch, just being there for her emotionally and picking her over me. It killed me. I tried to tell him it hurt me but he said he ""couldnt help it"" or he broke up with me so that ""he wouldnt have to worry about my feelings"". He never had sex with her.

I know that you can never end a relationship in the right timing - but I was battling a lot of shit during that period. I felt like the timing couldnt have been better.

Not only that, but, I felt like him liking her was a joke because my flatmate would always talk about how much my ex liked her in front of everyone and make little jokes about her ""two blonde boys"".

We even watched a very sexual movie all together in which my flatmate apparently told my partner she thinks of the two guys in it as him and my other flatmate.

To make matters worse, our whole flat had planned a trip to India, and he decided it wouldnt be a good idea for me to go because of how awkward the situation was so my flights were cancelled.

He changed his mind recently and decided he did want to be with me and he made a real stupid decision. Explained he may have unrightfully blamed me for his unhappy lifestyle right now and he does love me.

Hes been trying to make it work and has stopped talking to this girl as much as I have a lot of issues with them talking. However, hes still going to India with her. She now is dating our other flatmate.

I had a best friend of six years, they were one of the only people who I shared how terrible my home life was and how it made me feel. We could relate to one another because they were also going through a unfortunate events in their life so we could talk about how we felt and understand. We would hang out all the time, very comfortable with one another. While in high school I was tormented by girls because they were upset that I was dating someone they liked, death threats and the such. During that whole time I always spoke to my friend about it, they understood how much I was going through.

Well around a year ago we started to grow apart. It was the standard just being so busy trying to figure out what we were  going to do now that we had graduated growing apart or so I had thought. We started hanging out again  but I always felt like I was the third person even though I was the one who asked him to come hang out. But I'd always end up being excluded. It had got to such an extent it felt like it had been done on purpose, as if he was treating me like I didn't belong. 

My boyfriend and him had a falling out, I had no idea why because I didn't want to involve myself barely knowing what had caused it. Eventuality we stopped talking for a few months due to my boyfriend and his friendship ending. I decided I had enough of the silent treatment since during this time I tried talking to my friend trying to hang out but didn't try too much since they may have been upset. I sent them a text because I knew they always read their text, m text goes as follows,

""Hey, want to go to the beach and hang out?""

they didn't reply, so I sent another.

""If you don't want to be my friend anymore, that's fine I understand but just tell me that's what you want.""

This got a reply, his response came to how he couldn't trust me or my boyfriend anymore because of him feeling used and how he felt I didn't care about him. He kept saying I did something wrong but wouldn't tell me what it was, which is odd due to the fact that he has no problems telling anyone what they did wrong. I brought up the ending of my boyfriends and his friendship and he got really upset. 

He asked me what I knew about it, I told him nothing other than the fact they weren't friends anymore. He said that's really funny because it seems everyone knows but him about what happened. At this pint I was mad because what happened in their friendship does not dictate my friendship with him.  So I ask him again if we could talk about it or if he just wants our friendship to end. He blew up saying I have never changed, I'm childish, then ended promptly by saying the friendship was over forever ago. When trying to reply back to this, my text wouldn't go through as he had blocked my number at this point.

I, being upset at this point, talked to our mutual friend B about the incident because I felt hurt. During our talk I learned something I didn't know about, B slipped up and told me my boyfriend had told him that my best friend kissed him and touched him while he slept over at his house after hanging out. This was why their friendship ended but my boyfriend was so upset about the whole event he didn't even address it. he pretended to keep sleeping and then left after ""waking up"" and never spoke to him again. 

I feel so hurt over this whole ordeal because my friend used me trying to hang out with my boyfriend, pushed me out of our hang outs, then lays his hands on someone who didn't consent to it. Then has the gall to be angry at me and lie to me instead of telling me what actually happened. I understand feeling guilty but I just feel like he wasn't. I feel like I was used and lied to. 

I've somewhat moved on from the incident but I still get angry because we had been friends for so long just for them to hurt me so deeply. I don't know how to completely move on or what else to do. any advice?

34,"I have a lot of resentment towards my father. I feel like he is the main reason why I have anxiety issues. My father always had a really violent temper. He would get angry over the smallest things. When he would get angry he would yell at the top of his lungs, his eyes would turn red, etc. He has lost his temper with me numerous times. Whenever I tried to stand up to him, he would yell even louder and even physically assault me. He has called me all sorts of names like: b*tch, coward, failure, etc. He has always made me feel like I'm nothing.

Being around him and having to live with him was very stressful. I now live on my own, but all the things he did to me growing up still affects me today. I've talked to my dad about all of this, but he won't own up to what he did. He makes excuses like, ""Well you shouldn't have done this or that or else I wouldn't have got to that point.""

I admit I definitely wasn't a perfect teenager growing up, but the things my father did were very hurtful, and it's even more hurtful that he won't take responsibility for his actions.

35,"My little brother is 12, and he has a youtube channel where he uploads his Fortnite gameplay videos. (*original I know*) I was thinking about buying subs and likes for him because he uploads a video daily but of course being a little kid who plays on console with his little friends, he doesn't actually do it for subscribers. Still I think it would make him happy. I don't know why but I get weirdly sad/happy when I see him upload a video and I always comment and like them; I guess I can relate to wanting to do upload videos to Youtube when I was younger.  
Of course, sub and like bots are like very temporary and I wouldn't be doing it for every video, just once or twice, to make him be like wow, I got noticed. I'm just not sure if this is me setting up false hope or something. He is very mature for a 12 year old, but I doubt he would suspect a sub bot and I wouldn't tell him I did it.

36,"So my boyfriend and I are getting pretty serious. And I have been going to college about 4 hours away from him. He has visited me multiple times, but he owns such an old and beat down car that it will break down if he tries to drive up to visit me again. During this time I decided that I hated the college that I go to, and that I wanted to be closer to home. Being at this college has brought me so much depression and sadness that it is incompressible to the people in my life back at home who are used to chatty, bubbly me. My parents aren’t too happy that I plan on switching college my freshman year after being at this college for only one semester. Anyways, since I’ve started dating my boy, he has been my rock, I’ve stayed at his house more than my own over the summer after I graduated. When not at college, I live at home with 7 other people, one of those people being my step mom who I can’t stand most of the time, and who says nasty things about me. My dad is so worried about leaving her that I never think he will do it and so he tried to make her happy by having me be like a little minion doing everything she says she wants to me to do. I am tired of not being able to have my freedom. This December I will be turning 19, and will have lived away from home for a year once I am done my freshman year of college. My boyfriend and I decided that we want to move in together this summer, but the problem is, his mom is struggling after a super messy divorce and so if we were to move in together, I would move into his house with him and his mother and younger brother. They treat me like family already. I am completely okay with this and would love to move in with him, even if I have to move into his house with his family. But how should I tell my parents? Will they be offended/ against the idea of me moving in with my boyfriend if they knew it was into his house with the rest of his family? Im afraid my family is going to think I’m moving in with his family simply because I don’t feel comfortable at home. While it is true, I feel EXTREMELY uncomfortable at my actual home, I’m not trying to move in with my boyfriends family and him to spite my parents, I’m doing it because I simply want to move in with my boyfriend because I want to spend the rest of my life with him, but he is currently helping his mother care for the house and his brother after the divorce.

39,"I feel so behind in life (work, school, relationships, etc) and I’m constantly beating myself up over it which in turn, makes me even more anxious about life in general. I feel unequipped to handle being an adult and it makes me really sad. I generally feel like a positive and passionate person- I’m an artist and I’m good at it and I love what I do. But when it comes to big life expectations I feel I fall short:

I’m 26 and I’ve been in college for eight years with no degree to show (I fucked around in community college because I knew I wanted to go to art school but my parents wouldn’t let me so I didn’t try, and I failed a ton of classes. I’m now in art school and basically had to start over, was two semesters from graduating, got diagnosed with brain cancer, had brain surgery and had to take a year off to recover, now I graduate in April but don’t even really want to anymore because all I want to do is work and make money, which leads me to my next issue...).

I solely live off of my parents financially and I hate it because I’ve worked and been financially independent in previous years (which was another reason I failed so many community college classes), but I know that I’m not capable of working and doing well in school at the same time. It kills me because a ton of people do it just fine but due to complications during my surgery, my ability to multitask and concentrate has been severely disrupted (I had to do a year of speech therapy just to get to where I am now). All of this sounds like an excuse that I tell myself but I’m still learning to cope with what I went through.  

I’ve had a major set back in life and I’m beating myself up over it, but I also can’t shake the feeling that maybe I’d be this much of a loser even if I hadn’t been diagnosed. 

I guess I’m just looking for validation and/or a kick in the pants and/or life advice.

40,"I (16) M have a major crush on my ""best friend"" (16) F, let's call her ""Bell""

&amp;#x200B;

The story starts here. Back in 2016 spring, I had a crush on another girl (we'll call her Grace) and it boosted my confidence a lot, and so I talked to more people during that time. While I was making new friends, I stumbled across Bell and we talked a lot online (she goes to my school, same grade). A few days later, I start hanging out with her group that's consists of 4 people. As I talked more to Bell, we became bestfriends, because we always had each others back and we always had fun. Of course, during the time that I hung out with her, people assumed that I liked her because I suddenly joined her group which makes sense. But I never thought of her in that way, and so I kept on denying it. The year after, we were in year 10, and we haven't talked much in the holidays because I was a bit of a nerd (played games with friends). On the first 5 weeks of school, we still hung out, but I felt kind of jealous because I felt like she wanted to talk to one of my friends who were in the group, and I didn't get that much attention from her. After a few days, I asked myself, why I felt jealous that she gave almost all of her attention on Friend A, and that she didn't sound interested in talking to me. And so, I thought that I liked her. After thinking about it more, I realised that I had a crush on her, but I felt it was wrong as we were best friends and I didn't want to ruin our friendship.

&amp;#x200B;

A week later, she realizes that I don't talk to her much anymore, and asks me online, why I don't talk to her anymore. And I told her that I couldn't tell her because of personal reasons, but she kept asking and said this, ""if you don't tell me, then that proves that we're not truly friends at all."" And so I told her that I had feelings for her, and she said she was fine with it and told me to hang out even if I like her, because apparently, Friend B in our group liked her in the past and still hung out with her. At some point during the convo, I told her to hate me because it'll help me get over her, which was pretty dumb of me (and a bit dramatic).

&amp;#x200B;

I started to pick up basketball, because she usually hung around the area where nearly everyone in our cohort are. So I played basketball so that I could get over her better as I'm not seeing her during the breaks/recess. This kind of pulled our friendship apart as I didn't talk to her anymore at all, and made new friends down at the basketball courts at our school. I'm pretty insecure at this point which means I have no confidence

&amp;#x200B;

A year later, we get retreat (basically camp, but you talk about life.) And I tried to strike a convo at camp, which went pretty okay (was happy af not gonna lie). While we were on camp/retreat, we had to write notes to the people that we wanted to write it to, and then when we were finished with the notes, we would have to put in that specific person's folder. I wrote about Bell, and surprisingly wrote about me. And hugged me when she received mine (gotta be the best day, lol). Btw we looked at each other a lot during camp (but I bet that I means nothing). After camp, we started to talk more, but only sometimes (1-3 every fortnight, which is probably bad).

&amp;#x200B;

I barely go to parties, because they're always out of my reach, like they're so far away from my house and I'm scared of trains. But I went to a party this one time with my friend (his mum was our uber, btw Bell didn't go to the party). And during the party, I was in the shed which was pretty cool because there was a couch and a ps4 (video games). I hung out there just to contemplate about what was going on with my life, while everyone was swimming. While I was thinking and listening to music, my friend (isn't apart of the group, and he catches the bus with me) came into the garage to see how I was going, and complemented me a lot for some reason, probably because I wasn't drinking and everyone was. While we were talking, he said this ""you know Bell has a thing for you."" And I was quite surprised, and when I was gonna ask him for more information, some other guy interrupted and asked him something else, and then left. It gave me a little ego boost, but I wasn't sure what he meant by ""a thing"", so I messaged him on facebook, but he left me on seen, so I left it at that, so that he didn't find it suspicious, because I didn't want people knowing that I liked Bell. Bell and I talk more nowadays. At this point, I don't know what to do.",28Oct2018,1

Now I might be jumping the gun a little because after all it is my first semester, but I really don’t see myself studying anything else (and making it financially). 

At the same time, the military has been coming back into my mind, specially after reading all these military themed books I like. 

I feel like I’d be happier in the military, but at the same time the only thing I don’t like about college is my major, everything else I enjoy.

47,"I can't exactly cut ties with her either. That would require me to cut ties with my entire friend group. 

So here is the deal. Me and her ""dated"" in middle school. I was an absolute fucking horrible person then. I treated her like shit. This caused her to get really depressed and attempt suicide. She failed (thank god) and we stopped talking. She started dating another guy, who verbally abused her constantly (I ignored her and talked down to her. I regret this more than anything I've ever done). He constantly called her a slut and whatnot and was so controlling of her (she wasnt allowed to have any friends basically).

After she broke up with him we started talking again. We were in the same friend group, most of them didnt know how terrible i was, and we talked again. This was a little over a year ago. We started actually getting to know each other. Having very personal and intimate conversations with each other, I wasnt as much of a dick and stopped ignoring her, and overall my favorite part of those days was talking to her. We would stay in skype calls and talk for as long as she would let me, and i would keep her up.  Now i realized now that i was awful before, and i enjoyed this relationship a lot. In my mind, we were a thing, and i didnt know i felt like that. But she kept asking me if we would be together again. I said no, because i didnt want her to deal with me again, and i didnt want to ruin the relationship we had. 

Now this was around homecoming. I had forgotten about me telling her no, and figured since we would be going as a friend group, us both single, I could invite her to dance or somethin after we got there. Well my best friend at the time asked her out first. I was heartbroken. I felt betrayed, and I broke down into tears everytime I saw them together. A week into them dating, and a few days before homecoming, we are hanging out and its fine, until they are making out CONSTANTLY. I excused myself to go to the bathroom like 5 times either to dry my eyes, talk to myself in the mirror, or hit myself because I fucked up so badly.

The day after that I told them both I couldnt be around them. They didnt know why. But I said it and blocked them from social media shortly thereafter. I went back and read the chatlogs me and her had, and holy shit, I cant even describe to you how bad they were. She was so excited to be in a relationship. She thought she had somebody specal. She genuinely loved me. And i just ignored her, and didnt care because I found her annoying. I was set up with her by my best friend (same one that asked her out later, and same one that said he wasnt interested in her). I have felt like a fucking monster since i reread those. I cant believe i said those things even though i remember it. After reading almost all of those chatlogs, and using it as reasons to hate and hurt myself, I sent her a very long apology. I apologized for individual events, and just couldnt say i was sorry enough. I still cant. There is nothing i could do to make up for it. I still went ahead and stopped talking to her and avoided both of them in school. Now, I was still trying to talk to my best friend this whole time, but he had ghosted me for 9 months, until very recently, assumedly because he knew how i treated her.

I added her back earlier this spring. Maybe still winter. She accepted my invite, but seemed genuinely scared of letting me back into her life. I genuinely think I love her and I dont know why. Eventually she added me back on discord, told me her relationship with my best friend wasnt going so well, and that he happened to be controlling too even if he was still trying his best to make her happy, and she just didnt want to be with him anymore. Ive told her many times what I think of her, before and after she broke up with him. She is an amazing person who had an absolutely shitty childhood with abusive family members and now lives with other relatives who are still inconsiderate. I honestly would do anything for her. Everytime she is sad i feel sad. I want to give her a hug and never let go, i want to make up for all the things i did to her, even though she says she forgives me. I want to make her happy. But i dont know if i can. She has feelings for her best friend (a guy who shares a first name with who she just ended a relationship with and a birthday with me). He has feelings back too, but she is waiting out being single for a while to let herself get a grip on things. Everytime she tells me how this guy takes all of her pain away, or describes the things he does for her or how they feel about each other, she describes the things i wish i could do for her and how i feel about her perfectly. I want her to be happy, but i feel the need to protect her since she had a string of bad relationships and is still hurting from the recent one. I want her to go date this guy when she is ready, even though i wish we could be together i know she doesnt like me like that amymore. I want to be her friend at the very least. I couldnt live with myself if i left her again. But i dont know how to move on. I dont know how to feel this way for another girl. I can only imagine myself with her. Nobody else was willing to talk to me where she was, and she experienced my awfulness the worst out of anybody. I just want to move on. I feel horrible that everytime i see her talk about how happy she is i feel jealous that it isnt because of me, because everything she says this guy does to make her happy are things im trying to do or am doing.

Obviously I’m not pressuring her or forcing her or doing it myself because it’s not my place, but she seems committed to struggling to be a perfect child (is there even such a thing?) and I’m afraid she’s secretly placing blame on herself. As far as I know, her mom has been like that to the family since she was young and there’s no change in sight. There have been a few times where her mom didn’t know I was in the house/the phone was on speaker so she’s been pretty bad to the family in front of me, but she always acts like it never happened. Even when she knows I’m there she tries to discreetly antagonize them like I won’t notice. What do I do? What should she do? She’s such a nice person, to everyone, and it really pisses me off that she has to deal with such massive amounts of bullshit. I don’t know how to help her and that pisses me off even more. I’m sorry if there’s bad grammar in advance. ",28Oct2018,1

64,"Hello buddies, former incel here !

I  ended an 8 years relashionship due to shared mistakes 4 months ago.

I do not dwell on that relashionship, i dwell on the first woman i ever met 11 years ago, when i was 20. This girl wasn't single when i met her, but we still had a brief affair, which was my first sexual encounter, for a  summer.

Thanks to shared accointances, we crossed paths again 5 years later, this time I was the one who wasn't single, but we still had an affair during 1 year.

Now, 11 years after our first encounter, and while i'm single but she's now married, I just can't shake the feeling that i will never meet someone to ""click"" instantly with again. I don't want to ""settle"" with someone, i want someone who would make me fall in love after 15 minutes of chatter and laughter. 

I know that i probably fantasize about this because we couldn't put our love to trial but still, i never felt such a conection with anyone so soon.

&amp;#x200B;

How do i get ready to fall completely in love again ?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR : after an 8 year relashionship and 4 months of dating, i still love the first girl i slept with 11 years ago.

65,"I'm not sure where to really start this one. I guess I should start by saying I feel helpless in the situation; like I should be doing more, but I can't.

My parents (stepmom &amp; dad), after a few years, never really got along. They're very different people. Two different people with two different ways of thinking. It used to be that they'd fight/scream every other night, but now they just seem to bottle up their feelings, like a volcano preparing to erupt.

Growing up, I could never force myself to ignore it, I always had to listen, which probably wasn't a bright idea. I still feel like I need to listen. I was never sure why, but I think it's to protect my stepmom, not physically (I hope), but more so verbally. Though I've never actually had to butt in.

Lately though, things have been getting worse, and because of it, is making me depressed because I have no control. 

The first odd thing I noticed was my dad acting strange. He'd be out in the garage very late at night with the lights off, and when I'd walk out, he'd be behind a car, very quickly saying he was ""looking for something"". Following those events, he'd come inside, and he just felt different. His personality was different, and he always seemed hungry afterwards. At first I suspected something like weed, but I never smelled it. Now I fear it's something else.

Recently we moved into a small condo, and his escape spots seem to by the outside porch, with the blinds closed at night, or in the bathroom, for a strange amount of time.

My parents are building a house right now, and my dad always gets angry very quickly about things that stress him out, and so lately he's become very distant, and not caring. I'll try and talk to him and it's clear he wants no part in the conversation. So I stopped talking to him unless he talks to me.

As for another issue, both my parents drink. My stepmom will drink a lot every night. On a typical night, she'll start drinking wine at around 5pm and I'll come downstairs at 12am and she'll still be drinking, clearly under the influence and clearly a different person; irritated easily, mind not thinking logically. I've talked to her about it, but it always falls back to me talking to her, but not my dad. And she's right, I don't talk to my dad about it, because I'm afraid he'll just get upset or ignore it, so I just talk to my stepmom about it. That doesn't make it right...

We'll go through one of those boxes of wine that says it holds three bottles in about two nights, and a large case of canned beer in four. On really bad nights I'll see around 9 cans of beer in the trash that my dad had drank. My stepmom sticks to wine usually, but if she has none, she'll drink whatever beer is around. 

Writing this all out, it sort of seems worse than it appears to me, but maybe I'm just used to it. 

I have two little sisters, who I really love, and thankfully they haven't been affected by this whole ordeal, or so I know of. One of my sisters suffers from anxiety (as I did as a child &amp; kind if still do). She's like my best friend, and I try to talk to her and help her as much as I can.

Sometimes I think it's not right for my parents to drink as much alcohol as they do while having parental responsibilities. And my stepmom is definitely more at fault for that than my dad. It usually gets worse when he leaves for a trip. She'll drink a lot more and either fall asleep or stay up drinking, leaving my sisters to stay awake.  Hasn't happened for a while, but my dad leaves for a ten day trip tomorrow, and I know it's bound to happen and I just don't know what to do.

I'm a college student. I live with my parents because it saves me money. Sometimes I wish I could escape and live my life, but I'm too worried about my stepmom and sisters. Don't get me wrong, I love my dad too, we just have never had a great relationship. He never handled my anxiety well, and I don't think the relationship will ever heal completely.

Everyone in our house seems to just tolerate one another. I get along with my stepmom when she's not drinking, and usually my sisters, (except the sassy one sometimes). And again, my relationship with my dad is not great, I wish it was better, but I can't do anything about it. He comes home from work, sits on the couch, grouches at small sounds and inconveniences and then goes to sleep.

We're not a family anymore, just housemates waiting to explode. It's only a matter of time before one of us freaks out. I'm internally freaking out almost all the time. I don't want to leave though, I can't leave my sisters and stepmom, I care too much, but in a couple of years I'll NEED to move on and live my life, I need a job, I need a home, and I know I shouldn't let my family stop me from getting that, I just feel lost.

Sorry this ran on for so long, I didn't expect it to.

Thanks if you read all of this. I appreciate it and any advice you have.",28Oct2018,1
66,"Long story ahead y’all! Any and all advice is welcome because I really need some help on what to do. Also- I’m on mobile so if the formatting on this is messed up I’m sorry!

Okay, so my before my dad was married to my mom, he was married his high school sweetheart, Pam. They had two boys (my half brothers) Paul and Neil. My dad divorced Pam when the boys were 5 and 3 after many attempts at healing his very, very dysfunctional relationship. 

My mom and dad had been really close friends and had kind of been romantically involved with each other in college. After my dad was divorced, he got in contact with my mom. They started seeing each other again, and my mom was around Paul and Neil a lot because of this. My mom and dad eventually got married, and soon after had my other brother, Erik. My mom helped raise Paul and Neil with my dad as if they were her own. 

My mom and dad moved to South Carolina from their home in Kansas for my dad’s job, and it put an extreme strain on the family. Now, Pam was very petty. Paul usually would choose to stay with my dad and mom when he was given the choice, and because of this Pam treated Paul like shit (and still does to this day). Neil, on the other hand saw how Pam treated Paul, and he would often choose to stay with her because of this. 

I’ve read almost all of the court documents from  the multiple times my dad had to deal with Pam and her pettiness. She would say that my dad was a drunk and would beat Paul and Neil, yadda yadda yadda shit like that. She actually tried to say that Paul tried to commit suicide and tried to have him put in a treatment facility. Over the years, Neil never was happy with anything that my parents did and was very hurtful to them despite them bending over backwards for him. 

My mom and dad eventually moved to Oklahoma, and then I came into the picture. In 2009, my dad passed away. I was 11. Even though Paul, Erik, my mom, and I were all in Oklahoma, Neil threw a bitch fit and wanted my dad to be buried in Kansas where he was (where my dad was from). My dad ended up being buried here, though. Paul and Erik made the final decision on that, and they both told Neil that. Ever since then, Neil has completely written my mom off.

Even though Paul and Neil are technically my half brothers, they are my BROTHERS. And they have been loved by my mom, Erik, and I as if there was no difference. Paul calls my mom his mom, and treats her as such. Neil, on the other hand, after being manipulated by Pam all these years refuses to acknowledge my mom. Neil got married in April and did not invite my mom, even though Erik and I were both in the wedding. 

Neil is not involved in my life a lot, and it’s not that that upsets me. It’s the way he is a complete dick to my mom, although my mom has raised him and has always shown him grace and love. Neither Paul or Erik will call him on it because “there’s no changing Neil.” Which I think is BULLSHIT. 

My mom was diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer in 2016, and she was cancer free for about 18 months. But, it has come back. So there’s no getting rid of it, and I’m again left facing the very real possibility of losing another parent. 

Even after my mom trying to reach out to Neil soooooo many times, he wants nothing to do with her. I know my mom loves Neil and wants to be apart of his life, but I think she has just accepted that he doesn’t want her in it. I think that Neil is being a prick, and I believe if you really love and care about someone, you should call them on their shit. 

Neil is 35 and stuck in his ways. I just don’t want my mom to die with that feeling left in her heart, and I don’t want Neil to regret how he treated her, because I know he had a hard time dealing with the regret of how he treated my dad after my dad died. 

What do I do? I’m tired of watching this bullshit.

68,"So, I've been thinking about this a lot and I decided to get advice from everyone here.

To give you all some background, me and my brothers come from a single parent household, which when we grew up strengthened our bond a lot (especially mine and my little brother's). But my older brother has, ever since he became a teenager treated me like shit and I'm tired of it.

&amp;#x200B;

We're all adults now and I feel that I have the right to cut ties with him if I feel like doing so.

&amp;#x200B;

So just to give you some insight in how he treats me (and my mom), here's some scenarios:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Me and my girlfriend (we live together) were supposed to go to my childhood home. So were my brothers so we could all meet (my older brother have never met her). We had to cancel 2 weeks in advance because stuff came up. This ended in my brother throwing a tantrum and telling my mom that my  girlfriend is a whore.
2. My mom recently had her birthday, and so my older brother decided (forced us) to pay him 100 euro each so we could buy her something nice. Just to show him that I don't put up with his bullshit anymore I went and bought my own gift for her.
3. This spring when I was on vacation with my girlfriend, he complained to my mom that all my time is put on her nowdays (which it absolutely is not). And ended up calling me various things through text when I was trying to enjoy my free weekend. 
4. He very often travels back to our home town where my mom lives, to ""surprise her"" and spend time with her. But he always ends up just going out partying like a teenager and ignoring everything my mom says, despite him being 30 years old at this point.

I'm just really fed up with his bullshit and I can't take it anymore. I cut ties with him earlier this year but my mom convinced me into talking to him again because she wants us all to get along (even though it clearly doesn't work).

Any advice from someone who's been in the same situation?

I think he has a lot of problems he needs to deal with, but I'm definitely done being his punching bag. ",28Oct2018,1

After about 2 months, brooke and terry got back together with their partners again, only problem is brooke admitted she's pregnant, and she's pretty sure it's terrys. She dosent want to tell terry cause it could fuck up the relationships they just got back in, though terry should have the right to know it could be his.

Im a high school student in junior year. I plan on going to college but my grades aren't there (mid 70s to high 80s).

In my free time I pretty much just play video games because it's too late to go hang out with people. I'm feeling lonely cause I only see people in school (a place I can't stand because I'm just stressed the whole time) and under lots of pressure from my dad to ""stop being a little girl and work harder"" while at the same time having to understand that ""school is #1 priority and it will dictate the rest of my life"".

I came to Brisbane with a friend yesterday to see Parkway Drive. I already knew that he had a wild sex drive but that didn’t really concern me until now, especially after he’s been questioning me endlessly about why I have no interest in sex at the age of 20 and that it’s apparently really unhealthy, but whatever. 
Basically, he’s been trying to pick up for the past day and a half and he’s possibly found a partner for the night but he wants to have sex with her in the hotel room that we share. He absolutely won’t listen to my objection to this which I think is totally fair considering it’s my room too, it’s booked under my name and I payed for it, and he told me to “fuck off for an hour” and that I’m “whinging over a bit of noise”. His exact words, btw. He’s already said that he’s not going to pay for his own room for the night and that I’m being inconsiderate to him. 
At this point I’m seriously considering ditching the concert and just staying in the hotel room for the night and locking him out.

77,"a bit of background. Money is a slight issue throughout this, but not it is not everything. I was born into my family at their wealthiest, but grew up at their poorest. (due to immigration and all that). We're a lot better now, but the problem for me is that I never got any of the things my younger siblings get now, and it really irks me, not even sometimes but most of the time. Growing up I never got many new toys, got to go out and have fun, little freedom or eat out etc. My parents were never the best at raising me, as I was the first, and I can see this looking back. (Check out my last post if interested?) My siblings on the other hand, have every single thing they want. 

&amp;nbsp;

After my younger brother was born in 2008, I don't recall any quality time I spent with my parents, because I was either second mothering my brother as a 9 year old or everything was all about him. I wasn't ready for the big change and I guess you could call me selfish for that. I really wanted a younger brother but with that I felt like I lost my parents love. It sucked and still does. Now, he's 9 years old and it only gets worse. He got a new laptop 2 years ago, and demands a new one everyday. apparently his laptop is now slow and crap, and he needs a better one. haha. Meanwhile, my laptop was second hand from 2012 (I got it in 2015 from my dad for high school), actually slow and laggy, and I definetley don't get to complain about getting a new one even for educational purposes. It just annoys me to see him do this in the first place, and its even worse when he won't shut up about the newest release tech. 

&amp;nbsp;

My mum takes my brother out for lunch every single weekend, and her excuse is that she has the time to and so does he. unfortunately I'm at home studying, but when I have time she won't take me anywhere. I mean, I like to go out and eat too... is that so wrong? Another example is my mum buying my brother a $14 mechanical pencil today, even though she knows well and clear we have boxes and boxes of stationery at home. (my dad works an office job so we have way too much stationery) IDK why but this just annoys me. 

&amp;nbsp;

I know I need to stop feeling so jealous and selfish, but it's so hard. I can't help thinking about how I never got to do that, and I can't go back in time. Sometimes I can't believe I'm so petty but I've just got so much anger and annoyance stuck inside myself. What can I do? ",28Oct2018,1

80,"Let's say we first had an one night stand but we got to know each other before this goes down. We hooked up two more times within a year, so it kinda developed into the fwb situation. Honestly, I caught feelings for him and I'd like to get to know him more and date him. I highly doubt that he does feel the same since he didn't drop any hint that he likes me. He still keeps in touch with me and replies to my texts asap. We had an everyday connection before one night stand, but we have on and off talks now. Sure, I can text him whenever but eh... I don't want him to think I get attached to him.

However, I start to get suspicious lately but I have no proof. Perhaps, it was just my imagination and it was a pure coincidence. Who knows? Whenever I posted anything in my snapchat story, he would post it soon like later or few days. Usually on the same day. There are some times he did post first when I wanted to post before I saw his story. It was a coincidence in my case. I notice our snapchat stories are a little bit similar. For example, I posted pictures of my fancy food from restaurants. Months ago, I posted a picture of s'mores pizza I think. Last month, he did post a picture of s'mores pizza from a different place but he rarely posted a picture of food. Perhaps, it was just a coincidence.

I admit I made my snapchat stories a little similar to his. We rarely said anything to each other but viewed each other's snapchat stories ALL time.

I am sure there were some times he tried to post snapchat story to catch my attention so he just texted me instead and talked about this. Most of time, he did not. I once tried to comment on his snap. It said he just opened and viewed. I always replied to his comments when he commented on mine though. 

I thought of confessing my feelings for him last August, but I saw his snapchat story. It was a picture of him and a woman at bar. I got pretty upset, and I also felt sick in my stomach. I felt so stupid. I decided not to confess, and I try to forget him and move on.

Two months later, we talked again...for two days in a row. It turned out he was still single since he texted me and in the next day our conversation turned to sex. This time, I didn't drop a hint that I want to do it with him again or whatever but I still told him what I liked what he did to me. After the last time we talked, another day I posted something in my snapchat story and he didn't view my snapchat story at all. When it was 23 hours old, he did view before it was gone. Yesterday, I posted something in my snapchat story then I noticed that he also posted hours before me. Later, I added more. I notice that he did not view my story at all like he was always one of first people who viewed my story.... The first snaps were gone in 24 hours, and he still did not view my last snaps. Then they were gone.

Tonight, I accidentally took a picture of my keyboard and table and posted it on snapchat. I deleted it, and then a little later I noticed that he posted something. It was a small picture of someone drinking, but it was hard to see. I was busy talkng to someone else, and I didn't want to view his story. Then he deleted it afterward. Was it really a coincidence?? Was he really playing games or trying to get my attention?? He's 37... I am 27 btw, and I have no dating experience. I don't know about guys so much.

I know I have to confess my feelings for him, but another part of me doesn't want to because I'm still hurt by the picture of him and a woman at bar from 2 months ago. Yeah, I'm in a fucking complicated fwb situation.",28Oct2018,1

Basically, if I graduate as my current grades stand, I'm screwed. While I tried my best, my chem and genetics classes killed my gpa. The advisory center told me it was fine since ""because it is such a good university, employers understand how rigorous the classes are...' I recently met up with a professor who helps students get into med school, etc She helped me to see how screwed I was and.... 

Now, I have an appointment on Monday with an adviser at the business school and I'm going to beg for mercy to get a business degree despite the fact that have the credits to graduate. With my wildlife/biology background from my prior major, I thought a business major with some emphasis on organizational behavior would tie together really well to ACTUALLY get a good job after school.  Does anybody know of any resources I could look at to help which direction I should pursue at business school? or things I should include when trying to persuade the adviser to take a chance on me? or people who have successful careers tied into business?

I started a minor in nonprofit management and successfully completed 2 internships tied to it with a great GPA. A professor recommended me to go to our business school and see if I could switch majors or double major. Business is always something I've enjoyed and I was going to take a beginning entrepreneurship class next semester just for fun! 

I already have taken accounting and other prereqs and have been very successful. I figure if I can do well in business, employers prob won't care about my previous bio grades....

I’m the youngest (23M). I moved from ruralcoservativecollegetownsburg to a midwestern metropolis. My parents and siblings all live in the same city and I moved away for work. I have an older sibling who’s engaged and another in a long term relationship. I barely dated between working through college. And now that I’m graduated and should have the time I feel as though my family time is taking away from that. I also have only made a couple friends in the year and half since I moved away. 

I love my new home. The arts, jobs, diversity, entertainment, and public amenities are incredible. I want to plant my roots here, but feel like it won’t happen because I spend my free time flying right back to my family. I was homesick for 6ish months, but now I’m getting very comfortable.

101,"I am 17 years old and Ive gone to four or five different schools in two states in my life. Ive never drank, smoked, snuck out, or done any teenage rebellion things. I dont even swear for crying out loud. One thing ive noticed in the many schools ive gone to is that i always seem to be falling behind everyone else socially. It was minor things in elementary school but it really ramped up once i got into high school. It used to be everyone was hanging out outside of school or had the newest videogame or pokemon cards while i had never even considered the concept of hanging with my friends outside of school and my family couldnt afford a videogame console and i wasnt allowed to play pokemon (religious family). I used to not mind because i thought that the kids who did have those things were just the lucky few. But as time progressed through high school, other kids would do things like sneak out, host parties, drink, do weed, smoke, some kids were even losing their virginity. But now that Im halfway through my senior year, and i still havent done any of those things, i cant shake the feeling like im falling behind my generation. Like theres something im missing out on thats keeping me from being on the same page as everyone else. I know that i shouldnt be doing those things because their unhealthy and/or would get me in massive amounts of trouble, but that thought of being delayed is still in the back of my mind. 

I tried talking to my parents about this and mostly what i got is ""well i dont know what to tell you other than if we catch you doing those things youll get the belt okay?""  So they werent much help. 

Because of this ""vaccuum"" in my life, i never go out with other kids my age AT ALL. it used to be because my parents simply wouldnt let me out of their sight at all and they wouldnt let me hang out with anyone when i was younger, but now that i can drive myself with my own car and license, instead i spend 35 percent of my time at school, 35 percent at work, 30 percent at church, and the few hours of free time i do have are all much too late at night while im working on homework. But because of that, i tell myself ""i dont have time to go out with friends because i have work/church/homework"" i could simply ask for time off from work or school, but its been like this for so long that it just doesnt seem to make sense to me. 


(Sidenote: i have been public schooled, private schooled, Christian schooled, homeschooled, you name it. It doesnt matter what school i go to, im still behind everyone else.)

(Sidenote pt. 2: Im 17 now and Im STILL not allowed to play/watch Pokemon and i still dont have a console.)

TL:DR, Everyone i know thats either my age or younger has done teenage rebelious things in their life (drank, smoke, snuck out, etc.) And the fact that i havent done any of those things makes me feel like im falling behind everyone else socially.

102,"I recently starting working about a month ago but this problem has been with me since forever. I can't seem to be able to get a handle on how to cope with stress. Instead of taking something as an exciting challenge, I worry about not doing a great job because I'm lacking in physical skills and knowledge. It sucks because I get so overwhelmed that I freeze sometimes and end up doing not such a great job simply because I wanted to do it well.

I've tried doing breathing exercises and coaching myself through it but my mind always tends to gravitate towards negative thinking.

The problem is that most of the people who would call him to do work know he stopped doing it and have moved on.

Now I'm stuck trying to find work and I'm not sure how to best do it. The professionals in the field I have talked to have all basically said, ""I don't know. I've been doing it for so long people just call me all the time"". This isn't helpful to me. I've tried making a Facebook page and advertising through that, and I get good digital results, but no leads. I've gotten some big jobs from people just referring me, but I want/need to work full time, or as close to that as possible, and I don't know the best solution.

112,"My fiancé was in a subway station bombing a few years ago.  Most of the people around her died, but she was saved due to the fact that the bomb was on the other side of a pillar so the shrapnel did not hit her.  She remembers only a few small things from the event and that day; bright light, climbing over bodies, black smoke, coughing up soot. She is the strongest person I know mentally. 

So after it happened, of course the government offered counseling, medical care, payouts, etc. but she refused everything and just focused on moving forward.  She rarely speaks about it, but has no real outward signs of panic when she does.  She talks about it like an event that happened to someone else with no real emotion.  She even went so far as to bring me to the station where you can clearly see where old meets new and where a memorial was built, and we took the subway like it was no big deal

I truly think she would be content living with this as a deeply repressed memory.  The problem is that I am a combat medic veteran and not nearly as mentally strong as she is; I have my demons. She wants so badly to support me and truly believes that I should be able to share the details of my own trauma, and she very much so wants to share her own experience, but she cannot recall any specifics. The main lingering effect of the explosion is an extreme aversion to even the slight mention of blood. This makes any discussion on the topic impossible as her reaction is visceral and profound.

So she has been toying with the idea of finally seeking counseling. I know that I have no bearing on her decision and only want to support her in whatever she chooses. But we are both worried that counseling could uncover repressed memories and have a severe affect on her mentally.

Does anyone here have any experience with this? Experienced some extreme trauma and worked with a counselor down the line?  We will both be speaking medical advice, but we figure that the wide world of reddit may have some advice that could help point us in the right direction. Thank you! ",28Oct2018,1

116,"This post is a bit long, so TL;DR at the bottom:)

Throwaway acc cause this is just too personal

A little bit of backstory... both my mom and dad were meth users before I was born (I’m 18) and continued for a while even after I was born. My father was in and out of our lives all the time, even now, so my mom pretty much raised us by herself. Now, I’d like to clarify, my mother is and was amazing. She always provided for us, we were never abused, nothing like that. I am extremely grateful for her even to this day. 

My mom got busted in 2012 for possession of meth and so when she got out she stayed clean and turned her life around. 

We moved into a new house in 2014, life was going great, mom was clean, holding down a decent job, we were all happy. One night, she sent me to get her a pair of socks out of her dresser. I picked up a lonesome sock and to my surprise, two meth pipes are stuffed in. Confused, I confronted my mom. She swore up and down she’s doing good, and that they may have been there from a few years ago and just got mixed up with everything else. I believed her and brushed it off. She seemed normal and wasn’t acting like she used to, so I brushed it off. 

Over the 2 years we lived in this house, both my sister and I found several baggies with residue, etc. My uncles wife (not calling that bitch my aunt) was a super tweak. She was always at our house, so we often assumed the shit was hers. 

After those two years, we had to pack up and find a new place again because our landlord decided  to tear down the house and build his new one on the property. I was home alone packing the rest of our shit, and when I went into the kitchen, I found a pink meth pipe in the sink. This time, I was pissed. I thought “who the fuck would leave their fucking drugs in the sink?!” I confronted her, and again, she swore it wasn’t hers. She said it may have been her ex boyfriend’s, who I’ll call Jordan. Jordan is a really good friend of my mom’s, even now, and played a big part in helping her raise me and my siblings. They both did drugs together, but they both got clean eventually. I never suspected Jordan was back on drugs, he was doing good, he got his daughter back and didn’t act the way he did before when he was using. The entire time she apologized and swore to me it wasn’t hers, I finally just told her “okay” and dropped it. I didn’t talk about it again after that. 

We temporarily moved into my grandmas house, and eventually got a bigger house for all of us. 

Now, this is the part I really wanted to get into. Multiple times both my sister and I have found hidden pipes, baggies, etc, and what do ya know, my mom swears they’re not hers and now actually gets pissed saying “I’m so sick of being accused of shit I don’t do, everyone thinks I’m on drugs,” and so on. Now when I find shit, (I still do every now and then, especially if I’m snooping) I don’t say anything about it. I already know the outcome, and I usually don’t want to deal with the same shit all the time. 

Not only am I finding drugs around the house, but she’s been hanging around obvious tweakers, known drug users (people in and out of jail all the fucking time, we live in a super small town, everyone knows who’s in jail😂) and she’ll leave for hours on end. Sometimes she won’t come home till like 3 am. My sister and I are older and we don’t need babysitter, so it’s not a big deal she’s gone, but it’s the whole point. 

She and my uncle are also getting pretty heavy into gambling. My uncle just recently blew $3,000 in two weeks, all to gambling. Not even kidding. Three thousand fucking dollars. Anyways, my mom isn’t this extreme, but she will literally spend her last $20 on the slots. I’ve talked to her about this, approached her with an open mind and asked why she would spend her last $20 that could have been for food or something on the machines. She was much more open about this, unlike when I talk to her about drugs. 

There’s times she will be flat broke (she’s not working atm, got laid off) and then all of a sudden have $100 within hours. Maybe I’m overthinking this, but where the fuck does she get money so quickly? With how much money they blow on gambling, how are we still functioning? 

With all of that being said, I want to talk to her. I want her to be honest with me. I’m so scared she’s gonna get busted again, and honestly she’s worked so hard to get her reputation back up, I’d hate for her name to be on the roster again for everyone to see. I’m just worried about her, some of the people she fucks around with are so sketchy. I just want to know how to approach this situation. Should I involve my sister? What do I even say? I’m worried she’s just gonna pull the whole “it’s not mine” bullshit I’ve heard a thousand times before. 

If you read all of this, thank you. I know there was quite a bit to read, but I’m on a plane and got a few hours to kill. :) also, sorry if there’s some typos, etc. I’m on my phone 

TL;DR: I have suspicions my mom is back on drugs. How do I talk to her about these suspicions ?

I am almost 6 months clean from self harm so I am doing very well (especially with the shit they put us through). They tell her I will manipulate her with threats of harming myself if she does not comply with my ""demands"".  She lives with her parents and can't afford to move out on her own (we are not moving in together for personal reasons).

&amp;#x200B;

She works about 20 hours a week while also going to college. I am working full time while also going to college. We have been seeing each other for a few hours on the weekends and while we are at school a few days throughout the week. I have my medical bills from my therapist (that I no longer speak with) that I am still paying off. Although I am financially well I believe it stresses her out with me paying for college and my therapist out of pocket. Therefore she is reluctant to take financial help from me this early in a relationship.  Which obviously makes sense because we are a fairly new couple. But I would love to help her, help her. Where can we look to find her cheap living space? A cheap, reliable car (as well as insurance)? A cheap phone plan with as little expense as possible as she can use wifi for most things she needs. Lastly where can we find her some extra money she can make. 

&amp;#x200B;

She has talked about taking a break from school next semester to work more so she can move out because of her parents constantly causing her to be unhappy. I would love to find a way to keep her in school and help her afford basic needs. I can work on cars, work construction, computers, and car audio so anywhere I could find extra income is also welcome.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not entirely sure how to ask for the help that we need. Please just give any advice that you have.

131,"Looking to pursue and gauge interest with a girl. 

How to go about that?",28Oct2018,1
132,"To preface, I got out of a 4.5 year relationship about 10 months ago (dated from 8-12 grade yeah I know). This is my first attempt at breaking back into the dating scene and I don’t want it to go poorly because I feel like that could have a bad lasting effect on me. I’m not talking about rejection specifically, I just mean that if I get rejected I want it to be because she isn’t interested, not because I’m a glungus and would seem too cocky, abrasive, cunty, etc. This fear of messing up is what’s been causing most of the apprehension.

I’ve been texting this girl from my old hs (graduated last year) for about two months. We never talked in high school. The *whole time* I’ve been talking to her I was planning to ask her out. I wanted to do it in person so I tried asking her to hang out, but it kept getting rescheduled and moved. She would initiate them too but our schedules are just so conflicting. Without giving too much info, she works at a seasonal place that will be closing next week. This’ll open up a lot of free time for her, and I was gonna use this as an opportunity to hang out and maybe pop a question then, but I don’t want to wait any longer.

For a brief time, I thought she had a thing for me, but I didn’t wanna address it until we were free to actually pursue anything with each other. But now she doesn’t act like she’s romantically interested any more, and honestly I don’t either. We used to FaceTime every day and text all the time but now it’s a little more sporadic. That’s why I don’t want to wait just one more week. I’ll lose interest and I know I’ll regret not doing anything about it. It’s been such a rollercoaster too because sometimes I feel a lot and sometimes I could not care less about what happens. So much time is being taken away from my life and productivity because of this person that may not even think of me even close to how I regard her. I just want to either hear a yes or hear a no and get it over with. I’m gonna have to do it over the phone/text sometime soon. Maybe even tomorrow. I’m so ready to get it over with that I think I would just tell her bluntly the first moment she interacts with me. Like, if she messages “how are you”, then I’ll message back “I have feelings for you and want to take you on a date when you’re free”.

Should I wait it out one week? I only ask because I feel like it’d be weird to schedule a romantic date a week in advance and try to keep conversation going every day. 

If you think I should tell her ASAP, then do I do it over the phone or text? I think she might actually respond better to text, but I think the phone is more respectable. What time of the day should I do it? What should I say? 

Sorry for coming off as really pestered or angry; this has been eating me up for a while and now that my feelings are fleeting I feel that this was all for nothing. Harden my scrotum.

5 months ago my boyfriend of 4 years broke up with me. It was the hardest thing I've had to go through, as I feel like I will always love him. I still suffer with it now.

I met this guy around 4 months ago 20M and we started dating. We met on tinder. We haven't gone to next base yet (sex) but I have met his family. I think he is lovely and everything, but something is holding me back. I'm not sure that I have completely healed from my old relationship. I lost all my friends as they were tied to my ex originally and I've been left with no one.

I think I'm clinging onto his new guy as I have nothing else, but if I put a stop to it I'll be lonely and probably never leave me house. I feel like I'm at a different stage in life, with my study nearly done etc but his would still have 2 years at uni.

People say the right one will come along in time, and something tells me thats true...but I'm hesitant because I'm introverted and may never meet anyone else and this guy might be my only shot.

I'm stuck on what to do and would appreciate some advice. Thank you.

136,"Little context before I get into anything. This is about me possibly walking away from a friend I've known for a long while. Ever since we were kids he's been an ass no matter what. Granted his dad beat him, his brothers hate him, mother's a druggie and his step father molested him. So he's got a reason to be like that at times. Also we are both 23

A few years back I stopped talking to him out right cause I honestly couldnt take the abuse. Fat jokes and saying some pretty mean shit about my weight. Constantly trying to out do me in everything, short tempered and just out right was a cocky douche bag. 

A year or so back he had a daughter and after time had past I thought since having a kid I thought that would help him grow up. I was mostly wrong. He's toned it down a bit but it's all still there. He recently just had a son so life is stressing him out I get that. But he's going back to how he use to be. 

But now he's drinking like a fish. 2-3 cases a beer every day or so. I'm not joking ether I wish I was. He spends almost 50-60$ a month on beer. I bought a bottle of Jameson for myself and he killed the whole bottle in one night without me knowing it.

Also he's starting to steal from me. First it was a flask that I got as a college present from a good friend. Now it's high quality pens (he's taken 4-5 now). 

He's someone that claims to be a badass but you say the wrong thing and he gets offended. Case and point he said during basic for para rescue they stole a helicopter and jumped out of it over a lake for fund and didn't get jail time. Or how he was gonna be the leader for a stealth mission in North Korea to save people. 

Im thinking of just walking away from him again cause I cant take it. Mind you he tries to do the world for me at times. But it's all just getting more worse. Also he's trying to force me to get a job at the IT department with the company he works for. 

I have no idea if I can talk to him and straighten this friendship out or just walk away cause. 

What do you guys think?

137,"***I’ve had my eyes on this gift for years...***

My parents gave me a gift for my college graduation, but never actually got it. 

In case it’s not clear, they told me on graduation night and never followed through with it. 

A little background the gift has to do with something I’ve been involved with for almost 2 decades. Honestly, it probably would’ve been the greatest gift I’ve ever gotten. 

So I’m really sad. I’m really bummed. 

It’s been 6 months now nothing. From time to time they make mention of it and nothing comes. 

So, here’s the thing. It’s a few parts. They “thought” it was $800 less than it is together. That caused a minor hiccup for one of my parents. One didn’t/ doesn’t care. Doesn’t even acknoledge it ever. 

Not to sound spoiled - $800 won’t kill them. It won’t. $800 won’t kill me. (I know this sounds wrong and I’m sorry to offend anyone. I’m just trying to give as accurate of a description as I can so that I can get the best feedback possible!)


***The ultimate dilemma:***  I’ve had my eyes on this for a while in fact I’m so eager I’d love to just buy it for myself. I’ve waited so long for something like this and I’m at a point where I can buy it. What’s holding me back is that I feel that it’ll be really awkward when I come home (I live with them) with the gift that they wanted to give me. 

*To be noted: I feel funny about gifts. I don’t regift. I’m appreciative of any gift.  I won’t ask no expect a gift and I will feel very uncomoftable reminding them* 

In the end though, this is one thing I actually want, one thing I’ll actually use, take care of, and finally, appreciate it. 

I’m in a position where I make enough and can buy it and would love to buy it, but I’ll feel really awkward when it arrives.

hello,  i am new to reddit, so please be nice. close  to 9 months ago my wife  and i had a beautiful baby girl. I, air craft  mechanic by trade and  youngest of my family. I suffer from depression  from my military  service, im on zoloft and trazadone, i would be on  Hydrocodone from a  back injury i got in the service, but i am not a fan  of narcotics  (different story for a different time).  Fast forward a  little a few  months,  we are fighting pretty bad and she goes to the  doctors and  gets diagnosed with postpartum depression and gets put on  medicine that  works. At this point, i am working 50+ hours a week  cleaning offroad  equipment. Things are going smoothly, but this whole 9  months i have  been asking for my wife to help show me how to take care  of our child.  My wife is the oldest of 3. I know the kid is mine because  she looks  exactly like me (the father). Now the story of the past 2  months. I had  to quit my job because i am going to school and using my  GI bill so  money is flowing in and bills are almost caught up on, but  when i  started school, by wife decides that at 3am is a perfect time to  yell  at me for not taking care of our daughter, even though i am at  school  most of the day. So i am failing classes because i cant get sleep  for  school, so i tell her that she needs to teach me HOW to take care  of  out child. every time something needs to be done, she would rather  say  nothing and then yell at me when i ask what i can be doing to help  her.  I dont play video games or am never glued to the TV. I want to be a   better father, but i cant when my wife is treating me like someone she   is dating and like a second rate father. Sorry if this is all over the   place, but the last time i ever felt this useless and shitty, i was   contemplating killing my self back in 2002 (when i was 12). Please help,   Reddit, the only place i can see is dark and alone. I can not get my   kid's schedule down because i am at school and when i get something   down, she gets older and it changes.

tl;dr  wife makes her husband (me) verge of self harm because she  would  rather fight instead of helping me. I want my wife to use her  words and  just tell me what needs to be done when i ask because i have  no clue.",28Oct2018,1

Anyway, we both had plans tonight to go to different parties. She left an hour before I did. However, before I leave I receive a call from our mother. She tells me my sis is crying and upset because the party she had planned to go to was actually yesterday night. She goes on to nudge me into tagging along with my Sis’ plan B, which is to join a cousin of ours and her bf at a basketball game. She then tells me to not mention that she told me about all this.

So my sis gets home, not looking sad but still somewhat bummed - kinda light hearted about it, but she asks me if I want to go to the game with her, knowing I’d have to cancel my plans to go.

To make identification easy, my story is going to include: Jack (20M), Ben (21M), Ken (22M), and Tommy (19M).   
Until a month ago, I was dating Jack (1.5 yr, known \~5 yr from HS). We decided to take a break for the semester, since I was so busy. We had a long distance relationship (2hr different college), and on my only free day of the week, I preferred to spend time with friends, studying, or treating myself. 

Even though I was busy, I decided to engage in an Asian club actively this semester. I look nothing like the people, but am half-Asian and can speak a dialect pretty nicely. This culture has been a big part of my identity, but I'm not the greatest at connecting with these people since they have more modern terms I don't follow, and I was bullied when I was younger for being a bit different (It's a conformist society). I met Ken in this club, who is an exchange student in America for 4 more months. He probably likes me, and has been texting me nonstop. He's a nice guy, but I feel a bit awkward, and it's hard to understand the dialect he speaks. 

Tommy is also part of this club, and studies the same major as me. While Tommy speaks the same dialect as Ken, I've been friends with him (1.5 yr) that I can ask him for stupid translations (I feel like I can be myself around him). I've had a crush on Tommy for a long time - I don't know if it's because he's nice, smart, or I'm jealous. I've 85% given up though, since I had a bf Jack at the time, and Tommy had a gf at the time (I'm not sure, but I don't think they're still dating). Tommy just went back to aforementioned Asian country for a funeral, but brought me home a gift (what does this mean? Or it might be a part of this Asian culture?), and he helps me understand class material. I've never met anyone who can explain the concepts better than him, so I can't just distance myself. I've consequently made myself a rule that I won't date anyone in my major. 

Outside my major, I met Ben in one of my classes. He also happened to be working in the same lab, and so we became good friends in the class and lab (he's the only one I talk to in both, other than my Post-doc). He's super cute, and nice- he walks me home even though my house is \~30 minutes in the opposite direction after class. It's hard to understand him since he has an accent and I generally suck at hearing, but I enjoy spending time with him, even though I still hold myself back.

Although 6 months is still far away, I don't think I'll get back together with Jack, since I don't feel the same way about him anymore. In fact, now I only feel confusion, sadness at how stupid I am in every aspect, etc... 

I'm just confused at myself, and need help figuring out what I'm thinking. Thank you!  


TLDR: Broke up with bf for 6 months. Guy 1 likes me, but only is in America for 4 months. I have a crush on Guy 2, but gave up long ago bc he studies the same major. I like Guy 3, and maybe Guy 3 like me. Confused and just ultimately lost. ",28Oct2018,1

It’s very special to me and valuable and hidden deep in my closet. My heart dropped and I look at her and ask, 
“why is my treasure box in your room?”
she replies with 
“Why is your treasure box in my room?” 
I started getting really red and just said 
“Why the fuck is it here?” 
and she goes silent for a few seconds and then says 
“Oh I needed coins for the turnpike.” 
I stood up and took the box back and led my cat out and said not to come into my room again. I’m really upset because this is the third time I’ve had issues with a roommate since I moved to college. My first one was a drug addict, the second one was a nympho and always had crazy amounts of guys over all night, and now I found out from an old friend I texted that this one is a borderline klepto. How did she know about that box? How did she know where to look? Why didn’t she even put it back. On top of that, she refuses to clean her cats litter box for almost over a month at a time and it’s unbearable to even walk into her room. That stink kills brain cells so I sometimes clean it when she’s at work. She also crashed my car a couple of weeks ago because she was stoned and asked to drive it to the grocery store and I had to pay for a new door. She’s so messy I find myself cleaning everyday just to stay sane and allow guests in my apartment. I’m just an engineering major and wanted a quiet place with no issues for a year. I know I have to confront her eventually but I’m just so tired I want to get a place alone already. I have to get locks installed in my room because this place didn’t come with any and I don’t want to live on edge every day that she’ll steal from me. What should I do?

TLDR: I walked in my roommates room and found my box of valuables. Gave a shit lie for having it. She lives in urine smell and mess. Should I move out?",28Oct2018,1

166,"Ive always been one to treat my close friends as family. From hugs to close talks many of my friends are closer to me than most of my family. Those that I am I tell them I love them when we are saying goodbye or after weve had a long chat over phone or text.

I dont know when I start telling them. It just sort of happens. I have a friend that weve known eachother for about a year now. We talk a lot but distance has kept us from ever actually meeting. The other day though we were talking and I went to say my goodbye and say I love ya but realized I had never said that to this particular friend. Im wary about just saying it because ive had friends that didnt understand that I meant it platonically. Even after explaining the friendship wasnt the same. 

So do I just ask if its okay to say it? I just dont want them to freak out and take it the wrong way. It feels slike it comes so naturally for my older friendships and family but newer friendships I have to catch myself because id rather keep the friendship than get to say a couple words.

Just looking for advice. Most Google results are for couples and saying it for the first time in their relationship which doesnt really help.me.",28Oct2018,1
168,"For most of 2018, coming to Korea was my main and only goal. Now that I'm here I'm so disillusioned, I've come to realize teaching isn't for me.

Although outside of school I've made amazing friends, I still cannot enjoy my free time because all I keep thinking off is having to teach the next day. 
As much as I want to stay positive and make it through for the next 10 months, I don't see how I'll survive. I feel so burdened every time I think of having to stand in front of uninterested, rude middle schoolers.

We have been as close as siblings for years now, and she recently turned 18. She had a loose thing with a guy for about a month and he got her pregnant. He has since stopped returning her calls, and she can’t reach him. Great guy right? She’s only about 4 weeks in, and is planning on keeping the baby. She has only told me, and doesn’t plan to tell her mother, as her mother is negligent and not the best caregiver. Her dad also isn’t in the picture. I am very concerned for her because she has barely any friends as she just moved across the country. She is not in a financial situation to raise a child, especially on her own, and I feel she doesn’t fully understand the commitment she is making by refusing any preventative measures (an abortion, adoption, etc.) and is not really facing the issue. Any advice? Also please note I know I mentioned abortion I don’t want to get into a pro life or pro choice argument, I’m really just looking for advice either way. Thank you guys! ",28Oct2018,1

After the end of my first relationship I was left feeling empty on the daily, the girl I was with cheated on me and became the person I never thought she was.

These actions have led me to feel fulfilled in becoming the best version of my self.

171,"Okay, so this happened thrsday night at the laundromat down the street from me.

I'm at the laundromat, talking to this guy I know, small talk, &amp; on the other side of the room, there she is, this young lady, dark top, bright patterned pants that are way too tight thanks to her **big** hips, ass &amp; thighs. Normally I find this kind of body type activate, but I refrain from staring, as I don't want unwanted attention.

I get the feeling I'm being watched closely by her, so I end the convo with my guy &amp; go to the other side where my notepad &amp; backpack are (in the middle of writing a song), as my clothes finish washing. Apparently she came around &amp; decided to use a dryer right behind me; didn't see her walk up, as I tuned everything out with my headphones on. 

Suddenly, I feel something wet (not dripping) hit my head (it's so embarrassing even typing this, it pisses me off), then drop to my arm before hitting the floor next to my left foot. I look down closely, &amp; it's a black pair of panties. My mind goes blank, then: **This woman just threw her WET panties at me WTF.** I was mortified. I'm sure she just got them out the washer (I hope). I just took off my head phones, turned around &amp; looked at her. She was side-eying me, apparently nervous, &amp; some little boy standing close by her, whom I assume was her son, was wide-eyed staring at me like I was about to swing on her. I was more shocked than anything else. She was too embarrassed to own up to it; I'm sure she could blatantly see how irritated I was. I just picked up my note pad, put my head phones on, readjusted my shades &amp; went to the other side while my clothes finished. She eventually came &amp; picked them up. I couldn't even write anymore, I was so distracted, so I looked down pretending to write, but all I could think was, ""this woman threw her wet panties at me...""

**Summary:**

I just would like to say that what his wife did was disgusting and going through a midlife crisis is no excuse for what she did but I went through this guys comment history and he openly admitted on reddit to say he was 36 when he slept with a 19 year old girl from a foreign country out of revenge for what his wife did to him. Honestly after finding out that my wife had cheated on me I would just divorce her instead of sleeping with a 19 year old girl especially considering he already had children with his first wife and had to set an example for him. He then got this 19 year old pregnant and then continued to pursue this 19 year old make her a second wife and had a second child and might be planing to have a third as he mentions in his posts. This person says he is trying to make his relationship with his daughter who is also now coincidentally 19 year old! But she refuses to, I don’t blame her. He seems oblivious to the pain he has caused his children, especially his daughter.

**My post:**

I just want to apologise in advance for sounding self obsessed or nasty. Just to give you a little bit of context I am 16 years old girl (turning 17) next month and Greek by ethnicity (hence the name 😉), but I live in Australia. I get complemented on my looks and regularly about my intelligence (I don’t want to sound self obsessed sorry if I do in advance), people say that I’m quite logical person in general and that I take it from my Dad (the looks as well). I just would like to say that my fear of being cheated on was not trigged by this post as I had it long before it was event created. Ever since I was a little girl (lol still am little I’m 5”1’!), I have had consent dreams about being abandoned by my family, now this takes place in a different form: My fear of being cheated on. As I believe it is also a form of abandonment. I’m not dating anyone currently as I believe I am too young. I am growing up in a semi-conservitave family and I have always believed there is no excuse (or room) in a relationship for adultery/ infidelity/ unfaithfulness/ cheating. Not because I have been taught to think that way, I just believe it is wrong. I really think deep down inside I am scared of being in a relationship because of my fear that my partner will not be faithful. I also believe that my fear stems from the fact that overtime I bring the topic of perspectives of infidelity he does not fully condemn the act of adultery the way I do and I have been led to believe (not just by this) that he may have cheated on my mother in the past or even covered for a friend. Despite the fact people may say I come across as a logical person there is not a day I don’t think about my future partner cheating on me or even worse, in the post above starting another family behind my back after I have gotten married to him. Honestly this post I read made me cry (I don’t usually cry as I am not that emotional), but this is really my biggest fear: Getting cheat on. Honestly, I regularly get worked up about this topic and I believe that in order not to prevent the event of getting cheated on that I will have to marry someone 9-12 years older than me and make sure my BMI is in the healthy but lower end of the scale and constantly provide sexual intercourse to my spouse when he needs it. So I would like to know is it normal for men in the West to cheat? Do I have to marry someone older (not rich, just older) so he will be satisfied with a younger women to prevent this event from happening? I am willing to do anything to prevent cheating from happening! I really don’t want this to destroy my relationship with my future SO as it would be completely unfair for him to deal with my issues. I don’t want to scare my SO away as I don’t wish to be overly possessive of him.

**P.s.** I would also like to add I would never consider cheating on my spouse or SO I think it is the ultimate sign of dishonour on a personal level and the greatest sign of disrespect towards your SO. Also, as you can probably tell I am a big believer in monogamy!

**Edit:** I know this post makes me sound like a nut job but I would just like to say that I am not always like this. Only on the issue of fidelity/ infidelity. Also, if you've made it this far thank you! I really do appreciate it!!!",28Oct2018,1
173,"So, when I arrived at my job on Friday afternoon, I realized I didn't have my phone. After confirming with my boyfriend it wasn't at home, I immediately retraced my steps (I walk about 15 minutes to work) and couldn't find it. I called it several times throughout my shift, and tried to gps the location, but the location feature was turned off. That night, I checked my route again, turned off all of the functions, and set it up so the screen would say ""please call \*bf's number\* if found.""

&amp;#x200B;

I had work again Saturday at 7am, and at 6, we used a function designed to make the phone make noise for 5 minutes, even if the sound is off. For about 20 minutes I retraced my steps again and couldn't see or hear anything. At this point I figured it had either been taken out of my bag at one of the crosswalks (I carelessly left the pocket unzipped), or I'd managed to drop it without hearing it fall and regardless it was with someone else now. After my shift, I got information to get a new phone, and planned to order it tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

However, around 1 am my boyfriend got a call from someone. At first the guy on the phone said his ""roommate"" had my phone, but was ""being a jerk"" so he decided to call the number on the screen out of kindness. Then he explained that actually, his roommate wanted a reward for it, because they're homeless. I explained that I'd love to get it back, but that to buy a replacement was only $20. He wanted to meet and I suggested a public place, and my bf is willing to come as well.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? I'd lose a few messages and recently added contacts, and some photos from a recent vacation that I'd really like to have, but is it worth paying someone - who may have had it this whole time - worth it? I would have offered a small amount of money if he hadn't asked, but I'm feeling suspicious now. The phone was almost immediately in someone's possession, and they would have heard all the calls and alarms, but waited almost 2 days to try to return it. It seems to me that this is a last resort to make some money after failing to sell or use it themselves. Is it worth meeting at all, even if they might give it back without payment, when I really don't know what I'm getting into? My city has a very large homeless population, and many in my area seem to suffer from poor mental health. What would you do?

&amp;#x200B;

In summary: A homeless person has my phone and wants payment for returning it. A replacement wont be expensive, but there are a few things on it I'd like to have back. Should I meet with him, and if I do, should I give him a reward?",28Oct2018,1
174,"I've recently become friends with a few people that I now ride with regularly (motorbike rides) and one of them is this girl, i'm going to call her 'Emma' to keep it annonymous as it's the most common female name according to google, who', I have started to gain some quite strong feelings for. Be warned, this is going to sound childish and bitchy as hell, but...

I've just turned 17, and Emma's turning 20 in about 2 months, yet I really like her. Like really *really* like her. We got along amazingly from the first time I spoke to her, and I could already list a good amount of cringy things I like about her, but I'll save you the effort.

We've gotten to know eachother a good amount so far, much quicker than I have really gotten to know many of my other mates considering how I'm one of the most antisocial people I know, and she's shy as hell.

In general I guess what I'm trying to ask, is what should I do? Normally I would have just run away and hide for a few weeks until the feelings pass, but I know that isn't exactly a great thing to do from experience, but I'm struggling to figure out what else I can do. I don't know if the age difference is going to pretty much cancel any chance I have with her at damn near 3 years, or if I should just ignore that and hope she would too and try to get to know her and talk to her some more.

179,"So I’m a female who lives alone. I recently moved into my apartment it has only about 5 units on each floor and its generally a safe community.

This looked like a scene from a horror movie i’ve never seen something like this in real life before, my heart dropped to the floor but i still went into the elevator. I was in shock, i didn’t know how to react so i asked her if shes ok and she didn’t answer me its pretty obvious this girl is on something. At this point the elevator door still didn’t shut and i froze up in fear, keep in mind this is at night too.

181,"I had an analysis conducted on my personality and I over-indexed on 3 traits: intelligence, ambition and laziness. I have been reading up about both, and a lot of the articles / published research on how these types of people are fits well with me.

The good thing is that one of the best professional for ""Intelligent + Ambitious + Lazy"" people is a Software Engineering, which I am already doing, hence I fit and like my job, and see myself do this forever. I do experience the issues at work ""smart"" people face e.g. jealous / insecure colleagues, competing with myself always / wanting to learn and grow, changing / questioning the fundamentals, but thankfully in this profession those are also valued. 

The problem is, my life outside of work suffers. For example:

(1) I prefer hobbies that are conducted 'alone' e.g. gym, swimming, baking only. I have tried 'more social stuff' because 'that is more normal' but I end up hating it. I have no issues conversing ""if there is a reason to"" but other than that I don't see the need to interact with another human being. 

(2) I've never been in a relationship because I get ""bored"" of the person relatively quickly (and the ones that interest me are typically visiting so again its a temporary fling). Finding someone to hook up with is easy nowadays, I am able to hold a long conversation with them too, but then after the sex I just want them to leave (not in a mean way). I went to a sex therapist who said I may be ""aromatic"", but that will suck. I believe in love, just feel I have not met someone to challenge me mentally at all (and through an app its hard to judge intelligence levels I think). I have a handful of close friends (who I have able to maintain a relationship with for years) which is consistent with the articles I have read. 

While I don't feel there is anything ""wrong"" with me, I want more out of life still (to also keep me out of being depressed). I need help and advice on how to cultivate these personality traits \*outside of work\* in a successful way so I don't waste away my personal life. Any thoughts on what I can do? ",28Oct2018,1

184,"In May I (f34) drunk kissed a colleague, a colleague (m29) due to be married in September. I pushed back in those months many times saying I wasn’t someone who would see someone who was with someone else. August he called off his wedding. His ex fiancé moved out and we agreed space to let things settle. She isn’t aware I exist and I don’t want her to be and to be hurt more.

We failed to avoid each other in September he stayed at mine for a week at one point, he said we should book a trip, which we did for December, he said he was falling in love with me.

The last two weeks all change. He invited me for the first time to his city. The week preceding he was distant and I reacted by being needy to close the gap. I went up and the moment I stepped into the house it felt like he wasn’t comfortable. The weekend veered from being lovely and him being himself to being awful - he was distant, kept the curtains drawn the whole time, ignored his mums texts asking us over, jumped when anyone knocked.

Finally Sunday I pushed him by remaining silent on a long walk - I asked him if this was how things would be. He got upset, welled up and told me he’d woken up feeling the most anxious he’d felt since university in terms of knowing what to do. I said I understood, he said he regretted not taking the break properly in September. We agreed ok let’s try a pause/break again. Sunday afternoon he was back to his normal self and I was feeling awful.

This week we’ve talked due to work and had a xonvrrsrion where I said I clarified was this a break or break up - he says break - and said he needed to understand he’d upset me.

He texts about work and to vent about that and I reply. I broke Friday and text him “I miss you don’t reply I know a break is right” - now a weekend of silence. 

I feel like I’ve been broken up with, like he doesn’t care, like I’m losing connection. But I know what he did this year was huge and also that he says he’s doing this because he likes me so it can work.

I’m not handling it well, I’ve had therapy before so am utilising every technique I have, distracting myself constantly. I’m becoming concerned I’m checking when he’s on WhatsApp and starting to feel constantly like “he doesn’t care” or how he’ll get back together with her.

We do work together so we can’t avoid each other completely, but for example I know hes in my city tonight - I just want him to come over and say I know what I want etc but I know he won’t and I’ll be crushed.

Some of the kids are pretty young and are only doing what the people are saying because they get subscribers and views from the men, but doesn't look like they understand why they are making them do what they do.

I don't want to accuse them of being pedophiles, but it is very creepy as its grown men praying on kids and making them do tasks that give them sexual arousal.

192,"WARNING : REALLY LONG 


So , just a few days ago , my class went for this baking class which teaches us how to make cupcakes . When it came to the frosting , i asked around for a specific piping tip , leaving my cupcake on the table . While i was not looking , my friend decides to put a lot of frosting on my cupcake , already knowing that i hated the frosting , so when i turned around i was mad .

I know , i could've solved it by scraping off the frosting but stupid me decides to shout "" GO AWAY "" when that friend was mimicing my anger . Another friend was laughing at my state and i just don't know . Then my third friend asks me why i was so "" salty "" on the bus ride back to school . And it just annoys me now . Every single time i get angry i either get teased or get called salty . Then someone gets pissed at me for being angry .

This is not the only case

The friend that was laughing at me ( i'll call her Emily ) draws anime . Whenever i point out her mistakes and give her advice she would always push me aside and say "" YOU AND YOUR STUPID CRITICISM "" one time , she made this Tsuyu Asui drawing which had some room for improvement i gave her some advice and she simply said "" i don't need it "" and still makes the same errors till this day . She also likes to brag about all the materials to have to me . Not only that , she always tries to one-up me even though i did nothing to her . Whenever she has better grades than me she would always go "" I BEAT YOU "" and whenever i beat her she would always say , "" well , i beat you in ___ "" . Overall , whenever we argue , she would always try to play victim even when i bring out the correct facts . She's just so arrogant and always rants to me but never allows me to rant to her .

The friend that put a load of frosting on my cupcake ( call her camellia ) , is arrogant just like Emily . She likes to call me an idiot for no reason and doesn't pay me back whenever she uses my money to buy food . She would always say "" it's our money "" or "" i payed for our food last time "" whenever i get angry she always likes to joke around with it . Not to mention she gossips so much that i barely have ears . We got into a huge fight once regarding my study time . She said "" if you have so much time to study , why don't you have time to do your fucking homework "" i kept quiet and only talked about it on my status , and i didn't even put the blame on her .

193,"Started the new year in a two bedroom apartment with 5 girls. One roommate has recently told us that their social anxiety makes it so they cannot relax if any guests are in the house (including living room and other bedroom) and has asked us not to have guests over as often. This is problematic because we all have study groups and boyfriends and other friends that we want to be able to spend time with in our house. I completely understand that she would prefer no one else enter the bedroom we share, but I struggle to understand how it would be reasonable for her to ask that we have no guests in the living room or the other bedroom. I really want the best for her and to help her be as comfortable as possible, but I don’t know how to accommodate her without hindering the study habits and social lives of the other 4 roommates. It is not as if our guests so far have been loud or rambunctious, we have just been quietly sitting and working on projects in the vicinity of each other. This preference of limited company was also not mentioned when we met up to talk about lifestyle habits and see if we were compatible roommates before signing the lease.  I am looking for suggestions on how to find a balance/compromise or at least understand how she feels. ",28Oct2018,1
194,"First of all sorry for my not perfect english, but I guess it's enough to understand about what I am writing.

I am F26 years old and overweight since a pretty long time already. It started as a kid but I'm not the one who judges my parents for it because they showed me how to eat and live healthy, I just love(d) eating and food. My weight isn't so important to tell I guess. There are definitely bigger people than me but I'm still away from having a normal weight. Tried to change something regularly and yea it never worked. When I was still in school I could say that I was just too lazy to do stuff because back then I had enough time to workout. 

But now I am really tired of being so unmotivated. I wouldn't say that I'm ugly. I like my face, my eyes, my lips and I think if I would lose weight I could look really great. The problem is that I work now in a full time job, maybe more than that. 6 days a week and 10-11 hours a day are my regular work times. I love my job and it isn't a sitting job, I am moving and running around basically the whole day which isn't so easy with my extra weight on hips. So I come back to home after work, powerless and tired, still have to do all the housework and there isn't much time left for myself. I know a lot of people live that life and some of them still have kids to care about, my biggest respect for that.

My eating habits well... how they could look, I don't eat healthy. Before work I don't eat at all because I can't eat at mornings. In my half hour breaks I buy something to eat in a bakery. Fast and enough to survive the work day. After work it also have to be something fast. So soup, pizza, baguettes, all that unhealthy stuff. I love chocolate. Not sweet things at all, just chocolate. And that's it. From time to time I eat fruits and at least on my ""weekends"" I cook meals with different kinds of vegetables.

End of story is that I basically know what I'm doing wrong, but I don't have power to change it. The hard work exhaust me. Do you have any advices? I don't want to just lose weight, I also want to be more fit and start to workout. Thank you for reading!",28Oct2018,1

But I'm not gonna get in. I'm barely hovering above a 3.0 GPA, and after this shitty semester it's gonna be below a 3.0. The only work experience I have to speak of is a 2 month internship, and I don't have anything else that's even remotely impressive to put on a resume.

I've never had ambitions in my whole life, I don't have self-respect and I didn't even have the self-realization of that until I was 19. I've just never, ever, ever cared about myself or my future.

210,"This is kind of a new for me, I don't quite know if I should be doing this, let alone whether anyone will read and bother to comment. I'm rather new to reddit, so if anyone feels the need to absolutely destroy what they know about my character from this post, please take it easy on me. It's strange how I'm still finding it difficult to post a problem I have on reddit, even though I'm covered by the anonymity of the site itself. I suppose it's just awkward for me to be so open about something that's quite a closely kept issue to, essentially, a bunch of strangers. But I know that a lot of people on here can be real as shit, so...I hope this works out. 

So the title is a little vague for what I'm talking about but it's also pretty conclusive...I'll explain. I'm in my early 20s (22). And I've been dealing with a bunch of things that I've been meaning to get off my chest for a long while. I'm pretty sure I'll be posting a lot more darker and deeper stuff on here as I get more comfortable with the forum and feel the increasing lack of a good therapist. I've been dealing with this particular social thing that's been bothering me for a while. It's about girls. I grew up in an all girl household, my mother, my sister, and my cousins who would always visit. My father wasn't around, and my uncle (The father of my cousins) would only stay around for short periods of time, my auntie (My cousins' mother) would always stay though. Because of this, I've grown to have a strong understanding about female attributes and how girls act when around each other, alone, or with other males. Obviously I didn't attribute all of these particular things to **every female I knew** but I could make out the patterns of actions of my female friends. I grew comfortable around girls, then obviously the hormone monster (Yes the one from the show ""Big Mouth"" except he was always on Cocaine and LSD) busted in and turned everything on it's head. Puberty was pretty confusing for me... 

Going into my teenage years, I had a pretty crazy time finding out about masturbation and stuff, it was a pretty colourful part of my growing up (Seriously, it's a story for another time). The hairy part (No pun intended) was the attraction I grew to the female gender. I was always a pretty dorky kid, so I didn't have much luck with girls. Well that's kind of an untruthful statement, I like to say that a lot but it's not particularly true. I was only dorky when I liked a girl, most of the time, when I was just chillin, I would always find a girl would tell someone to tell me that she *""Liked""* me in school, and a lot of the time I was sort of dismissive, (like *""Oh cool, she's cute""* and then forget that I was even told that before the day had even ended) but sometimes I would have been open to having a ""childhood sweetheart"" (This seems to be the case up to this day and age by the way). Anyway, I remember the episodes of fantasising about girls, y'know, the part where it's all friends in school, teachers, people you noticed on the street attacking you with ludicrously sized breasts; well it got to the point of regular masturbation that I started being conscious of all this. First of all, I was raised as a Protestant Christian, so anyone who's been in that boat knows the feeling of the impending doom of spending eternity in hellfire and brimstone for daring to touch yourself. I started to question the morality of my thoughts based on the premise of my religion. Secondly, I started to question the big man himself, ""why, exactly was I getting all these floods of thoughts of naked women?"", ""Was it something I did? when did this start?"", ""Why would I even have these feelings if they were wrong? I don't exactly want them, in fact, I think I'd prefer it if they went away."", until questioning turned into shouting and cursing. It was all a big story, being angry with God, myself, thinking ""I'm disgusting for having these thoughts"", I even became angry at females; I realised that there was a lot of condemnation for young boys for having ""Perverted thoughts"", so every time I was caught taking an unconscious glance at a woman's breasts and, in return, received a glance of contempt, a part of me would always be angry, ""It's not my fucking fault! maybe you should control **your** impulsion and not dress like you want people to look at you"", this was only one of the colourful thoughts I would have to myself whenever confronted a female or a thought of one. 

I mentioned that I grew up a protestant christian, and by this, you could tell I have a pretty fruitful and complicated relationship with the ""Most high"". Luckily, my mind was rather strange and unique growing up and my first thoughts, in the first church I was ever in, watching all the grown ups reacting to each other and lifting their hands in the sky was ""Please God, if you're really there, show me the truth...of everything"". Skip 10 years later to a philosophy degree, (And **still** no solid direction in life mind you! Go figure!) so... Anyway, I grew up rationalising in my head, I realised that girls aren't attractive on purpose, they're not doing it to specifically hurt me, in fact, quite the contrary, I reasoned that girls must have been just as confused about all this shit as I was. Growing up and out of puberty, I eventually, I started to forgive myself for all of that...mess, in hindsight, it all seemed pretty trivial (So for any teenagers who might end up reading this post, this is how it turns out, realising your problems weren't all that important and there are much more detrimental, life questioning problems to come! But don't worry, with a little alcohol and some good company, it's pretty bearable!). It was odd to me because growing up in an all female household, I didn't expect to be so affected by the other gender, as a matter of fact, I remember becoming very disillusioned with ""girls""; actively swearing off of marriage, and never understanding ""why guys would spend so much time chasing girls, it's just not worth it!"". Hell to this day, I find myself ""preferring""...""male company"" at times (Me and the big guy are gonna get around to talking about it). Even after all of this, I still find myself being unwillingly attracted to girls...

It's not just to ""hot girls"" either, I always feel impervious to the attractiveness of a 'generally accepted hot girl', I could see through them easily, because it's always very apparent that they **try** to be that attractive, so my mind instantly goes ""Ok, I see what's happening, you're 'trying', you spend the first hour of your morning ""putting your face on"" and probably don't do much else"", I don't judge people based on this by the way, but it just allows me to acknowledge that person as an individual rather than something affecting me. It's just girls in general, and it's always in places I don't expect and I suspect that it might be a thing I just haven't fully matured in as a human. Let's say I'm somewhere...musical, I like music, if there is a girl in a pub gig, I, being a very sociable person, would want to go and talk to her (In the midst of other musicians mind you). I wouldn't necessarily be looking to hit on her, but my mind instantly turns to: ""She's attractive, and now she knows I'm attracted to her""...Ok, This is a pretty crushing thing for me to explain, because if I'm honest...a lot of my friends have the impression that I'm ice cool and I don't think I could live it down admitting that this is a thing for me! I'm not even sure how to properly articulate this... 

When I was a kid, I would always be awkward around girls I was attracted to, I hated this, I wish I was able to just have a normal interaction with them, without having them feel awkward, or without having anyone be annoyed with me and thinking I'm a pervert. I just...wanted normalcy. I used to look at older kids, and see how guys would normally be talking to girls, and I would *always* get so jealous, and I would think it was the coolest thing in the world, ""How is he just talking to her normally as a friend, how is he not acting like he's attracted to her"". It's kind of like that. I do deal with things like, being lonely, and not having a lot of intimacy...I can be pretty dorky and awkward, but I'm also picky, which doesn't help. Honestly, I just like people who are 'nice'. I would take a nice average looking person over a gorgeous asshole **any day**. The thing is, nowadays, I find that a lot of girls, have kind of an ego (About just being attractive!), and I find that very unattractive, so it makes me kind of apprehensive about going up to a girl ""And just talking to her"". (Please forgive me for bouncing around my points here, it's just that I've never really admitted this to anyone before). It's not like I ""Don't have any game"" either. I'm a smooth talker....it's just...selective. What's even more weird for me is liking a girl and wanting to talk to her, but knowing that in my mind, I'm only doing it because I want to have sex with her. That conflict in my mind usually results in me doing nothing. I think this could  be a factor in why I find it hard to have a normalcy when interacting with girls.

 Ok, I think, I'll be able to explain this precisely now. If I'm in a normal group of people, let's say there are 10 of us, 6 boys and 4 girls. I'm a pretty excitable, loud person in groups, I like to make everyone feel included, I like to crack jokes and make people laugh. Eventually there will come a point where everything is low energy, we all sit down and talk normally. I catch myself not being able to look at one of the girls (Who just so happens to be wearing a ""cute summer dress"" that only goes above her knees) properly. I try to make eye contact with everyone, but that particular girl, and when I do, it's very difficult to hide that...I'm actually attracted to this (Not particularly ""Hot"") girl, who's also here with her boyfriend! She also starts to notice this. To make it worse, another girl is here, and she's actually pretty ""hot"", I also, try, and fail, to not act as if I'm attracted to her either, now they both know that I'm attracted to them, I give off an awkward impression and they both seem pretty disgusted with me. That. except it's like that for a lot of girls, more than I'm comfortable with.

This is a part of my life that I'm very unsatisfied with. I do get lonely, I do lack intimacy, and it **has** ""been a while"". But I don't want that to dictate how I act with other people, it's very frustrating and it puts me in a bad light, which is bad for me because I actually care what people think about me.

This is the first time I'm admitting this, so I'm sorry if it wasn't entirely coherent. I was also worried about how I would come off to people, but I suppose I'll find out soon. This was kind of a hail mary attempt to see what people would think of an embarrassing trait and see how people would react to the type of person explaining it. I've been searching all over the internet, for maybe something that would explain something similar but I haven't found anything that came close. I would really appreciate the opinion of anyone who might read this. I would genuinely appreciate more clarity on this topic. ",28Oct2018,1

213,"I'm so sorry for the nature of this post, but I just don't know what to do. I've dealt with this for years and I'm exhausted of it. I'll put a **tl;dr** **at the bottom**, because the actual explanation is a bit long. This is what I'm certain is the root of it, I have no idea what else it could even be.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

When I was a child, I lived in a violently alcoholic home. Most of the week my father was drunk, my mom less so, but still. My parents were physically and verbally abusive to each other and us kids. It was a suffocating, invalidating, dangerous, miserable environment to be exposed to as a child. The weekends were the worst. Both my parents would start drinking early in the evening, and then from 10pm to roughly 5\~8am they'd blast screamo, hairmetal, and all that as loud as possible on a very powerful set of speakers. The whole night would be chaotic. They would shriek and fight and scream at each other, break and throw things, and get heavily intoxicated. If we dared step outside our room, they would verbally assault and mock us, sometimes threaten or actually physically fight us. 

The part that disgusted me the most in particular was they would have very loud sex, a lot of the time without even closing the door. I know kids hearing their parents sometimes isn't too big a deal, but with it being paired up with the alcohol, the violence, and the blasting music, I don't know, it's like it scarred me or something. I was particularly resentful having to hear my mom like that. Even though she contributed, when she was sober she was the one who protected and took care of us when my dad wasn't. She hated him, and he put her in the hospital many times. It just felt like some betrayal, and dehumanizing to not even care that your young children down the hall are hearing that. 

I would be in a constant state of a panic attack until they passed out, and I was very young. This started as far back as I can remember, all the way to when I hit 18 before I moved away and they mellowed out. 

By around 12\~13, I had started hearing the moaning that wasn't there. It's very distinct and real to me, even though it's happened when I'm in places where I absolutely know I'm alone. As soon as I hear it, I'm thrown into a full on panic attack. My throat gets thick, heart pounding, tears, breathing trouble. It's like I'm a little kid again locked up in my room trying to hide on the weekends. I hate it. I hate it so much, and I'm tired of it. I'm 22 years old and it's still happening.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr - Grew up in a physically/verbally abusive alcoholic home. Parents would get super wasted &amp; sometimes physically hurt us, most time scream insults. Would cause me insane stress as a child, then have loud, open-doored sex. Now I hear moaning when it's not real and it throws me into a panic attack.**

214,"Abit of background about me:
I was diagnosed with schizophrenia at 17 years old after a major psychotic break and then with bipolar as well 2 years later. I'm currently in my mid twenties and working on my PhD in nuclear physics. I have never had any social or romantic milestones. I've never had a relationship, a friendship, a first kiss or anything like that. The medication and schizophrenia essentially made me a very isolated person along with constant bullying and people purposely feeding into my delusions and hallucinations at school and college. 
I never thought I could be capable of feeling love until now. There's this girl who is very nice to me, she hugs me and calls me gorgeous which I read as her liking me in maybe a romantic sense and I feel the same way. I'm extremely out of my depth, I've never been in a situation like this. We were talking for a few months in person and over text. She now has got a boyfriend only two days ago so I clearly miss read any signals. She suffers from anxiety so I often ask if she's okay but now she's reading my messages and ignoring me which is fine because I won't keep talking if she dosnt want to.

216,"Hi all,

I am sorry for the vague title. I am 29 M, kind of in a mental struggle. Any advice would be most helpful!

I will be soon completing my PhD thesis in computational materials science, which is going well. My research has been good. Nothing exceptional. But, i will have a decent amount of  publications and a decent CV before I graduate. However I feel immense emptiness within.

I have always been an introvert my entire life. Now a days, I feel miserable about it. Social gatherings mortify me. But, I am at an important crossroads of my career where networking will help to secure the next step. But, I can simply not engage in social activities.

I don't know if this was the right thing to do, but I completed many online tests and found out that I might have Asperger's. All the test scores lean towards affirmation. I have always been a private guy, with satisfaction from minimal human interaction. But now, I realized this might have led me with no relationships or intimate bondings.

My relationships don't survive beyond few months. I don't enjoy intimacy. But I do desire for companionship.
This troubles me a lot. I have met several wonderful women over the last couple of years. Everything seemed perfect till things were expected to get intimate. I closed up every single time which lead to the ""breakups"". Yes, I have not been in involved in sex ever and the troubling thing is I want to do it with someone I care about but also it takes enormous time to actually have such level of comfortness with someone. I doubt I will ever find anyone who's going to stick around me for so long.


So, as you can see, both my professional and personal life is not going as I would like them to be. I have reached a state of confusion, where I don't know what should I do to make things work. With my PhD degree soon getting over, I have to make career decisions quickly. I am expected to leave the grad school mentality and enter the professional environment. I am expected to get a steady job, good pay, significant social life, a life-long relationship, kids, future all planned and organized. I just can't figure out how can I do this. I just can't see myself doing or achieving these life goals.

He made a comment to another guy about wanting to be in a woman's back pocket after she left the room. I feel like he goes too far sometimes. Maybe I am too sensitive and I am getting involved in something that has no concern for me. Would it be wrong to turn someone in for sexual harrassment for making jokes and comments to women? I'm not sure if they care. Sometimes they laugh I guess. I don't want to be a snitch. People at work tend to look down on those who run to HR and tell on people. Regardless of their reason to go.

This person is apparently liked at work. He's also on thin ice and he has been in trouble before. He told me that if he gets sent to HR he will be walked out the door. I don't want to be responsible for making someone lose their job. Nor do I want the wrath of pretty much the entire plant if they find out I turned him in. Maybe it's in my head but I feel like a lot of people would be mad. They may even go to lengths to retaliate against me. If you were in this situation what would you do?",28Oct2018,1

I don't want advice on just owning your tears or accepting it etc, and I know that not being angry in the first place helps but I want to stop my tears, not calm down.

222,"The barista at my college campus cafe has been enthusiastically saying hi and talking to me much in an enthusiastic voice and asking me questions and telling me much. She asked me if I have a girlfriend and why I do not have one and if I want one. I had previously anticipated her saying that, so I do not think that that can be a coincidence and that there is chemistry. She also told me that she was thrown off if my order was different than usual, told me to tell her friend who was the other barista to stop teasing her, and teased me by repeating me when I said yeah, and told me that something that the other barista told her threw her off in a good way. She also suggested I apply for a job at the food service at that college and asked why I had been laid off from my previous job. She also laughed a few times. When she saw me get off my bike she said she did not know that I bike to college as well as work and said looking good. She also smiled rather big when she saw me and gave me an expiring pudding for free and asked if I am hanging out with friends this weekend. Then she said “I will be looking for you.” and I said “You mean on campus.” “No.” “You mean when I am biking around?” then she said “think harder” and “I will be looking for a girlfriend for you”. and glanced so then I said I had been wanting to ask her and asked if she wants to meet for coffee and she said coffee? and I said or meet somewhere and then she asked if I drink and I said yes. Then she said she had plans last night but will call or text me at 3:00 today when I clock out or later when I wrote my # and email on a slip of paper she gave me and we had talked about how I might not be on break nor feel it vibrate and she does not want to disturb me. It has been more than seven hours since 3:00. I had anticipated much in advance for weeks so I thought that some chemistry was there and that I was not paranoid and that she does like me when I finally asked her out. I am wondering, does she actually like me as a boyfriend? Did she never plan to call or text me, or she Googled me, or forgot to call or text, or misread the # or lost the paper slip?

My mom didn't make it. 

Decided to get back to school and doing engineering but was really hard, too much commute, looking at home, studying and the situation after mom passed was hard.

Life has been dark and hard in these 5 years and it doesn't seem it's getting better. There is no day that I don't cry.  In these two years i have lost about 30 pounds or maybe 40. 

I don't have faith in the future and honestly I really don't know what to do.

I’ve got my alarm set to it’s loudest volume (sorry roommate) and even turned the vibrating function on, but I’m still sleeping through it. 

As stupid as it sounds, I’m ready to just breakdown. I’ve exhausted pretty much all avenues regarding my neighbors. Simply put, they just don’t care. I feel uncomfortable continuing to complain to management because they argue with me every time saying, “it’s just the buildings! They’re old!” 

The people that lived above me last time were dancers and after a polite conversation with them, they agreed to only dance in the living room during day time hours. I had no issue with their noise level after that. 

Anyways, I would really appreciate some tips or ideas on how to set an alarm I can actually wake up to! For the record, my current alarm clock is an iPhone.

229,"Back in April 2015, I was sexually assaulted by a complete stranger. Then, in October of the same year, I was raped by a friend of a friend. In both instances, I was not immediately upset by what happened, definitely angry and grossed out, but I didn't feel too affected.

As time has gone on, however, my self worth has plummeted and I've fallen into a mindset of ""I'm not good enough."" I've gained about 60lbs and constantly tell myself how disgusting and embarassing I am. Anytime I try to embark on a healthier lifestyle, I wind up telling myself it'll never happen, because I don't deserve it.

Even in places where my life is flourishing, I constantly feel negative; I have a well paying job - but I'm not successful enough; I've started saving for the future - but I never save enough; I graduated with a great degree - but I'm still not very bright; I have a wonderful partner, who I love to pieces - but he could do better than me.

Ever since those two events, I have been scrutinising and punishing myself - I've actually grown to hate myself. It's been years now, and I desperately want to change.

Those two incidents were not my fault - they were the faults of two stupid. I know this, yet, for some reason, I can't ever believe it.

241,"I'm going to tell the entire story to get this off my chest.

I met this guy through dating app. On our first meeting, he was very charming and gave me good hug the minute he saw me. This closed physical space and I was very attracted to him. He asked if he can stay for most of night and I wasn't into the idea. I gave in after few minutes. We decided to go to my room and get some physical. I didn't have sex with him. When I refused to have his penis on any part of my body, he got uncomfortable and decided to leave. I found that bit disrespectful and I messaged him saying I'm not happy how it ended. I realized I didn't even remember his name but I did kind of like him.

We kept chatting for couple more days where we planned to meet but he cancelled.once in last minute and another because of work. After this, I had to leave the city for family emergency and I kept talking to him. I was stressed and it found relief talking to him sexual stuff to keep my mind off. He had job where he can reply all day and I had all time to text.

After couple more days, I started asking his personal stuff, his full name and past relationships. When I tried looking him up in Google, I had zero results. I asked him about it, he suddenly stopped conversing that night. I thought that's strange and I tried using all resources to find him.

I did reverse phone look-up, I paid for report to find his details. I found his Fb and saw he has been engaged for months. This was quite shocking to me and had emotions everywhere. I have to admit at this point, I wasn't that involved but I had stressful things going on in my life and that made me go crazy.

I confronted him, he stopped talking and I started to think all extreme things about  him. I thought he is probably sociopath and I messaged friend of his fiancee through fb. Meanwhile, I ended up talking to guy more and I figured it is not that bad. I started forgiving him and talked about everything. He said he wasn't planning to tell me, he was initially looking for only sex but started having feelings and wanted to give full chance of where it goes.

Next day, that friend replied to my message asking for name. I told her I changed my mind and don't want to reveal anymore. She was persistent and super nice and said stuff like how I can help some girl. I got emotional and gave name with some details. 

I gave too much info about things the guy said about fiancee and their relationship after I confronted him. Since I did this, I feel so awful and conflicted for breaking the trust. I haven't even sorted my feelings about him and how I feel about everything before I made this reveal.

I feel absolutely terrible about myself. When the guy said he hated me for this and will never forgive me, I just can't explain how awful I felt. Fiancee talked to me, under pressure I gave in my version of story. I got to compare with his version and felt again horrible after realizing how I have been played. 

After fiancee saw my confusing behavior, she didn't want to have any contact. She quoted privacy and never to contact her or him ever. I don't know why, but no contact is making me go crazy. I was called many names by both of them through this process.

I'm here all alone, hating myself for loosing him this way, breaking his trust, causing drama, for trying to destroy someone's life. This made me emotionally unstable and along with somethings going on at home, I felt suicidal at some point.

I have since contacted my friends and I feel less guilty about whole thing. But I do think about it every day and I have hard time to completely get over it. I feel like after few months, they probably will be OK, but I will be here feeling shitty as I'm today.

Today I missed him, oh my god. Did I say  I hate myself for this. My feelings are so messed and I'm truly fucked up. I didn't sign up to be in moral dilemma and end something so suddenly.

I feel like I have to make contact with him after a month to see if he OK.i feel like I would be harassing if I try to contact after getting blocked, but I'm running out ideas to get closure on this. I think I need to be forgiven by the guy for what it's worth.

The reason I miss him is I am going through some shit now and he was very compassionate and nice. I'm very stressed and confused over everything.

Tl;dr met guy through dating app, got attached, found he has fiancee, outed him. Now I feel terrible over losing him and also for outing him

244,"Hey 

Long story short my boyfriend is a weed smoker which I have no issues with at all. He also has tried other types of drugs such a coke , ket and pills and this is now where my issue started.

Firstly he started taking pills on and off and now he takes them every time he goes out. We went to a festival this year and he went off to find a friend he came back an hour and half later with his glitter all over his face mouth and doesn’t remember a thing now this stressed me out a lot however there was nothing I could do he said he must of wipe it over his face. However before this a firmer told me he was chatting to a girl at the toilets which he says he told her to go away and I can’t accuse him of any other.

He went to a party recently and he said he was taking ket only I don’t mind him doing drugs if it’s not all the time as it isn’t good for him and I only want the best  but  anyway this wasn’t the case he then took a pill on top again and end up seeing him self out of his own body! He said he felt like he was dying this time which was a possible k hole. He told me his friends look after each other and there very close however they were all to fucked to help him that night and no one remembers much he said he never felt like he was going to die before but he did that night.

I don’t want to tell him what he can and can’t do as I shouldn’t be controlling to what he wants to do in life. However I trust him but just not on pills he is a different person on them it’s not him I don’t trust it’s what the pills do so I get stressed out a lot and he wants to go leeds fest next year with the same friends but I’m really worried he’s going to end up dead.

It effect our relationship and I don’t know what to do about it I can’t stop him from doing them but it’s really effecting me I’ve tried to talk to him about it and like I said I’m being controlling is the basic answer  I get back and he said I said he could do what he wanted however I really don’t like what they do to him , I don’t trust him on them and i possibly think he is going to kill himself on them one day.

248,"Hey Reddit. Sorry for bugging you all. I really need some help. The last two years have been really rough on me. I developed an eye condition, and my schooling spiralled out of control. I started hanging out on online chatrooms all-day, which led me to make my own, complete with a website and bot. I'm good at programming.

It was a comfy little community, and the praise I got for making it was validation that fended off my depression. However, a lot of the community came from a toxic place and managing it was stressful, to say the least. I got into some bad habits of expressing my sexuality with several people there, which led to some white knights rising up and making me out to be some monster. Some people I got involved with who turned out to have legitimate mental illnesses joined the frenzy, and my reputation was shattered. I made a mental meltdown and left, losing every friend I ever made there.

This was months ago, and I've been a walking zombie since. How could a crowd of people go from loving me, to hating and shunning me? Did any of them ever even care in the first place? I feel this deep loneliness and depression that I can't shake no matter what I do. I've lost 20 pounds exercising, a huge feat to most, but it's not good enough for me. I've got a great job that pays well, yet it doesn't make me happy. 

There was a girl in the community I was best friends with who I fell deeply in love with, and although I know she was running from life just like I was, and that I would never love someone like her IRL (no offense to her), I miss her deeply. She defended me when things first broke out, but once the stress of the situation got to her, one of these white knight guys basically woo'ed her into a relationship. Good for her I suppose. It hurts and I think about her everyday.

I'm seeing a therapist, and I have many great friends IRL. I've been completely honest with the people I'm close to, even with the stuff that makes me look terrible, and they've been nothing short of a wonderful help to get me back onto my feet. They don't think I'm a monster, and that I was just a victim of letting a bunch if mentally unstable people destroy my little home. Perhaps. I don't know.

I still struggle with my vision 2 years later, and the memories of this online community haunts me. I'm the sort of person who likes to make sure everyone is happy, even at my own expense, and to know that there's this image of me being a monster out there just to satisfy some people who wanted to see me fall makes me furious and depressed. I feel a deep loneliness knowing the people I was myself to, and loved turned on me. It really hurts, and keeps me up at night.

I feel like I'll never find love. I'm only 21. I'm a good looking guy, according to some females. Being shunned for being mutually sexual has made me afraid of my own sexuality, and I don't even know if I ever wanna have a sexual relationship ever again. I even completely stopped masturbating.

I have trouble sleeping. I have nightmares about what happened. I just wanted to make people happy with my talent, and get a bit of internet praise. It destroyed me. Therapy helps, and so does venting to IRL friends, but I feel like a nuisance to everyone. I hate being vulnerable after what happened, especially when my mentally unstable friend in the community shared all of my deepest secrets and insecurities just to add fuel to the fire.

It was months ago, and I still can't come to terms with it. It bothers me every waking moment of everyday, following every waking thought I have. I can't talk to people online anymore. I've had SSRI's recommended by my doctor, but my therapist says it'll just hide the issues and they'll come back once I get off of them.

I've tried to get into a relationship since the incident, but the girl who I thought was the new love of my life turned out to be a legitimate sociopath and told me a few months into the relationship that she never felt anything for me, right after trying to get into my pants. It left me broken and confused.

I don't understand. I have people who love me IRL. I have friends who bend over backwards to help me recover, but I feel broken. I pretend to feel better because I don't want them to get frustrated and abandon me. I have a family that, although a bit disfunctional at times, loves me. I wish someone would just put a bullet through my head, because I can't stand the thought of killing myself. It feels selfish. It'll destroy my family. But every day is pain. What did I do to deserve this?

272,"I'm a 21-year old male, university drop out, with intentions of going back to school in the Spring so I can get closer to graduating.  I worked hard in school, and never partied or wasted time.  I was on the university soccer team, but severely depressed, which led to poor self-care, and ultimately dropping all of my classes, and leaving the team.  I'm now back at home with my parents planning the next step for next semester.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad regularly asks me for help with yard work, cleaning the dishes, or generally helping around the house while I'm home.  I always help out when he asks, and often when he doesn't.  But in the past two months, he's been increasingly agitated with the fact that I'm not in school, even though I have plans of going back in the Spring.  So when he asks me to help around the house, he fat-shames me because I've gained a lot of weight after quitting soccer and being depressed, yells at me, and tells me how much of a failure I am.  Every time he fat-shames me, I refuse to help around the house because I'm not dirt, and I have respect for myself.  But it hurts so much, I'm depressed and I can't escape the bullying even from within my own home.

&amp;#x200B;

Then once I refuse to help around the house after he body-shames me, he threatens to kick me out.  And I'm afraid he's getting close to actually doing so now, which is why I'm posting this on Reddit.  I don't know what to do.  He body-shames me whenever he asks me to help with anything around the house when I'm already depressed, I tell him not when you say that to me, and then he always threatens to kick me out after that.  It's a positive feedback loop that he is perpetuating.  Am I handling this wrong?  It seems to me like I can either stand up for myself and get kicked out of the house and become homeless, or let myself to continue to be bullied by my own father, and let him tread on my depression for a place to stay.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to go back to school in the Spring and work on finishing my degree, but if I'm kicked out, I will have to spend the money I have left on food and cheap shelter (if I can manage to afford that), and my job doesn't pay enough for me to save money for school on top of that.  So I can't see how I'm able to finish my degree and become independent if I'm kicked out.

277,"So i’ve been working at a certain timeshare company for almost 2 years now. I am an outside sales rep who works in a mall and sells little getaway packages to shoppers. I’ve been working at location X for the majority of the two years i’ve been with this company. Just recently, location Y opened which is much closer to my house, so I have been working there for about 3 weeks now. 

The manager at this location is a complete asshole. I’ve worked with him before at this company and another one, but i’ve never been directly under his authority until now. This manager and i have a history of him trying to fuck me over at work, with one example being how he tried to take $1000 out of my last paycheck with the other company we worked for. I was trying to make it work at this new location, but shit hit the fan this week. 

So he has been on my ass since day 1 about being on my phone, being a couple minutes late coming back from break, not approaching every single person in the mall, etc. I am the top sales person at this location, i usually average more sales than all 8 of my coworkers combined, so I’m obviously doing my job correctly and well, yet he still feels the need to bitch at me about the smallest things. I am the only person he does this to which leads me to believe that he has a personal problem with me and is singling me out. 

I have never been written up EVER in my time with this company. Two days ago he wrote me up 3 times. Yesterday he sent me home an hour and a half into my shift and told me not to come back until further notice. The 3 write ups were for not getting enough sales the previous week, taking a longer break than i was allowed, and he sent me home early on that day as well because we were having an argument about his managing style and he said i would be written up for that. He sent me home again yesterday because I was having a dance battle with a kid in one of the stores through the store window. (I know that my seem like a weird thing to do but it’s a high energy job so i drink a lot of energy drinks and i just overall have a very lively personality and our company literally tells us to try to have fun with the customers to put them in a good mood so they’ll buy.) 

I sent an email to HR yesterday morning about his problems with management (laziness, disorganized, management through intimidation and punishment rather than encouragement, etc.), and I also included that I felt as if he was singling me out specifically and i felt uncomfortable at work. 

So I feel as if this is a hostile work environment and I do not want to return. The manager texted me this morning and said i could return to work with a final written warning, but basically that he could fire me at anytime on the spot. 

I want to leave this company all together, and i have been applying for jobs, but in the meantime i want to know what is the best way of going about this situation until i find another job. 

I basically have a few options. 
1. return to work at location Y
2. ask to work at location X
3. email HR and tell them i don’t feel comfortable going back to work 

my preference would be to just email hr and tell them i feel harassed and i can’t come back, but if i do that, I’m worried i won’t be able to get unemployment while i try to find another job. I would love to go back to location X, however i don’t think the regional would let me and if i did, i would have to drive 100 miles a day round trip because it’s located in the town i used to live in. 

i have to tell HR or a manager something today because I’m scheduled for a shift tomorrow. come through reddit, as a young person who’s never had an issue with a manager, never called HR, and never had to file for unemployment, i could use the plethora of knowledge this website has to offer.

I quit about a year ago, but smoking quickly replaced it. My original plan was to do it until I can get a fix for anxiety and likely depression, and I want to quit before my 18th birthday which is on the tenth but I honestly know that's not gonna happen.


Me and my dad were talking and he says he'll kick me out if I don't sign a form forfeiting my medical privacy to him, which is honestly the only thing I'm looking forward to when I'm turning 18 - being able to fix my shit. 

I already go to a psychiatrist, but it is basically me sitting in a chair with my dad talking about various things of my life he hears about from outside sources, or Donald Trump, worth the occasional question to me. 


Now I have 3 options that I see.

*Live with a friend, or rent a room. I make about $100 a week at my job so this will be hard but I can get more hours. A room where I live will cost about $500 a month. This will be difficult because I already take multiple medications and I need to pay for food, and the actual stuff that I need to help with my anxiety depression.

*Live in a car and buy a membership to the local community center. Unfortunately I don't have my license, only my permit, but I am pretty sure if I keep it parked and don't drive it on the road I don't need to get it registered and such, but the membership alone will be about a grand a year, and I would also imagine what I would still want to buy gas, (although biking to the gas station) to move it around the parking lot, so that don't think the car is abandoned. 


* Continue smoking to help with my anxiety, maybe I will pick up vaping, but I don't like it as much. This is probably the cheapest and most likely option. But I want to know your guy's opinion

290,"I moved about an hour away from my family and yet all my free time goes to them. I’m not unhappy, but I think I need to distance myself. I’m grateful to be close to my family, but I feel I am holding myself back by spending so much time with them. 

I’m the youngest (23M). I moved from ruralcoservativecollegetownsburg to a midwestern metropolis. My parents and siblings all live in the same city and I moved away for work. I have an older sibling who’s engaged and another in a long term relationship. I barely dated between working through college. And now that I’m graduated and should have the time I feel as though my family time is taking away from that. I also have only made a couple friends in the year and half since I moved away. 

I love my new home. The arts, jobs, diversity, entertainment, and public amenities are incredible. I want to plant my roots here, but feel like it won’t happen because I spend my free time flying right back to my family. I was homesick for 6ish months, but now I’m getting very comfortable. 

It’s not just me. My sister begs me to make trips up. Even guilt trips me with “dad wants to see you” or “moms having us over for dinner and you won’t be there.” My dad regularly sends job postings for jobs back home. My mom talks about me living in my new city like it’s some fad I’m going through. (Even if it is, so what?)


Is it selfish to start distancing myself? How do I find balance between building my new life and my family? How can I become less dependent on my family and branch out in my new(ish) home? ",28Oct2018,1
291,"Hey Reddit. Sorry for bugging you all. I really need some help. The last two years have been really rough on me. I developed an eye condition, and my schooling spiralled out of control. I started hanging out on online chatrooms all-day, which led me to make my own, complete with a website and bot. I'm good at programming.

It was a comfy little community, and the praise I got for making it was validation that fended off my depression. However, a lot of the community came from a toxic place and managing it was stressful, to say the least. I got into some bad habits of expressing my sexuality with several people there, which led to some white knights rising up and making me out to be some monster. Some people I got involved with who turned out to have legitimate mental illnesses joined the frenzy, and my reputation was shattered. I made a mental meltdown and left, losing every friend I ever made there.

This was months ago, and I've been a walking zombie since. How could a crowd of people go from loving me, to hating and shunning me? Did any of them ever even care in the first place? I feel this deep loneliness and depression that I can't shake no matter what I do. I've lost 20 pounds exercising, a huge feat to most, but it's not good enough for me. I've got a great job that pays well, yet it doesn't make me happy. 

There was a girl in the community I was best friends with who I fell deeply in love with, and although I know she was running from life just like I was, and that I would never love someone like her IRL (no offense to her), I miss her deeply. She defended me when things first broke out, but once the stress of the situation got to her, one of these white knight guys basically woo'ed her into a relationship. Good for her I suppose. It hurts and I think about her everyday.

I'm seeing a therapist, and I have many great friends IRL. I've been completely honest with the people I'm close to, even with the stuff that makes me look terrible, and they've been nothing short of a wonderful help to get me back onto my feet. They don't think I'm a monster, and that I was just a victim of letting a bunch if mentally unstable people destroy my little home. Perhaps. I don't know.

I still struggle with my vision 2 years later, and the memories of this online community haunts me. I'm the sort of person who likes to make sure everyone is happy, even at my own expense, and to know that there's this image of me being a monster out there just to satisfy some people who wanted to see me fall makes me furious and depressed. I feel a deep loneliness knowing the people I was myself to, and loved turned on me. It really hurts, and keeps me up at night.

I feel like I'll never find love. I'm only 21. I'm a good looking guy, according to some females. Being shunned for being mutually sexual has made me afraid of my own sexuality, and I don't even know if I ever wanna have a sexual relationship ever again. I even completely stopped masturbating.

I have trouble sleeping. I have nightmares about what happened. I just wanted to make people happy with my talent, and get a bit of internet praise. It destroyed me. Therapy helps, and so does venting to IRL friends, but I feel like a nuisance to everyone. I hate being vulnerable after what happened, especially when my mentally unstable friend in the community shared all of my deepest secrets and insecurities just to add fuel to the fire.

It was months ago, and I still can't come to terms with it. It bothers me every waking moment of everyday, following every waking thought I have. I can't talk to people online anymore. I've had SSRI's recommended by my doctor, but my therapist says it'll just hide the issues and they'll come back once I get off of them.

I've tried to get into a relationship since the incident, but the girl who I thought was the new love of my life turned out to be a legitimate sociopath and told me a few months into the relationship that she never felt anything for me, right after trying to get into my pants. It left me broken and confused.

I don't understand. I have people who love me IRL. I have friends who bend over backwards to help me recover, but I feel broken. I pretend to feel better because I don't want them to get frustrated and abandon me. I have a family that, although a bit disfunctional at times, loves me. I wish someone would just put a bullet through my head, because I can't stand the thought of killing myself. It feels selfish. It'll destroy my family. But every day is pain. What did I do to deserve this?

I apologise for this post. Compared to other problems other people face, these feel so tiny. But I'm suffering, and could use a bit of encouragement. Thanks in advance. Let me know if you have any questions too.",28Oct2018,1

295,"So a year ago, while on holiday with my family, I was out walking with my sister. When we returned home, she immediately said that she hates that mom is trying to hide the fact that she smokes. This was after a brief hello to my mom when we entered the door.
I was shocked because I didn't knew, but apparently my dad and sister had caught on to it a while ago.

The thing is. My family never talks about the ""elephant in the room"", which basically has turned in to multiple elephants so to say. The same goes for my mom smoking.

Ever since I was young, she has almost scared me from cigarettes. It wasn't the casual ""your dad and I will be disappointed if we caught you smoking"". It was always phrased way worse, like I would me kicked out of the house and be such a terrible disappointment.
I now know that it's because she's overprotective, but she is also very anxious about a lot of things. Extremely afraid of me, her child, turning into a drug dealer or something.

The thing is, I can't get myself to tell her I know she is smoking, and the way she is, she will most likely just deny it.
I just want so say something like ""I know you smoke, and it's your choice. But why hide it from me?""
Of course she can make me anxious sometimes. With this and other things, but it's her choice. 
What do you guys think?

TL:DR! Mom smokes, I can't tell her because of anxiety.",28Oct2018,1
296,"Long***I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls (only 2 of them are in this , a blonde girl and a brunette girl) were there for a few hours in the night at the end before closing time the blonde girl walked up stairs with another girl to the toilet she kept looking back at me down the stairs and laughing/giggling . but couldn’t make it out fully. later I walked around the corner towards by where they were sitting and one of them (that same blonde girl) was looking at me and pressed her lips together in a polite/pleasant way and she didn’t look away and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say whispered excitedly to her friend the brunette girl 'eh that lads just been staring at me'. another while later I was cleaning a table nearby  (they were the last customers left in there it was late before closing) and it went quiet and then it went like:

Brunette: “excuse  me...excuse me” 

Me: *stops to look over*

Brunette: “how do yer get a job in here?” 

Me: “oh just online application form and sent it from there”

Then they asked me about a girl who worked in there (where I work) i walked over t their table and I said yes and she was saying they don’t know her that well just by sight and then said ‘yea she’s bit weird like’ (which she is tbh) as she was talking with the blonde girl too but the blonde girl was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ or something like that then the brunette then said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know’ and then looked at me after she sipped her drink with a straw then grew a smile and said 'she likes you' quipped and they all burst out laughing I just walked away (she meant the girl at work who said she likes me. She doesn’t as these girls never seen me before) then I then went back to finish cleaning the table and it went quiet again: 

Brunette: “excuse me”

Me: *looked over*

Brunette: “can I ask you a serious question” (she pointed at me saying it nervously and politely) 

Me: “yeah”

Brunette; “have you got a gf?” (she said it really pleasantly )

Me: ***ignored her because I didn’t know what to think of it***

Blonde: *watching the whole thing and after a pause between anyone talking again*  “awww leave him alone, he’s dead cute” looking over smiling and “he probably has” (probably has a gf) (she said it out loud while looking over at me like as if she made sure I heard her idk)

Brunette: “have yer, have yer got a gf?” (Pleasantly in a wanted to know way)

Me: *ignored again wiping the table looking annoyed because I didn’t know how else to act*

Blonde: laughs a bit  and says ‘aww leave it, he’s fuming now’ laughing a bit (I wasn’t fuming it was the coffee stain on the table I was wiping was not coming out lol) 



 . On their way out by the door when I was cleaning other tables the brown girl looked a bit drunk walking out with her hand on her head and the blonde girl who seemed normal walked towards me and went out of her way a little to say ‘byyyeee’ loudly smiling politely idk they looked like pleasant well spoken girls not loud drunk girls

297,"So I've been with my girlfriend for 4 and a half years now and we moved in together a few months ago. After a few bumpy weeks and loud arguments we've now settled and got used to each other, I can now really see myself building a life with her. 

(To give you an idea we are both 21).

In June of this year I was suddenly unemployed (I walked out of a job in the same industry I have now launched my business in), with no savings or any financial support (whilst I was moving house) I nearly bankrupted myself starting my own business. Now I have a few regular clients and I am starting to get close to making a profit that will let me live a modest and happy life! (Within just a few months) This is something I am really proud of however I would really love it if my partner could be involved.   


Firstly, I'm not sure what she would do and how I would pay her, as paying myself is a bit random I just top myself up when I need it as I do not make enough money regularly to pay a salary of £1500 per month that I need so I just pay myself when I need the money, which is bad because I am relying on Credit Cards and my Overdraft (I am paying these off sensibly - I feel that these are just helping with cashflow). She works full/part time in retail and we split our bills down the middle at the moment which is absolutely fine, I think we both benefit from financial independence and it is a good way to live as if things go south there is no argument about who was paying for things etc...   


However, if I'm going to take this seriously I do need help. It is hard work staying motivated and keeping everything on track and why not build a family business where we work together.

302,"Hi,

So recently I took my parapro test for a job that is through a public school. I did great on the test (I got almost a perfect score which was cool) and so the HR director wanted to set me up to interview for a position which is awesome because working with kids is one of my passions. However, the pay is 15 an hour and since I live on my own, that's cutting it pretty close. 

I've been working in a factory for almost four years and I make like 30k a year with all my OT. It is NOT the job that I want in the long-run, but it allows me financial peace of mind. Also, with my work schedule, I can attend classes for a child development course in the mornings at a local community college- something I may not be able to do if I take the job through the public school as it's probably 9-5 and it would be more difficult for me to squeeze in classes.

On top of that, I want to propose to my boyfriend who is from England (we've been in a LDR for almost three years) when he comes here in December- but the problem is that he'd be sponsoring me and so- would I be better off with job experience in the field that I want for when I move and have to look for work in England, or would I be better off taking the college courses and getting my CDA? I feel like the job experience would be better but I really have no idea. I just got out of the hospital recently due to some severe mental health issues and this really isn't something I want to worry about right now lol.

I'm fairly sure my dad has cheated on my mom in the past and he's currently seeing a 21 yr old (he's 50 yrs. old), the worst thing is that she was a friend of the family, she used to come to our house and my mom would treat her really well, she also lives 4 houses away from ours. With that said, I think you can imagine how much my mom has been through. My mom has been loving, is responsible and really cares for us, the only problem is that she doesn't work (she left work because some stuff in the past) and it's really hard for her to get a job now, specially because of the current situation in our country regarding jobs (we're not from the U.S), so my dad has full financial control over us and he uses this as an argument to be rude to her, he says that he's the only one bringing money into the family, but instead of helping my mom get a job and be understanding, he insults and diminishes her as being not capable. Because of these things we're on a really bad spot economically, but we wouldn't really be if he didn't also pay for his lover's university and food and clothes and trips, so my mom has to ask her family for financial help to pay for our food and sometimes college, he gets mad at insignificant things and treats everyone in our family like trash, he is threatening my mom to get us out of university (stop paying for it).

It's not that I'm not interested in economics but it also isn't what I'm passionate about at all. It's the international course, because I always wanted to work abroad or just with people from other parts of the world but not necessarily as an office guy. That's basically the only reason I'm interested in it.

In the end, I just signed up for it because I went with the flow, which is what I've done up until now. And maybe that worked too well, otherwise I wouldn't have done it. Anyways, I've started having these thoughts of me either not even making it to graduation or just never being happy with what I'm doing professionally. On the other hand, I'm also very insecure as to what alternatives I have, since I don't really feel passionate about anything really. I really liked drawing comic figures back in the day, but I lost touch with that completely and haven't done it for at least a year now.

Then I found out that I could do a 1-year pre-course at the art department of the local university, so I could sign up for the bachelor program in art &amp; design, so by the end of all this I'd be around 27-28 years old.

315,"So I parked up at a store last week, as I came back to the car, the women in the car next asked me if I could wait until her husband came back as he went inside looking for me.

Apparently I had dented the their car door as I tried to get out of mine. I don't remember causing any damage, but on closer look there was a very small dent.

I gave him email address, he emailed me yesterday saying he tried to get some quotes, one price was £400 but managed to get it done with a dent removal company for £80 cash in hand and gave me his bank details to transfer the money over.

I asked to send a copy of the receipt but he said as the job was done with cash there was no receipt.

So I dont know whether to refuse as it sounds a little like scam, or the guy is being honest.

If I go through my insurance so they can investigate it, but this will likely increase my premiums by more than £80!

319,"Okay, so here's a bit if story. My dad is a 100% disabled veteran. Because of this, we (the family) all get certain benefits. I am 20 years old and still live at home, making me a dependant and recipient of benefits. I am also a type 1 diabetic. Supplies for my diabetes are very expensive, but because I go to school, the VA covers most of my medical expenses. That is fantastic; a really good deal considering I cannot join the military myself. The problem is, I absolutely *hate* going to school. I am miserable there, and I haven't enjoyed a learning environment since before high school. If I enjoyed school, perhaps I would be doing better in my classes. 

Here is the current situation as it stands: in order to continue recieving my medical/financial benefits, I must receive a ""B"" grade or higher for this semester. Otherwise I lose them forever. I don't think that's entirely possible. It would take an act of god or a team of dedicated scholars to help me through. My other option is to find an entry-level job that has medical benefits that will cover my diabetes supplies. I would so much rather do this option. So far, I have found no such job.

This situation has weighed heavily on me. I am not suicidal, but most days I wish I weren't alive so I wasn't such a burden on my family. I have depression which I take meds for, but it's starting to get hard to stay positive. 

Please help me, reddit. I am so lost and upset. I have no idea what to do. My parents will literally cry if we  cannot take care of me.

325,"Without going into too much detail, I have a roommate who keeps odd hours.  Lost their job, became a bit of a shut-in.  These things happen but this person really didn't put in any effort to keep that job, they're kind of a dopey rich kid.

Anyway, for a couple days now I've thought this person was stealing from my desk at night (desk in another room.)  A bit of money and other things. Like my mj supply, which is how I noticed it (it's not such a huge amount that pinching some wouldn't be pretty obvious).  He even started eating my food at night.

So, I pulled the old spy trick - leaving a piece of paper wedged under each drawer, and one wedged into the door jamb as I closed the door.  Of course I removed anything of value.

Sure enough, this morning there it was by the door - the paper slip.  And sure enough, both drawers had been pulled and those paper slips were right there under the desk.  Besides feeling violated, I'm just astounded at how dumb this person is, thinking they'll get away with it.  And I feel it's now required to boot this person, because I don't know what else they might steal or do.

So, now I'd like video evidence.  My laptop sits on that desk and should be the perfect spy tool - I just need to know what software to use.  Something that detects motion and will save the file?  Maybe something that alerts my phone?  Hell, maybe I can set it up to trigger an audio alarm, so they KNOW they're busted?   Not sure what's the best course of action but having the camera deliver a delayed audio clip from The Ring would make for some choice facial expressions I'm sure.

Anyone have advice on what to use?  I'd like to set this up ASAP and get this person out of my life before any more weird shit starts happening.  I'm running a Windows set-up, for the record, and my phone is Android.

Thanks.",28Oct2018,1

the only thing I can think that triggered it was hitting my head maybe?

344,"I share a small office in our building with a woman doing a placement from the university in our town. She started in September. It's a small office, our desks are L-shaped, and kitty-corner to each other, so when we are typing our backs are generally to each other. 

We have to talk a lot about work, though, so we often swivel our chairs to face each other, or turn our chairs so the backs are to one part of the L shaped desk, and our laptops are on the other part so we can face each other somewhat (this also allows me to face the door which I like to do) while typing.

The problem is that every time she swivels around in her chair, her legs are open and I can see everything. The first day it happened I just looked away and got super embarrassed and didn't turn around really the rest of the day. But it's been happening almost every day.

Sometimes she sits cross-legged with her feet up on her chair, which is basically insane for someone to do with a dress and no underwear on imo. Sometimes just with her legs slightly open. Sometimes she sits on her desk and leans back against the wall, so its at eye level when I'm sitting. Sometimes she perches on the part of my desk before it curves into the L so her vag is basically just screaming at me from a few feet away while I stare at my laptop and type.

I am scared to bring it up at work because I don't want to get done for some sort of sexual harassment or told that it's my fault for even noticing.

On her second week the girl said ""that's too bad"" when I said I had a partner. Because of this, I haven't talked to my partner about the vag stress because I know she'd think she was doing it on purpose. My partner already told me that I'm full of shit after she creeped this girl's social media, because I'd kept reassuring her that I didn't find the girl attractive and that she had nothing to feel threatened by. (It doesn't matter how many times I explain that people put their best, edited pics up on instagram and it isn't an accurate representation of their looks...).

I just need a way to handle this that makes the problem go away without putting my ass in the jackpot for some sort of sexual harassment (our HR staff are vehement about protecting women in the workplace, and are outspokenly feminist. which is great! I am too! But it makes me nervous as heck to talk to them about anything like this).

353,"****This post is going to be VERY long winded****


For background, I’m 18 years old and I started college a little over a month ago. However, my family struggles financially and has made it clear that me going to school is a burden on them in many ways. I go to a culinary school, but I’ve begun to think that I should transfer out due to the fact that it’s not academic and it’s a small school, but too much money for me to be going there “just because”. Socially and emotionally I know I’d be better off at another (cheaper) school, and without my family. 

Additionally, my boyfriend attempted to move up to me recently after we spent 4 months long distance. We did this carefully, as he worked a job for these months and earned enough to rent a place in the area. After applying to a place a few minutes away from my campus, the apartment was rented out from under us 5 minutes before he and his friend were going to sign the lease. After that, they stayed in airbnbs as a backup option was processing our application. However, that place fell through and we no longer can afford any apartments here since we’ve been staying in airbnbs that have ALSO fucked us over (fees, lying on the listing, also giving our rooms to other people, etc. etc.). He’s originally from georgia, and can go to stay with his family until he can gain enough to move somewhere in the area. Apartments there are cheaper, so it’s a definite yes that we’ll be able to find a nicer, cheaper place down there. 

However, my parents have been very opposed to me having a boyfriend since I was younger and have told me that I’m not allowed to have one until I’m “older”. I know that if I ever told them what was going on, they would order me to leave him and wouldn’t let me out of their sight again. 

What should I do? I want to leave with him as I know that I love him and that his family is loving and welcoming towards me (I’ve met them all before), and I know that that is the option that will make me the happiest. 

Would I be a dick for leaving my family? Would they resent me? Can I never go back? Do I risk telling them? Should I stay here and risk not being with my S/O for another 6 months?

Also when I only got a pub job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ a lot on emails and in person which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her . Has in a bad way? When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘how did you apply for there then?’

She broke up with her ex(mutual friend but I don't talk to him often)about a year ago, and it's gotten more serious between us over the past several months as we shared more and more about ourselves. She recently had to move away due to circumstances beyond her control, but we still text every single day. She's been getting lonely and I now live quite the distance from her so I can't really do much about it as of now. We were talking and she mentioned that her ex was visiting her(he only lives about an hour away) to keep her company for a few days, that was about 3 weeks ago, I didn't think much of it and was happy she had someone to hang out with. A few days ago she tells me he's coming over again, and I don't know if I should read anything into that. She acts super weird when he's visiting in my opinion, like we usually text for hours and when we don't, we still talk a few times a day, but when he's there we basically don't talk at all. She's also usually very flirtatious, but it's really obvious that she's holding back when he's around. Is that weird to anyone else?

356,"They are spraying for the bugs today, and my mom is convinced that the spray will kill every bug in the mattress. 

However, a friend of mine had a serious bedbug infestation at her last apartment that was almost impossible to get rid of (they had the place sprayed multiple times)

It got so bad that it almost drove my friend insane—she was washing all of her clothes and blankets constantly and kept saying how she could never feel clean because of it. 

I have maybe 200 pieces of cloth in my room (clothes and blankets and pillows combined) and I’m starting a full time job on monday—my mom is pretty old and if we did have an infestation, there is no way that she’d be able to take care of it on her own and it would suddenly become my burden to bear after a 10 hour day. 

I can’t let this happen.

I’m 15 years old and I live a good, healthy life. I love my family and I’m thankful for all I have. There isn’t much trouble in my way but there is one thing making me angry, sad and disappointed. 

My mother and sister is away on vacation to look at art in museums (it doesn’t interest me very much). They have been gone for two days now and are back home on Wednesday. Every time my mom is away my dad drinks. It’s *very* easy for me to tell when he’s drunk or when he’s planning to go drinking. He has never been drinking in front of me and tries to hide it. The dumb excuses he always gives make me think that he thinks I’m stupid. It makes me very sad to see him like this. Anyways, my mother knows that he has a problem and he has had for a long time. He promises her that he will never drink again, but he can’t keep it.

Today he was out for hours and came home around an hour ago with pizza (same thing as yesterday…). So I told him ”Pizza two days in a row, huh?” and he goes crazy. I have to get this out of the way - my father has never been abusive to anyone in my family, he isn’t like that. He hasn’t laid a finger on me, ever. So he started shouting at me and throwing stuff around and saying ”I do everything for you and you’re not thankful?”. I am thankful, he knows this when he’s sober. My father is the best father I could’ve ever hoped for, I really love him. But when he’s drunk he is a different person. He gets angry for the smallest thing. I was unthankful for the pizza, but come on, it’s not fair. 

I’m in my room now eating my cold pizza while crying and he’s downstairs. He just came in my room and hugged me but I told him to get out because I don’t want him near me when he’s drunk. 

He has seeked help for it (my mother probably seeked help for him) but it clearly doesn’t help. He needs serious help and if I tell him he needs it he’ll just deny it and be angry with me. And I’m not going to message some rehab center that he needs help, he knows he needs help. I not only feel bad for him I also feel bad for mom having to put up with this shit. Or maybe I’m the one having to put up with it since he doesn’t drink when she’s home… What should I do? If you’re reading this and just wanna talk I’d like that also. 

We live in a society where alcohol is not considered a drug and that’s fucked up. I went to a party yesterday and many of the people there got drunk, I don’t see the point. I have seen the effects of alcohol and I will never start drinking.",28Oct2018,1
360,"I'm new here so I hope I did everything right. 

Basically I haven't had a job for years because I have pretty bad social anxiety. Anytime I think of getting a job I think about how I'll mess up and embarrass myself, or how I'm too dumb to memorize or understand my role. The fear has gotten so bad that I have disappointed my family and friends for years because I'd rather avoid them then admit I'm going nowhere in life. 

I finally decided enough is enough and I applied at a grocery store that is hiring. There is a good chance I'll get the job, but the very thought of that cripples me with fear. 

Does anyone here have social anxiety? If so, do you have any coping techniques? How do you deal with it on the job?

363,"I can't remember the last time I had fun, partly it could be down to depression and lack of a social life, but even when I do get an opportunity to be around people I just can't seem to have fun...it's like I've forgotten how to have fun.   


Take for example in dance class I can't do the faces expected (think cheesecake pin-up cheeky poses), when the teacher calls the register she asks us to answer dramatically or this week to make a scary/spooky noise/action but I stand there, that's it. It's not that I'm scared or embarrassed, there's no conscious thought there, I just...can't. Everyone else in class tries, but for some reason it feels like I'd be judged if I do try or it'll be made into a big deal so more embarrassing.  


Another example is when going out, while everyone can have fun and dance I feel I can't, people end-up thinking I'm boring or assume I'm not having a good time. I swear once upon a time I would dance and have fun but now I just can't seem to let go. Again this isn't a conscious anxiety or fear, I jut don't know how to let go like others.  


Other than in primary school I've never had the opportunity to dress-up for Halloween and I'm not sure I'll ever get the opportunity, even when I had friends I was never invited to anything where I'd get to dress-up and I worry people wouldn't think of inviting me to anything like that as they'd think it's not my thing...it is, I guess I need reassurance.   


I don't like having my photo taken as they turn out terrible, I've no photos from going out with my old friends, I'd love to join-in on silly group photos but I always have to hang back as I can't trust I'd not end-up looking terrible - this isn't just my paranoia, everyone agrees I'm not photogenic, everyone else can look good but without effort I look horrific.   


I'm not sure all this makes sense, if it explains the wider issue...  


I guess I spent so long being bullied as the weird kid I now don't know how to be 'fun' in an appropriate way, I don't have people I feel comfortable enough around to try being 'fun'...I get treat as boring if I don't join in but then people act like I'm a freak if I do try to join in, I get people giving me wired embarrassed looks if I every try.

369,"My Mother is a very sweet and caring person, but so horribly overprotective. Her sheltering definitely stunted my social growth during my teens (I was basically never allowed to go out, or had to be home at some silly time like 10 PM until I was 18). Took me a long time to find friends again and resocialize, but I did when I was 19.

Ever since she throws a hissy fit that I am to be home before 4 AM, because she can't sleep when I'm out. When I ask her why in gods name that is, she just says 'I just cant sleep if youre not home!' Like what.
I was in psychotherapy from 18-19 (anxiety related) and even my therapist told me to 'condition' her into making her see her reaction is inappropriate and just ignoring her hissy fits, and just letting her deal with it.

Now today I told her I'd be going out tomorrow, because I have holidays atm. She has to work however, so usual tantrum about 'oh but I cant sleep and I have to work' My response, as usual (and suggested by my therapist) was :'That's neither my fault nor my problem' But todaysShe chose to respond with 'Yes it is your problem, you'll have to move out if you keep this up'

I know for a fact that's just a hollow threat, because she used to swear she would disown me if I ever was to join the army.
But currently I'm doing the equivalent of my A-levels (worked a job before) so I can join the army as an officer. Well, by now she kinda supports me with that, but still hopes I won't join. Doesn't threaten to disown me anymore though...

I obviously understand what makes her feel the way she does, but I honestly can't understand why she choses to act like this, nor why nothing I tell her changes her mind. She's convinced her reaction is 'normal' even though multiple people told her otherwise.

Moving out is not an option currently, because I'm going to school for 1.5 more years, and until then money will be tight. After that I will (hopefully) join the army and I'll have to move out anyways.

So, how would I best adress this constant annoyance? I know she won't take any serious action, but it annoys me so much to put up with her nagging everytime I leave the house. And I don't even party often, like maybe 2-3 times a month if I don't have holidays. Peers my age go out like 5-8 times...

I am a 20-year old kid in Europe currently going to vet school. Becoming a veterinarian was my dream since I can remember but I am growing more and more unsatisfied with my personal and professional situation. 
My current troubles are multi-faceted but basically I am frustrated with the bad organization at my university, the bad job market for veterinarians and the amount of work I need to put into my education (I am pretty intelligent but I still need to put in about 110 hours of work/week with practically no weekends). Honestly, I don’t think my current effort is going to pay off later.
Furthermore, I am unable to have meaningful relationships. I have a habit of cutting most of my friends/relatives/sex partners out of my life as soon as they grow to close. Currently, I am barely talking to anyone. After going to my classes I usually just work out and go to bed. 

At this point in my life I don’t really see a point in trying to get my degree. I have a good opportunity to become an electrician and make a decent living, but I‘d have to move to a pretty remote location in Northern Sweden.

374,"Hey everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 1**

So I graduated high school in 2011, and went to attend college at University of Texas at Dallas as a mechanical engineer. After the first semester, I figured out that I no longer wanted to do engineering and changed my major to Economics. I did alright, but I've always had trouble committing to college, especially in regard to attendance. I figure that the source of this is

1. A really bad bout of depression that I fell into my first semester of college which lead me to skip classes and generally allowed for bad study/school habits to take hold.
2. Generally bad sleep/study habits

Anyway, so I attended school through spring of 2014 and basically had a mix of pretty good semesters and terrible flunking semesters. GPA fell below 2.0, I was placed on Academic Probation and Financial Aid suspension, and decided to move out with some friends and ended up taking a year off of school.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 2**

I developed a plan with my parents in that year off where I would basically move back in and attend UTD for one more semester in order to raise my GPA above a 2.0 so I could transfer to University of North Texas (this transfer due mostly to the fact that I was going to be commuting and UNT was closer, AND that UNT was also less expensive overall). In exchange, my parents would pay out of pocket for that semester at UTD (\~$7,000). So fast forward, mission successful and I transferred to UNT. First semester at UNT (Fall 2016), I basically fell back into my old habits again and skipped class a lot and got Cs in the classes I needed Bs in, and would have to retake them in Spring of 2017. I was also placed on Academic Probation again.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 3**

Spring semester of 2017 began and it wasn't looking so good again. Was continuing to skip class and not do work. Then, on February 28th, I suffered an ischemic stroke which paralyzed the right side of my body. Through months of therapy I basically regained the ability to walk unassisted and regained some movement in my arm/hand (though I still suffer decent deficits on my right side; I'm typing this one-handed for example). Luckily, I suffered no permanent cognitive effects and in Fall 2017, I was able to resume school half-time and finished that semester with all As. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 4**

Spring 2018 did not go as well, however. Once again, I started skipping class again and basically dropped to Academic Probation and Financial Aid suspension again. I haven't told my parents still. But essentially, my current situation is this:

1. Living on my own funded by a full-time job at Dillard's (which I hate)
2. Taking off school this semester
3. Still no degree
4. Need to finish school, but can't receive Financial Aid, so can't afford school at UNT
5. Need to take classes that I've taken too many times already so couldn't get Financial Aid even if I wasn't on aid suspension
6. Feel like I have learned almost nothing in all my time in college and at the very least don't feel the slightest bit prepared for a job in my field (econ/research)
7. $48,331.54 in debt from school loans

**Ending Notes**

Some last things I want to point out. I really enjoy academia and reading about data, research, analysis, etc. but I definitely don't feel like I know how to do any of it and also have become a weird combination of disinterested/disillusioned in those subjects as a result of my off-and-on with school. Would really like to get back into them. 

After my stroke, I discovered a passion for tabletop gaming. Board games, RPGs, Dungeons and Dragons, etc. I love this stuff and I would like to design a board game on my own. 

I feel like the 2 interests are at odds with each other somewhat, in that time spent on one is time away from another. I think ideally I would like to graduate and work in economic research/analysis and have that to fund my tabletop gaming hobby (and maybe design on the side when I have time). But I've wondered a lot in the past year about whether or not I should just jump into game design altogether as a career. I think I have a knack for it, but at the same time I don't want to romanticize what a life like that would be like and also I don't want to give up on a career in research. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel at odds with myself and I have fucked up my school career completely. Any advice would be appreciated.

Im sure that she and i will not be togheter forever, beacuse im a designer, i love cartoons, videogames, other perspectives, etc. And she cant offer any of that. Our relationship is not bad, but she isnt my soulmate, totally not.
So, my problem is... yesterday i went yo a party. One of those parties full of drunk people, where everyone kiss each other, dance and do those things that i cant. I was alone on a wall when 2 guys got near me and asked me if i wanted to smoke some weed, i always carry some just for those opportunities so i told them yes.
I smoked a lot on the roof and when i got down, a girl dressed like mavis from transilvania hotel started talking to me, she didnt even told me her name but she was talking and talking and talking, she told me about good movie villians, about peace and love, about energy, she told me that the point of being alive, for her, was just to be happy. She was a little drunk and we sit down on a coach and she started asking me about my dreams, my life, what happens after death. I was super high that i couldnt answer to everything, i was just thinking on her, reading her body, when i noticed i broke my red glass on my hand and my heart was about to explode, at first i though it was because of the weed but when she fall asleep on my arm, my heart got back to normal and my mind was about to explode.
Watching her was like listening to my mind when i cant controll it. She was like just made for me, everything she told me made me feel home, good, safe... like literally nothing before! hour passed and she had to go, and when she did, i got very, very sad, like depressed (i used to have depression back on my 17s, so i recognized rhe feeling). the rest of the party my mind was driving me crazy with her, and still does. I feel empty now, like if i found what i needed in this life and now its gone. I got her number, but im afraid. I can tell for sure that she doesnt even remeber any of that, she was so drunk. Im used to be alone, i like it, i kinda accepted that i'll die alone, bc thats how i am, and i cant change it, but now i cant. I feel like a 13yearold, my mind is shouting to me that i need to search for her, but i dont know, im just afraid. im afraid of this change.
Also, that feel when i meet her made me reconsider on leaving my gf. Not because i want to replace her. because if i dont feel good with her, like i did with the girl at the party, i'd rather leave her so she can find someone who does, and then she will

I try my best to be as nice as possible but sometimes I feel that if i ever get upset about something, their opinion of me might change?

392,"Hey guys I am a 15 yr old
. I am so depress. Mainly right now cuz maths is making me brain dead slowly maybe I absolutely dumb but I can barely even score 1 marks In math .
in my skool if u fail 3  subjects from the MONTHLY exams they put u a grade behind. And also dumb subjects like sports and art also count. 

Not just studies but In school in general. I feel so useless and like most of the people in my school only care for me because they think I might do a skool shooting cuz I’m shy I don’t really have a school shooter personality tho I’m just shy. 
I don’t even have any friend because I don’t talk. I just don’t know why I can’t. I feel like a retard.

And main thing is cuz I think I might have mild schizophrenia. I keep seeing shadow figures and suddenly feel like there’s something by me . And I hear voices on some occasions especially when I’m about to sleep.

I told my mom that I wanted to murder people, I was lying, I just felt so sick of it all so I hoped i would go into a mental hospital . But she did not tell anyone.

My mom did take me to a therapist, therapist said I maybe had autism, I know I don’t, I didn’t tell her anything, I only answered some questions, and she said if I wasn’t going to tell her anything she can’t help me, I wanted to keep it that way because anyway I do think I am worth of help 

Also another thing is that. Even since I was very young my dad gave me a very sad perspective on life. And ever since, I have seen the life and the world in some of the worst ways possible. When I was younger I always wanted to be like my dad, he was in the spetznaz when He was younger.It was my dream till I was like 8, but he told me it was very easy to join it back then and that only people who can’t get any other job join the military jobs. Now I don’t know what to do as he says most jobs will be taken over by robots in the future. 

I haven’t tried to commit suicide yet, but I just feel like drinking bleach or something poisonous, or just drowning my self.

400,"My childhood was horrific. My dad abused my mother verbally and physically throughout their marriage, he left my mother and I when I was three years old. My mother was never able to recover from the abuse as she was left bitter and angry, I never seen her happy. She spent my childhood beating me for every little offense, screaming at me. She never liked me for what I can only assume, I'm my father's child. Home was never a happy place, and I dreamt about moving away since I was a young child. Throughout the abuse neighbors or landlords never intervened to help, my mother constantly blamed me for not being a good child. I failed at school as I had nobody to would teach me things at home, but I still floated through the school system. 

When I was 18 I had my first job, and saved up enough money to move out and saw that the worst was behind me. The abuse was only verbal at this point, though it took a toll on my emotional health. I dropped out of college after one semester and went to a trade school. After completing the course, I couldn't find work, and fell into depression as my current job was a terrible minimum wage store and my mother constantly berated me, making me feel worthless, unlovable. I hated my life and wanted to kill myself. I saw no purpose in continuing to exist.

Strangely enough, my mother wanted me to continue college or she'd kick me out and I'd be homeless. 4 years later, I put up with her emotional and verbal abuse. A am about to receive my college degree. I owe it to her that I will be making a good amount of money.

401,"I’ve been fighting with my wife for years about hard work. I’m an underachiever with a crappy job &amp; no degree. I understand I’m supposed to work to improve myself but...

Hard work &amp; planning &amp; striving make me feel godawful, unworthy of any benefit. I just wanted one thing, one talent, one benefit I DIDN’T have to work for to show me I had some actual value. 

I’m not putting down YoUR hard work, reader. My wife worked from nothing to a graduate degree &amp; has a “good” job. I’m not putting her down either. 

I grew up poor. I think I’m dumb &amp; I’m ugly &amp; im clumsy. Maybe hard work corrects those things, sure, but it also confronts them. The smart, attractive, graceful &amp; the rich are all clearly more loved by God or whatever than I. I tell myself aspiration (for me, not you) is stupid, &amp; that all the work in the world is just a poor attempt to make up for my own inherent worthlessness. 

For example, LeBron james works hard to be LeBron James, but he has tools to perfect, he didn’t just wake up one day &amp; say “if I work hard I’ll be a famous basketball player.”

Nothing I could ever “earn” seems as rewarding as just lucking into something, once, ever, would. If I had to work for it it seems worth less.

402,"Hi guys I’m just here because I’m very sad right now. So basically this exchange student came and, naturally, was put into my language class as we all spoke her native tongue. Over the first week we got to know each other and met a few times outside of college. (I should add that at this point, it was purely on a friendship basis).  She would always tell me about how she found this other boy attractive and that she wanted to meet him and stuff and I just remember feeling crushed and I realised that I really did like this girl. Anyway... her and the other kid didn’t work out and we started to meet and talk in a way which was probably more than friends but not fully ‘Romeo and Juliet’ style. The week came for her to go back to her own country and we were so sad. I saw her everyday and spoke to her every night and as much as I wanted to, I knew it wasn’t helping. Throughout her time here we didn’t actually do anything more than kiss and this was partly because I felt like trying anything else would be disrespectful to her and just rude. There’s not a day that I don’t regret this and I feel so down about it. As part if my college course I will go to her country and might have the opportunity to see her whilst I’m there. Also, she is coming back next year and of course I will see her then. This is really weird as it is probably my first proper love and it had to end like this...

403,"Long time lurker, first ever Reddit post so I apologise in advance if this breaks some Reddit rules.

For some context:

I quit my job of a year and a half in September, it was working in the legal department for a gambling company and I couldn't deal with a lax approach to compliance. I also felt guilty that the business was profiting from people with gambling problems. Amongst other things, but I left without having a job on the other side.

Anyway, I've always wanted to write and was given an opportunity to freelance for a content writing business as a kinda sorta of job interview. I completed the work to be told that I had narrowly missed the post but they would retain me as a great writer.

After weeks of applying for new roles I have a few interviews lined up next week but money is drying up fast. 

On Thursday night the content writing business emailed me out of the blue, advising they urgently needed a new copywriter and whilst the pay wasn't what I initially asked for they wanted to offer it to me first. So of course I emailed back to say yes of course I would love to take the role and we would discuss the outstanding freelance payments due to me. (Which i have not yet received)

I saw the word urgent and was expecting a response so when I didn't receive one I emailed back to say, on the back of my email, I can start as soon as next week.

I haven't had a response back and I am worried that I may have come on a little strong. Maybe I'm just anxious because I am a little desperate to work or should I reconsider the position entirely?

 I mean I haven't been paid for my freelance work and the salary is 10k less than my previous role. Plus Christmas is coming up.

407,"So basically I was super anxious and upset today, I wasn’t sure why but I kept dwelling on this even that happened last night. I didn’t think much of it at the time. But maybe I should have?

I was out drinking with friends earlier in the day, later in the night I had sobered up and we grabbed food. My friends were still very drunk and left without telling me, so I was alone in the city. I was kind of upset but wasn’t sure what to do next, there was some confusion of whether my other friends were coming to meet me. I decided to stay at this bar crawl until I knew what to do. Like I said, I was pretty sober by this point, but I had drank a lot earlier that day so I’m not sure what affect that was still having on me. I went to the nearest bar to call my friends / call an Uber / be off the street. Some old guy offered to pay my cover in the bar bc I didn’t have cash, I said thank u and went straight to the bathroom to call my friends. Didn’t think much of the guy, but he followed me to the bathroom door and was waiting for me when I came out. I simply walked past him and went to go sit at a booth. He came up to me and gave me a drink, claiming to own the bar and he was just looking after me. STUPIDLY, I drank the drink (I swear to God I wasn’t thinking straight. I am so embarrassed to admit this) and suddenly I felt grotesquely drunk, and my memory gets hazy here. I do remember the guy groping me and even trying to kiss me. For some reason I didn’t really care, I was just on a mission to get home at this point since I was uncomfortable being so drunk so quickly and alone. I should mention I did not finish the drink he gave me, I only drank a very small amount. But I was weirded out by how quickly I got drunk from it/ basically blacked out bc of how hazy my memory is. I don’t want to be over dramatic. The guy was def a creep, but did he put something in my drink? I don’t know. I don’t want to make false accusations. I slept for like 13 hours straight when I got home (I called an Uber and made it home soon after I realized I was drunk, the guy had gone to the bathroom and that’s when I left the bar)   Sleeping that long is unusual for me. But I’m not sure. I’m not trying to make false accusations. I don’t know if I should call the bar and report the guy. I just am unsure about everything, I had major anxiety all day today and I realized it was bc of what happened, I just kept replaying it in my head. I felt like I was going craZy, I’ve never been so anxious. Am I over reacting???? Please tell me if I am. Is this as big a deal as I’m making it ??",28Oct2018,1
408,"So, my brother is in the happiest relationship of his life. His bf has been supportive, takes care of him, they have common interests, and so on. He's the only bf that I've approved of and we all got along very well when I visited a few months ago. 

Basically, the bf's business is hitting off and they're beginning to make a lot of good money. The bf offered me a great job too that pays twice as much as I get paid now for less hours. They also want me to move into their home which is quite spacious and nice. 

Buuuuuuuuutttttttttttttt

The three of us went drinking the last time we visited and the bf is lightweight. He was being kinda flirty but I just marked it off as jokes (I'm straight). But at one point he started to cling to me and started kissing my neck (like 1~2 times). I jerked away and got him off of me and left the room. My brother went to the bathroom at the time. When my brother came out, the bf was K.O.'d.

I didn't know what to do, so I just didn't say anything because I didn't want to cause a scene. But now I'm thinking more and more, was it the right thing to do to not say anything? Especially now that a shared living space would be in the picture. I feel kind of uneasy about the whole situation.

I've said no to the job/living proposal many times but the bf's been very persistent. To top it off, my current work is constantly in fear of audit (where some of my colleauges have been and fired) and (what I feel is) scamming people for their money. I smile at people everyday, only to have them spend hundreds to thousands of dollars. Many times, multiplying prices by 5x (approved by VP of Sales) by misleading and exploitative practices. And I've been quite unhappy, but I keep working to help my mom pay the bills and save to hopefully one day go back to college. I do look for job listings every day as well on multiple platforms, but I had to drop out of college for family so I don't have much qualifications or money (which is another long story).

So, one weekend the bf asked me for probably the 10th time with more pay and benefits, and when I was out with friends drinking I said yes.

That made my brother and his bf really happy and excited, but now I have this sick feeling in my stomach that no matter where I turn I'm not making the right choice. And do I choose to ruin a relationship that literally makes my brother's world? He moved 3 states east for this guy and left everything, including his old career. I'm confident it would destroy him. 

My brother has also confessed to me many times before that he is jealous of me in many ways, including superficially, like appearances and stuff. I've been wary to not let that ruin our relationship as brother's and I'm worried that he might take that out on me too or just try to avoid me from now on.

I have no idea what to think or what to do. If I don't make sense, sorry. I'll try to clear up whatever I can.

So I'm a 19 year old guy and I've been putting off driving for a long time lately because of pretty potent driving anxiety. Currently in college, but virtually every job opportunity mandates a license so this is something I'm going to need to bite the bullet on.

415,"So,  I just spent 500 dollars on a ticket to fly home and help my dad fix up his home. Here's a little background with its issues (note that this is due to neglect) : 
This house is a wreck. There is no kitchen sink (the countertop rotted around it so we removed it,  this happened 9 years ago) so they do dishes in the bathroom tub,  there kitchen counter rotted off as well,  the electrical in half the house is not working (that happened 10 years ago), the carpet is 30 years old (not to mention the dog would pee on the carpet a lot, my mom would clean it, but you never really get it all out) which gives the house a stale smell. The front steps are crumbling and the roof has moss growing all over it.  Not to mention the steep stairs that lead to the house has no railing because surprise,  it rotted away. Their hot water is out so they take baths by boiling water on the stove and mixing it will cold water and dumping it over their heads (in as bathroom with no electricity).

We have been planning this for 6 months and today I called to get a game plan together. We were going to take 20 days and fix up the kitchen,  dining room, and bathroom.  This house isn't huge, and i have done plenty of refacing in homes of my own,  on my own. My father immediately told me that we should only do the kitchen, that it will be too difficult to do all the rooms. He says he doesn't have the money.  In most cases I would understand,  but my father makes 6 figures and the only debt he has is his house mortgage. I showed him where I could get top end products far below value. He still acted as if I have no idea what I'm doing as if I was a child designing a room made out of candy. 

What i'm getting out of this is that he had zero confidence in me or anyone that we could fix some of these simple problems, and i'm sure he will fight me on almost everything. Before I got off the phone I told him that I would drop this if you could tell me you are content with the way you live. He said that ""it's comfortable"". I may have wasted 500 dollars on a flight because now i'm strongly debating just canceling this trip all together and cutting my losses.

1. I would like to change majors and because the prerequisites for the new major are so different, it would put me over 180 hours
2. I have schizophrenia, and it's bad enough that even with medication it keeps me from holding down a job reliably.

425,"## Thoughts on if this is anything (MIL maybe mentally ill?) (crossposted)

Throwaway acct for privacy reasons. Long, sorry. This isn’t a “just no MIL”; we have genuine concern and wonder if she is suffering silently.

&amp;#x200B;

**TDLR; MIL may have a mental illness and displays erratic, polarizing, frightening behaviors. Yet can also have amazing weeks of complete normalcy.**

&amp;#x200B;

Would love to hear if someone thinks this is ... any type of mental illness or a personality disorder... or just part of who she is and it’s nothing.

Husbands mother has a terrible relationship with everyone in her family: a “sudden” divorce (not amicable) , doesn’t get along with her siblings, not close to any of her children, and her version of the truth is very much, well, not the truth.

She hides information. Literally any and all information is discrete, yet she has to know everyone’s business at all times. Examples can be her digging through mail, rooms, drawers... creating fake accounts online to scan for info and screenshots almost anything and claims that someone “sent it to her”.

Has significant money issues; this is probably one of the most profound issues we can all visibly see. Claims fraud on many cc’s, has online orders show up at various adult children’s homes in their names but will be purchased for her from her cc. Claims she shops only at thrift stores but is wearing decent labels/sometimes designers. Will say she has no money for rent so she’s living x y z (a friends house, a friends available apt at a discounted price, above a restaurant, at her relatives house, etc). Said she was renting a car so one of her adult children could borrow her car, but the “rental” kept showing up for over a month and had a dealership sticker on it (so not a rental... and she admitted “I’m renting it from the bank” aka she bought it).

Tons of lies, but never any apologies or reasons for it. Leaves us (particularly me) confused.

And then there are times where she’s completely normal, has a great head on her shoulders, seems to be working so hard and saving money, and appears to be extremely even and mellow (this really can’t be articulated well, but all of us family members can see when things are on an even keel... and when things have swayed back to being terrible and untrustworthy again).

One other example is we let her watch our toddler daughter one fall day a few years ago. The stipulation was I’d be back in an hour, please take your phone outside with you if you choose to play outside so I can reach you. This is someone who has her phone on her at all times... come home, can’t find them anywhere for over two hours. They were “walking the woods”. I was upset she didn’t have her phone and said that was all I asked her to do...

Bipolar runs in their family. She claims to have over a dozen autoimmune diseases and will fall victim to hospitalizations for days at times at least a couple of times a year. We always visit her. We’ve asked drs for info which they obv will not share with us (many family members will ask if they can be a health proxy for her, she refuses). I’ve been in a few times where drs have said they don’t know what’s wrong but she can go home... she will cry and say she can’t... she will be sicker there. Her weight sways towards being severely under weight to being such a healthy weight.

She will put us on a “shit list” if we do anything “wrong” which can be extremely obscure and confusing. Grandchildren become confused as to why she is not around as often.... when I’ve been an advocate for my children who love her unconditionally, she will say I need to understand she is healing and needs time...

427,"Growing up I've always had a fetish for humiliation. This involved wearing diapers, dresses, and panties. This went on and on for years.

I always had diapers hidden under my bed or in a box. Growing up, my mother would find my used diapers and throw them away. My father would accidentally catch my diaper porn on the computer. My sister would find my google searches. I was just very clumsy with hiding my secrets.

And about five months ago, my sister found a giant box in the basement full of adult baby diapers, dresses, panties, rubber baby dresses, and sex toys. It was just the worse stuff you could imagine. She brought them upstairs in front of my family and then just threw it all away in the trash. I didn't see this happening since I was asleep, so I just...fished it out of the trash. My mom and dad didn't care.

It's very painful and shameful that they know my secret. I'm actually in the process of quitting this fetish because it has caused me nothing but pain and misery. It's kept me from having normal and healthy relationships. It's kept me isolated and has warped my views on sex and I don't think it's healthy or normal.

My parents don't bring it up or talk about it. But they know. My sister moved out of the house but is coming for Thanksgiving. How do I face my family when they know this shameful thing about me? I just feel like I can't be normal or act normal with them because they know my biggest secret.

I just feel so ashamed that my parents know of this stuff. It's very painful and I just feel really bad about it. I feel so pathetic. I feel like a failure or something. I feel like I caused my family a lot of pain because of this. I feel like they are embarrassed by me in a way, at least my sister is for sure. I don't even have a friendship with my sister.

I am currently on holiday on Crete in Greece with my family and of course as you may already think there is this amazing girl who is easily a 10/10 for me and I really want to talk a bit with her and maybe get her number. 
Normally I don't have an issue talking or approaching the opposite gender but this time there is another problem:
She is always with her own family and I never saw her alone doing something and now I just don't know how to continue.

If I saw her alone I would already got my courage together and go talk to her but as I just told I don't know if I should just go anyway to her and her family and ask her out. So thats what I am asking you guys: 
How should I continue with that? Should I just try and talk to her when her parents are with her or should I wait for an oppurtunity when she is alone?(but im flying back tuesday and maybe i won't get that chance)

Adding some extra information:
She is the same nationality as myself (German)
We had eye contact for like 3 times and she smiled at me and I obviously smiled back
She also checked me out sometimes and as I am not that bad looking I would think that she may is interested in me

I am afraid that maybe I have bad luck and she is flying back to Germany tomorrow and I never see her again.

I am currently a sophomore at the university of Maryland (CS Major) and as of recently I feel extremely burned out. This feeling has come and gone, but this time it hasn't really left and I just feel like I've lost all desire/motivation to study. Furthermore, I've realized that my endeavors in school have been motivated by my fear of disappointing my family and community. However, now that this realization has manifested, everything else has begun to unravel. I don't know why I'm studying what I'm studying, what I like, and what steps forward I should take in terms of education. The other moot point is that im completely dependent on my parents, and as a result I feel obligated to continue studying even though it's not what I want. My parents are understanding and I think that if I am able to come forward with a reasonable alternative to my current path they will continue being supportive.

434,"So like I said this is for my wife. I don't know how to give her much advice on this because her family is very tricky.

So I'm planning on joining the military. It's a decision we both made to better our family. We know the ups and downs to our decision but it's a decision we want to make. 

Her family is... difficult. Traditional southern family. Her mommas mommas momma was born right here. And none of them have ever moved away. That type of family. We moved away a year ago for a short time and it was pretty bad. We left very suddenly though with no notice. But it was really the only way we could go without a huge fight breaking out. But basically the whole family refused to speak to her the entire time we were gone besides her mother. Even mentioning going away for a week on vacation was a huge no-no before we did that crazy move. 

So now, we know its gonna be difficult. Her mother knows and is very so-so about it. But mostly doesn't like the idea. Her grandmother believes the military is all a lie and once you sign the paper your just gonna be given a gun and trained/sent off to war. No benefits etc.. and we already know her father is just going to get pissed off and refuse to speak to her unless he's giving her a lecture. 

How do we break this to them where they aren't gonna ""disown"" her until she comes back. They want us to stay here. Live as close as possible. And me stay at my job and us just slowly make a living. But its rough. We lived paycheck to paycheck and went into some debt to get stable, then I got a small raise and we dug ourselves out. But now with my daughter here. Having to get the ""family plan"" insurance with my job. Its $100 per week. Then of course co-pays etc... it put us right back to paycheck to paycheck barely scraping by. Then on top of that we live in a small 1br apartment. And were gonna need to upgrade to a 2br pretty soon. That's even more money.

My wife medically can't work. After the pregnancy she developed a heart condition and the doctor told her absolutely no working for at least 6 months so he can keep track of her and evaluate/medicate her condition properly. 

The army will give us the money to pay our rent and utilities, I'll get a food allowance that's most likely enough for us to eat on. Then I'll be paid on top of that. And be trained in a valuable trade (joining to be either a helicopter mechanic or diesel mechanic). It will completely change our lives. Of course theres risk and theres cons like working long hours and having to go on a deployment here and there, and training etc.. but it will completely change our home lives. And I will make sure I get one of those jobs. I will threaten to walk out if they can't get it for me.

How do we make them see that? And make them see that it's going to be ok? Because if they do what they did last time we left it's going to kill my wife, she was so upset that nobody would speak to her. ",28Oct2018,1

436,"When I was 15, I met a man of 26 who took an interest in me. He was a drug dealer, drove flashy cars and would come to my school and pick me up in front of all my friends - I thought he was the best thing on this earth. I spent around a year with him, in this time I was in a very dark place and didn’t understand what was happening to me. 

During the time I was with him, I slept with him multiple times and although I was consenting to all of this, when I think back it makes my skin crawl. It’s clear to me that he was manipulating me and paying me with nice gifts in order for me to keep sleeping with him. I feel horrible admitting to that, but the sad truth was that at 15 I felt like I was in love. 

He would also turn up at my house at silly hours in the morning, telling me I could not go out to school without him in case I saw another man on the way. He locked me in his car and threatened to set fire to it, locked me in his house with him and trashed the entire place. The smallest thing would send him off the rails and he would be threatening me and throwing things and breaking things and often would threaten to drive his car into or off things with me in it. 

He also got to the stage near the end of me seeing him, in which he wanted me to start sleeping with his friends. This terrified me because I know when I wasn’t willing to have sex with him there would be threats, he had pictures of me that he’d taken that he would threaten to send to my dad. This was the last straw and I told a friend what was happening and she helped me escape. 

I’m 19 now and I still haven’t had any relationship still. For a long time I abused sex and used it to make me feel better, but the idea of a man actually showing me affection makes me feel physically sick. I can’t even bare to hug my own dad without feeling strange. I don’t know how to deal with this anymore and I’m at my wits end. 

I met somebody absolutely amazing who I know would do anything for me and I can’t bring myself to connect with him beyond a certain level without running away. And now I’ve ruined all my chances and he wants nothing more to do with me. 

I feel like I’m going to be okay and I tell him I’m ready but then I realise I’m not and I need to run away from him again. I don’t know if I will ever be capable of having a relationship beyond sex. 

I realise this is long winded, and I also know that many young people have experienced way worse in levels of actual abuse. But I’m just looking for maybe a little guidance on how I can start to overcome this and patch myself up a little.

I went all the way up to  executive management over this and executive management is siding with  my manager. I asked my manager for the conditions that must be met for  me to make this transfer in July and he was unable to provide any  concrete conditions that must be met for me to go.

So I’m 22 years old female. I don’t have a job and I’m not going to school at the moment. I have a very hard time finding jobs that interest me especially since I have no further education besides my high school diploma. I know that might just be with everyone. But I also suffer from depression and anxiety. I used to have a job as a dog groomer for about 2 years and I loved it. It was just very hard to be with a company that treated the animals/employees shitty so I quit. I’ve tried finding other grooming places to work for but where I live there isn’t too many places that groom ethically. I’ve tried other jobs involving animals but they all turn out to just be very sketchy and I’ve had very uncomfortable in counters with the employees themselves. 

So long story short I am having the poop luck with the ‘animal industry’. 

I’ve thought about going to school but I don’t even know where I would begin. 
I’ve thought about becoming a veterinary assistant or even a veterinary. I just don’t have the stomach for it.

440,"Here's the long story short - Tumblr has a child porn problem so bad that you can find it by accident. At this point I've reported all that I've found to the FBI - I don't need advice on that. But there's one video I can't get out of my head, and it's because the girl in it looks exactly like my younger cousin, to the point that I'm almost certain that it is her. However, I don't know for certain - she's got a pretty common face so there are a lot of girls that look like her, and I don't actually see her that often.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to call the police and start family drama if it's not her, and even if it is her I'm not sure what would happen. I know for certain that if it's her it's not her parents putting her out there - don't ask me how, and I don't want her to be taken from them. I want to ask one of my family members if they think it's her, but the problem is that A) I don't want them to think I've been looking up child porn, and B) none of them know I'm not straight (I'm a girl), so I'm afraid I might have to bite the bullet and come out if I show them the video to check, even if they don't think I'm a dangerous pervert. Even so, that's more than worth it to make sure she's safe, right? I'm just so scared.

It makes a lot of sense for it to be her - she's only 12 but she dresses pretty provocatively for a child. She's constantly making instagram posts where she looks much older than she is, and even as protective as they are I don't get the idea that her parents are actually monitoring her internet access. She's very adult for her age, and she sometimes talks about topics I'm not sure she should know about just entering Middle School. She's also very into dancing - she was a cheerleader at her school for 2 years, and she's always showing off new things she's learned, like the splits or how to twerk.

I'm just genuinely not sure what to do, or even if I should do something after I've already reported the pages responsible to the FBI. I think if it is her then her parents certainly should know, and they should get her away from whoever/whatever got her into this. But I also don't want to stir up unnecessary trouble if it isn't her - both of our families are already going through a lot.

TL;DR, in a CP post I reported to the FBI, one of the young girls is a dead ringer for my cousin to the point that I believe it might actually be her. What do I do about it and what's the best way to confirm whether it's her?",28Oct2018,1
441,"okay, so. I’m not exactly sure if this is the right place to be writing this. 

I am a 19 year old girl and uh.. a virgin. I’ve been talking to this guy who lives about 2 hours away for about 2 and a half/3 months. He’s 22.  we started sending nudes straight away after talking. However we also get along very well and I genuinely think he wants to get to know me? In the first week of talking HE WANTED TO GET A PLANE RIDE TO COME AND SEE ME? I was kinda shocked. 

I enjoyed sending nudes until It started to make me anxious and I realised i was only sending them in the end to make him happy and not me. so, I pretended to have my account deleted on the app we sent them on. I did this as a kinda test to see if he kept talking to me? And he did. he didn’t ghost me or anything. He’d ask about my day how I was/how I was feeling what did I get up to, but he’d still ask maybe every week if I wasn’t gunna make an account. anyway. 

he is coming to my area in November and he said he wants to meet up. He said some cute romantic things but then he started saying how he has a hotel room and stuff and how that is the “end goal”. He knows I’m a virgin and he always seemed way more interested after he found that out. Almost like it was a trophy or something? Just something he said as a joke but I was like ehh. 

so basically I’m extremely nervous and I don’t know whether to meet him or not. I have bad social anxiety and I don’t know whether or not I’m ready to lose my virginity. I know 19 is old, but mentally I don’t feel 19 and I kinda feel like a kid still. kind of immature and not ready, you know?

I cant tell whether this guy is being genuine. We have had very deep and meaningful conversations up until 4am sometimes and it makes me happy that even when we’re not sending nudes n stuff he seems to want to get to know me. I cant help but feel the way he’s messaging me kind of feels a bit forceful? I’ve said from the start (making up excuses) that I’m “busy that week” and just excuses like that but he kept on saying “see you in nov!!” With like excessive hearts and stuff. I’m not stupid and I don’t want to be used for sex once then ghosted. The problem here I guess is I KNOW I want to lose my virginity to someone I love and care about (kinda stupid) but it’s always what I’ve personally preferred and I don’t know whether or not this guy is using me for nudes/to get off and to eventually meet up and have sex.

She said ""you know (boss name) isn't that great, did you know IT has been failing audits? So when he tells you something keep that in mind.""

The way I feel about what she said is that she is trying to undermine the relationship between me and my boss, mostly because of the last part of that comment.

I warned my boss of this because he is coming to visit, and more or less as a heads up in case she talks poorly of me to my boss.

Am I right to be wary of her, or is my response just an overreaction because I like my boss",28Oct2018,1

Was she’s insulting me here or being nice? (self.seduction)

I go to appointments fortnightly  with an employment advisor for the past month. I’m a 21 year old quiet guy who’s quiet and nervous and polite. She reminded me the interviews she chose me for that I had coming up and she subbed me for both of them (they get job opportunities) and she then turned upbeat and her voice also was upbeat (bubbly) she talked a little about it and then said ‘ok do you need interview clothes?' (THey provide vouchers for interview clothes) I replied politely (I’m very quiet)  ‘yes, Iv got all that' and she  said 'oh have you got all that?’ (upbeat as I said) I said yes then she went on to say 'ok well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes, (she moved her hands also while saying this like a checklist) make sure you get a shave, make sure you cut your nails..make sure you do your hair up all nice and that.....(then she paused as she was facing her computer) ..'and make sure you put some aftershave on aswell, for the girls make sure it's mens' then burst out laughing, she’s never even smiled before (I just smiled along with it) I a young guy and she’d in her early 30s.

447,"Evening everyone (or morning, or afternoon). I'll keep this brief because I can write an entire thesis regarding this.

For all my life I didn't have a goal in mind. I just did things just to do it, including choosing jobs/career paths. Thankfully I'm only 23 so it hasn't screwed me over yet, but it bothers me that despite being around and working motivated and ambitious people, I have none of that. I like to draw, but I have no plans to work for a company or make it anything more than a hobby (but if I can earn some extra cash on the side I'm down). I like to be active and I'm good at learning choreography, but I have no interest in being a champion or famous. I chose to pursue a career in civil service mostly because it's vaguely related to quirks of mine. I like superheroes, I want to be useful and never be forgotten. I can't see myself in any other career, so I went with being an EMT. But I also have no desire to go any further in medicine. Hell I can barely get myself to study for my written exam. Arts, athletics and medicine. I'm around these fields mostly because I always have been, but I have no care to go anywhere with them and I have no interest in anything outside of it. I've only just filled roles that were needed or are related to my own quirks. But I can't live like this. I need to do something.

I've competed athletically and hated it. I'm never excited about a tournament, I just go because those around me go and I compete because it'd be a waste of time not to. Hell I hate competing in general as I get super anxious, even in casual settings. I have several creative projects I'm working on, but at this point I'm doing it just to do it. Even the project I wanted to release this year(can't cause of several delays), has taken a back seat to in favour of nothing really. I still need to be nationally registered and my written exam is only a few weeks away, but I can't muster the drive to study at all.

I hate this about myself and I want to do something about it. I just don't know what.  I need help. Help in what to do next, or at least help in understanding why I'm like this. It's probably something simple. A lack of discipline maybe. Either way I'm thankful if you've read this and even more thankful if you can lend a helping hand.",28Oct2018,1

450,"Hi all. Exactly 1 week ago I felt mentally groggy. I thought it was just the byproduct of a bad night of sleep and thought nothing of it. However this extreme mental groggines (an inability to focus on things) has continued and I've been having headaches on and off.

To be safe, I've been to the doctor/ER now and they've run the classic neurological exam (e.g. follow my finger), blood test (normal), and finally a ct-scan (nothing of note).

But I know how my brain works and it isn't right. I feel like I'm wearing a pair of foggy mental goggles and it is really hard to carry out tasks that involve critical thinking (which unfortunately is really important for me because work in research).

So there’s this girl that I have feelings for , recently so let her bf and moved out. I knew about her bf and past couple of months I still talked with her a little bit. Recently I told my feeling about her and she wanted to hang out. She texts me first and she asks me to see her work and I talk with her for 2 hours normally about random stuff. She even asked me what color she should do her hair

Upcoming we plan on seeing a movie she already seen but what’s to see again and then go out and take pictures of nature spots that I told her about.

Being that I like her and I have decent suspicion that she likes me , do I even dare to try anything or just enjoy the time we are spending?

452,"I’m a teenage girl (please no creepy guys, I’m underage and I’m gay) and I live with four of my five siblings. All of my siblings have their own rooms except for myself and my two years younger sister, since we share. 

My brothers are slobs. My mother has paid for a $100/hr cleaning service to clean my two years younger brother’s room TWICE. His room smells like a hamster cage (her exact words) and if there’s dog urine/feces on his floor, he doesn’t clean it up. He expects people to do his laundry and fold it for him (even though I’ve been helping with family laundry since I was 8 and he’s currently in middle school). He leaves food wrappers everywhere he goes, and I am deathly allergic to even the smell of peanuts. He leaves his peanut candy wrappers at the gaming computers and then denies ever having eaten them, even though we all see it. There are currently two baskets of laundry in his room that I cleaned, that he needs to put away. I can’t walk through his room without gagging or tripping over garbage, and since my bedroom is right next to the computers, I have to listen to him scream at his video games while trying to do homework or sleep.

My older brother is no better. He had FOUR baskets of laundry that I had washed and dried for him, still in the basket in his room. He has awful dust allergies (just like me) and uses that as an excuse not to clean his room, even though he can sleep in there and contribute to the mess just fine. 

The women who cleaned their rooms had to leave early and finish up the next day because the smell was making them sick. 

I try to keep my room mostly clean (and for a teenager, it’s about an average room) and I’ve managed to keep the entire downstairs living room from becoming a hell pit. While trying to clean and discuss where to put the living room TV, my younger brother generously suggested simply moving it to his bedroom, even though he has Netflix and a perfectly fine laptop. 

How do I convince my parents that I’m old and responsible enough to have space for myself? The past four years have been the only ones of my life that I didn’t have to share a bed with my sister, even though my parents had a perfectly functional bunk bed that we could have used instead. 

(FYI, we don’t have money issues, in case that factors into your answer)

I do laundry for a lot of us, I cook dinner, and I clean up other people’s messes regularly. I am not perfect, but I don’t understand how my parents can think of me as less responsible than my brothers who can’t do any of that.",28Oct2018,1

454,"A few examples from my niece's everyday life to get a clearer picture of what I'm talking about:

1. She can keep up with the conversation in social situations. She's confident around adults (and kids her own age) enough that she can talk and respond to them and keep the conversation flowing.

2. She's able to do basic math like adding and subtracting, but has a little more difficulty when it comes to multiplying and dividing. She can memorize the multiplication tables and everything but it doesn't seem like she understands *why* X times Y equals Z.

3. She really dislikes reading. Her parents don't read a lot. Her father is a lawyer, but he limits his reading to just work stuff and doesn't really encourage his daughter to read for pleasure/learning. I don't think she's dyslexic or anything because I bought her a manga book about Disney princesses (*Kilala Princess* series) and she finished it quickly and understood the story, then told me she prefers comics over regular books which is why she finished it so fast.

4. She has trouble understanding word problems and figuring out if she has to subtract or add or divide, etc based on the word problem. If it's a normal equation with just numbers, she's OK.

5. She seems to understand what she learns in school, but she gets answers wrong in tests because she doesn't take time to read the instructions. For example, she sees that her exam is similar to homework she did before. She doesn't really bother to read the instructions on the exam and just does it how she did her homework before. She gets the wrong answer because of not reading the instructions.

6. She likes playing with Lego but does not like following the instructions. Whenever she gets a new Lego set, her father ends up putting the thing together for her while she watches or ""assists"" him by handing him the piece(s) he needs.

7. She really likes slime and silly putty. Her mom has said that she's a very ""physical"" learner, meaning she more easily learns about things if she can physically hold them. BUT she also loves watching YouTube videos and getting hours of screen time. She likes to learn through DIY videos on making slime and other gooey stuff, but in the end she doesn't bother to strictly follow the instructions - she just does what she remembers from what she watched and assumes it's correct (it usually isn't).

8. She isn't really aware of what day it is during the week, and doesn't keep track of her own schedule. She relies on her parents and/or personal nanny to tell her what she has to do when (like when she has to go to school, if she has ballet on a certain day, etc). If I ask her what days she has ballet, she doesn't know. She just relies on what her mom and nanny tell her to do for the day.

9. I was born August 5 (I'm the youngest). My older sister (middle child) was born in September. Our brother (the oldest, and the father of my niece) was born August 17. My niece got a little confused and said that I must be older than my sister and brother because August comes before September, and August 5 comes before August 17. It took her a while to ""remember""(?) that age is determined by year of birth and not day/month of birth. She said she ""forgot"" that it was by year and not by month.

10. There was a time she had to bring pizza to school for a pot luck thing. She really wanted a slice before bringing it to school, but her dad said she couldn't bring a pizza with one slice missing. She said she had a solution: take 1 pizza slice, then bring the 2 surrounding slices together to make it ""whole"" again. Her dad pointed out that the opposite side of the pizza would also move so it would still look like a slice was taken, from the other side. She went, ""Ohh yeahh...""

11. Whenever she's confronted with a puzzle or some other thing to solve, she never takes the time to understand how to go about solving it. For example, we were in an interactive museum and there was a display where we had to find certain shapes in an intricate carving on the wall. She picked up the instructions, glanced at them, saw that it said the answers were on the back, and then flipped the instructions over so she could get the answer right away. She has this ""if there's an easier way, take the easier way"" mentality. So basically, if there's an opportunity to not have to think, she takes it(?).

12. She knows how to read a clock (hands and everything), but always asks us what time it is even if the clock is right there in front of her. When I told her ""Why don't you check the clock?"" she said she prefers the digital version because it's easier.",28Oct2018,1

456,"I'm a major social recluse, and even at 15, I have never been in a relationship- nor do I have any real friends. It hasn't ever bothered me, after all it was my choice. I have what could really only be described as major social anxiety, and relationships wern't ever anything I wanted particularly badly. I had gotten it in my head that there was no chance anyone liked me, and I just left it at that. I didn't care.
 
So needless to say, when a longtime family friend ambushed me at lunch, and asked me out,  I was thoroughly confused, and above all, lost.
But Its important to describe her, and our families relationship with her, since its vital to understanding my dilemma. 
She is not the most mentally stable person, nor is she a very developed person. She's naive, Acts far younger then she is, and is overall not very mature. Shes Bi-Polar as far as I know, and could just as easily be mistaken for an 8th grader. Now I'm not bashing her or anything, Shes an amazing person, but shes not the kind of person you want to be your first girlfriend. She's a lot to take on, Especially for someone who has numerous problems of their own.

Now on top of that, I'm fairly sure this is a passing crush. She claims shes been after me since Elementary school, though I have no real way of verifying this. But, Either way, I don't believe that a relationship with her would last more then 6 months, and I don't plan on being very serious too quickly.
But the largest thing I'm worried about, is that people would Think I'm taking advantage of her. She's had Relationship in the past, and has had people take advantage of her, and the last thing I want is for people to think I'm just another guy looking to take advantage of some girl. I don't want to get myself into anything I'll regret, nor do I want to get into anything I can't get out of. 

On one side, this isn't an opportunity you get very often, and there is a good chance I won't get another one. Shes someone I know, and I know she won't judge me. and in the end, All knowledge is of value, and I feel like this is something I'll forever be kicking myself for if I don't go with it. Shes someone who knows who I am, and she knows the kind of stuff I have, and vise-versa. Shes the kind of person you don't have to worry about making upset in the respect, no matter who you are. 

But on the other hand, We live in two completely different worlds, We are polar opposites, Completely different interests, completely different mindsets. Due to her mothers protective nature, she has no exposure to the type of stuff I'm into, and no real way of getting into it. We don't have a lot to talk about, and while that can change by making a mutual effort to try each others interests, its always going to be a major weak point, and probably what breaks the relationship. Secondly, when that breakup inevitably comes in high school relationships, I don't want to hurt her, assuming I'm the one who cuts it off, and I certainly don't want to ruin the relationship between our families. Its something that's causing me a lot of stress(more so then It probably should), since I feel like I've accidentally lead her on to the point where I can't back out, but again, I don't want to get into something I'll seriously regret. Third, She doesn't exactly have a filter. I can't trust her to not talk about everything I've said. Shes talked to her teachers about liking me, and apears to be taking advice from them, and because of this, I don't feel like I can trust her. I have to go out of my way to tell her not to talk about certain things, she doesn't seem to have a grasp on what should be talked about and what shouldn't be. 

**PS:** We are talking, but I've made it clear that I'm not ready to say yes to anything, But I also feel like I need to make a decision soon, for fear of again, leading her on more then I have already.
**PS(2):** Her mom knows, My parents do not. I don't want outside influence yet, though its causing problems trying to come up with excuses to see her *alone*, without raising suspicion.  Especially considering we don't normally talk at all.

457," Hey guys

Here’s where I am at…

I graduated 4 years ago with a degree in Business and Marketing and dove straight into any job I could find to pay my rent/bills.

This just so happened to be admin/call center work, after numerous job moves and a promotion I am now on a half-decent salary and benefits, but I hate my job.

I feel trapped. Trapped on my higher-than-market salary, trapped without work experience in other sectors. Trapped with no easy exit into anything else worth doing.

What makes this worse is I’m not fully sure where I want to go. At the moment I just want to escape this horrid job, which drives my anxiety, depression and suicide ideation through the roof.

It would be cool to do something with my degree, but I have zero work experience in Marketing and I doubt even an entry level job is going to take me with zero work exp.

I don’t know what to do at this point and to be honest month on month I’m seeing the only easy way out as death.

Then she gets really cuddly.
After a while she usually announces that she wants to cry, if you ask her if you should take her home she usaually says that she absolutely does not want to go home.
She says that she would like to kill herself, last time she told me that she wouldn't mind if I kill her right now. She wouldn't say anything.
When you confront her about that the next day she says that you dont have to worry about it or that she doesnt remember it.

464,"So my younger brother (18 yrs old) is thinking of taking acting classes and pursue an acting career. He got this idea because someone complimented him saying he should go into acting. I never saw his performance but in my opinion, I think he is acting on impulse and wasn't thinking things through.

After discussing things with him, I thought the problem stemmed from him having a very sheltered childhood. He never really went out to hang out with friends like a normal kid cuz my mom was very protective of him. I believe this led him to be very unhappy with himself because he was such an introvert and doesn't know how to properly socialize and mingle with others.

It hurts my heart hearing that when he was trying to converse with a student seating next to him, it seemed that he was only the one trying to talk in the conversation. I explained that some people just don't like talking.

He said that by going into acting, he could break out of his introvert shell and be an extrovert. I explained that there many ways to improve his communication and ability to socialize like school clubs.

He keeps giving me the ""you never know"", ""it's a potential"". As much as I want to support him, I don't want him to fail completely just because he acted on impulse. 

I compromised with him and said that he could take up acting classes as a hobby since a lot of people have different hobbies but still have a main stable job. But he's really keen on doing it as a career.

I'm not quite sure how to keep this short, but I'll try. This is a bit of a request for advice, and I guess a bit of needing to get it out, to tell someone. I typed this up half a dozen times, but nothing seemed right. Hopefully this works:  


I'm a salaried manager for a grocery retail chain. I'm usually scheduled in at 9:00 AM or 10:00 AM, but since I usually get home just shy of 9:00 PM, I often wake up just in time to shower, throw on some clothes, and drive to work. Many times, this feels like I go to bed just so I can wake up and go to work. Usually, when I get home, I can't walk very well. I wear special insoles and have to order specific shoes, because I have severe plantar fasciitis. There isn't much time to heal my feet, as I walk somewhere between 16,000 and 20,000 paces a day according to my watch and phone. We are given an hour lunch, but I've taken exactly thirteen lunches in a year. There are a lot of things I'm expected to personally take care of, and I'm the one asked to fix things when they break or go wrong, so I usually don't have time to sit down.   


I do this five days a week. It's supposed to be 45 hours, but I usually work the five hours of my lunch break, and I very rarely leave on time. I've found myself coming in on my days off now, too, because I'm expected to accomplish so much. It's all been very frustrating to me, lately. I love my job, and my company. I am incredibly grateful that I'm given the ability to take care of myself and my family. However, these few things have been weighing on me heavily lately:  


* I'm putting in these hours while my boss takes every Saturday off, and back to back weekends on each of his vacations. When I ask for vacation, he tells me he needs me there on the weekends, but that I can start my vacations on Monday. Recently, he told me I was going to have to change my vacation in October, and work it, because another manager had requested it off two weeks prior. I had this vacation reserved since Spring. He did not ask if I had made plans or had put money down. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Three weeks ago, I was working late; I think it was around 6:00 PM or thereabouts. I had asked my wife to meet me for dinner, so that I could spend a bit of time with her that night. I was sitting there, in my uniform, looking at all the people passing me by on a Saturday night. I remember wondering when the last time I was out in public wearing my own clothes, not my work dress clothes, and I couldn't answer it. It felt very dehumanizing. I've never missed a day of work in my life, and throw my entire body and soul into work. I felt, looking out at them, of very little worth. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Today, my father wanted to go see the new Johnny English movie. We'd planned it for months. Because both of the other managers were on vacation, I was the Manager on Duty, I couldn't leave without another MOD present. I'd made arrangements for our Evening Manager to come in early, and I'd leave and come back to close the store for him. I was willing to trade an hour of his time for four of mine, in order to spend part of an afternoon with my father. I know Johnny English isn't high comedy, but it was special to my Dad and I, for reasons I won't go too deep into. He'd spent the whole day making jokes from the first movies. My Evening Manager was too lazy to even both to arrive on time, so I had to cancel thirty minutes before the movie, and my parents went to see it without me. I've worked every weekend save for two on my vacations in six months. The one day I need time with my family, I'm let down.  


So, in short, that's some rambling, ranting idea of what my life is like. I know it's not a very good description, and bouncing around a lot, but I think it's the best I can manage right now.  


So, the advice part, yeah? I could hold out for finding another opening at another location, with a more considerate general manager, but that's rolling the dice. I used to idolize my boss, until he figured out I wouldn't say no to anything asked of me, and started to take advantage of that fact.  Should I look for work outside my field, and if so, how do I break away from retail? CAN I break away from retail? It's not exactly, by most measures, a job that is considered to be a job requiring great skill.  


Thanks for reading if you made it this far. Helps to get it out, and maybe I'll get some advice from someone who's been there?  


tl;dr: Working in grocery retail management, hours and weekends have gotten worse to the point I don't even feel human anymore, while my boss seems to be living it up at my expense. How to slip free of the cycle?

474,"Hi there! 

Basically I have a Skype job interview on Tuesday and I will be given scenarios that are complicated involving freelance writers and editors that i would manage. Stuff like making sure everything’s in on time, coping with bad freelancers etc etc. I had a phone interview which I thought went badly, but actually apparently was alright. 

Does anyone have any advice for scenario based interview questions like these? Or how to best impress? I’m a recent graduate so don’t really have past experience (which they’re okay with, as I would receive training). 

Thanks!!",28Oct2018,1
475,"Despite trying my damndest, my life is still a disorganized chaos machine. My school paperwork is spread out, my work/school computer's files are all over the place, I miss deadlines with college, I have tons of clutter, just everything.

476,"So for some background I’m in university and there’s a guy in my course who has allegedly been sending vulgar messages to girls in my course. I say allegedly because even though I’ve heard the same story from different people, I’ve never seen screenshots or any hard proof. 

The story goes that several girls in my course have received messages from this guy on Instagram and other social media making sexual comments and asking when they’ll come over and have sex with him. And other than these online interactions, he’s never spoken to these girls in real life. He makes all the girls in my course uncomfortable and it’s only repulsive that he can get away with this sexual harassment. 

I want to tell someone in the university but I don’t know how/if I should. It’s not like what he’s doing is necessarily illegal. I feel like they might write it off and the fact that I don’t have any hard evidence doesn’t help. The only evidence I have is something he’s done to me but I don’t feel it’s on the same calibre as what he’s been doing to other girls in my course. 

Should I come forward about my and the other girls in my course’s experiences? And if I do what should I do? ",28Oct2018,1
477,"So this seems like a legal question but it's not because I have the answer already. 

Which is this:

""You have to live in it by February and do so for at least a year or the goverment office is going to demand you repay the grant you got for building and buying it in the first place, plus a big nasty fine because you are using what you claimed was your first home as an investment. And you will just have to work something out with paying your joint investor.""
I've already told him and sent him links to gov pages and told him a property is a long time investment.

I've looked on forums myself  and it definitely happens. I wont dob him in since he still has time to do the right thing, data matching is more than likely to show up discrepancies so theres a good chance he will get caught anyway.

He wants to sell his half to the other investor Never mind he will have to pay back the grant anyway to do this not to mention i expect CGT (tax) will be involved.


Did I mention this guy is useless with money even though he earns alot. He also wants to sell because the newspapers are declaring the sky is falling and houses are about to lose 20% value.


So how do I get it into this idiots head that he is better off living in the place for a year to meet his eligibilty than  being caught for what will look like clear fraud and being told to repay  $15,000, since he plans on moving somewhere he will have to pay not too much less than the mortgage or half-mortgage/ half-rent anyway.

if I don't have enough money to even support my parents? The fucking truth is I don't want to be like those fucking nerds who think that there is nothing greater than knowledge and are constantly perusing every book in the course in stead of ""just chillin"". I fucking hate that. Now I know that whatever they are doing right now will get them a better job than me, and its probably going to be them the world will actually give a shit about. Me?

480,"Not as serious as most other posts on here, but still I need some advice from someone who isn't going to be biased. 

I'm currently doing a double honors degree so I'm studying Translation, Media and Modern Languages with French and Japanese. Basically this means I study French and Japanese Language, but I have one other project on intercultural communication that isn't very big. 

My issue at the minute is, I love studying Japanese, I've always loved languages but I've never had the chance to do Japanese and I'm finding it really fun. But French is just not enjoyable to me anymore, I don't know if its a good idea. 

On one hand, I've studied french for 7 years of high school + sixth form, and I'm not quite fluent but I can get by, it seems like a good idea to keep on studying to be fluent. Also logically it makes sense not to put all my eggs in the Japanese basket so to speak and only be bilingual coming out of Uni. Speaking 3 languages should make me twice as employable than 2 right? 

All of these benefits though don't seem to make up for the fact that I'm just not enjoying it, and I haven't really been since I got here. I'm doing a 4 year degree and one year of that is in Japan. I'm so passionate about Japanese right now and I just don't know if I should keep studying french. I'm half-assing all the work, barely going to the lectures and the 'Oral' Seminar honestly gives me anxiety. I used to be quite a nervous/shy person, most of that has gone but for some reason I get ridiculously nervous in these lessons just not the Japanese ones. 

I don't want to fail my French at the end of the year and it affect me being able to do my year in Japan/have to resit the whole year. 

I'm thinking about scheduling a meeting with my advisor, I haven't told my parents or anything about this. I feel like people are just going to think I'm being a lazy student and can't be arsed to study a bit more. But to be honest there is quite a lot of french work we get given which wouldn't be an issue if I didn't hate every minute of it. 

I know life's not fair and sometimes you just have to suck it up but I don't really want to be getting myself £10,000+ in debt every year to spend over half the time studying something my passion has burned out for. 

Then again I don't want to look back in 10+ years and regret not studying it for longer. 

I'm frustratingly conflicted as you can probably tell from reading this. 

Any advice is appreciated. ",28Oct2018,1
481,"My bestfriend is in the hospital for his depression, I just found out yesterday when his mom texted me from his phone an told me that he wanted me to know. Now he’s not your typical type of friend. We mostly just play video games online with each other but we do know each other IRL he just lives 30 minutes away. Now I don’t really have social media for the most part, I only use reddit an YouTube. I don’t have Facebook or non of that. But apparently he post a lot of red flag material on Facebook talking about depression an suicide. Now me an him have never really talked about depression in depth I knew he had it but not to the severity it is. 

He’s my best friend really my only friend at times. He should be home in a few days but I’m wondering if I should go see him in the hospital or if that would put him in a weird place like it would me.

It was 10p.m and my mom wanted to quickly go into the shop before it closes, on our way back we passed a pub and she asked me of I wanna go for 1 beer, I said and don't mind. We ended up going.

Whole she's there in the corner of my eye I see my somewhat friends parents and I keep my gaze on the TV so that I had my head turned away from them. My mom returns from the bathroom and we leave. Is that akward? Should I say anything or wait until she mentions it? Her parents were giving me wierd glances. Should I be embarrassed.

486,"Hi everyone, I would like to hear your advice on this very difficult situation of mine.

In freshman year, I was in a different HS than the one from which I will graduate at the end of the year - let's call it L. When I arrived in L, I didn't know anyone (I've transferred a lot in my life), and after a year, they all hated me. To be fair, they were right: I was absolutely insufferable. To give you an idea, I developed this weird 'friend-crush' on a girl whom I followed everywhere wanting to be her friend; she obviously didn't want anything to do with me and the situation worsened yet I remained the way I was, jealous of her other friends to the point of insulting them and incredibly rude to the one girl who tried to help me. All in all, I was an absolute arsehole.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of that year, I transferred to the HS in which I am now and things went a lot better - mainly because I sought therapy over the summer and resolved my deep insecurity issues and complicated family relationships. Naturally, they ceased all contact with me and I never reached out to them again... until now.

&amp;#x200B;

After two (almost three) years, I believe I have changed enough to take the one step in making peace with my past that would allow me to move forward; indeed, it has been holding me back in many things, and I have trouble forgiving myself for the things that I did.

&amp;#x200B;

Through a girl in my Spanish class whose friends are from L, I found the IG accounts of several of my old classmates; it was then that I started wondering if I should reach out to them to mend our relationship. Not only that, but I also (still) remember the e-mail of one of my old classmates, a very nice guy who sometimes goes on Reddit and who was the last person to keep talking to me after the whole ordeal.

&amp;#x200B;

I've gotten better. I've made new friends, worked on myself. I've grown. I believe I'm a better person now, but I also believe that I should do this in order to turn the page completely and start a new era of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm thinking: should I send him an apology e-mail (which he can and will show to his friends, thus why the plural in post title), knowing this would immensely help me move on to greater things in life and forgive myself for the truly awful things I did, or should I not, since they clearly don't want anything to do with me and most of my issues with them were caused by reaching out to them too much anyways?

We're about a group of 6 or 7 ish but my other friend group sort of hangs out with them as well. 

I'm not in the group snapchat, I haven't been invited to the recent sleepovers, some of them can be dicks to me at times, sometimes I never really know what to say as some of them are really quite judgemental of me (btw I'm a really tall slim shy kid and this is my main friend group ). Yet when I'm with other friends I feel more relaxed as they aren't as condescending. They have a bunch of inside jokes I don't know about and I just feel really irrelevant. Some of them always go on about how I'm such a meme. 

And when I looked on Instagram and saw them on each other's stories I just felt really left out and sort of betrayed I guess since no one even told me or asked me if I wanted to go and this isn't the first time. 

I've been friends with some of them since we were about 7 or 8 but feel like it's been getting more awkward between us recently but I wouldn't say it's that awkward. 

I don't know whether this is normal or if they aren't really my friends. 

Should I stay with them or move on. I mean we're going to college next year so we might not all go to the same one but I think we are all planning on going to the same one.
