0,"So I'm off school and my sleeping schedule is really screwed up. Today I stayed up until like 8 am, then fell asleep and woke up at 5:30 pm. I hate having my sleep schedule messed up because then I just waste the day but I want to go out and do things. I try to pull all nighters and then go to sleep early to fix it but it never works.

1,"I could write pages and pages, but I don't know how much that would help.

In summary, I'm a very business/machinist/custom fabrication savvy person in school for engineering. I have Ehlers Danlos, Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, Pelvic Floor Dysfunction, and a severe case of Peroneal Tendonitis. The last three all being by-products of Ehlers Danlos. This has affected my life from the age of around 12, though peaked when I was ~16.5 years old. It left me urinating from 30-70 times daily (which as of three months ago, has been lowered to 20-40 times daily but with much less pain via Rapaflo, a medication I wish I would've been put on seven years ago...), unable to use my right arm for two years, unable to keep my head upright for one year, unable to walk without being in searing pain for ~1.5 years, though I still have incredible issues walking without a brace as of right now, in near never-ending daily pain for ~6 years, as in, way over what would've sent me to an emergency room when I was 11-12, near constant. Daily migraines, difficulty swallowing, waking up in the middle of the night from having stopped breathing due to hypertensed neck muscles, being incorrectly diagnosed with MS, Lupus, Segmental Dystonia, Internal Cystitis, and many other things. I've been to around 20 different doctors, only two of which I met in the past 1.5 years have been any help. After meeting those doctors, I went to the Mayo Clinic and a few other vascular/neurological specialists hours away from my home, was finally diagnosed with TOS (though I've known I've had it for ~2.5 years) and am currently headed to Boston for surgery with arguably the best surgeon in the nation five months from now to remove two of my ribs and possibly other stuff. I don't know if I should disclose this via rules, but I live in Ohio

Throughout this all, I've had not the slightest amount of support from either parent, aside from the use of a car - which I wasn't allowed to get my license for until I was 17.5 years old. I had to make all of my own doctors appointments, showed up to some and was told it was illegal for me to be here on my own under age, yadda yadda. 

Despite dealing with chronic pain all throughout highschool and sleeping ~12+ hours a day, I scored a 32 on my ACT, a 36 in English, high in several others, but kinda poor in math (like a 26-27) because my teacher just thought I was the biggest piece of shit for not knowing how to deal with severe chronic pain at the age of 15. That got me automatically accepted into my engineering school (I also got accepted to Notre Dame, but would've had to pay good money for it and knew I couldn't go for medical reasons) which I ask myself why I'm going to every day. Surprisingly, I've kept up halfway decent grades and made fairly decent bonds with many professors and staff members. A prof of mine actually paid for my trip to the Mayo Clinic, but I can't keep going to him and I already feel terrible about it in the first place. 

Anyways, I've been living at home all of college and I literally still feel like I'm 13 years old. Now would probably be a good time to mention, from ages 14-16 I ran an online (ebay) store where I sold completely custom fabricated stuff, that I designed and made myself. In short, I made $35,000 in those two years, and put near all of it towards payments on my large house that my parents can't afford and could never possibly in the rest of their shit miserable lives deserve. Yeah, I was dumb and thought maybe my situation would change. Aside from the fact my parents got pissed at the fact I was making more money than they ever had their entire lives and near every day threw my workshop/raw materials into piles in corners, my medical situation (where I lost complete use of my right arm) at age 16 made me have to completely stop running my store. Since then, I've lived on less than $20/week, typically less. I generally eat bad food that's kept around my house, but every day I make a shake that costs around $1.5 with a vitamix that a friend gave me when he moved away. It comes out to around 12-1400 calories, and if I eat nothing else throughout the day it's not exactly going to be the end of the world. I do however also make potatoes, spaghetti, eggs, etc. I'm actually a really great cook too, it's pretty unfortunate I can't buy any ingredients.

But anyways, I guess that's for the most part background. Here's really the ""advice"" request portion of my post - I just don't want to do anything anymore. I can't stand being in this house any longer. Studying biomechanics, anatomy, and doing my own physical therapy and with a lot of medication, I've gotten to a point where I can run an online store again. However, I have no space to work, keep the slightest amount of materials, and all of my tools (soldering station, files, donated 3D printer, etc) get thrown in a pile daily. I currently have very niche in demand products I could make if I had the slightest place to do it. But I wake up every day, no longer wanting to finish my degree. It seems so hopeless. I have some student loans incoming, but not enough to live off of, even with the large amount of scholarships I got as well. I wouldn't have enough room in an overly expensive dorm to do any of my physical therapy (have to have enough open room for my body, flat on the ground, in a star shape, then enough to twist a broomstick side to side) and I also wouldn't really be able to live in a dorm while recovering from having two of my ribs removed. I need to see another specialist in Cleveland (3.5 hours from my location) for the pelvic floor dysfunction (Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, Pelvic Floor Dysfunction, Prostatitis, and Internal Cystitis are all incredibly life and career ruining illnesses that are barely known about) as 8 years of urologists even at OSU were unable to help. 

Despite all of this, I'm still a very clean, organized, hygienic, well rounded and somewhat intelligent person. I get pretty confused and in the literal meaning of it, retarded more often as of late because of brachial ischemia due to the TOS, but I have days where my circulation is fairly decent and I can think pretty clearly. My TOS causes 95% occlusion of the veins/arteries passing through my brachial plexus when raised 45* above shoulder level. 

But yeah. I just don't know what to do. Family has no money, parents are also pieces of shit. In college, can't really afford it, can't work a ""real"" job until I have surgery, don't want to finish college because of the hopeless situation, parents are pieces of shit, just got back on medicare after being kicked off 6 months ago due to my mother making like, $10.50 an hour at a new job, could make a ton of money if I had a small workshop space to myself and didn't live around 24/7 toxicity and yelling.

If anybody managed to read all of this and has a sliver of advice they could give me, I'd truly appreciate it. Most of my professors are just stumped. 

Thanks all.",20Jul2018,1
2,"Earlier this afternoon I was given a job offer within the same company, but different states. I have not officially accepted the position but plan to tomorrow afternoon and I’m struggling with how to go about turning in my two weeks notice. My original plan was to accept the job offer tomorrow and turn in my two weeks notice on Monday morning, but then I remembered that my boss will be leaving Monday for a two week long vacation. Being that I am staying in the same company I do not want to burn any bridges at my current job, but I feel horrible telling my boss that I’m leaving right before he goes on vacation. 

Does anyone have any advice? I am also slightly afraid of jumping the gun and telling my boss my plans to leave prior to actually accepting &amp; signing the offer.",20Jul2018,1
3,"I'm 17 and yes, I'm scared as fuck about my future. 
Okay so I have a 3rd grade math level or less, I don't even think I have any skills even though I've taken many different courses, such as transportation tech, to robotics. (which I did shit in) I have shit social skills and can only talk about something that isn't about small talk or something emotional. And what's even more shit is that I get overwhelmed too easily, I mean I keep getting overwhelmed by a 3 step brownie instructions guide, and I keep forgetting those steps even if I've just read them. 

On to my asthma 
My asthma is shit, I can fucking exercise for more then 20+ minutes with out me coughing a lot and my chest getting tight to the point I might have an asthma attack. When I had P.E I once has to sit out because I was about to have an asthma attack, even though I used the inhaler (with the spacer) 14+ minutes ago. 

As for my family I asked for my ssn, she denied it. I keep asking but she wouldn't budge for shit, I asked if she could help me make a bank account so I can get a job, no matter how many times I've asked she didn't do anything. And out of nowhere I'm out in a benefits interview? I've told her that I should go out and see if I really an that disabled but she said no. 

After all this my self esteem has dropped too damn low, that I have begun questioning if she's right? I mean I know I'm young but so far I sometimes feel like I won't be able to do anything, and this feeling of dread keeps growing every day.

4,"I received an email today from accounting, stating that they over paid me $405 which will show up on tomorrow's check.

But ADDITIONALLY paid the holiday pay and the 2 PTO days. They stated it was to late to correct the mistake, therefore on the following check They will deduct that amount. My immediate boss looked online and found some states it is illegal for the employer to do that. If I'm not mistaken,  in Ohio the employee must sign a document agreeing to this. I need advice as to how to handle the situation. Do I go with the flow what work says? Or is this a bigger issue that must be taken care of in a specific manner? Thanks.",20Jul2018,1

6,"Hey there, it’s basically the title, but for some background:

I’ve been hospitalized twice for mental health issues, planning to die, that kind of thing. I’ve had depression/anxiety since I was about 12, I’m 23 now. Brother is 18. We’re trying to work together since they went through the “worst” with me (my wording, not theirs). This has been months coming and only a few weeks ago did he put to words that he needs help. I was so proud of him for actually saying anything, as wording his feelings aren’t his strong suit. My parents have also been very supportive, making sure the doctors are called and he sees his therapist, who he gets along with. 

My brother is different than I was though. He doesn’t actually want to die, but he’s so depressed all the time. He’s in a relationship with his on-off girlfriend and while I’m sure they do love each other, it’s been kind of toxic each time they’ve been together and I know if they break up is going to be really bad for him. He’s terrified constantly that they’re going to break up and I think she’s about to cry uncle since it’s just been a lot on her as well. He’s always had a bit of a self confidence issue which was staved off a bit when he started body building, but lately he’s been too tired and nauseous to do that and has lost quite a bit of weight. 

The past three weeks have been especially difficult. I’m away from home, like thousands of miles and a plane ride away- and I want to be there for him as much as possible. My parents will text me whenever he’s having a particularly rough day, and it’s been every few days for the past few weeks. He’ll be up and down again. He doesn’t have much to do at home before he goes back to college and that also plays a part in it- and while we’re hoping once he gets there he’ll been occupied enough, I want to have some idea of what to do in the interim. 

He’s in therapy, probably going to start twice a week next week. The first medication he tried made him really suicidal, trying a new one within the next 24 hours. I just want something in case it also doesn’t work. 

If there’s some books or articles anyone can recommend or some action we can take in the meantime, it would really help. I’m all over the place and I know it’s killing my parents to see him like this. We all just want the best for him. Help?

7,"I apologize for the format in advance, I’m on mobile. I’m 17 and currently work at Wendy’s. This is my first job and I’ve only worked there for about three weeks (beginning on July 3rd). Yesterday during a shift, a group of thugs(?) came in and essentially threw a tantrum and beat one of my pregnant coworkers, leaving a series of scabs on her. They also broke one of the chairs in the dining room. After this incident, a couple of close friends and my older brother advised me not to go to work tomorrow as the environment is deemed unsafe to them. However, I’m afraid of not being able to find another job after this. The only reason I got this one is because my brother’s friend referred me. I feel like I don’t really have anything going for me at the moment but this. To conclude, I have a shift tomorrow and I’m unsure as to whether or not I should go. My brothers friend who got me the job told me he was quitting (not going to work regardless of any shifts scheduled for him) and that he will be finding another job...Should I too?

8,"TL/DR at the bottom! I am 19 years old. After taking a year off upon graduating high school and working on my mental health/recovering from anorexia, I enrolled in a university 8 hours away from my hometown. 

My parents have been smoking 1/2 pack to a whole pack a day since I was born and constantly dismiss the risks surrounding cigarettes. Today, a family friend - who was a smoker - passed away suddenly due to a myriad of complications regarding his lungs and heart. For the last couple of years my younger sister (16) and I have made multiple futile attempts to talk to our parents about their addiction and the result has always been ""we'll think about it"". However, with me moving 8 hours away and starting university + the most recent passing of our family friend, my sister and I decided to have another discussion with my parents today. 

After lecturing them to no response, the room became a cliche Netflix drama and I frustratingly told them that I want nothing more than for my parents to be there for my sister and I as we grow into adults, to attend our weddings, to be around for their grandkids, etc. Again, no response. I finally told them that I refuse to attend university and build my own future if they have no desire to be apart of it. In retrospect, I feel guilty and selfish for making such a bold claim. I struggled with addiction (benzos, opioids, marijuana and alcohol) all throughout high school and now that I've been sober for 14 months, it pains me to see my parents constantly denying the health risks of smoking. I understand that this is definitively blackmail, but I didn't know what else to say in the moment. For what it's worth, I am aware that it's naive to deny myself a future just because of their addiction.

Any advice?

TL/DR: Parents have been smoking anywhere between 1/2 pack to 1 pack a day for 20+ years. Family friend passed away today due to heart and lung problems as a result of smoking. Have made multiple attempts to talk to my parents about their addiction and they've always dismissed me and the risks of smoking. I am due to start university this fall and told them that I refuse to build a future for myself if they have no intention of keeping healthy enough to be apart of it. ",20Jul2018,0
9,"I have been living with two random girls this summer and our lease is for about 2.5 months. I am leaving in a few days, and they will be here for about 3 more weeks.

What's a nice way of asking about the details of employment with A in the context of receiving an offer from their competitor B, without seeming cocky or demanding?

12,"TL;DR : My mom is mentally ill. She gets little medical support and struggles to cope. I financially support her, but I'm a student moving away in a month and I can only keep this up for so long. Am I enabling her, or should I keep helping?

Tldr above because this might get long. Questions are at the bottom.

So, I live with my mother and grandfather. Grandpa gets Social Security checks and while money is tight, he gets by. I've paid him rent in advance to last until I leave next month, $500/month. I just didn't want to have to think about it anymore so 4 months ago I wrote him a check for $2500, and of course I was paying him monthly beforehand.

Dad died 6 years ago and my mother has spent every last dime he left her. If not for my Grandpa, we'd be homeless.

My story is, I'm a 20 year old student transferring to a college 500 miles away from home. I chose to do so instead of staying here because I was afraid of getting stuck here (I very nearly dropped out and took a low-wage full time landscaping job, friend of mine smacked some sense into me). Even going to University here, that pull from financial and familial desperation would always exist. Had to get away. My plan right now is to graduate in 2 years with a BS in Ecology, with the intention of going to grad school, internships, working my way up, the whole shebang. Well, not just intention, it's what I'm going to do, come Hell or High Water. I'm the usual story of being from a working-class family and 1st to go to college, so this is a huge dream for me.

Enter my mother. She's 45 years old. She has congestive heart failure (which doctors blame on the fact that she was a meth addict before she got pregnant and married my dad), is currently a pain pill addict, has had at least 2 strokes and possibly more, and has just terrible mental health. History of being abused in every way, trauma, and the general depression/anxiety that's common in both sides of the family and I myself inherited. Her MediCal gives her 1 psychiatrist visit a month to get her prescription refilled and only 1 therapist visit a month aswell. Doesn't seem to have been effective, nor like she really wants the help. She also hasn't worked for ~9 years that I can remember, possibly longer. She has no degrees or certifications, although she was a Certified Nurse's Assistant for a time. My dad did put her through LVN school, but even though she graduated she failed every attempt at the NCLEX (big nursing exam you gotta pass) and gave up. That was back when he was still alive, so at least 6 years ago. She's been job searching, but she's been struggling. To be honest, she's botched every interview she's gotten. She has horrible soft skills, can be quite condescending, and has one Hell of a victim complex. She also had that antiquated mentality of go down, shake hands, demand a job and you're in. And if not, you shouldn't have to send out more than 20 applications to get in somewhere. 50 tops. So yeah, she didn't go into her search knowing what the market is really like either. She gets ~$130/month in food assistance, and was denied gov't Disability benefits which she's appealing but I don't really see her getting.

Now, money. As I type this, I have about $33,500 in the bank. That money has come from my own saving over the years, a little luck with Bitcoin, and a legal settlement related to my father's death. ($25k up front, $11260/year until I turn 26. Started when I was 19). I've always tried to be somewhat careful, but admittedly splurged here and there and spent some on travel. Silly me thought Mom would have her crap together and not run herself broke. I give her $1k/month (about the same as my paycheck) for the cell phones, car insurance, groceries, gas in the car, and her medicine that our shitty MediCal refuses to pay for despite her cardiologist demanding that she needs it to survive/rant. I did apply for financial aid, got a good amount in grants with a gap of ~$10500 for this year, which the annuity payment covers perfectly. Awesome. Now, I might not get as much next year because I made about $34K compared to last year's $13k (Thx to Bitcoin). I know I can pay for my last 2 years of college out of pocket, and I've read all about how to get Grad School paid for. And lucky for Grandpa, they won't have to worry about feeding me or paying for the utilities I use up once I'm gone. I just don't know what to do about the drain on my finances that is my mother. I guess I'm gonna stop right here and get to the point because I know I'm awfully long winded.

Do I cut her off completely? Reduce the amount after I leave and let her slowly go into more and more debt? F$%^ what if she kills herself (she's tried before and often talks about how low she gets)? Or keep giving her money until I have nothing left and I lose the entire head start that not only I've worked so hard for but that my father died for?",20Jul2018,1
13,"Long story short, I got laid off in Feb, and I took a contract job in May, and it has been an absolute hell since I started for the following reasons:

-I was lied too about what the job was, I was told it would be like my last job, but its really just data entry and filing (my recruiter said he didn't know)

-Micromangement: Literally every minute and every single thing we touch has to be tracked. I mean that I have to clock out to go to the bathroom, they make us count literally everything we sort and file (and of course we have to change our assignments in the system every time we switch tasks), and if we deviate from the system even slightly, we get yelled out in front of everyone. This is difficult because the system changes at least once a week and we don't even know about it until we are informed we fucked up.

-Which brings me to my last point, everyone at the office is so fucking petty. Our managers belittle us in front of everyone, and never pull us to the side, even for the little things. It seems that some of the perm employees think they are managers, because they do the same to us, and they will report any minor infractions to the managers as soon as they see them (one woman comes out at 8:32 to make sure everyone is there). Also, when I am 5 minutes late, my boss speaks to my bosses boss and I get called into the office to explain myself.

This contract is effecting my mental health, and I want out ASAP. This is my first assignment with this recruiter, and it is supposed to be a 6 month assignment. However, I am at 2 months and a week and I am ready to break, this is literally the worst job I have ever had. Should I ask my recruiter for a new assignment? If so, how do I go about it?

14,"So ill keep this short for all of you but I’ve been working at this company for about half a year..and i just haven’t felt right with my crew of people for some reason. fast forward to today:



a co worker did not complete her work and used my name as an excuse..she said i asked her a question (which let’s say was asked at 1 and solved at 1:03) and we work until 430. i let her know that please don’t mention me because that’s a strange reason to use in explaining why you didn’t complete your work.ok ok, so we solve that and keep it going..



then i receive a call from my supervisor after hours: she claims that she heard from multiple people that i had taken a photo of the same coworkers computer. 



this is a very very serious offense to me. as i would never do something like this..but i’m innocent so that’s fine. now i’ll have to defend myself and live with the fact that some coworkers actually said that about me..i don’t know if they were angry that i told my coworker not to mention me and now are retaliating?

16,"Got a strange situation going. I've got a (admittedly attractive) female co-worker. We've been a bit flirty, certainly very friendly, text a lot, hang out at work during slow times a lot, etc. We have similar interests, same sense of humor, watch the same shows, etc. We've even hung out outside of work a couple of times. But due to my company position, I wouldn't pursue anything romantic with her, and I'm pretty sure she feels the same way.  


Now, she is leaving for another job. I had thought about asking her out since we had such a good connection, but she recently started seeing someone (in the past month or so). No big deal, it happens, good for her. But here's what I don't understand. She will not admit that she is seeing someone. I've brought it up a few times, often in a joking manner, and she always responds ""I don't know what you're talking about"". She literally will not admit to seeing some guy.  


She's on Facebook, but we aren't friends there due to work and my position. She apparently has made no attempts to hide it on Facebook, as other people at work have mentioned in passing. I mentioned to another person at work that this girl ""got a new place to live, a new job, a new man, new everything apparently!"", again as a joke. And this person said they had seen posts by her on FB that 'alluded' to that.  


Again...why would she do this? I find her attractive, sure, but I don't have a crush on her. My feelings aren't hurt by her seeing someone. So it's not like she's sparing my feelings. Further, she's shared all kinds of personal stuff with me, like her son that ran away and doesn't have contact with her anymore, or her problems with her ex-husband. I've met her kids multiple times and am on a first name basis with them. So it's not like she wants to keep personal business to herself. Our offices are right next to each other, so I can hear her talking and giggling with her man on the phone in the mornings. She has to realize that, as we've helped each other with work related stuff when we overhear the other dealing with an issue one of us might know more about.  


I'd feel the same way if a male friend did something similar. You'll tell me all about your life and what you're doing, send me memes and selfies, but will act dumb if I brought up their girlfriend?

Last year around October 3 of us were planning a group trip to another country. Since I had the money and felt it was a good gift I ended up buying the airplane tickets and airbnb. I thought it was an appropriate gift knowing how close we were. I assumed wrong because one of the 2 girls thought it was too big of a gift and cancelled. I kind of got mad at her, but I got over it after awhile. The other one was shocked, but she was excited and ready for the trip.

The one that was still going asked me a few things about the place we were staying at a month before the trip. My dumb ass got nervous and started avoiding her and not responding. A few days later when I finally got the courage I told her in a text that I was so sorry but I wasn't going to be able to go on the trip. I didn't have the money and had not planned out anything well I told her. 

In hindsight now, I know I fucked up and should have been upfront with her. Instead I ignored her and made everything worse. Anyways she blew up on text telling me that I should have been honest and responded instead of being shady af. I knew I had fucked up so I didn't respond because I didn't know what to say. 

After that her and the other 2 friends stopped talking to me. They would hangout and do things but never invite me. I know I fucked up but I did not think I would lose all my friends over my stupid actions. I decided to give my friend some time to cool off and tried talking to her a month later, but she wouldn't respond to my messages asking if we could talk. After another while I sent her a text that said '""Can we please talk?"" and she finally responded ""No"" 

I want advice on what I should do now? I feel pathetic because it has literally been around 6 months since January and I have not moved on from the situation. I still care about all 3 of them but I feel like they hate me. I'm not sure what the one that is mad at me feels because we never got to clear the air...should I try to contact her one last time? I want to go to her house and knock on her door and just apologize and fix everything between us. My family and other friends tell me it's a bad idea but I don't know what to do. Do you think I have any chance of salvaging our friendships even though so many months have passed? I would think after all this time she isn't mad at me and would be willing to talk? I just wish I had never ignored her, but obviously I can't go back in time....what should I do? 

Sorry for making this so long, thank you to anyone that reads the full story",20Jul2018,1
22,"I’m a little emotionally drained right now so please forgive me if I struggle to articulate. About six months ago I started a great job. Competitive pay, benefits at a well respected tech company. 

For the most part, it’s been better than jobs I’ve had in the past and the compensation really does help. However, I’m finding myself about five months into this role feeling dismissed, marginalized, and taken for granted. This was a pattern at the last job I had as well and standing up for myself led to me being wrongfully terminated. I was basically the office scapegoat and whipping girl. This is been a pattern throughout my life starting from an abusive childhood.

I’m a pretty shy/sensitive person and speaking up is hard for me. I also have a stutter and pretty much my only saving grace is that I am “pretty” but it doesn’t help me that much nor would special treatment for that or any reason. I’m friendly-ish but tend to keep to myself and sometimes tend to be a people pleaser which hasn’t always served me well. I get very caught up in what people think of me and feel anxious when I’m under any scrutiny.

It also doesn’t help that I work in a less technical role at a tech company so people often assume that I’m clueless even though I’ve been embedded in the product teams and know a lot about what we do. I know I’m kind of rambling right now but I’m not really sure what to ask. I guess just mostly I’m starting to feel burned out from being spoken down to, talked over, and totally dismissed by people. 

I’m not sure how to stand up for myself without steamrolling or alienating the wrong people but it’s starting to get upsetting. The other thing is that this treatment is just subtle enough that I wonder if it’s just in my head and I’m really just being too sensitive? Everybody needs me all the time but act like they could do my job better than me. It starts to make me wonder if I will ever succeed.",20Jul2018,1
24,"I am the only one in my family who isn't religous. No one knows this. Even my husband doesn't know the full extent. I'm sure they have some suspicions.

My oldest son is 5 and will be starting kindergarten this year. My inlaws have been really pushing for him to go to the same school as my niece. It's very religious and would be teaching him things I don't agree with. They've even offered to pay the tuition. 

How do I decline their offer without explaining why I don't want to send him there? If they find out what my beliefs are, I could be facing a divorce or even lose my kids. I know it sounds extreme but they are extreme and it wouldn't be outside the realm of possibility.

25,"My grandparents dog is a mutt, a small dog - I’m not sure what kind. She bites, barks, and won’t let me near her. No history of abuse, they got her as a puppy and spoiled the shit out of her. The only time she’ll come near me is when its time to get fed, they have her on a strict schedule. 

I have a dog of my own, he’s a sweetheart golden. She’s bitten him and drawn blood a couple of times, but he just growls and chills. I scolded her and separated them. Couple days later they seem like pals, but she cowers behind him whenever I get near and she bites him if I get to close. My dog doesn’t retaliate besides growling, but he’s got bite marks all over his legs now. 

Unless it’s feeding time, she bites and barks constantly. She’s bitten my roommate a couple times, bitten me at least a dozen. It’s like hit and runs, she panics then attacks out nowhere. Also doesn’t come when I call her name, unless I have a treat, then growls at me until I set it down. Taking her outside is a bitch, she has to be on a leach and tried to bite you the entire time. 

The dog has been fine around my grandparents. But I’ve got another week and a half of this little devil and not sure what to do about it.

27,"Alright so as you can see by the title it's pretty self explanatory but I need help because I have some clue of what to do but not all. Basically me and my girlfriend were having sex and right as we finished we hear a knock on the door. We both rush and get a blanket and get under it. The knock was her dad and basically he was just like why are you naked (not in a gullible way) and yea basically just left. He didn't see us in the act but I bet he had his suspicions. 

He goes upstairs then my girlfriend goes upstairs and from what she told me he's not very mad he's just mad at the fact that we were home alone when we shouldn't have been and he's worried that we are having sex. After this I went upstairs and apologized he said it was ok just don't do it again. (Tension kind of still lingering of course) 

As much as I would like to accept this and move on I feel it's my responsibility to do something about it. My girlfriend told me to text him apologizing and say things like, ""I'm sorry for being home alone, I'll make sure a parent is home before I come over (blah blah) we aren't having sex she told me she wants to wait and I respect that."" 

Things like that but I need a strong consensus from you guys because I'm still shocked and I know she is too.

28,"Hi, I'm currently in summer school going into grade 10. I have never faced any academic issues in elementary school, or grade 9. I got As and Bs for the most part. But, for some reason during my time at summer school and at the end of grade 9, I started losing motivation for school. Every time my mark goes down, I mainly just shrug it off and play video games instead of studying harder. The thing is, when I was younger, I used to stress and cry every time I got lower than an 80 on a test. I don't know what to do anymore. It feels like my life is going down in a spiral. I feel like I am not worth anything at the moment. I'm afraid of being a homeless bum but for some reason that doesn't give me any sort of motivation.

29,"Hello! 

First, I no longer harm myself, I see a therapist, and take supplements to deal with depression. But, in the past I used to self harm and did so for years. Just a warning I'm going to describe my self harm just so people know what I'm trying to undo. I used to pull my toe nails completely off and slice the bottoms of my feet. I was never a classic wrist cutter, but I do have one noticeable scar on my left wrist that I used to repeatedly cut open when my feet were in real bad shape. Because of this I no longer have a pinkie toe nail, all other nails are very flaky and break easily, and at this point its quite easy to pull them off or flake off. The pads of my feet are extremely leathery and look terrible. I don't really know what to do. Now that I'm out of this behavior, I'm embarrassed that someone might see my scar or feet and know that I once hurt myself. So, what I'm hoping for is some advice or suggestions. How do I make my feet not be so leathery? What do I do to improve the heath of my toe nails? And finally does anyone know of a good scar removal jell or pad they could recommend?

Tommorow at 9am (only time her parents can drop her off), a girl I have been talking to for half a month is coming over.

All may seem good and I do agree but I have never hung out with a girl with the potential to be more than friends.

We asked each other the question over text of what we would do and came to the conclusion of watching the Netflix hit series ""Grey's Anatomy"".

She sends me hearts/winky faces but I am not sure what she wants us to be. I want to make a move and cuddle and everything but am intimidated by the possiblilty she will be like ""what are you doing?""

I hope I do not make the situation awkward and I do realize if I go with the flow, things should be fine.

First off I just want to say that I feel I need a lot of advice on this since to be honest I'm still a relatively young adult (24) who also had a bit of a rough upbringing and thusly kinda just thrust out onto the world on their own with not a lot to know about so I do have a lot of questions on how to do this and where to get started.  


Okay so this won't be happening for a while as I still have some goals in between this one that I need to work towards like getting a car for example which that in and of itself is becoming a bit of a hassle due to issues with trying to get a replacement social security card. I plan on moving to Seattle in the future but wouldn't know how to go about it either by car or air. If by air I wouldn't know how to go about getting all of my stuff from point A (Illinois) to point B (Washington State). I flew by air from Louisiana to here initially a year and a half ago but that wasn't much of an issue in terms of moving stuff considering I was basically starting from scratch because I had lost everything I owned in a massive flooding event back in August 2016.

I have a pretty decent, steady income thanks to the job I work at so I have that covered in terms of working towards saving up to get where I need to go. Another thing that has been bugging me is thinking of the hassle it would be to have to change a lot of things like addresses for my bills and such and I'm not even sure how to go about that.  


I don't know how to continue going about asking this without going off on a tangent that I feel would completely go on forever because this topic feels so broad to me cause I have way too many questions to ask about this.

38,"I wear contacts. This morning when I went to put one in, I realized there was only one in the case.

No where, ok I still have a couple pairs left so I open a new one. Where them all day at work, then for a few hours at home with no problems. 

So I'm playing on my phone and I feel that *contact out of place behind eye lid* feeling..but I can still see fine. I take my contacts out, but the feelings still there. (I triple checked there is definently one contact in each side.) I'm worried I could have but both contacts into one side of the case last night and some how not realized and put both in one side?

I swear it's there but it moves out of view. If it is a contact it's stuck as hell, if it's not I don't know what it is. I tried to get it out at first but I don't want to fuck with my eye too bad especially if it's not a contact. Light head ache, probably from looking around all crazy trying to move it. 

Yeah should probably just go to the hospital. Well, I live in the the US so it's a last resort but I'm curious if anyone else has had something like this happen.

42,"Hi! Okay, so I made the choice to attend community college for my freshman year of college. In high school I had severe medical issues that caused me to miss over a quarter of each school year. These caused my grades to drop drastically every single year from where they were when I was healthy. Although I was accepted into schools that I really loved, I did not receive any financial aid from them so that meant they were out of the cards for me. Within the past year my medical problems have improved dramatically, and I’ve been able to attend college with regularity. So after a semester at community college, I have earned a 4.0 gpa. I was planning to transfer into a 4-year college after my two years at this college, but because of this I’m thinking if I keep my grades up for the second semester I might apply to transfer for my sophomore year. However, I’m unsure if the amount of school work that I will be applying with will be sufficient in outweighing my grades from high school. My high school gpa was a 2.7UW and 3.2W, and although I took nothing but AP and Honors courses I know that my gpa and transcript are nowhere near impressive. I also know that by the time my application goes to the schools, the only grades they will have seen are the ones for the first semester. So with that all being said my question is: would it be a bad idea to apply to transfer after only one year?

For those who are curious/care to know: My medical issues were 2 concussions within my junior and senior years, hemiplegic migraines (basically migraines that cause stroke symptoms), as well as anxiety and depression. 

AND IM SORRY FOR WRITING SO MUCH, SO IN SUMMARY:
High School GPA of 2.7UW/3.2W (+med issues)
College GPA of 4.0 after one semester
Looking to transfer colleges, unsure of whether to do so after one or two years of improved grades. 
Sample of colleges looking to apply to: BU, NYU, Tufts, Williams

He just didn't think things through a lot and said/did shit that hurt her feelings. He made mistakes like everybody does. Nothing physical and no cheating ever happened.

He said, ""How can I forgive myself when I know I did wrong, I will never be able to fix the pain I caused her and she will never forgive me?"". He feels so bad and so guilty that he's considering suicide. He didn't explicitly say ""If she forgives me I won't kill myself"" but I know if she did that would be his first step towards forgiving himself and getting himself out of his depression.

65,"Well long story short(ish), I got back together with my ex about 4 months ago, going on 5. We had originally broken up becuase of his drug use and the issues that come along with it. But he told me he was clean and honestly he seemed like it. He was bright eyed and focused, he was really putting me and our relationship front and center. 

Due to trust issues from our past tho, I still felt the need to drug test him. Honestly this was mainly for my own well being to help me be able to trust him more. The test looked for weed, opiates,  Amphetamines, and a few other that I don't remember. I think it was a 5 panel drug test. He passed and I was honestly so happy I cried. It was like a weight lifted off me. 

He was okay with it when I asked him originally, but the next day he got very mad at me and we had a big fight. I was more so pissed that he was trying to hold something against me when I specifically asked him before I even told him I had the test.

Well fast forward to yesterday, I found the backing to a fentanyl patch at his house. When I confronted him about it he was kinda dodgy and get really defensive. He did tell me that if he was using fentanyl that it woulda shown up on the test I had him do and the backing was probably just and old one he had over looked. But I checked today. Fentanyl wouldnt have shown up on a 5 panel drug test, and I feel like he had to have known that. Hes a really smart person especially when it comes to that kinda stuff.

Hes also been distant and he seems to be always tired. And when I was at his house yesterday his eyes were really droopy and his pupils were way smaller than normal.

So to the question at hand, am I wrong to want to retest him? Just specifically for fentanyl since it wouldnt have been caught in the first test. I'm just really worried for him and for us. And honestly I have to know if hes lying to me again. I don't wanna push with asking him too much because I know that's just gonna discourage him if his is still clean and thats the last thing I wanna do. I'm also worried that he'll get mad at me again. I honestly dont feel like he understands where I'm standing in this situation. I just dont know what to do.",20Jul2018,3

We eventually cut him out the group. But now he's coming in the picture again and even though I didn't want him to come back in the picture, I specifically told them to not meet up with him or else I'd leave the group.

72,"Hi all, 

Buckle in. 

About 9-10 months ago I took on a new job, basically an inventory/asset control position for a large scale business. There were some hiccups when I first started, but things stabilized and there hadn't been any issues or problems for months.

Up until about the last week or so. There was a major project that I was a part of. Due to some fumbling on my end, I've had at least 2 different departments absolutely not want anything to do with me and we've had to had another manager to hop in and assist me. 

I have a meeting coming up shortly to discuss how to move forward. Basically, the goal is to try and win back the trust of one of the departments and get everyone back on the same page. They are in a position where if there is one more issue they're basically rioting.

Some context on things: I was part of a larger restructuring for the company I work for, which resulted in somewhere between 80-90% of all veteran staff being cleared out for fresh faces. Certain positions were occupied with senior or experienced staff members, but there was a lot of fresh blood coming in, including with my department, particularly with my department, actually. 

I had expressed concerns about going into the aforementioned project with an inexperienced team (indeed, I was hiring people to fill roles basically up until the last minute) and there were some things outside of my control (other departments not scheduled, not being informed about things from other departments, etc.) 

In an attempt to be fixing/resolving things, I ended up going nearly 3 days straight without sleep and haven't had a day off in nearly 20 days, as I'm working (of my own choice) to try and resolve and fix as many things as possible. 

How can I build trust and rebuild relationships with a department that is overly hostile/does not like me and is very integral to my continued employment?

73,"She’s been having a very, very bad couple of days. 
Basically, her mom and her don’t get along what-so-ever. 

From the moment she can remember, she has always had problems with her mom. 
It’s always like one good day out of the seven days of the week. 
They argue so much, they go back and forth because her mom was raised very strict and so she’s trying to raise her like that, but giving her like one day (maybe) to hang out with me and all of a sudden that’s a lot of permission. 
Her mom thinks that my GF working is a bad thing because she has the rest of her life to work and she should focus on school. (She’s going onto her senior year of High School)
Her mom doesn’t like me at all, hates me with all her guts, to the point that if she sees me, her day is automatically bad. 

By the way, my GF is stuck home from Wednesday until Saturday. 

Now, the reason my GF is depressed is because they had an argument and these were the key points. 

- They’re moving back to their home country (literally unlivable and she’d rather die starving than live here) 
-Mom can’t take this anymore (working a lot and taking care of her two daughters)
-If they go back, she can basically give them to their father so she doesn’t have to worry about them. 
-GF doesn’t do anything in the house (Even though she cleans everyday) 
-GF ask for too much permission (Once a week or two, wow) 
-GF gets all the blame while her younger sister is super lazy and doesn’t do ANYTHING (Little sister is 10, doesn’t go out and spends everyday at home, gets mad when GF tells her too clean)
-GF should be the example for her younger sister but younger sister doesn’t listen to GF.

Then they talked the next day and my GF said these 
-Says it’s not just the GF and little sister that should change, it has to be us 3 
-That moving back will ruin their future because it’s very bad time to move back 
-That her little sister should listen
-That she wants to be independent and doesn’t want to ask for stuff from her mom. 

And the one that the mom got really offended of...

-That mom doesn’t buy her anything, not even when GF was a little girl. 


Well this blew up, ended up arguing about that, her mom called grandma and told on GF and now grandma is saying how amazing mom is. 
And now GF beats herself up for mentioning that and saying she’s dumb for doing that. 

(Her mom is very controlling, wants everything her way and she’s right 110% of the time and nobody can do anything about it)

And now she’s just sad, being stuck home is horrible to her, not being able to see me is affecting her too, not having friends is bad too. 
She doesn’t want to talk, or eat. 
She’s not motivated to do anything 

And I’m scared, I don’t know what to do. I’m watching this all happen and I’m scared and worried. 

I try to see her as much as possible, I try to give her pep talks and motivate her but nothing. 

TLDR; mom is crazy (lol) wants to basically get rid of her responsibility as a mom and move back to their home country to make them go be with dad.
Saying they’ll move back and my GF is the worst even though she’s like a dream child to have. 
Trying to talk calm, ended up in a discussion about mom not buying anything for GF and GF beats herself up for it. 
Not seeing me, her friends and staying home all day affects her and is now depressed.

74,"tl;dr: My social life and I were role playing, I was Nero and it was Rome. 

I'm not sure what to do or where to go from where I am currently. Maybe that's wrong, it's not that I don't know where to go as much as I don't know if I can keep moving anymore. 

Everything started ramping up about a year ago. I'd finally made friends again, for the first time in years. I was content, if a little lonely romantically. I went on occasional dates, talked with a few girls, but nothing serious which didn't sit well with me. I've always been heavily driven by love, so not finding it was seriously grating on me. Several false starts turned into me confiding in one of my newest friends, Kelly. 

She was a lot like me. We were both doing researchy things and tutoring at the local university and started to see each other through our work. We had a few mutual friends, even a friend of hers from high school who was my sister's best friend. We gradually started going from seeing each other once every few weeks to it being rare to not see each other in a day, and she began to open up to me. About her suicidal brother, Graham. I let her know about my battling depression, how I'd gotten through it, how she could probably help him. I got to know Graham and went out of my way to let him know that he wasn't alone when possible. About her boyfriend, Sam. A guy who she didn't seem happy with. Who she told me she had nothing in common with other than being outdoorsy. If you're paying attention and decent at inferring I think you can tell where this is going. 

Me being me, I assumed that no one living with their boyfriend would actively pursue another guy. Especially when they also lived with her brother, who was also Sam's best friend. Kelly proved me wrong by asking me, a few months into us being best friend adjacent, ""Could we kiss?"".  

I turned her down, ""I would, and I'm sure it'd be great, but you're not single."" And then I drove her home. But her question clawed itself into my head. I felt her pulling away, realized that the friendship wasn't platonic, and I hated being reminded of what it was to lose someone. Well, her sister and I became friends. Ariel asked me one day, ""Do you have the hots for my sister?"" And, for some reason, I didn't lie about the fact that I was. In talked with Ariel I realized that I had to say something, because it was getting unbearable. 

So I planned on heading to an art thing with her, that I'd let her know how I felt. Not a ""Be with me or we're not friends."" kind of thing, or a ""Choose between me or your boyfriend."" sort of thing, just relieving the pressure that had been building for months. But she chose to invite Sam, and I stayed home. I really shouldn't have stayed home. Honestly, a lot of things should've gone differently that night, because around 11pm I got a call from Ariel, ""He's dead."" While Kelly and Sam had been gone, Graham drove to the middle of nowhere and ended his life. 

Ariel told Kelly what I'd said shortly after. She let me know that she knew on the night of Graham's wake. And that she didn't want to lose me. And then we talked, for hours. And then we kissed. And we nearly slept together. And then we did the following day. I'd never done something like that, never let my emotion overpower my reason to that extent. And we kept making the same mistake for awhile. I told her we couldn't keep doing it, that I couldn't handle it, that we needed to just be friends unless she became single. And she went on a vacation with Sam for 2 weeks, I assumed she'd made her choice.

So when I found myself clicking with a girl named Kayla, found someone who was available and absolutely hilarious, it felt like serendipity. But this too was not a simple relationship, she'd previously dated one of my friends. While they dated I was living out of town and rarely saw either of them. They'd lived together, he'd broken up with her and kicked her out about 6 months prior. I thought it would be ok, but apparently just her and I hanging out without any romantic or sexual happenings was enough for him to call me human garbage. 

Well, I was lonely and reeling from Kelly. Kayla made me feel happy and I had so much fun around her. So, I rationalized my decision by citing all the times he'd betrayed me, about how I always had to reach out to him, about how he was at fault... And he was to a degree, but I still shouldn't have started a relationship with her. Because in doing so I lost him as a friend. When Kelly got back things were as they'd been for a bit, but then she told me that she couldn't be my friend while I was dating someone else. ""I know I'm a hypocrite."", She'd told me, ""I just can't handle it."" 

Days later, wracked by indecision and heartache, I talked to Ariel. ""I don't know what to do, I don't want to lose Kelly, but I can't be someone who can't choose me."" In pain, I reached out to her, and we slept together again. I felt like my friend was right, I was human garbage. I was furthering a cycling of pain and infidelity. So that time I did shut it down. I told her that I didn't know what was right, but that this wasn't it. And I lost her as a friend, and the possibility of something more. I lost a lot of people when I told her I couldn't be on the backburner anymore, people who considered her their friends before they were mine. 
I told Kayla most of this, asked her if she wanted to go from a casual relationship to being monogamous and seeing where it took us, and at the time she seemed happy. 

I was in my last semester of my undergrad, but the fallout of losing so many people so quickly shut me down. I couldn't focus in class, I couldn't do work, I resigned from my job. I was entirely overwhelmed, and began to wonder if I could actually become a doctor after failing so wonderfully both in and out of school. And then it got worse.

Kayla started to let me know that she didn't trust me, especially around other women. Went from having banter and hilarity to flat jokes and long pauses. From constant sex to long dry spells. From feeling as comfortable as I have around another person to feeling as if someone had duct taped several dozen eggs to the soles of my feet. 

But I told myself it was just that I was horribly depressed. She invited me to do things with her family, and we spent almost all of our free time together. Surely, I just had to get myself together and things would go back to how they'd been. 
So I started pushing. I started trying to be the me that I love, the guy who's an idealistic dreamer hoping that he can make the world a little less bleak. I got back to exercising, I've had some pretty major lower limb injuries from sports so I wasn't doing the 20+ hours a week I'd done in the past, but I was consistent. I was able to cycle at my old pace, and I was getting strong again. And I didn't just try to get back to the academic and athletic, I made sure she knew I cared. 

I forced myself to go from avoiding everyone and everything, often ignoring Kayla's calls, to trying again. I'd take her on dates, I'd cook for her, I invited her to do things with my family. The day before she let me know she couldn't handle it anymore we went over to my Mom's house. We swam and had dinner, I fixed her swimsuit because she can't sew for shit, and we talked about how she could dogsit when my Mom headed out of town for work. Kayla loved dogs, and lived right down the street from my Mom, so it seemed great. 

Then Kayla told me she didn't want me to come with her on her family vacation. Bailed on a wedding we were supposed to go to together. ""I really should've been second guessing things at the start, not now. I'm sorry.""

And so I'm here, back to my state of loneliness. Having lost every friend I'd managed to make, having tortured myself and people who I had so much love for. I'm not sure how to keep going. I wonder if the pain of what happened made me make such terrible decisions, or if I'm just weak. I wonder if I can get over the guilt. I wonder if I'll be able to become someone who's strong enough to actually help others. I'm trapped in this darkness right now, and I'm worried I'll wind up like Graham.",20Jul2018,52

Display: 1920x1080 with IPS coating, 13 inch until max of 15.6 inch.

Processor: i7-8th gen, 4 cores.

I’m not entirely sure if this is the right subreddit to be posting this, but I need some advice on life. Right now, I am 19 years old and I finished my first year of University in May, studying computer science. My issue is that I am just not content with life. Due to this, I have sort of fallen into a slump and I’m not too sure what to do to get out of it. More on college: I got a few scholarships to attend but I still had to take out about $12,000 in student loans for the whole year to attend. Right now I am truly debating on whether to go back or not. I value my education and have dreamed of going to college ever since I can remember; but I’m at a point in my life where I face the least amount of risk in the choices I make and I feel like I could/should be doing more. I am also very passionate about computer science and programming in general, it is definitely what I want to do for the rest of my life, but is it something I want to go into debt for when I could possibly make it without a degree? College, however, only plays a small role in my issue. Overall, I just don’t feel content with what I’m doing with my life in every aspect. I feel like I should be doing more with my life but when it comes down to it, I never feel like I put in the work necessary to be successful or do anything with my life. I often find myself getting distracted by menial things, such as accepting plans with friends, finding that I can lose hours of valuable time by not managing it properly, and I also waste a lot of time with social media. I know the best thing to do would be to give all that up but for some reason, that is a very daunting thing for me to do. I often look up to my older brother, who at my age was getting a full ride to college and was managing his own business at my age and now he is very happy and successful. I also find it may be important to mention that I am an avid marijuana smoker. I never found it to be a problem as it would always motivate me to do my homework and be more productive; however, now I mainly use it once a day as a stress reducer and sleep aid. The reason is feel the need to bring this up is, I feel like marijuana may play in my discontentment in life (maybe because it has ruined my natural dopamine levels?); but I also look at my aforementioned brother and he is an even more avid smoker than me. Even my older sister (who just graduated with a 4.0 from med school) smoked more than me while she was going to school . I have attempted to start and finish multiple coding projects over the summer and I have a lot of fun working on them when I actually start them; however I always find it very difficult to actually start working on a project and I always lose the drive to finish them because I have gotten into a bad habit of just giving up when I hit a roadblock in my projects. I feel like it may also be important to say that I am currently working a full time job that I got in order to possibly get more of a grip on my life. Also, my parents aren’t the best role models. While they both work full time jobs and are very hard workers, they usually spend their free time doing trivial things, such as watching TV. They were also never very strict with me or my work habits (which is what I partly blame my issue on). I am just now realizing how long of a rant this has become and I appreciate anyone that reads through it and gives me advice on how I could possibly turn my life around and feel more content. Anything would help from advice to tips, or maybe even some motivation through other people’s stories. Even if no one reads through this entire thing and responds, it has still been nice to actually type things out and rant. Thank you for your time",20Jul2018,1

Also, I'm not really in to engineering, but I want to do well in a good field so my parents' money doesn't get wasted if that helps you see where I'm comin from.

Thanks for reading and please help!",20Jul2018,1
91,"My dad been unemployed for the past 5 years that has caused some tough times. Our house was almost foreclosed, but we sold it just I'm time. However, I sense he's in trouble and I don't think there's am easy way out. 

In the past month or so, I've given my dad $500 to pay for bills. He said it's a loan, but I honestly don't expect that money back, and that's fine. 

The only problem is that I can't afford to keep paying the bills. I make about $1000 a month and rent alone is $1400, and I saw in his email he owes $1500 to a golf course in dues. 

I feel like he's given up on the job search, but that's just speculation. I'm worried because although he went to an ivy league college and business school, he still has a 5 year gap. 

I was thinking about leaving him 2 grand in cash before I leave for college,  but I realize that puts him in a bad place where he would feel guilty, and it wouldn't really solve anything. 

What should I do, if anything? I'm so stressed tbh",20Jul2018,1
92,"So I was raised catholic and went through all the big ceremonies (baptism, first communion, confirmation) but no longer attend church or believe in Catholicism. 

My cousin is getting married and is having a catholic wedding so they will be giving out communion. Should I go up and receive communion just to go through the motions? Or should I stay seated? I don’t want to make some dramatic statement to my religious extended family that I’m not receiving communion/don’t believe anymore because I know they’ll confront me about it...but also don’t want to participate in something that I don’t believe in.

96,"I have a full time job that I'm extremely grateful for but - to cut the long story short - due to medical issues requiring me to stay at home it's looking more like part-time work. I haven't been consistently making enough for rent and basic needs due to not working enough hours. I would like to spend my rest days doing something productive as most of the time I am not incapacitated and well enough, I believe, to work. The thing is, I don't think I have much marketable skills. I do not hold a degree (I'm working on changing this). I know that doing free online courses maybe beneficial but I want to do something income-generating at the moment.

**What I've tried so far:**

- Looked for waitress/service crew/retail work 

I'm very willing to do retail but I've yet to find a place that accepts my inconsistent schedule. I don't think my work will appreciate me doing a retail job when I'm supposed to be on ""sick leave"" either.

- Went through every link I can find in r/BeerMoney, r/BeerMoneyGlobal and r/WorkOnline that is available in my country (Philippines)

They're mostly survey and click- or download-for-pay sites that does not have nearly enough offers, or for some reasons suddenly dwindle on offers when I almost reach the minimum payout amount. I have tried signing up for content writing websites as well but I haven't been accepted due to English not being my first language.

- Looked for work on local freelancing sites

I've tried bidding for work several times but haven't received any offer yet. It's quite disheartening as I've tried to build up my profile with as many skills and experience that I can but I don't know how I'll compete with and stand out from others. I have no idea how I'm suppose to start and honestly I haven't really found any work that I'm confident I can do well.

- Applied for local online tutoring jobs

This I do believe I'm qualified for but they require a stable internet connection. I have only very spotty prepaid broadband internet for my laptop.

**What I can do:**

- I'm fairly fluent in English and can speak two Filipino languages (Tagalog and Bicolano)

- I can force out cohesive articles every once in a while. I do feel like my English is obviously ""non-native"" and I'm not sure how to fix that.

- I have experience in retail and customer support so I do have some customer service skills.

- I average at 60 WPM.

- I am willing to work at very low rates. I earn around US$2 per hour at my current work and I can go even less than that if need be.

I'll greatly appreciate anyone who can point me in the right direction. Thank you!",20Jul2018,5
97,"I'm unemployed ,and have been for a long time. Im in a job program and have a job specialist but still no job and it still looks gloomy to me. But I was on Instagram and I came across these sports pages with my team. They had shirts with the official logo and a design on them. I messaged them both and asked is there a way I can get commission if I helped sell them or just sell them myself. And I got no response of course. I have a sports group and very good at creating huge ones. If I could sell team stuff,or anything really for a profit. I could fix my crappy life.

They also have jobs and aren't available all the time. I try to waste some time by finding things to do throughout the night, like re-watch a bunch of YouTube videos I have already seen hundreds of times. But I get bored with them. It's hard to find something funny 100 times in a row. My internet is not good enough to stream so that's not happening. I usually pass time by playing Overwatch alone, but it's really boring alone now. I don't have many single player games, And I don't have any money to just buy games. I don't have a job. Even if I somehow had the money to buy a game, I would probably have to wait a few days to play it anyways because of my internet. I don't have my driver's license, so I can't go hang out with friends. The worst part is that even if I wanted to make new friends (which I do), I am too shy to meet new people. It just seems like for everything that I want to do, there's something stopping me from doing it. To make it all worse, my best friend is going to be at his dad's house all weekend, so I won't be able to even talk to him until Monday.

104,"My half-sister is 10 years older than me. Since I was young, she has physically abused me. She would choke me, pull my hair, scratch me, and push me to fall down. There were a few times I nearly died but was saved because another family member found and stopped her in time. Those were the times she was trying to choke me to death. It was because she was jealous my parents were giving me attention.

She has also destroyed a lot of my physical possessions while I was growing up. Childhood had good memories, but there were also bad ones where I would almost die or have my belongings repeatedly destroyed by her.

Then I grew bigger than her as I aged. She is 5'0"" and I grew taller at age 13. So she stopped physically abusing me and then changed and wanted my attention instead. She started behaving towards me how she behaved to my parents and other adults: in which she wants their attention.

Then my parents tried to get me to watch her at age 13+ but I did not want to. She would just stare at me all day and I found it very creepy. I did not want to be around her.

One time she also locked me in the house so I could not go to school. I missed a school exam. My parents came home from work and freed me. My instructor said it was fine but my A+ became a C+ since my exam mark was 0% because I did not write the exam. This was an important science class. My parents then fixed how the stuff in the house worked so that people could not be locked inside.

Although I am much older now, I do not like her. I get her presents for birthdays and Christmas every year. But I do not like being around her. And now my mom is asking me to sign on to be her guardian in case anything happens to my mom. I do not want to sign. 

My mom has a close friend that likes my half-sister a lot. The friend agreed to sign as guardian. But my mom wants me, her blood relative, to sign. I said no and my mom got really angry. She still keeps trying to ask me. She also got one of her friends to bother me with text messages to ask me. I have already declined repeatedly.

And it's basically always turns out into an argument where everytime I bring up my research from the internet she says it's false and I try everything to tell her it's true.

I know I tend to overanalyze a lot, and overthink a lot, but I think having those habits is good if you want to know what's happening in your surroundings. Though I guess that I'll have to agree that the 'over' part is unhealthy.

I have no issues and absolutely love it when a guy does it, so there's no mental block there.

114,"I(38F) am so nervous and afraid of this phone call that I have to make and need suggestions on my approach.  First, you will need the long story.  My old neighbor (83F), that my friend and I were like daughters to, is in trouble.  I used to stay in touch with her, but kept my distance for the past 3+ years because I knew that what I had to say to her would upset her.  She had this son that was the worst kind of person there is.  He was a total waste of life.  He had everything handed to him and never kept a job.  His grandmother left him her home when she passed away.  He lived there for many years and eventually sold that and moved away onto the grandparents farm property.  He had drug issues, so he must have blown through that money quickly.  He always took advantage of his parents and constantly got money from them.  He was such a piece of garbage that he let his elderly mother work until she was forced to quit.  His father passed away in 2011.  He still would never come home to visit his mother.  He did not even come home for the funeral.  His father was a saint.  The mother, we will call her Helen, was a difficult, harsh woman to most people.  She was loud, bossy, and outspoken.  She was always good to me.  I guess I accepted those personality traits of hers.  She was always so horrible and critical with my friend Gwen.  Gwen is the kindest, caring, Christian woman you will meet.  She had a difficult life and always just rolled with it and stayed positive.  She is inspiring.  Helen was this horrible person, yet Gwen still cared about her.  Gwen also stayed away for the past few years because she needed to minimize these toxic experiences.  Gwen had told me about how Helen cried to her one day about her son saying that she was so guilty about his life and felt that she was responsible for his issues.  When I heard that, I lost it.  I was going to go over there and lay into her.  I was going to tell her that she enabled him, but she is not responsible for him being a piece of shit.  He was an adult and made his own choices.  I was going to scold her for how she always criticized everybody else and how they did things, but her son was the worst thing out there.  I knew she would have been hysterical, but I also knew that I could not hold in the truth anymore.  Well, the son ended up dying and I figured that God handled it.  The son apparently was gay and lived with his boyfriend on the farm.  This scumbag Mike was just as much as a piece of garbage as the son because he participated in manipulating the mother for money and lived off of her.  I found out later that Mike moves back here and moved in with the mother to allegedly be her caregiver.  I would get regular updates from Gwen and another friend on Helen and how she was doing until about the past year.  She popped into my head often and I felt bad for not seeing her in so long, but I still knew that I would say things that upset her if I saw her.  I still sent her holiday cards and hoped that those made her smile.  
Helen’s birthday was Monday.  I have the alert in my calendar.  I also got a FACEBOOK reminder picture from years before of us celebrating it with her.  I was in class all day and saw a text as I was leaving from Gwen asking if I was able to reach Helen.  Gwen said that her phone was disconnected.  She said that she found out that her house was foreclosed on.  She had taken out mortgages on her home and the property that she owned next door to keep giving her loser son money.  Now, she lost her home.  Gwen called the police to do a welfare check.  She was contacted by a woman that Helen had known who informed her that Helen was brought into the hospital months back delirious and in bad shape.  She was covered in bed sores and had not had her medication for a while.  This con artist, criminal Mike had been neglecting her and just stealing her money.  He would manipulate her with affection and lies.  He apparently had her change her will so everything goes to him.  He is stealing the social security and pension checks.  There is this large farm property, almost 200 acres, that he is just waiting on getting when she dies.  He is trying to speed up her death by neglecting her.  He has tried to keep everyone away so they would not find out the truth.  The woman that is helping, Joan, has informed the police and she said that they said that it is not a crime.  She said she did not have all of the evidence that she has now.  She can prove that he did not get her prescriptions for months.  The extent of the horrible bed sores also proves that she was not properly cared for.  All of her possessions are gone.  He had not even seen her in months when Joan contacted him.  Helen went from the hospital into a nursing home.  He then put on his act.  He clearly has a drug problem just like the son did.  At this point, I don’t even think he was the son’s boyfriend.  I think he was just his fellow loser friend that just mooched off him and his parents and did drugs with him.  He hit Joan up for $20.  She has been trying to get more out of him.  He apparently is focused on maintaining control of Helen.  She is not mentally incompetent, so she requires a guardian.  He told Joan he went to the court hearing for it on Tuesday, but he did not know that it was postponed.  He did not even know where Helen was until Joan informed him.  
So, after Gwen talked to Joan she called the nursing home and they did not have Helen.  We were panicked.  Nobody knew where she was.  I thought she was dead.  I thought that he must have killed her.  We were so distraught.  Gwen ended up finding her.  She was in the hospital because she had a stroke.  Gwen went to see her in the morning and FaceTimed me.  Helen has now had dementia set in, most likely more rapidly due to her neglect.  She did not recognize me or Gwen.  Gwen is a nurse, so she was getting all of the updates.  
I finally spoke to Joan and she filled me in on everything.  She explained her doctor had asked her if she knew Joan and told her that he thinks that something bad was going on.  Joan went to see Helen at the hospital and filled her in on everything.  Joan said that some of the things she would say seemed a bit delusional from her dementia, but most things were very lucid.  She told her that she thinks that Mike killed her son.  I absolutely believe that.  I believe he did it in the same manner of neglect.  He did not allow him or help him to get the care that he needed and let him die.  He had conned him into telling his mother that if anything happened to him, he wanted her to leave everything to Mike.  
Gwen and I are going to fight him for her guardianship.  We have enough evidence to discredit him and prove his incompetence.  I also need some help figuring out the best approach to begin a criminal case against him. 
Now, the dramatic twist on top of this horror.  When Joan had first seen Helen at the hospital months back, she thought she was dying.  She began to make her death bed confessions to her.  She told her that the man that everybody thought was her brother was really her son.  She was 14 when she became pregnant and her parents adopted him as their own and it was kept a secret until now.  She asked Joan to find her son and tell him that the family farm is in trouble.  
Joan tried to find him and thought she had sent him a letter, but I believe she had the wrong guy.  
Gwen and I are taking over now and are so thankful that Joan was there to help.  Joan really wants nothing to do with this, but anyone with a heart could never just sit back and allow this to happen to someone.  
It is my responsibility to talk to the brother/son.  I found him.  I am supposed to get his number tomorrow.  It was very difficult.  I am terrified to make this call.  I am sure he hates her.  He never came around after the mother died.  She was probably not nice to him because she resented him for the shame that she felt he brought upon her.  I owe it to her to tell him what she wants him to know.  What if he does not know that she is his mother!?  I fear complicating his life.  He obviously had his reasons for staying away.  But, I also believe that if he did not know, it could help resolve things for him.  He would understand the complicated relationship.  He would understand her.  He has the right to know as she wants him to.  I have no idea how well the secret was kept.  She told Joan that she was on the phone with the bad son the night before he died and he asked her if he was his brother or uncle.  She told him the truth.  So if he figured it out, maybe the brother/son did.  I have no idea.  
My idea is to call him and explain that I am not seeking any money from him and I am not asking him to come and help.  He is a retired police officer, so I hope to appeal to his dislike of criminals with the situation.  I simply want to do what is right for that family and that farm that belongs to that family.  What happens to their family farm should be up to him, not some criminal.  I just need him to step in and take the property so this criminal Mike does not continue to hang around trying to harm Helen in hopes of getting it.  If Gwen and I obtain her guardianship, we will manage her finances and ensure that it is all going towards her care.  Then this criminal will no longer try to kill her because the assets are gone.  
I am terrified of how he is going to react.  I am terrified that he is going to yell at me.  I understand that there could be a huge range of emotions.  I think I should make my disclaimer first about not needing his help or wanting money.  Next, give him my contact information in anticipation that he might freak out and hang up on me after he finds out, but then want to talk to me after he processes everything.  I will let him know that this is a very difficult thing to tell him in hopes that he can see that and not attack me.  Any other suggestions on the approach?  
What if he is a horrible person and does not care or have any kind of response?  What if there is even more to the story that we don’t know that he will have to relive?  We have no idea who the father is.  What if she was molested by her father and got pregnant?  We have no idea.  
No matter what, I have to fulfill her request.  It is a frightening duty that I will not run from, but I am so scared of the response or lack there of.  
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  ",20Jul2018,1

- Now I am working on two books 
-I've built a lot of handmade wood furniture
-and my dream is to get the courage to do stand-up (I've written the jokes but it is scary). 
**I do these things purely because it's fun.**

Anyway, I just find that whenever I do any of these things, im basically met with 'So what' or a shoulder shrugs... My 2 best friends are supportive but I sense a lot of jealousy at times. When I gave the App presentation at work, my best friend (co-worker) didn't even tell me 'good job'. I'm telling tho he is an amazing friend, but this one regard is shitty.

And my other high school friends get really upset in our WhatsApp group chat when I do something cool like move to Australia - they basically just tell me 'how lucky i am.' Not talk about the risk it was to leave and sell everything, and leave the few people I care for.

**I ask this because this is either a fundamental thing many people experience - Or I somehow how I am missing something painfully obvious?**

There's got to be common phenomenon in psychology, like the need for deserved and undeserved credit

118,"College student going into his 3rd year, in a bit of a crisis. I've had a hard time picking my major thus far, but I've narrowed it down to these two. Both would be paired with the same two minors: computer science and applied math.

Physics has an emphasis on astrophyics. I've becomed disillusioned with the prospect of getting a PhD in the subject after finding out how long it'll take. I've loved the field and been interested in it for years, however.

BEA is a combo of math, comp sci, IT, business, and economics. It's my university's version of a data science degree. I love the idea of working with analytics, big data, machine learning, etc. This one seems like a good, high paying way in.

I’m super pissed off, but I don’t want to make his birthday about our issues. 
I have been planning a surprise party for him for the past few weeks, and I still have to make him his cake and decorate our apartment while he’s out. Right now, I don’t feel like doing anything.

120,"Okay, so I was in a group of friends it was me a gay M with 3 Fs. We were all close since high school and have had some minor fights or arguments, but nothing ever huge. Last year around October 3 of us were planning a group trip to another country. Since I had the money and felt it was a good gift I ended up buying the airplane tickets and airbnb. I thought it was an appropriate gift knowing how close we were. I assumed wrong because one of the 2 girls thought it was too big of a gift and cancelled. I kind of got mad at her, but I got over it after awhile. The other one was shocked, but she was excited and ready for the trip. The trip wasn't until January, but by December I had gotten a new job and was kind of broke so I knew I wasn't going to be able to go to the trip. The one that was still going asked me a few things about the place we were staying at a month before the trip. My dumb ass got nervous and started avoiding her and not responding. A few days later when I finally got the courage I told her in a text that I was so sorry but I wasn't going to be able to go on the trip. I didn't have the money and had not planned out anything well I told her.

In hindsight now, I know I fucked up and should have been upfront with her. Instead I ignored her and made everything worse. Anyways she blew up on text telling me that I should have been honest and responded instead of being shady af. I knew I had fucked up so I didn't respond because I didn't know what to say.

After that her and the other 2 friends stopped talking to me. They would hangout and do things but never invite me. I know I fucked up but I did not think I would lose all my friends over my stupid actions. I decided to give my friend some time to cool off and tried talking to her a month later, but she wouldn't respond to my messages asking if we could talk. After another while I sent her a text that said '""Can we please talk?"" and she finally responded ""No""

I want advice on what I should do now? I feel pathetic because it has literally been around 6 months since January and I have not moved on from the situation. I still care about all 3 of them but I feel like they hate me. I'm not sure what the one that is mad at me feels because we never got to clear the air...should I try to contact her one last time? I want to go to her house and knock on her door and just apologize and fix everything between us. My family and other friends tell me it's a bad idea but I don't know what to do. Do you think I have any chance of salvaging our friendships even though so many months have passed? I would think after all this time she isn't mad at me and would be willing to talk? I just wish I had never ignored her, but obviously I can't go back in time....what should I do?

**TLDR:** I got in a fight with a friend after cancelling a trip last minute. Ended up losing an entire friend group because of it. I tried to apologize but she wouldnt see me in person. It has been 6 months and I still want to try to talk to her in person. Is it too late? Any advice?

Sorry for making this so long, thank you to anyone that reads the full story

121,"Hey... bear with me sounding like a typical teen, it’s just something I need to get off my chest and some advice would be awesome. 

I’m gonna try to keep it short, but there’s a lot I wanna say. 

There’s a girl I met during university in one of my classes, both from the same hometown, we hit it off  pretty quickly. As time went on, she ended up messaging me on FB and giving me her number. As we became better friends, we chatted almost every single day for weeks, her initiating almost all the convos. We bonded heavily over finals, and studied together for them every day. She seemed super flirty, from a 3rd person (according to my friends atleast) she was super into me. Even some of her friends wouldn’t hang out with us as we just flirted the entire time. The reason I didn’t make a move was there would be random times she’d say “.. I would only ever date a guy after knowing him for months” and also because she was in a middle with a thing with another guy ( not dating.. but a thing?) 

Another reason was her having to stay for the summer so we’ll be separated for 2 months. 

As summer went by we kept in touch, chatting about our lives every few days. One thing I noticed was this one time she posted a picture of her and a guy and she used to have a thing with(that ended over the summer) and snapped me how he’s this and that and how they arent dating and it’s just for memories. Whatever.

Over the summer she was excited to hang out and we talked about things we would do.  

Fast forward to when she got back, this is where I kinda feel weird. 

We coincidentally meet at a festival together, we hung out almost the entire time, when we’d separate she’d text me “find me” etc.. we got pictures together and bonded. 

But what I find weird is how she acts over text compared to in person. 

I’ll ask her to hang, she’ll seem kinda off put. But we’ll see each other at a beach, shell say things like “you look great..””did you get jacked over the summer”(I’m hairy and we joke about it) “don’t worry hairy guys are my thing” 

But then other times shell call me and her other girlfriend her bff, which tells me everything is not there.

But when we text it feels like nothings there or she puts no effort to meeting until we coincidentally meet- then us 2 hang out for the rest of the night. When we are together everything’s great, we plan more things to do next time, talk about good times, but when push comes to shove it feels pretty flat. 

I just feel super friendzoned, and would love to know where I screwed up for future, if any.",20Jul2018,2

A bit dramatic, yes, but she is just that sweet. 

She is so heartbroken because she's never yelled at any of us, and on top of that I'm sort of her favorite. How do I convince her it really isn't a big deal and get her to ""forgive"" herself? She's kind of stuck on replaying what happened. I can make another trip in a couple months, and I've called her and reassured her whenever I talk to her, but she keeps saying she can't forgive herself.

125,"Adoption or Breakup Relationship Crossroads

Hey Reddit - first time on here and after reading SO many posts and not finding my exact situation, I decided to post myself.  I hope someone on here can offer some insight.

My boyfriend and I of 1.5 years recently found we do not agree on children. He's 32. I'm 35. I do not want biological children because I do not want to be pregnant.  None of it sounds appealing and at 35 years old, I don't want to put my body through that.  I am open to adoption. He wants biological children and is just now considering adoption because I've brought it up - thought it is very much not his preference.  He has always pictured his life with a traditional nuclear naturally birthed family.  This is how everyone in his family has done it. My family, on the other hand, is very mixed: step children, adopted. I've seen it work out beautifully. My none-blood-related cousins, nieces, and nephews feel no different to me than those who have my DNA.  We love and have drama just as much as any other family.

For the last 4 months, my boyfriend and I have been at a crossroads. He's been sitting with the idea of adoption and isn't comfortable with it for the following reasons:

He won't love the child and bond with it.

His family won't accept the child. Like him they are traditional. Adoption is only a last resort if you are physically  unable to have your own.

The issues that come with explaining the child's adoptive state later in life. 

Potential genetic abnormalities because you don't ""know"" the parents.

I've driven myself bananas on Reddit, Google, and conducting informational interviews with doulas, pregnant friends, moms, my mom, friends who loved being pregnant, and friends who hated it ... all in hopes that I would have an epiphany and magically develop a desire to give birth. The opposite happened.  In all my research, I am even more certain pregnancy is not for me.  I am still open to a change of heart, but it has to be genuine.  I'm not going to go through with it unless it feels right for me.  It's not something I can sacrifice for my relationship.

That being said, I feel terribly that my boyfriend then needs to sacrifice his ideals for our relationship.  But it is the only way I can see us staying together.  We are incredibly in love and compatible except for this one big thing.  

I don't want him to resent me. And I know that if I force myself into pregnancy, I will resent him.

We decided to give this til the end of the year. At that time we will make a decision to stay together or break up.  We agreed that it makes no sense to stay together any longer if we know we don't agree on this.  Til then, we don't talk about it all the time, but it is an open discussion. I'd say we talk about it maybe 25% of the time we are together.

I feel that I've arrived at ""my truth"" and he's still contemplating his. How do I support him as a partner during this time? I honestly feel that we would be very happy as a couple with an adopted baby, but I don't want to seem like I am convincing or manipulating him. And I don't want to talk about it too little or too much.  He's a ""typical guy"" in that talking about it is torture. And I'm typical in that I always ""feel so much better"" after we talk.

Are there questions we should be asking each other? Things we should be researching? Has anyone else been through this? Have you made it to the other side still together? Or did things end?

Really struggling here and would appreciate any thoughts at all.

THANK YOU!!",20Jul2018,1

129,"Male, 25 years old, terrible credit. I need help if there's anyone kniwledgable about this type of problem. I have a credit score of 416, with numerous closed accounts on my credit score and student loans that I have now been made aware of are now many days past due. I started working with a federal debt relief branch a year ago but it doesn't seem like the $2000 I've payed through them has helped with anything, so I'm starting to do this myself and will soon cancel the debt relief thing. Recommendations from Credit Karma suggest I start out with a secured credit card, and now I'm confused.  

If I have to pay for this card upfront, what is the whole thing about a 24%APR on it? Is that opened as a positive credit line considering I can only spend what i pay to the card, or is it a net negative because it's but another credit line in my name?

I really like this person who is 23 and I'm 13. I don't want to go into the whole story but, in short, they are like an older brother to me.
Things to know:
-I've never been in any relationship before, I do have crushes on people my age but its not serious and more like ""oh, they're pretty"" or ""wow, they are really nice, cool, etc."" but with this person it's way more than those feelings.
-I'm a very 'philosophical' person and I always ask questions about the world, universes, gods, random thoughts, all that stuff.  
-Usually people get annoyed after i ask these questions. But with them, we just talk about this stuff all the time. 
-I feel very happy when I see them, think about them, or hear their name.
-they dont show any interest in being in any relationship with me and the most 'contact' we've had was just a quick half-arm hug goodbye
-They are there for me like a counselor and notice if I'm feeling sad or hurt.
My questions:
-is it normal to have these feelings with someone 10 years older than you?
-What do I do if they find out?
-will this crush on them go away?
-When will the age gap close and make it not so weird? 
-are you (or someone you know) in a relationship with an age gap like this?


Also does this flair count as 'personal'or 'relationships' because both seem wrong and correct at the same time.

138,"I am sitting at 3 am in an ex girlfriends cellar. I sleep on a thickly padded exercise mat with a box fan on low because it makes my bones too stiff. She has a young child so the couch does not work. Her daughter loves me and when I broke up with her because of her age we said I had to move for work. The basement which is windowless has felt unmerciful in is a partial concrete/dirt floor and I have been bit by spiders. I have been living like this since May. If you are in Philly you know it has yet to be below 85 degrees. 

I have been estranged from family for over 7 years. They abandoned me repeatedly and took advantage of my generosity. When I was hospitalized for complications due to an inability to catch my breath twice in two months and my finance and I broke up and she had me falsely arrested (She claimed I tried to break into ""her"" house). I was subsequently arrested at my job in front of everyone where I was the managing director for nine years. After 12 days in PRISON not JAIL someone finally looked at my paperwork and saw that we bought the house together and you cant have someone ""home invade"" your own home.   

After 4 months I get another job as a procurement and project manager and became very successful. The issue is after close to two years employment they have not paid me or given me financial information for profit sharing which was part of my financial package when I agreed to work and I have about a 50 million dollar buying portfolio. I stupidly quit when growing deeper in depression. The depression stemmed from my ex not showing up with my child for custody. This was my 8th contempt of court. I get a court date 6 months out. We file an expedite and the judge whom any lawyer I ever hired has said she has some sort of vendetta against you pushes my ""expedite"" out to 8 months. This is when I filed an expedite. 

I have a Masters Degree. I have certifications in SIGMA from CPIM. Increased responsibility in every job I had and I only changed jobs 3 times in 11 years. No arrests. No history of mental instability. No history of drug abuse. Always lived on my own since 18. I have worked since I am 12 and I will be 42 very soon. The judge in a phone conference before court suggested I attend counciling with my child since I have missed all this time. It was her mother who has not shown up and I have my daughter on Friday night to Sunday night every weekend but one a month....how am I now supposed to fit this in? Keep in mind I have spent 70,000 dollars and had 47 court appearances including twice mother tried to file fake PFA's and had them thrown out when she was cut lying (different judge). I was having to get my child from a police station for my benefit so mother could not file more fake shit....judge refused to give me primary custody. No DHS was never involved either. My child always had her own room. Was never hurt or hospitalized and when the judge asked her chambers if she wants more time with her dad. She said how much she loved and she has so much fun....

So I quit my job.  For the last 4 months I have been looking so HARD for work and I have ample qualifications. I managed over a 100 employees at one job, I had a 50 million dollar buying portfolio at another company....advanced degrees, certifications....and I had less than 5 interviews? I hired a resume service too and they said your resume is awesome and honestly you dont need our service....

So I leave my last gf whom I have lived with this last year and my money has dried up between lawsuits. I am currently down to 300 dollars. I have not seen my child in well over a year now.....mother changed numbers, jobs and child's school ALL ILLEGALLY. I had to hire a private investigator...have judge thrown off of case....it is in the wrong county as well. Mother and child never lived there. I have not lived there in years. 

So I am abandoned and anyone who wants to help (sue past employer, custody) wants minimally around 8,000 for a retainer and as I said I been bled dry by lawyers already in the cases and ex-gf who I broke up with because she abandoned me as well. 

So now almost 4am and I have no idea how it got so bad. I worked hard. I was a good father. I was a good son and brother. A good boyfriend (she did ""lend"" me 2,000 dollars recently). Which I paid off my car thinking this is where I am going to have to live. I went to college. Graduated top of my class got an academic scholarship for graduate school. I do not know what I did wrong. My heart is broken of my child. And the ""loan"" this comes after I paid for all the food and utilities for a year while was embroiled in a lawsuit over a property and she just settled and this ""loan"" came from that. My guess she got 140,000....

I want to kill myself. I keep thinking move to another state. Start over. I have no friends and no support system. I worked hard 9,10,11 hours a day and I happily had my child on weekends. I was only free 2/3 days a month. What do I do? I think of California (I know cliched) but I always hated Philadelphia yet with 300 dollars....

I am sorry. I am sure no one is reading this far. Even I am exhausted. I am so exhausted from this existensce and I just would like to die but I am so afraid my child may blame herself someday....and it makes me angry. WHAT THE FUCK DID I DO WRONG IN LIFE? I WAS A GOOD MAN. I TRIED TO HELP EVERYONE AND HOW DO I END UP A LOSER. If I just knew what I did wrong. I would leave my house. Drive to another state with no wallet or phone just jump into some fucking river and honestly depending on how brain washed my child is and ""IF"" she becomes interested in what happened....but no one cares at all. They just dont. ",20Jul2018,3

Today I have a serious thing that has come into my life. Briefly about myself. I'm a 21 year old man from Finland currently doing my 2nd year of my Computer Science bachelor's degree. I'm also a active person and workout daily. I would say that I like meeting and helping new people and friends. Now for the situation...

So, 3 months ago, I was playing a online mobile game, where I met a player with the help of connections to others. I thought it was like all other players, until she told me to voice chat in Discord while playing. We started to talk about ourselves and that is when I heard her tragic past 5 years:

\- At 18, she lost her mom to cancer =&gt; her father became depressed

\- At 18, had a boyfriend to comfort her with her loss, who later forgot about her

\- At 18, dropped out from high school

\- At 20, family sold her horse due to money shortages

\- At 20, had to give up a foster puppy cause he had an expensive heart condition.

\- At 21, had another boyfriend, who cheated on her after 8 months.

\- At 22, got into a photographer learning course, where the instructor sexually harassed her.

Overall:

\- she is Dutch

\- she is uneducated

\- average looks and health

\- spends all day watching anime, chatting with online friends or gaming.

\- lives with her dad until she gets a place from the Government.

Currently what we do:

\- Voice chat 1 hour everyday about our lives

\- she enjoys talking with me with the little time I have (full time summer job as coder)

\- wishing to meet and travel when she gets her own place (probably when I finish my bachelor's XD)

I'm even learning Dutch at the moment and planning to do my Master's in Amsterdam (cause its a good Uni). That means I can meet her regularly and strengthen our bond.

152,"So let me start off by saying that I didn't have this problem when I was in school.    




About 5 years ago I was in public school,I had friends and I talked alot but my mother decided she wanted to home-school, Ever since I was taken out of public school it's just felt like I don't know how to talk to anybody anymore.




I have problems getting words out of my mouth or correctly speaking without stuttering or mis-pronouncing words.   I can't even hold a 2 minute conversation anymore because I don't have the social interaction I used to.


It's been 5 years ever since I left public school and all of those years I haven't talked like I used to. I've been the quiet type my whole life but its gotten worse over the years,I don't even remember what you do in school or how you would interact with anybody.


It's just sad to know the only people I can talk to are my family members and not anyone else.

153,"Hi all, I already wrote this on an another sub but I wanted to get more advice on this... Can't get it out of my head.

My friend and I knew eachother since very young, but we only started talking last October. Since then, I've just been falling and falling for him... and I don't know what to do. He just graduated from high school and he's taking a gap year before he starts university- meanwhile I'm the year below him. We talk every night about everything that happens in our days and we usually stay up until at least 2 am and even sometimes 5 am to just blabber on and on. I'm so incredibly happy when I'm around him, and I've never felt like this before for anyone. Yes, I'm young, but I have a certain feeling inside me that makes me head over heels for him. I've been in several playful relationships and 1 that was serious, if it helps. But he's incredibly mature and responsible and I just love that he's so comfortable and reliable to talk to. But my problem is that I have no idea if he has remotely any feelings of that sort for me, because I want to know if I need to move on. Quite frankly, I don't want to move on. I want to graduate and perhaps start something properly with him. But if he doesn't feel anything for me, I'm afraid that I'd hurt myself a lot more than needed. The thing is, he does give me the idea that he wants to be with me, since he always talks about coming over and visiting me even if I move away. 

Also, last night, I was asked out by his close friend and I immediately told him about it. Before I could say what I thought about it, he told me to reject him and stop talking to him. This has happened already with 2 other people, and would it be safe to say that it means something? Or is it just a friendly act? What would you suggest that I should do?

**tl;dr - I am in love with my friend and I don't know if I should move on**",20Jul2018,1
154,"Sorry this is so long.

A bit of background: I have been good friends with A for 3-4 years now. She is a student with a daughter. She was a bidesmaids in my wedding and went to my weekend bachelorette party about a year back. When planning my wedding I was super conscious about the bridal party costs. I had them to wear whatever knee length black dress they wanted and a pair of nude shoes. For the bachelorette party we tried to keep costs somewhat reasonable and it was around $500-600 in total per person. Both the wedding and bachelorette party were within an hour and a half drive from where we both live. I think she had to take 1 day off work in total.

Onto my current problem: My friend A got engaged recently and she started planning her wedding. First she talked about having it locally and I was excited to go. Although she didn't specifically ask, there is an assumption I'll be a bridesmaid, maybe even maid of honor, since she starting talking about dresses with me (which I will have to specifically purchase for her wedding). I was ok with this since I thought it was going to be close to home. Now she has decided not to have the wedding local anymore but almost on the other side of the country since weddings are cheaper there and his friends/family is there. I have limited days off work and so I'll have to probably fly in on Friday and fly out on Sunday and it'll be about 20 hours on plane + layovers in 3 days. I will most likely not know more than 2-4 people at the wedding besides her and the groom.

She has asked me to plan the bachelorette party for 12 people and told me she wants a 3 day getaway that includes 2 days in Disneyland (about $200/ticket alone not including any food while there) plus a nice dinner and a night out clubbing.  Disneyland is 6+ hours driving from where we live so because of vacation issue noted above I'll have most likely have to fly or opt to take time unpaid. I haven't officially committed to planning it.

While my husband and I make pretty good money, we are saving to buy a house and may end up moving to a different state soon. I may end up having to take time off work unpaid this year for personal reasons. I have the savings to go to both events if I really wanted to but I feel like the money could be spent better elsewhere - either towards the house or for a vacation to a place my husband and I actually want to go.

Since she is a good friend, was in my wedding, and came to my bachelorette party I feel that she is just expecting me to do the same for her. The price difference/travel requirements/time off work between what she had to do for my wedding and what I'll have to do is, in my opinion, quite different. I am estimating that when everything is said it'll be around $3000+ and 2-3 days off work.

I also kind of feel like she's kind of doing things as cheaply as she can for herself, while pushing the costs onto the guests. For example, she is planning on having an afternoon/early evening wedding to save on costs with a cash bar and then have people go bar hopping at night where they will pay for their own drinks but is going to get antique furniture rentals for a ceremony so it looks pretty for the photos. I understand it's not my wedding but with how much attending her wedding is going to cost, it would be nice to have a couple glasses of wine that I don't have to also pay for. 

I prefer to only go to the bachelorette party since that's where I'll spend the most time with her and probably have more fun but should I just suck it up and spend the money to go to both to avoid ruining the friendship? If only going to the bachelorette party doesn't make me a bad friend, does anyone have advice on how to explain it to her while not ruining the friendship?

155,"Oof this is gonna be a long post, but I hope that you'll help me :)

So, hello, everyone, I'm a 17 year old teen soom graduating from an art high school. I currently live in Europe and I was born from an American dad and an European mom.

The reason why I wanna move to the USA? Well, yeah I was born and raised in Europe but I have an american heart. All the good and bad, I embrace it, because I want to be 100% american.
It is my home, even tho I visited it only once. And wanna know something? I've been wanting to go home for 7 years now, yup I started to feel the need to be there since I was 10.

Why didn't I move sooner? Well, my mom is afraid of changes, kinda understand that, we have no luck with family or money over here. My dad always supported me on this since he misses our home as well.

You might be thinking ""Why did you write that you are going to graduate from an art high school?"". Well, I will be an artist one day. And I plan to start my carreer over there. 
I want to move to Salt Lake City since I have family there, I want to attend an art college there.

Why am I asking you a little help? Well, me and my family aren't really wealthy. We have problems going on and I'm trying my best to make them end with my parents. 
I will be graduating in 2 years and I need to get enough money with them around 20.000 $, then we'll 100% go on rent and when we have more money we will buy a house. We should have also enough money for tuition (at least.. I hope). Or i will just move in my aunts house and study while my parents will stay in Europe for a little more.

Are there other problems? Yes. My mom will get a pension for her job in 20 years. Is there a way to not loose that money? She cannot be transfered. Can she get a job in the USA and still have a pension after 20 years?
My dad is a veteran, what high-paying jobs can he do?

Last BIIIIG problem.
My mom isn't still convinced. She is afraid of changes, but it's our better future we're talking about. Here taxes and bills are expensive AF. Here our family is nasty and also their workplaces are bad. They don't get much. My mom would actually really like going over there but is too afraid and won't admit it.

157,"First I will explain what I've seen - I am looking for advice on how exactly to move forward.

My giflfriend, our baby daughter, and I recently moved into our own place. To keep the story short - I work swing shift and usually am up at odd hours of the night/day (get off work at midnight, sleep from 5AM - 12PM). 

I smoke cigarettes, and usually spend a good deal of time the first couple of hours after work smoking outside to wind down and relax. (Multiple times from 1AM - 4AM). From the very first night at our new place I noticed the strange occurrences at the house a couple blocks down from us: lots of cars coming and leaving over and over, people running out of there property, people parking down the street (across from our house) and going down there etc. After a few nights of seeing this, I thought it must be some sort of dealer house, most likely one step up from a peddler because of the traffic.

I decided to do a bit of looking around during the day, walking by their driveway, Google Street view. I noticed that on their property they had these huge shipping crates, ones that go on freighters. There were 10-15 of them, and right near the driveway was a rickety sign that had a bunch of different pricing for storage space. 

I began to notice people going in and out of the property throughout the day. I also started to recognize a pattern, seeing the same cars at certain parts of the night/certain nights of the week. 

There are a few incidents which really stand out to me that this very well might be much more serious than a simple small time dealer or illegal squatting. A couple times I have seen men on Harley type bikes slowly patrol our street back and forth (keep in mind all of these things are at like 2/3AM) which is loud and intimidating. 

Tonight what I saw is what urged me to seek advice. I got home from work and I went out to smoke. I noticed a small group of people gathered at the entrance to their property (4 or 5 people). Then two cars suddenly pulled on to the sides of our street and men got out of each car and just stood outside the driver-side door looking around. (I went immediately inside as quietly I could and continued watching through the blinds). After these cars pulled up, a POLICE CAR pulled to the end of our street (right across from my home) and posted up. Then a medium sized UHAUL turned on to our road, and into their property. Everyone got into their vehicles and followed the UHAUL in, except for the sherriff who lingered for a minute or two, then pulled away. About 15 minutes later I saw the UHAUL pull right into the spot the police car had been, parked, and a large Hispanic man got out of the truck. He walked down the road a ways, then crossed the street and on to the property from where he just came.

10 minutes or so pass and the 2 cars which had followed the UHAUL in left the property, followed by a third nicer looking car which went the opposite way. I am just in shock at this point, shaking and heart beating, confused. A good deal of  time went by when the nice car returned, dropped the Hispanic guy off at the end of our street. He went to the property one more time, then got in the UHAUL and left. 

What should I do. This seems like something way out of my ability to handle or comprehend.

Before they left, she showed me how everything worked, told me how much water each plant needed, how to go about cleaning up after, and gave me a key to access the house. She then had my friend text me the dates I were to come in and water, an to let her know of any questions I had. She also said that she would be paying me for doing it too.


2 weeks had passed since then, and I've been at their house everyday that they had assigned me. It was alright, relaxing, gets me out of the house, and I get paid for it too. It was only till recently, my latest stop, that I noticed that the leaves on some of the plants are withering, and the branches and flowers of other plants are drooping. I go and ask my friend's mom about it and she just says to water it some more.

171,"I'm 21 years old and ever since I was 13-14, I started becoming utterly obsessed with things. First, I became obsessed with a metal band and it was my only interest at that time. I refused to go out or do my homework because I needed to listen to them all the time. I would collect all the interviews, all the backstage footage, all the pictures and everything I could find about them. I was always busy with reading and writing fanfiction. It was crazy, and I feel like I wasted 3 years of my youth obsessing over something so irrelevant. Next, I became obsessed with a TV show that I would binge watch all the time. I lost most of my friends at that time because my only discussion topic revolved around this show. Later, in college, I managed to rebuild my life and make some friends but it all came crashing down again when I fell in love with a guy for the first time. I lost all my friendships once again, because I was obsessed with this person and ultimately, I lost this person too because I was too clingy and it drove him away.

I hoped and I kept hoping for the vicious cycle of obsessions to end. Last year, however, once again, I became obsessed with a rock band. I've pretty much gone through the same behavioral patterns as I did with the other things I've obsessed over. It was exhausting and I almost killed myself because of it. I developed severe burnout and depression because of this.

What's even worse is that, I might never be able to enjoy something without becoming obsessed with it. It would be pleasant to go back to all those things and enjoy them NORMALLY, without being obsessed, but the obsession made me burn out and lose interest in them. So, this means that, every time I discover something that I like, it will soon be ruined and I'll never be able to enjoy it again because of my obsessive personality.


&amp;nbsp;

I'm really sorry for this wall of text, I'm desperate and don't know what to do. I want to know whether this is normal behavior or there's something fundamentally wrong with me. Is this just a phase, will it pass? Is it a teenage/youth thing? Also, this last obsession left me confused because, unlike the others, I can STILL relate to this band's music but I am unable to listen to it anymore because I've burned out on it. Will I ever be able to enjoy this music again without being an obsessive asshole and repeating this cycle? I really need some insight, I feel lost and confused. ",20Jul2018,7

174,"This is in Louisiana, no cooling off period. So not the past Tuesday but the one before, I went in after a couple of days of them supposedly working on my loan, signed the contract, paid my DP, drove away. Later that week the salesman asked for a photo of my DL. I asked why since he already had a scanned copy, he said he said he didn't know but it was required. Okay. Now yesterday I get a call from the supposed lender saying they need bank statements to finalize the loan. I told her that I'd already given them to the dealership as they'd asked for it as a critical document for me to get the loan. She says she has no records of it, so we both call the dealer. He claims to have lost them, and I'm like I scanned them and emailed them to you, how can you lose an email? Long story short I'm resending them today, but here's the thing. When I asked while signing the contract, ""is this completely final? There's no chance of something not going through and me having to bring the car back?"" He said to my face ""no chance, it's completely final. No worries."" So there's a lie. When I asked if they could lower the price of the car to make it easier for me to qualify for financing, they said no. But in the contract the price is a full 4k less, so obviously they could and did. Lie number 2. I'm feeling extremely uncomfortable and concerned that this won't go through and I'll have to bring the car back. I reviewed the contract and the dealer is listed as both seller and creditor. I read the entire thing and saw nothing that said if they weren't able to secure a lender that it terminates the contract. What is the worst case scenario here and what should I do? If it's worth it to do so I will try calling a lawyer. I read that if they're listed themselves as the creditor that they may be legally bound to just accept the loan payments in the contract, but am unsure if that applies here in Louisiana.

There's a lot he hasn't told me about his life, but I know it was rough on him and he's seen some shit before he converted.

I have a deep respect for him, even though I dont necessarily believe the same as him anymore.

Around middle school (I had transferred to a public school by this time), I started to become disillusioned with religion and fell away from the church.

182,"Because I don't know what the hell my problem is. Everything revolving around being in love and relationships scares me so damn much. I hate having crushes, I absolutely refuse to be set up by friends or family, I refuse to try any dating apps. I don't open up, ignore any guy that gives me attention and every time I like someone I convince myself right off the bat that nothing is going to happen because of  X Y Z. I make the most ridiculous excuses. I admire from afar but anything beyond that? Never

As a result I have no dating experience whatsoever at my age. 

I've had this problem forever. I always told myself it would dwindle when I got older but it didn't. I feel like I'm relatively ""succesful"" in a lot of other areas in my life, such as academia, social life etc. but this area stays behind. 

One might think: well maybe you don't want to be in a relationship?

I do. I think I do. Maybe I like the idea of having an SO more than the actual reality of it.
It seems like I'm literally incapable of dating. That it's something I'll never be able to pull off due to the ridiculous anxiety that comes with it.
I also think there's fear of rejection, fear of humiliation, pride and nevousness. 
When I talk to friends or family about this they give me a peptalk and afterwards I feel confident that I can change it. But then that feeling of confidence goes away and weeks down the line a situation occurs (lets say there's a cute at work) where I can apply their advice. You think I do? Nope. There I am again, paralyzed, unable to do anything and going into avoidance mode.

186,"I’m in my late 30’s, and working for a company that will pay for your schooling.  I’ve worked here for about 3 years, and figure I’m just wasting this opportunity, so going to start using.  They’ll basically pay for a degree at each level (associates, bachelors, and masters).

Background:  Spent 6 years in the Air Force, working on aircraft electronics (mostly RF).  Most of my jobs since then have been electronics technician (basically testing electronic boards, and troubleshooting them to component level).  That’s what I do currently, and have about 15 or so years of experience in.

I have an associates in computer technology that I got with my GI bill.  It was mostly some entry level programming (C#, Java, assembly language, socket (network) programming), some hardware, some networking, some security, a couple of database classes, etc.

So what I’m trying to decide is, what to use this opportunity to get a degree for.  I could use it to get a degree in electronics, maybe letting me move up to an engineering position (I think this is near the bottom of my list though).  I could try to turn my associates into a bachelors in a computer related field.  Or I could go for something completely different (was even looking into something in the nursing/health care field)

One of my issues is I have a wife and children, and we’re single income.  My wife doesn’t have any background that would lend itself to a career good enough to support us.  So I can’t take a pay cut to pursue a different job field/career with some entry level job.  I’m making pretty good money right now, but other then yearly raises I don’t see a way to make a big jump in salary just “staying the course”

192,"So today I had skipped sleep so I could go ahead and get to work and after that I planned to go and get two hours of rest and then give plasma for some extra money.
I've been waiting for today all week , today was the day I was going to finally get my car on the road.
I have done a lot of work to it , thought it's still uninsured, etc.
I live at an apartment complex.
After work today (12-5am) I get home to no car in the parking lot.
We call the towing company and find out they have it and they want $150 for it.
I had a collective of $300 today for my car to get on the road, I had plans, etc. Didn't even consider this happening. I went online to see what rights I had, and since I live in North Carolina I found Article 7A, I thought that would help but then I ended up finding out a hour after that my lease states I can't have an uninsured vehicle on the premise.

When we got to the towing place I was armed with facts, I figured maybe I could scare them into submission if I omit that last fact I learned but they obviously knew their shit. It was really my last effort to save the money I was gonna spend on not having to rely on my 54 year old mother to wake up at night and drive me to work every day. I was really looking forward to lessening her load of having to drive all the time for my family today I feel horrible.

The facts, didn't work.
The beat my facts with bigger facts, I got angry.
Snapped and told them I was gonna ""fucking sue you""
I don't know why I said it, but the guy there called me disrespectful. He was right, I quickly regained consciousness and told him sorry, I apologized, it just idk.
For some reason it took my dignity there, me apologizing to the guy that took all my hope away? Idk it happened..I paid the $150 and then I had to pay $85 to tow it to my grandmother's house. (Since she owns the land, would have been stupid for me to bring it back home).
Before that happened I lost all my self worth
I fell down on the concrete outside of the building, punched the ground, cursed god, cried. I have never cried so much. I feel shitty, I feel useless, I feel like it's not worth shit anymore.
I'm so tired of trying and trying and getting pushed back, I try to be honest and try not to do anything horrit or underhanded, tell the truth, I just idk.

193,"I have a problem articulating my thoughts properly and English isn't my primary language so this might be long and all over the place, I'm very sorry.  


&gt;I feel so detached sometimes. Every so often I'm confused on what to feel, what appropriate emotions I should have, to the point that I feel so empty inside (Mostly during at night). Aside from that, when I feel emotions I constantly bounce around feel depressed and anxious to very happy and euphoric. Everyday I have suicidal thoughts that run inside my head throughout the day and I even joke about it. I'm quite sensitive, very unfocused, have a short-attention span, easily stressed, a perfectionist (but I'm really incompetent), and I doubt myself frequently. I also get delusional like thinking I'm better and smarter than others (which in reality I'm not), everyone is talking shit about me, no one actually likes me, and that someone likes me just because they're being friendly (jfc...)   
  
&gt;  
&gt;I've suspected I have some kind of Depression/Anxiety though I can't really confirm due to not being officially diagnosed by a professional, but for a long time I've always dismissed everything as just me being an attention seeker or drama queen. I can't afford to go to a Psychiatrist now and I don't wanna tell my parents to fund me because I haven't told them that I've been feeling like this and have been suicidal for almost 5 years (Started when I was 10/11) They're part of the reason, mostly my mother and they're pretty conservative. I was also being bullied by my 'friends'/classmates during that time. I guess some of my coping mechanisms are excessive daydreaming (This is such a problem because I'd rather do this than actually do anything in my life), crying myself to sleep, sometimes drinking alcohol if I just want to pour everything out, and rarely, cutting..   


  
Now that I've disclosed all of those important information, this is the second important part.  


&gt;This summer, I applied for our local McDonald's because I felt like shit doing nothing productive everyday, morning 'till night and it only fueled my suicidal idealizations. I thought it would give me some will to live, even if it's small. I got accepted this July after waiting for almost 3 weeks. I officially started working last week Monday (9th July) and I was on lobby duty. It was really fun, I talked to my co-workers a lot and accommodated tons of customers and it made me really happy to see them smile and stuff. Just this week, they started training me for Batch Grill (Kitchen) with one of my male new-ish co-worker (let's call him 'R'). To be honest, I was very anxious about it. I'm usually clumsy, slow, and forgetful which is a big problem since you had to be fast and precise during kitchen duty.   
&gt;  
&gt;During the times I was being trained and was cooking, it was pretty bad for me. Our trainer wasn't very good at teaching us and sometimes told us opposite information from the paper she gave. We had to memorize the temperatures of the grills, cooking times, all of the names of the equipment and how to cook properly, which I had no problem. The problem though is that whenever she was testing/verifying/asking about our knowledge about the kitchen was when we were cooking a lot of things, and whenever I made 1-2 mistakes before getting to the correct answer was she would always say ""You don't have to think, just say it."" which frustrated me so much because I have a very hard time remembering things when being pressured while multi-tasking (cooking, checking the food, and answering questions). My head was all over the place, and I was always unfocused. She also favored 'R' and was a little bit nicer towards him.  
&gt;  
&gt;I always feel like shit whenever I'm working inside the kitchen because of my incompetence, slow reaction time, and many mistakes. I would always be sad while working, always on the edge and was always anxious to the brim since she would always be in a bad mood. Someone even told me that she had an enemy with the same name as I, and she was kinda pissed at that. I didn't know what to say.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm also quite lonely because barely anyone talked to me, or even acknowledged me during breaks. I would get talked over when I would try to talk with other people, some ignoring what I say.  
&gt;  
&gt;Every night before work, I get stressed out, anxious and would cry by myself. Just today, I didn't go to work because I was going to be by myself since 'R' has his day off and I was so scared to be by myself. I feel so guilty, useless and incompetent. I'm starting to loathe going to work and wanting to quit. But I can't, it's just my first week and I need the money for me to go to a Psychiatrist because I need proper help. My parents also spent a lot of money and time for me to get my proper documents so I can work, I just can't waste it.   


 I feel like a sensitive drama queen to be honest. I know stress is natural in this kind of fast-paced work, but I have no idea how to tackle all of this properly without breaking down in front of them or resorting to drinking and cutting when alone. Do you guys have any good advice on how to just stop being so sensitive and incompetent, and just focus on doing my work properly ? I've tried venting everything to my friends but it didn't help much.

My dad doesn’t like me expressing myself, and wants to change a lot about me. I wear baggy clothes, long sleeve and jeans, every day. He doesn’t like that. He told me it “doesn’t look good”. Not too long ago he yelled at me because of my clothes. Straight after he tried to guilt trip me by saying “Please wear short sleeve... for me?” as if he literally didn’t just yell in my face.

I want to express myself more, by changing up my hair. But he is restricting me from doing that. In fact, he wants me to shave off most of my hair and go nearly bald like him. He’s not kidding - he made me do that a lot when I was younger.

I also want earrings. He doesn’t want me getting piercings, so I asked for clip on earrings. He doesn’t want me having that either, despite him having piercings. 

I’m not allowed to have a credit card or debit card. He said I can get a credit card when I’m 18 but he will monitor it, and I’m only allowed to use it in emergencies. I asked what an emergency is. He said when I have to bail myself out of jail, even though I probably would never go to jail. I am too good a person for that. I respect the law.

Then there’s my music. He has yelled at me for listening to the music I listen to many times. It’s not about sex, drugs, gangs, or anything like that - I usually listen to Linkin Park or NF.

199,"So, I tend to have bad anxiety and panic disorder. I get panic attacks from many things, but one of the main ones is going into crowded public places. 

It used to be a lot worse than it is, to the point where I couldn’t even take transit (I lived in nyc) and had to walk everywhere, leading to me waking hours a day. Now I have a drivers license but can also manage transit even if it’s crowded. However, I’m trying to challenge myself, and so I’ve been doing more. For a while, I struggled to go to the vet clinics I work at, but I’ve been going every day. My next challenge was the gym. I still get a lot of anxiety going, but I can generally do my own workout if I plan on going around times that aren’t too crowded. 

Today, I wanted to take a core class at the gym, and then do the elliptical. I figured it wouldn’t be too busy at 10 am on a Friday but I guess they have a summer program for teens, so it was crazy. I had a full panic attack and had to leave and am now sitting in the café across the street. 

So my question is, how do I deal with this? I want to be able to enjoy taking classes at the gym, but the business on top of the anxiety I already have about taking a class, feels like too much.

We decided to go with an off campus student housing facility that pairs you with other students if rooms are needed to be filled. The two of us chose a three bedroom apartment and the 3rd person would be filled for us, via this leasing company. So, instead of signing a 3 bedroom lease, we sign leases per bed. Now, during the application process, his application said he was approved and ready to turn in his pay stubs. After reading this, I decided to sign, as his paystubs easily meet the requirements. However, for some reason, he was told he has also been denied and can't live there.

 Okay. So we have to find a new place? Wrong. This company is forcing me to stay there since I already signed their lease, even though my roommate did not get in. I've been begging them to terminate my lease, however, they state that I need to complete a re-let/sublet. But this will cost me $700 to do....what the hell?? This place has so many open rooms that the possibility of me finding someone is slim to none. And they already advertise up the wazoo, every knows about this place, why would anyone take extra steps to take my lease over?

211,"I started my job about 3 months ago. At that time, when my boss and I discussed salary, I asked for 14/hour. He told me he could give me 13/hour for the first month and then the 14/hour after that. Because I was in training, and working the same shift with the person I was replacing, I agreed to it, because at that point he was paying 2 people to do 1 job and after the first month I'd be on my own. Totally fine, I get it, it's a small business. After 2 months, I brought it up with him again, saying we initially agreed on 14 and hoping I could get that now that I'm alone and I've been here long enough for him to know I'm here to stay. At this point he says something like ""things are crazy right now, let me get through the summer."" I agreed to that but definitely gave it more thought on my way home that day and it just didn't sit right with me. I know he isn't the one actually changing my salary, he's got a bookkeeper and a manager. I also spoke to the person I replaced (who is on maternity leave) and she says that he absolutely will drag out raises (""it's on my to do list"" or ""I'll get to it when I can"" for weeks). I feel like this is his way of seeing how long he can get away with paying me less than what I asked for.

212,"Yesterday I accepted a temporary job within a county organization &amp; position that I've been trying to get for a couple of years now.  My first choice was as a full time merited employee, and I did very well in the interview for that, just someone else did better.  As a temporary employee I have no rights within the system other than my paycheck for the hours worked and I can only work a limited number of hours which requires me to keep a second job.  I accepted because it was a foot in the door and it puts me in front of the right people.  The only difference in the positions is the numbers of hours worked and benefits.

No less than 24 hours after accepting the temporary position, a full time merited position opened up at the same organization for the same position.  Since that position would grant me benefits and a full schedule, I really want to apply.  Like I said earlier, it's the same exact position, in the same organization, only full time and benefited.  I'm in a position where they can cut me loose with no warning or explanation, but it's not like I'm bailing on the organization or even the position.  Should I apply?

After some stupid bullshit, he says that I’m not beautiful and that because I’m not beautiful I should be wiped off the face of the earth. This was mildly concerning because he escalated it by saying more and more. Then he says my first name. I started to become uncomfortable because he was kept saying it. I of course denied this, but then he said my last name! How did he get this information, does it show up on the phone there? I’m scared that he might know my address or other personal things.

214,"My friend is a beautiful young woman with low self esteem. This is because her father forces her to go through extreme diet. She isn't fat in any means. She weighs 53 kilos ( rougly 120 lbs) and she is 158cm tall (5 1"") which is normal in my region. But her father demands much more, he expects her to be this fraile doll like figure, which is kinda creepy if you think about it. He wanted her to lose 10 more kilos.
My friend is only allowed to eat 1 boiled potato, 1 boiled egg, and 1 plain white bread per day. Which isn't enough for a growing 16 y/o. My friend would often go to school pale and exhausted. If her father cought her eating more than shes intended he would beat her up.
The worst part is, her mother gets treated the same way. She tried standing up for my friend once, and just got abused by her husband. She is now too afraid to even protect her daughter.

I'm 19, suffer from depression and onset anxiety quite badly, I currently have a job in retail which causes quite large amounts of stress for me due to my anxiety, as soon as I go to start the shift I sweat profusely and go bright red. I wish I had the balls to go to my gp and ask to be signed off for a good few months unpaid from illness, but I just cannot bring myself to do it, at work I am a bit of a loner but still the 'always happy/laughing' guy, they just would get annoyed at me and blah blah I don't have the balls to ask for months off unpaid.

I have around £14,000 saved up and have a monthly outgoing of around £200 ish, I also have a small side income from sports betting/trading that averages at around -£100 to +£400 a month.

What's your guy's thoughts on my quitting my retail job just to focus on my mental health and try to make a career out of my dream job being an online physique coach/sports trader.

I don’t blame him. I’m currently the only one with an full time job and stable weekly income, my father is a lazy jackass who cares about nobody but himself. I’m beyond frustrated, anxious, and scared. To top it all off, the eviction paperwork includes my name which is bullshit honestly. I give my dad rent money and honestly not even 100% sure if it all goes towards rent. But when we moved in to this apartment I was still a minor. So now I have this on my record and I’m worried it’ll effect me getting my own place. I only have about $1000 to my name and I make about $1500 a month. I think it will take some time for them to force us out, seeing as my mom is disabled and really sick but I don’t know for sure what’s going to happen.

226,"We currently live in North Carolina and after searching for months she only found a new job in Michigan. We do basically everything together. I find myself having made the mistake of only hanging out with her for the past year that we've been seeing each other, despite having been warned about doing exactly that. My friends have all told me (I didn't alienate them completely) that they'll be here for me when she leaves... so that's thankful.

But I've been getting all sorts of responses as to whether or not I should move with her. I currently have a job that I'm not the biggest fan of, even though it pays well (sales) and while I have lots of friends here as well as my parents... I'm still considering moving with her. Her suggestion is that we try out long distance until I can find a job (my company might even be able to get me something there which is fine because knowing I'll get to see her at the end of the day is seriously helpful, especially when I'm not having a good day) and a place to live there.

But of course there's the objective reasoning that I have to go through as well. If it doesn't work out, I'm stuck there with NO support system. And I can't be certain that she won't move to some other place halfway across the country after a couple of years (she says that's about the timeframe she's looking for there) and I know I can't just follow her around for the rest of my life. I'm considering marriage as a possibility down the road, but neither of us are ready for it.

TL;DR I just feel stuck between being with the girl I love and my life here at home. I have no idea what to do. Any advice?

227,"TL:DR My boyfriend is 21, hasn’t finished high school, doesn’t have a job and lives with his mother. Should I continue to just be supportive or should I start pushing him to get himself together?

I’m in a long distance relationship with a guy for over a year now. For all the time I've known him he hasn't had a job. As a friend I felt like it wasn't really my place to do anything but try to be a good friend to him. After we started dating I'd always think ""It's too soon, it's not my place to push him"". This is my first serious relationship I've been in and I'm pretty lost on what to do in this situation. I love him very much and I’m extremely lucky to be with him. I’m in no position to help him financially but I’m more than willing to help him with whatever else he may need. I’ve touched on the subject of maybe looking to get a GED or to maybe look for work but nothing really came from that and I haven't pushed it since. I really want him to be able to support himself and build a life. 

According to him, he hasn’t been outside in two years and he doesn't seem to see an issue with that. He pretty much just sleeps, eats and plays video games. As much as I love spending my free time playing shit, I can’t imagine doing that every day of my life and have that be all I do. He doesn't sleep much which adds to my worry for his health. He has no hobbies or anything he's passionate about. Other than me and a few of his friends he gets no outside social interaction. As much as I love spending time with him I have college to worry about and I can't spend every minute with him. I want to help him because it’s unhealthy to be living the way he is and I want him to be happy.

I have a friend who was around 29 when I met him and he was in the same position. He didn't finish high school, he had no job and lived with his cousin. He decided to find a job so he could rent a place to live on his own. Seeing him transition from not doing much other than smoking and playing video games to working full time, to having an apartment and thinking about moving to be with his girlfriend, was pretty fucking inspirational. It gives me a bit of hope for this situation.

In an ideal world I would be incredibly rich and I would provide for him myself and let him live the way he wants as long as he’s happy. This not being an ideal world, he can’t live like this forever and be happy. He’s says he wants to change the way he lives but never takes steps towards doing that.

Molly is a feminist, so ""hard core"" that she believes the man should pay for every date, and all the woman's wishes and whims, but shouldn't be in positions of power (she used a building manager as an example for a job men shouldn't be allowed to have.) Molly is gluten free, so gluten free that I am not allowed to cook anything that may even contain traces of gluten or touch it without scrubbing my hands because ""it gets on the doorknobs"" and that apparently makes her sick. Molly is entitled, Molly puts out a gofundme every month, asking for help with rent, because she can't afford it.

She doesn't even buy groceries, and leaves the cleaning to me (except for when she notices I've left something for longer than an hour, then she explodes on me about how dirty the house is, calling me lazy, saying I have a pisshead attitude towards the house, saying I'm an asshole, obnoxious, amongst other things, then she will go on a rampage because I didn't get up with a smile on my face while she says all this rude shit to me and help her.)

229,"I've been living with my brother since around the end of February. My parents are severe alchoholics who can't even take care of themselves. My brother is the type of guy who... well... doesn't quite think with the right head. So, about a month ago, after literally only being a few months out of a severley toxic relationship: he's back at dating again. The new girlfriend is ""nice"" to me when he's around, but as soon as he leaves for work, she talks about how ""oh I don't do shit... blah blah. Etc, but that's because of 1 thing: I have no car.

So, when my brother let me move in he let me use his car. I've been using it to get back and forth to the main town which is around 20 miles away. Recently, I became unemployed because my boss would actively single me out, so I called him out and as expected, I was fired. So this leaves me with no job (even after countless hours of applying for another one) and no money saved up to buy a vehicle since I kind of fucked myself over (I grew up poor w/no money so I spent it on stupid shit because I actually had money for once.) and Checking/Savings is completely empty.

Brother's fucktoy decides she'll pay for it so he GIVES HER THE FUCKING CAR EVEN THOUGH SHE HAS A WORKING TRUCK.

There's 3 cats in this house, all of which like to jump on to the top of the fridge, where it sits. A cat must've been retarded and knocked it over into a pitcher of tea, which caused that to hit the floor. She says her kids ""saw me do it"". 

Then, I got her to say what I've been wanting her to say.

""I can take that car from you in two seconds and you'll never get to use it again"" with a shit eating grin. She's purposefully trying to wedge me out of his life. He won't listen to me no matter what I try to say. If he kicks me out I'm actually homeless. How do I get out of this? If I had a vehicle I'd just tell her to fuck off and sleep in my car but, I don't have a car.",20Jul2018,1

- Letter confirming my appointments with a counselor I saw at my school’s counseling center
- Letter confirming my appointments with a counselor at a rape crisis center
- Letter of support from the uni Title IX coordinator (who is also an advisor to a club I’m very involved with)
- Letters of support from two professors

And I won the appeal! I really want to thank these people because without this scholarship I wouldn’t be able to afford my tuition, but I’m not really sure how to go about it. Are there ethical concerns with accepting gifts from patients and students? Is a handwritten card good enough?

231,"So I’m a female senior in high school and I think my teacher who is about 30 likes me. There are examples where he could just be being friendly, but there are some instances where I question what his motive is. We both have a lot in common and get along well. A lot of times during my independent studies we just talk instead, I even skip some of my classes just to hang out as weird as that sounds. Once when I walked into school one morning, I passed him in the hallway and he was talking to another teacher. He found me later that day and apologized for not saying hi to me. He’s called me pretty multiple times and even said things like “You matter more to people than you think.” He always finds little ways to touch me or brush up against me. I sat next to him for a play and he sat super close to me, I felt his hand on my arm and his shoulder leaning on mine. After a concert I performed at, he came up and gave me a hug. We text sometimes, mostly about school related things, but he has messaged me about inside jokes. He’s also asked me about some of my guy friends and told me I could do better. He also acts differently when other people are around. He doesn’t talk to me as much.

232,"     A little history. I'm 35 this year, father of two amazing daughters. I had, from 2006 to 2015 worked for the same company and did well for myself. The office I was in was going to close, we all knew for quite some time, so when a promotion came available to relocate, I took the opportunity and for two years, everything was great.

     In July of 2017, I was terminated with little to no warning. The reason given was that I had used ""racial terms"" while speaking to my employees. The racial term was ""black"", and it was used while discussing hair care and television shows with some of my African American employees. The context of one quoted interaction was one of my employees, who also did hair as a second job, was complaining about how the rain negatively affected her hair. I asked if it was because of a certain product she used, or if it was because she was black so her hair reacted differently. This conversation took place in 2016, and was used to fire me in 2017.

     After being unemployed for 4 months, I had applied for over 300 different jobs. At this point, my wife and i were forced to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy in an attempt to get the bills to a manageable amount that unemployment and our savings could handle. After another 2 months, and a total of 412 jobs applied for, I was finally able to get a new job. The pay was only 30% of my former salary, but it was manageable with our new lower bills after the bankruptcy. 

     The job wasnt bad, but it was the same type of job I had done from 2006 to 2015, so mentally it was difficult for me to go back to. But I did it, I did it well. Because the pay was so low, my family still qualified for medical assistance, at least for my children, and while it hurt my pride to accept help I did it for their sake. 

     After 5 months at this job, I was approached by a friend of a friend who was needing a position filled at a factory in HR. Filing, running reports, basically my favorite things to do. I left my old job amicably, and began my new job. Things were going fantastic, I absolutely loved the job, and my manager was so impressed they wanted to move me from HR to an Analyst position making more money and doing more in depth reporting. 

     Beginning with this job required going through a temp agency for 30 days, then being hired on full time. At 29 days, I received a call from the temp agency informing me that my assignment had been ended, not to come back. The temp agency stated that the IT guy informed my manager that I had ""installed a backdoor to their server"" and I was terminated with no discussion. This never happened, I wouldn't even know HOW to do this. I tried to explain this, but no one would listen and the factory wont talk to me since I was ""just a temp"".

     At this time, I have no prospects. I dont qualify for unemployment, we've used all of our savings to get by, and I've missed out on my dream job. I feel more crushed than I can ever remember feeling, and it's a struggle to drag myself out of bed which is hurting me and my wife and girls. Everyone keeps saying ""Things happen for a reason."" Or ""Things will get better."" But I dont see that. I have no degree, and a 10 dollar an hour job wont cover our bills, even though we have nothing extra other than internet we could take off. How do I come back from this? How do I not lose my mind to the depression and hopelessness? 

How do I get through this crippling depression and no income and keep my family together?

I have no friends to talk to, no family that can help. I dont know what to do and its 100x more scary since I have 3 other people relying on me to support them.

235,"Hey!

So, I have this recurring issue that I can’t find much on and don’t know how to search for it. When I go to bed, at around 3 am I constantly hear this booming inside my head which turns into a loud cheer or scream. I’ve woken up with bloody ears before too and it’s getting to the point where I’m afraid to go to bed now. Couple this problem with sleep paralysis I experience on a weekly occurrence and you have the duo of death. Yesterday night, I woke up today, I fell asleep at around 11ish PM and stayed asleep until at 3 AM, I think, when I heard the booming, cheers, and screams. I say I think because I don’t know. Every other time I’ve had this booming I’ve woken up thrown some water on my face and went back to bed. But today was different, I couldn’t move and as the screams and yelling got louder I couldn’t move I could only see. It felt like I was having a seizure and I started shaking. When I woke up my ear was bleeding, my head ached, and my arms and legs were sore as hell making it hard to move. I’m fine now and it feels like my hearings getting worse and I don’t know what to do about the problem or how to address it. What is it that I have? And why does it occur at that specific time? How can I fix this problem? 


It’s getting harder for me to sleep, and I just want one good night of sleep where I don’t wake up with bags under my bags bag under my eye. This problem has been happening for the past 5 months, but today was extreme. If it means anything, I also get sick very often, about 25-35 times a year. I’m vaccinated ofc, and have no idea what could be affecting this. My sleep schedule was good too, getting 8 hours average a night. I’m 17 (M). 


And last part is when I was 6 I had this traumatic experience with a therapist as one of my family members was mentally insane and I had to watch my parents have to tie them up so they wouldn’t stab me or anyone else in the family. The family member would always scream at me and I became silent and mute at school because of it. I was scared to talk because I thought that if I’d talked I would get yelled at. When one of the therapists came in to my elementary school to talk about it, I wouldn’t talk because I thought what I’d say was  dumb and would end up getting smacked for it. Because I wouldn’t cooperate the therapist started screaming at me, probably because she got fed up with my null face. Since then, for the next 7 years I went through therapy and finally am able to speak very well with others and I’m not scared any more. I never had any nightmares about it and I don’t know if this may be the cause of the sleep issues. If so why is it hitting me now 11 years after the event? I’m lucky I could break through my fear and trauma to talk to others and listen to conversations and am currently loving life! Except for this sleeping debacle.

My parents aren’t abusive and my sibling got the help they needed they’re fine.

* I'll be travelling very light, and basically bringing only carry on plus maybe a personal item depending on the airline.

I knew there would be some ups and downs to living with each other, but I never expected to think about moving out so soon. We live together, but that’s about it. We don’t talk to each other much, we don’t go out, and it’s not fun to be around him anymore, so when our yearly lease is done in November, I want to move out.

Problem is, my roommate doesn’t have a plan when that time comes. I’ve asked him what his plans are, and he’s said that he might renew the lease for another year, (which I don’t want) or he moves out with his other friend, (who has said that he wants to find a house with his brother) but I’ve heard no updates on that since April.

If I move out, my roommate can’t afford the apartment by himself. The reason why he moved out in the first place, is because he would be closer to his work. He can’t go back to his parents house, and make an hourlong commute to his job everyday. Also, if my roommate’s friend doesn’t have a house ready for him by November, he could be screwed. I’m prepared to tell him to find a new roommate, but they’ve been flakey before and might not commit. We’ve been best friends for a long time,  I just think that we aren’t good roommates.

One of them completely and the other talks to me like they used to and treats me like a friend only occasionally while at other times appearing to dislike talking to me/me as a person in general. I’m not the person I was, as I have recovered and am a lot happier than I was back then and I regret my actions deeply and I wish to apologise, however I apologised many times during the events badly and even if they did forgive me, I managed to convince them to leave by doing the exact same thing just days after. So my question is how do I apologise to people I hurt and treated like shit, months after doing so while also convincing them that I was not myself when I did so. Also I’ve known these people from anywhere ranging from 4-13 years so they knew what I was like beforehand. And I can’t move on because I see these people regularly and still have to talk to them/ or are forced in a group situation with them. Any advice is appreciated.",20Jul2018,0
243,"Hello guys, 1st of all I want to say that my English in not so good. Do I want to tell you my story and what is happening. Im 16 years old teenager and I'm playing video games on my free time. I dont have a dad, because I lost him when I was 1 year old. I have a ""stepfather"" and my mom and a sister. So my problem is there that my parents (my stepfather) thinks that im addicted to video games and he is bullying me for that. He tolds me that I'm not a real man, It will become nothing from me. My mom was ok with that I'm plaging video games but she really believes at his words that I'm addicted and she is bullying me too now. Also my mom started drinking alcohol and smoke because of my ""stepfather"". So now my ""stepfather"" dont give me the computer that I worked for it and buyied by myself.  My mom thinks that I don't have friends I don't go outside because of him. But actually I go outside everyday and she knows that but I don't know why she is talking like that. My ""stepfather"" sometimes reaches my mom. I need an advice what to do right now",20Jul2018,10
244,"Recently, my friend turned eighteen. We've been talking about how we're going to rescue him from that house for months and now he just doesn't want to leave. We've been on the brink of getting him, but when we showed up he says no. We've tried this three times. My friend is truly not happy where he is and I know he wants to leave. He keeps making these excuses of why he can't and thinks the police are going to be involved. I'm afraid that his family is forcing him to stay and is feeding him all these lies. 

For example his ""mom"" has been cashing his social security checks for years. She lied to him so she could cash out his checks. His real mom died when he was a baby, his ""mom"" right now is his aunt. He thought we were lying to him when we told him the truth and now he say's he's going to get them. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I've talked to him about this for days, other friends have spoken to him, we've tried to get his head straight but he just won't listen to us. Frankly, I'm losing my patience.

What should I do? I was thinking to just leave him alone and just let him do what he wants but I don't know if that's what he really wants. He says he is suicidal, but I don't really know how to help him. I don't even know if I want to help him. He's self destructive now and just doesn't listen to what everybody has to say. He just wallows in his self pity.

What should I do? Or should I do anything at all?",20Jul2018,1
245,"Sorry for a long and somewhat redundant post, I am new to reddit... skip to the bottom for my questions needing advice 😊

I created a support community through an app for adults who have been victims of childhood sexual abuse.  I created it because it was something I was looking for and I wanted to heal with others through support and community. It can be hard to discuss it with family and friends because it is a difficult topic and it's easily overwhelming for anyone.  

I have made very clear that this group is for community and a place to feel understood, that I am not a licensed therapist nor am I looking to be the ring leader for advice or answers to members - but rather that I can help facilitate a space for people who have shared this tragic experience to be heard at any stage of their process.

The group has been active for a little over 2 months and there are 31 members, men and women of varying ages. 

With that said, I have had 2 meetings so far and am gearing up to have our third. The first 2 meetings were small, less than 4 people and we mostly just introduced and talked about what we were looking for. All positive feedback that I wasnt the only one looking for a group like that. This third meeting we are doing vision boards. We are able to meet in a private conference room at a local restaurant. 

SO My questions are... 
• How do I engage people to show up and participate? I dont care about #s, I'll be there even if it's one person. 

• As a female, how can I be welcoming to the Male members of our group (who I feel are widely underrepresented in this issue in general)?

• What sort of activities would be appealing to attend? ( I am trying to coordinate speakers on stress management, anxiety, etc) 


Thank you in advance for any feedback and constructive criticism!!

250,"Hey guys and girls,

Throwaway account here. I have worked at my job for eight weeks, and beside the slow pace, I do enjoy it. It’s got good benefits and pays much better than my old job, and is a gateway into my career after I finish college.

That said, I’ve had a few issues which were my own fault in the past two weeks. Beginning two fridays ago, I unintentionally falsified information on my time sheet. During the summer I work full time, 80 hours/pay period. I had accidentally claimed that I arrived at 8am instead of 9am when I actually arrived. Small error, I was scolded, and felt guilty about it for roughly a week. I admitted my mistake, notes that I was in fact careless, and proposed making changes to my routine in order to not overlook any discrepancies. All was good and well until today.

This morning I came in at 7:10, yesterday at 6:55. To quote the instructions that I received regarding timekeeping policy, “round down to 15 minute intervals.” I took this to mean literally round down, so I’d mark that I arrived at say 7am today and leave at 4:30 after my eight hours are finished. 

Apparently, it was meant to round down the total time that I had been here, so instead rounding... up. As I was unaware of this policy, I had several days where I had come in slightly after the time that I had recorded, and this was brought to my attention while my
supervisor was validating my timesheet today.

I am aware that this presents itself as a scenario in which I look like I am trying to absolve myself of my full work day and  get paid for time not worked. Meanwhile, it had just been my understanding that I should round down. 

I understand the loss of trust that will likely result from this, and I feel guilty and anxious about being perceived as if I’ve intentionally been acting in the wrong. I would like to know if anyone has advice for dealing with these two feelings, as they ruin my work day and even the weekend coming up.

Thank you.",20Jul2018,1

So about 3 months before she moved, I caught her bf spying on me through a crack in the door of the bathroom after I had finished showering. I never told her this because I wanted nothing to do with their inevitable breakup.

259,"I want to start off by saying that obviously I’m still a minor.



I’m a spoiled brat- I have a Wii U, an Xbox, a Switch, and an age-old laptop, gifted to me either by my brother and/or my parents. Every console is a different experience. Despite all the gaming platforms, I am very focused in school and get REALLY good grades. I also only play on the weekends (well, excluding summer when I’m home alone all week) for about 4 hours both days. 


However, I’m missing the PS4, the final piece to my collection. I actually wasn’t really interested in it until I discovered certain PS4 exclusives- now, my heart is completely dead set on making this my first large purchase, using money I’ve been saving. 


Obviously, my dad doesn’t want this for me. I understand. They have their concerns, as they always do with these things. I do know that a few big ones have been eliminated, though, (Cost, mainly, since I’m paying) but they still won’t budge. I could try explaining that more consoles does not equal more time spent playing games, but refusal is imminent. My parents also get frustrated when I continue to press on with certain subjects, so....

263,"Already posted this in r/jobs

I have already gone to my manager about this, and I'm avoiding this guy at all costs, but if anybody could offer some extra advice that'd be nice. I'm mainly here to blow off steam and vent. 

I work at a discount retail store, we get overstock from places like target and amazon and there's really no planogram because of it. You just gotta find spots or make room for incoming freight. About a couple of months ago we hired some new people, one of them, let's just call him Dev. I was put in charge of showing him the ropes and how to get the job done, and he seemed okay, but a little bit off... Something in my gut told me something wasn't right about him. I just ignored it. We'd small talk and shoot the breeze with each other, again, seemed okay, til it got on the topic of guns. I don't like guns, not like I'm one of those ""abolish the 2nd"" types, but I'm just more comfortable with pepper spray or throwing knives. Dev said pepper spray will not affect him whatsoever... ??? How? Then I told him why I have pepper spray, a dog attacked me earlier this year and I keep some on me for just in case. Dev says he'd just pull out his glock and shoot a dog, like how he had to when he shot his neighbor's dog, and now his neighbor hates him and he's also an enforcer for the Crips in Louisville.

Dev also told me that he likes a coworker/work friend of mine, let's call her Casey. Casey has a fiance, I told Dev that and he said that her fiance was on heroin... I really can't comment too much, cuz that is a really morally grey area, but still, that's not exactly right. 

Then after he told me about where we go when we die, I was just tired of him, tired of hearing him talk and brag about this and that. Dev's just cocky, arrogant, and loud. Kinda person that I just can't fucking stand. 

I'd been staying away from Dev for about a week or so at this point. The other day he tries to talk to me after a week of me not responding to Dev and him just mostly being quiet. ""Hey Slade, how's it going?"", in a super annoyingly happy tone, did that about 4 or 5 times in the span of about an hour or so. Last time he did that, I just looked at Dev and mouthed ""Fuck off"" and walked away. He was with some coworkers and they just busted out laughing when I said that. 

Ever seen Goodfellas? That scene where the kid tells Tommy to go fuck himself, everybody's laughing and cheering for him, and then Tommy, pissed off, puts about 5 bullets in him? Think that, minus the mindless violence, is what happened next. 

A few minutes later, talking to a manager about Dev, Dev comes up to us and asks if we can all go in the office to have a talk. Dev looked fucking pissed walking to the office, mumbled ""We're gonna squash this shit"". Get in the office and we all sit down. 

Dev: ""What the fuck is your problem?!""
Me: ""... I don't fucking like you--""
He just blows the fuck up on me. Dev goes on a rant about how he doesn't like me either, cuz I don't shower and have poor hygiene(he's got me there), I'm lazy and don't do my job right cuz I keep putting stuff in the wrong places(untrue as fuck), and then, regarding me mouthing fuck off to him, says; ""you're lucky I didn't just snap and put you on the ground"", says he's done that over at his other job cuz somebody mouthed off to him. Dev denied that that was a threat. 

Talked to my manager after close and he told me to talk to the store manager. Did that and he's contacting HR, til then he's gonna keep us seperate for as much as possible. 

TL; DR
Guy we hired on is a creep, then cuz I didn't wanna talk to him and mouthed fuck off to him, he told me, to my face with a manager in the same room, that he was about to put me on the ground.",20Jul2018,1

We decided he would move back in with me while we searched for our own new place. I have a roommate and she’s super cool with it. We all get along and are friends.

Here we are 6 months later in the same place. I was setting up appointments to see places according to what we want. Gathering furniture. Taking care of his 1 year old cat he hadn’t had vaccinated or fixed. This is on top of doing the day to day stuff. Cleaning, cooking and what not. Basically he contributes nothing except rent. A couple weeks ago I expressed this to him.I told him that if he could help me with just one thing by taking care of his cat it would help. I booked her first appointment (got sick of waiting), took her and paid for it (he paid back half). All he needs to do is schedule the follow up visit and clean her litter. I asked for the absolute easiest thing. Take care of HIS cat. Instead she knocks over her litter and it sits there for three days until I finally clean it up.

I want to ask him to get his own place. I love him and I don’t want to break up. I just don’t want the responsibility of living with him anymore.

269,"I'm 17 (18 late next month) and I work in a grocery store as a service clerk. My job consists of bagging, carts, bottle room/machines, cleaning/trash sometimes, and a few other things. I started back in May and the manager hired me on the spot. I get along with mostly everyone, rarely have issues with customers, and don't mind it too much except for when B is the PIC (person in charge) she is typically the night person in charge and is very hard to deal with.

She's in her 50s and clearly doesn't enjoy her job much. B's attitude makes working a night shift miserable sometimes. I'll go into some of the incidents that have made her untolerable. A few months back I had a rude customer insult me for saying I couldn't write a rain check (I'm not allowed) I told her one of the cashiers would have to or the service desk could. The customer came at my work ethic and said work is new to me so I went and got B since she was in charge. Instead of helping she ended up laughing it up with the customer saying ""work isn't new to us like it is her"" or some shit. I didn't do anything besides point the customer in the direction of someone who was allowed to write her a rain check on a CERTAIN TYPE OF WATER. That day was super stressful because of people's attitudes and the heat. I sometimes will get emotional when I get aggravated and when B saw me doing so she went on about how my job is a man's job and that I need to become a cashier as soon as I can. There is another night PIC but she's only into 2 or 3 times a week usually and I really like her.

B expects people to stop whatever their doing to pick up on something she thinks needs to be done right that second. You could be bagging a large order and she'll tell you to go outside and get carts. I'm pretty sure the cashiers and the customer doesn't appreciate being left to bag in the middle of someone else doing so. B micromanages and feels the need to tell you what you have to do all the time. I was told that when she was a cashier she wasn't like this and was actually decent. She's called everyone  in the store stupid when we we're alone and is usually always pretty negative. 

More recently, a guy I know that's my age ended up getting into a argument with her. She  constantly tries to make him do things that he cannot do or that is outside of his job duties. They got into in front of customers and ever since she's treated us both like crap. A few days afterwards I was working with her and our bottle room was a mess after it being a extremely busy. She came in yelling at me about it around customers. It was like thqt because due to me being a minor I cabbot use the compactor alone &amp; she rarely wants to fo back there  I started to clean it up. I started to take the trash to the back where it goes just for her to say ""Don't do that. I have to go back there to unlock the compactor and don't have time to do it"" after just telling me to do it. I started to get ready to sweep and mop and she came back and told me she was tired of babysitting me, and when I started to defend myself she told me not to talk back. The store only schedules one service clerk per shift so I cannot get everything done at once. I dp always get everything done. She likes things done at her speed and gets mad if it isn't. I ended up asking the actual manager  for more morning shifts until I go back to school and I got them. I still have to work with her a couple nights a week. 

A cashier told me that about two days ago when I was off and B was working. B came out and yelled at her and another cashier in front of customers for taking a breather after a busy streak in the store and having to do constant large orders. One of the cashiers got super mad about how B acted and went to the store director. The store director is super nice and easy talk to. The cashier told him that next time she acts like that she's done and will walk out. The director told her that he didn't want that to happen and he'd look at the tapes. The customer service manager doesn't do anything  about B because they're kinda close. I was told that about two years ago a employee screamed ""Fuck you. I'm done"" at B, clocked out, and left after something happened. Still nothing was done about her attitude afterwards. Many people have had issues with her.


I haven't went to the store director myself yet. I work with B Sunday night and I don't know what I'm gonna do if she behaves that way again. It's embarrassing to be scolded over something around customers when I'm literally just trying to do my job. She makes me dread working the night shift when she's scheduled. I'm going to the director if anything happens. It night make things worse but oh well. Her attitude is basically constant and she continuously is on my back about something. More has happened than what was mentioned here but I don't wanna make it too long. Anyways, what would you do? How can I stand my ground without getting written up? She wrote the guy she argued with up that I mentioned but the referral ended up getting ripped up by the assistant store director. Lol. I feel like me keeping my mouth shut allows it to happen. I can't quit because I need the job and I don't want to allow her to drive me out of a job that I otherwise don't mind.  What do I do it this happens again? How do I handle it without just enabling her to do it again? I know I can't just stay silent to her and expect things to change. She doesn't know how to talk to people and clearly doesn't work well in a management position..

I could of went on awhile longer but I don't wanna make any longer. 


Thanks in advance!!

It started with this Girl I was dating, she had tons of mental health issues.

She was emotionally abusive to me in every way, she treated me like dirt but I foolishly stuck around because it was my first relationship.


Then I left for vacation for 2 weeks and during then she told me she was considering leaving me for another man. And strung me along with 2 weeks, once I broke up with her after that, she told me everything, like how they slept together, and how its all my fault for drinking once. 

She is getting treatment for her health issues now, which is why I don't hate her though 

What made it worse was that she left me for one of the people in my social circle so I still had to see him everyday. 

So I was emotionally broken from that and lost all of my self confidence. 

I wanted support from my bestfriend, we love eachother every much in a brotherly sisterly sort of way and I knew she could help me get through the rough patch.

Then she had her own issues with abusive parents and she admitted herself into a pysch ward, and I knew she needed me more than I needed her, so I visited her everyday and helped her while I battled my own inner struggles.

Then I tried to socialize more, I went to a bar and that night I ended up sexually molested.

I felt disgusted with myself and I still am. Nothing seems to be going right for me, I hate my life.

272,"Hi so I am not diagnosed with depression however i have been prescribed anti-depressants for anxiety and i have PTSD from my childhood which leads me to have symptoms of depression such as low mood. I am in therapy but i feel as though medication may help.

problem is, i threw out the prescribed anti-depressants because i was scared of the side effects. I’m now feeling low as ever and was wondering if i should go back to the doctors and get more anti-depressants. 

I’m scared of the side effects such has addiction (to the medication) and diarrhea (because i already have IBS). I was wondering what you guys think is best and if any of you have tried anti-depressants and if its worth it. thank you. ",20Jul2018,1

I’ve always struggle with discomfort while walking or doing other activities but I’ve always been able to get by.

The winners were picked by three random judges in the audience. I don't know if the owner realized she was a professional, and I'm not sure if he was even watching during the competition.

5 years I've been in my current relationship. I walked into it with a child and we had one together. Our relationship was beyond magnificent in the beginning, as always ;Shoot me with your daggers later, will you.. he slammed my head into the wall after the first year and I left because um no. Well my dumb 23 year old ass went back. Because I was 23, didnt want to live at home and damn if the dick game wasnt strong. Anyways. He apologized and we moved on. We finally moved from his roommates place to our own 2 years later and that's when things started getting bad. I started my career as a 911 operator and loved it. I made great money, had family for child care which is a true blessing, and my boyfriend. Life was good. But slowly I started to see how manipulative he was to me. Everything was always my fault. I had to do everything. He was jealous of cops I talked to when I was at work saying I was cheating. We never did anything anymore. Never EVER took me out or bought me anything anymore. NOW dont flip out on me. I'm not a materialistic gal at all, but to feel loved and to have fun is a great thing and I want that in a relationship. Shoot me..anyways so I got pregnant and lost my job. Then he didnt step up to the plate at all and blamed me for not having enough money. So I got another job at a bank. Loved it. Had total potential of climbing the later and making good money..but it didnt work for him bc I wasnt home to make dinner. So he got full time and now I stay at home and work on chaturbate 4 days a week and make a great salary. He probably doesnt care since he probably uses the same site. So now hes been hitting me and breaking things almost every time an argument breaks out. Hes broke my nose, slapped a black eye on me and tells me nasty things when I piss him off. My 7 year old has anxiety now and I'm a total bitch due to walking on eggshells. I'm a nice chick. I'm someone who loves hard. I want sex too much. Some weeks he kisses me for real and the sex is great and other times I'll send him a nude pic and he wont respond or he just acts so cold. Not to mention he got an engagement ring and is holding it over my head and said I'm not nice enough and now wont even talk about marriage..ok whatever?..Idk if its stress of his job which I've repeatedly told him to let me take the front and he can find something else, but he wont.  Or if hes cheating with someone he works with, bc I dont know who else, or if he hates me. But I have saved about 100k. And I have no car no job no credit. Scratch...shitty credit. I have a few promising REAL job..career outlooks that I could almost walk into and support my 2 girls and myself. I feel myself fantising about it. Just us 3 and him gone. How happy and free I'd feel to do whatever whenever. Can you pay for an apt. Upfront in situations like these? But then I feel so selfish because kids growing up without both parents sucks. And I hate being lonely. I want a partner. But he really isnt one. I feel like I love and adore him so much but,he gets mad at everything I do. I keep the house clean, I do all the shopping we play video games together and he has his private time..if we could screw 4 times a day we would. So I dont know what's wrong. Do people go through funks? Would you stay with someone who didnt support or care for your passions? What if they didn't seem to care for your well being? Someone give me guidance.

I’m studying. I’m working out and going to the gym, everything like that… and nothing seems to want to change. I feel like I’m stuck in some kind of weird, bizarre static where nothing changes at all despite the amount of effort I’m putting in. That all leads me to question - why do I bother living? Why even bother staying alive?

I have no idea what to think about this. I also feel super lonely. But I know that, really that’s nothing; I know that I’m a person who does better when he’s lonely and by himself. I manage to screw up every single friendship I get into or make the other party absolutely sick of and detesting towards me.

Even with that, though… I still feel sort of coldly and sickly alone. I’m pretty young so I know I shouldn’t even have to be worrying about relationships but still, I feel like I’m already doomed to being totally ForeverAlone.

Lastly, I know by this point I probably shouldn’t care about my physical appearance (you can stalk my history to check) but the fact of the matter is that it’s just on my mind, constantly, all the time.

299,"I'm prefacing this by apologizing if the formatting is garbage, I'm on mobile and multitasking at the moment.

My cousin is 12 years old and failed both Math and English his 6th grade year, and he was given the choice of either repeating the 6th grade or doing summer school. He chose the later.

His mother was unable to assist him with his Math or English, as she works 2 jobs and does not understand the newer gen math. She asked me to help as I went into school to teach but after a short stint of student teaching realized it was not for me.

When we started, both his English and Math grades were around 60%, which is failing (needs at least a 70%). After 1 week I managed to help him to a 93% in Math and a 78% in English, however I came to realize that he has a hard time with even the most basic math concepts. 

* He has a hard time with subtraction, which is extremely bizzare for a almost 13 y/o child. How the school wouldn't realize this is baffling.
* He cannot multiply numbers bigger than 3 or 4, after which he just adds numbers on scrap paper (E.g. If he does 6 x 7, he has to get paper to add 6 seven different times) I tried teaching him times tables but it went right over his head.
* Cannot comprehend division at all. I tried teaching him long division but it was much too foreign for him.
* Fractions, decimals, algebra, etc. are pretty much a lost cause.

So I went to Acadia National Park for a vacation from the 7th to the 14th of this month after giving max effort to help the kid struggle his way through math and English. When I returned he had done no work on his summer school at all, and it is supposed to be done the 24th of this month. There is easily 20 hours of both English and math work separately here. After complaining to the rest of my family that...

* He is supposed to do 2 hours everyday of both subjects and he has done none, why the school never contacted his mother I will never know.
* Now that the math is getting more difficult he no longer cares about it at all, and pretty much just sits there with a blank stare as I try to teach him.
* There is probably no way this work can get done by the 24th.

...They suggest to me that I should just buckle down and do **40 hours** worth of work for my cousin so that he may advance to the 7th grade. I am unsure what to do in this situation.

tl;dr: Cousin failed 6th grade and has to do summer school. He is clearly not at a 6th grade level for math or english. Family wants me to do his summer school so he can go to 7th grade.",20Jul2018,3

301,"I won’t go too into detail. There is a lot. But here’s a gist of what I’m working with.
TW Drugs and Abuse and NSFW? 

I have a very dysfunctional family. My mother has been distant for a chunk of my teenage life. My (late) father was verbally and physically abusive. My (late) step father sexually harassed me and verbally abused me. I struggle with severe BPD and I have 3 mentally ill siblings. One has aspergers. One is Bipolar. One is a drug addict. 

I’ve always had issues with my family. It lead to my GPA slipping in high school, I’ve received counseling since I was 8 years old. I am capable, but it’s been hard to strive in my environment. My ACT scores were very high (29 and 30) but my GPA was about a 2.9. My parents raised us all to be fucked up, and it’s been hard for myself to stay off of drugs. I was a pillhead and a burn out through my early years of high school. I’ve never been in trouble with the law, but I constantly make impulsive decisions because of my BPD and it’s resulted mostly in me hurting myself. I’ve smoked cigarettes for 5 years now. I have been hospitalized twice for mental related issues.

That’s just backstory. Recently got into a quarrel with my family (again) and it was officially the last straw. A lot of things were said that can’t be taken back, my sister threatened to file a restraining order on my boyfriend, she almost attacked me, and she put a huge hole in my mom’s wall. This started because I misplaced something minuscule of hers. It only stopped because I threatened to call the police. (This was at 3 AM.)

Now, I start college in a month. I’ll be attending University with my boyfriend, and I feel like I am running out of options. I don’t feel like it’s safe to go home. I have been wanting to leave for a very long time, but now I’m old enough to legally escape my situation.
I don’t make a lot of money. I work for a struggling newspaper company as an online journalist. I make 9/hr and I am limited to 20 hours a week.  Can’t stay with him because his dad doesn’t really wholly approve of our relationship. We are an interracial couple. 

My car is stuck at my mom’s house. I can’t pay to get it fixed and I can’t drive it to a shop because it won’t run. I literally only make about 700 dollars a month and I don’t know how else to make money. I’ve tried selling my art but no one is interested. I’m considering selling nudes and videos as means of getting by. 

My boyfriend is medically separated from the military and can only support me so much.  He’s been feeding me and getting me place to place but that’s as much as he can afford. None of my friends can let me stay with them because they either live with their parents or they have roommates that wouldn’t approve of me staying.

What can I do. I feel like I’m running out of options. I’ve been looking for new jobs but no one pays people right out of high school as much as my job does. I can’t request more hours, either, because the company doesn’t make enough to pay me extra.

How can I make money? How can I keep strong? Where can I go? Would I be a bad person for selling explicit pictures of myself? What resources can I rely on? Please tell me what [you] did in similar situations.
I may be homeless by the end of the week.

302," Last night, my (23 f) boyfriend (28M) said he was feeling lonely and a bit down in the dumps. 

And so, I asked him what I could do to help. He replied saying that a loving message would help pick up his spirits. So, I sent him a really heartfelt message and said that I was really happy with where we were at. It's been a really bumpy road for us and continues to be rocky, but we are actively working on things and are positive about the future.  
He replies asking ""did you just say that to say that or do you mean it""(which probably stems from him being insecure about how i feel about him despite multiple attempts at me trying to constantly reassure him i love him). To which, I replied ""no i meant that"".   
We started another conversation with flirty/playful pictures and then all of a sudden he stops replying for another 2 hours. By the time he replied it was already 1 AM and I kind of got annoyed.   
And then my thoughts started to spiral. Long story short, but he doesn't want to add me on social media because of the fact that I have deleted him in the past when we fought or after we broke up (and this was when I was younger/it was and is my first real relationship -- not to justify but i have learned that this isn't okay) and because he doesn't want his family and friends to know we are dating.   
So, despite getting back together with him, I did mention that the social media/friends/family thing really bothers me and is a huge sore in our relationship.   
SO i started like sorta stalking some of the girls he follows and he likes all of these other girls selfies/picture of them showing off their outfits. IT BOTHERS ME not because of the women but because I AM HIS GIRLFRIEND and he doesnt even do that for me. AND i dont get to see what he posts.   
I guess I was picking a fight because whenever I go MIA after a certain time, he flips balls and so I did too. In the past he has lied about where he would be so i got a little suspicious and started to find shit to reinforce my anger which i realize is shit and not healthy.   
BUT I HONESTLY FEEL LIKE MY BOYFRIEND SHOULD ADD ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA... We sleep together and share everything except this.   
And i feel like the progress of us getting to that point is contingent on whether or not I can start trusting him -.- and this doesn't help me.   
Ugh i hate that i kinda threw a bitch fit because he didnt reply/get what i wanted but i do feel like it is deep rooted and isnt that simple based off our previous relationship dynamic/trauma.   
Would you be mad, too? What should I do (breaking up isnt where i am at)?",20Jul2018,1
303,"Hi
So I'm having difficulties making up my mind about this girl I've been seeing and now having a long distance kind of thing. 

Because I had a cuple of sad break ups past few years I was intent on taking it slow. Rather too slow than too fast. Especially with the distance (different countries). 

She is younger than me and I feel we might have different ideas about what to expect from each other; I think she probably fell quite in love and I appreciate her a lot. 

Somehow I still feel insecurity. My mind starts drawing all these pictures about how bad it can go in every single way, and I get kind of claustrophobic about entering a relationship. Which is by the way something that has been my biggest problem so far in life. 

How can I approach the situation to find out if I should let it slide or keep it? Do you have any advice?",20Jul2018,1
304,"So a little back story, my little brother is twelve and lives with his mom while I live my dad. My brother comes over once a week (or is supposed to) and its the only time i see him/play with him. My father usually drops him off at school in the morning but since its currently summer, he sees him less now. My brothers mom has always gave the story that because its during school, he cant come over on week days. But now since summer has come and almost gone, we still only see him about only 4 times a month. this being the case if we dont get to see him a certain week, understandably, wed like to know why.
Our father and his mother dont really talk and most messages between them go through my brother. When they do talk its usually about sending money to her for my brother.
So when asked about why he wasnt coming this week he replied in a way that wasnt like him (especially since i talk to him on discord). It was in fact the mom sending messages acting as my brother when explaining these types of things. Shes done this a multiple times now.
So now when our father calls her out on this, immediately using her own phone says that shes blocking my fathers number on his phone.
The big thing is though shes always head over our heads that we see him at all is because shes not taking us to court for more money. So we always feels helpless to her will, since we dont have much anyways. I help dad with whatever he needs and we've almost gone under a couple times already but were saved by friends or luck. And here's the kicker, she has two other children with two different men and my brothers told me they see they're dads more often then we do, and thats probly because they've been taken to court as well.
This whole situation for me seems helpless cause if i try to talk to my brother about it he tries to avoid it, or i feel if i push it on him i feel he may just not want to come over at all or tell his mom and then that'll be another thing she'll have over us.
This feels like a battle only my dad can fight, and hes talked about going to court, despite what little we have. Is there any lawyers or people with this kind of experience out there that can shed some advice for a young adult who just wants to see his brother some more? ",20Jul2018,2
305,"I'm 25, from Peru, I already gradauted from uni but I don't feel entirely happy with my life.

Ever since I was a child I've been very shy, mostly because of my parents' constant fighting, most of the people that know me consider me a shy and polite person, and even though there's nothing wrong with that, I think that has caused me to never been able to speak up for myself when I needed to.

When i was in university my then best friend introduced me to my ex gf, and to sum things up, it was not a healthy relationship, during the almost 4 years we were together she would flirt with her exes and other guys and when I asked her about that she would say it was nothing and that I was overreacting, she even flirted with my then best friend. Me and him fell out and the worst part was that we shared a lot of Friends from school and they didn't know what had happened so I just stop hanging out with them because I felt it would be weird, so basically I ended up with no gf and no Friends.

When that relationship ended I focused on my studies and grew closer with my Friends from uni, i got good grades and obtained my bachelor's degree last year, on top of that I got a girlfriend now that I love very much, but still, I feel there's something missing. I feel my life is kinda boring, I wish i could travel but I don't have the money nor the time for that, I got a job with a decent pay but its not something I feel passionate about, I wish I could work in Digital Marketing, that's kinda my dream and it was my favorite subject in university but there aren't many Jobs for that in my city.

Like I said, Im 25, got a great gf, good Friends, try to cope the best i can with the problems in my family but I feel something's missing, there are some days I genuinely feel happy and there are days when I feel depressed, I wish I knew how to change that.

Anyway, advice would be very much appreciated although even writing it down helps.

306,"I graduated high school mid June this year. I have always been super motivated and on top of my shit. But a few months before graduating I started slipping. My grades and health especially. It kept getting worse and worse. 

I didn’t get accepted into any universities because my intended major is super impacted. I think that definitely contributed to my loss motivation. I was barely able to get registered for the fall semester at my local community college. I just cannot bring myself to check my emails that are super important to school.

314,"(Tldr;)I'm almost 30 years old and if you asked me what my living situation would be 10 years ago I would have never thought I would be taking care of another 30 yr old man, possibly with mental health issues..

(The long version) I'm currently away serving in the Armed Forces.  My wife, who stays at home in the states, has a brother who is about a year older than me and is the down-on-his-luck type.  I guess thats the nice way to put it.  There may be some mental health issues but I don't think he's ever been properly diagnosed.  Introvert, becomes anxious around others, battling depression and suicidal ideations.  With all of these things mixed together it is a challenge to hold a job.  Now, if you sat down and talked to him, none of this would be apparent.  He fits the sterotypical stoner persona.  Easy-going, smokes, plays x-box, and jokes all night.  To the point where I have trouble determining if depression is an actual issue.

He's lived with his parents for the better part of 30 years and was finally asked to leave.  With me being away and my wife alone at home, we thought this would be a good opportunity to scratch a couple backs at once.  He keeps his sister company and we help him build confidence getting a job and finding an appartment.  We wrote up a little contract outlining everyones expectations.  You live with us as long as long as you hold a job, or are actively looking for work, pay x amount of dollars and will vacate shortly after I come home.  The idea was to collect his rent and basically give it all back to him as an appartment-warming gift to start his path to indepence.  This is where the story gets complicated.

He hasn't been working for a month.  He held two jobs, lost one and walked away from the other for personal reasons.  Stopped paying rent and has nothing to his name except an x-box and some furniture.  It's been reported to me that he really isnt looking for work just stating that it's too hard.  I really wouldn't have any issue about just kicking him out, but remember the mental health thing.  He's recently expressed his plan to kill himself in the event of eviction.  Going into gruesome detail about his sister finding him somewhere in our home.  I genuinely can't tell if it's a child saying anything to get his way or a legitimate threat.  My wife has already lost a sibling to suicide and I'm not willing to call a bluff, be wrong and put her through that again.

We encourage him to get counseling or see health professionals to consider medications, or see if there are any special treatment centers to help get him where he needs to be.  I have no issues with him visiting my home as often as he likes and will continue to assist every chance we get, but I need my home.  I need my privacy.  I'm ready to start this next chapter with my wife, and I think it's important he start his own.

**And thanks if you've read this far.** I do care for him as a person and would love any advice you have regarding mental health or people who have over-stayed their welcome.  Do you feel like I'm being cold-hearted?

325,"I'm 17 (18 late next month) and I work in a grocery store as a service clerk. My job consists of bagging, carts, bottle room/machines, cleaning/trash sometimes, and a few other things. I started back in May and the manager hired me on the spot. I get along with mostly everyone, rarely have issues with customers, and don't mind it too much except for when B is the PIC (person in charge) she is typically the night person in charge and is very hard to deal with.

She's in her 50s and clearly doesn't enjoy her job much. B's attitude makes working a night shift miserable sometimes. I'll go into some of the incidents that have made her untolerable. A few months back I had a rude customer insult me for saying I couldn't write a rain check (I'm not allowed) I told her one of the cashiers would have to or the service desk could. The customer came at my work ethic and said work is new to me so I went and got B since she was in charge. Instead of helping she ended up laughing it up with the customer saying ""work isn't new to us like it is her"" or some shit. I didn't do anything besides point the customer in the direction of someone who was allowed to write her a rain check on a CERTAIN TYPE OF WATER. That day was super stressful because of people's attitudes and the heat. I sometimes will get emotional when I get aggravated and when B saw me doing so she went on about how my job is a man's job and that I need to become a cashier as soon as I can. There is another night PIC but she's only into 2 or 3 times a week usually and I really like her.

B expects people to stop whatever their doing to pick up on something she thinks needs to be done right that second. You could be bagging a large order and she'll tell you to go outside and get carts. I'm pretty sure the cashiers and the customer doesn't appreciate being left to bag in the middle of someone else doing so. B micromanages and feels the need to tell you what you have to do all the time. I was told that when she was a cashier she wasn't like this and was actually decent. She's called everyone  in the store stupid when we we're alone and is usually always pretty negative. 

More recently, a guy I know that's my age ended up getting into a argument with her. She  constantly tries to make him do things that he cannot do or that is outside of his job duties. They got into in front of customers and ever since she's treated us both like crap. A few days afterwards I was working with her and our bottle room was a mess after it being a extremely busy. She came in yelling at me about it around customers. It was like thqt because due to me being a minor I cabbot use the compactor alone &amp; she rarely wants to fo back there  I started to clean it up. I started to take the trash to the back where it goes just for her to say ""Don't do that. I have to go back there to unlock the compactor and don't have time to do it"" after just telling me to do it. I started to get ready to sweep and mop and she came back and told me she was tired of babysitting me, and when I started to defend myself she told me not to talk back. The store only schedules one service clerk per shift so I cannot get everything done at once. I dp always get everything done. She likes things done at her speed and gets mad if it isn't. I ended up asking the actual manager  for more morning shifts until I go back to school and I got them. I still have to work with her a couple nights a week. 

A cashier told me that about two days ago when I was off and B was working. B came out and yelled at her and another cashier in front of customers for taking a breather after a busy streak in the store and having to do constant large orders. One of the cashiers got super mad about how B acted and went to the store director. The store director is super nice and easy talk to. The cashier told him that next time she acts like that she's done and will walk out. The director told her that he didn't want that to happen and he'd look at the tapes. He doesn't have a relationship with B like the manager and seems like he actually cares. The customer service manager doesn't do anything  about B because they're kinda close. I was told that about two years ago a employee screamed ""Fuck you. I'm done"" at B, clocked out, and left after something happened. Still nothing was done about her attitude afterwards. Many people have had issues with her.


I haven't went to the store director myself yet. I work with B Sunday night and I don't know what I'm gonna do if she behaves that way again. It's embarrassing to be scolded over something around customers when I'm literally just trying to do my job. She makes me dread working the night shift when she's scheduled. I'm going to the director if anything happens. It night make things worse but oh well. Her attitude is basically constant and she continuously is on my back about something. More has happened than what was mentioned here but I don't wanna make it too long. Anyways, what would you do? How can I stand my ground without getting written up? She wrote the guy she argued with up that I mentioned but the referral ended up getting ripped up by the assistant store director. Lol. I feel like me keeping my mouth shut allows it to happen. I can't quit because I need the job and I don't want to allow her to drive me out of a job that I otherwise don't mind.  What do I do it this happens again? How do I handle it without just enabling her to do it again? I know I can't just stay silent to her and expect things to change. She doesn't know how to talk to people and clearly doesn't work well in a management position..

I could of went on awhile longer but I don't wanna make any longer. 


Thanks in advance!!

326,"Hey all! I live in an apartment 1st floor, to get to the second floor you would have to  go through the driveway or to get the the 2nd floor porch, The guy upstairs is very nice but had a crazy alcoholic girlfriend whom he got a restraining order against. She is about 40 years old and her father has to drive her &amp; her adult son around - none of them have jobs -they are on welfare. 

A little background into her personality: When she was living with the guy upstairs for a short period of time she would get insanely drunk, play loud latin music from 7 pm until I left for work at 5  in the morning. She would yell, scream and fight with the guy upstairs ALL night. The woman and her son are thieves, they took everything the guy upstairs owned when he had police come to kick them out after he got a ro. I  have to get up at 5 am for work every morning so you can imagine how little sleep I got.

It’s been about a year since i’ve seen or heard her until today, perhaps her restraining order is up because it has been almost a year. Today was my one day off and I heard her voice at 7:00 this morning ...She had her father drop her and her adult son off and they proceeded to get out and scream the guy on the 2nd floor’s name while she sits on my steps while her son circles the house throwing rocks at the second floor window to wake the guy up, they were wanting him to unlock his door.  He never did.


I want her to stay away from the front part of the house including the front property, Her lazy ass has no business being anywhere near the front.

I told her if she really wanted to she could get it for herself but I couldn’t help pay.

339,"I absolutely hate myself. It's not even in that modern ""edgy"" sense. I legitimately hate myself because I can't follow a few simple things.

You see, I'm 15, female and currently 250 pounds, give or take. I've had a problem with weight ever since I was small, although I remember being somewhat healthy up until I was about four. I desperately want to change the issues but I just can't. I've lived a completely sedentary life style for a couple years now, and I basically enjoy being a shut in more than anything else. Despite having friends, I don't bother going out with them. As you can imagine, this means I'm sitting at home, browsing the internet or playing games rather than actually doing some form of exercise. My eating habits are the main issue. I've gone on a lot of websites to calculate BMR, just to find some way to start dieting effectively, and they've all put me at just over 2000 cal but at least one has gone up to 2200 (not an overestimation, I'm just a freakishly tall 6 ft woman). Even with knowing that, I still manage to clock in at well over that amount. Even when aiming for about 1200-1400 cal, I can't do it. My day starts out well, managing to eat maybe 400-500 in the beginning due to the big dinners I have, but by afternoon, I end up giving in and eating a bunch of ice cream an cookies, which brings me to either that 2000 estimate for BMR or well past it (in the previous weeks, it's gone up to even 2600). Every time I do this, I end up hating myself and I can do nothing but mentally berate myself for being such a failure. 

My worse nightmare would be ending up at 300 pounds, because by then I feel I would do nothing but give up. I would simply accept the fact that I failed the one thing that I desperately wanted more than anything else, and eat myself to death. I don't want that, but I can't control myself. Sometimes it just feels like I have someone pulling me with strings, directing me to fill a bowl with half a tub of ice cream and a bunch of cookies to match. But I know this is all my fault. All of this is my doing, and I have to take action to do it. The only issue is, I can't. That's why I'm turning to this subreddit. I clearly don't know what I'm doing, so maybe someone else does.

My friends don't really believe I'm fat, so asking them wouldn't help. Me being so tall combined with how I carry that fat makes me seem a lot smaller than I really am. It's all mostly in my abdomen (39.5 inch waist in fact) with the rest being around the thighs. I just have a lot of practice with sucking it in, so it doesn't look as bad.

Thanks in advance to anyone who can help.",20Jul2018,1
340,"Hey - so in the last month my mother almost died. She is doing better but I think she will be in a more fragile state moving forward. She has COPD, which is progressive. It has been traumatizing and awful. She is my father’s caretaker, who is disabled and also stubborn as hell, and has injured himself to the point of being incapacitated twice in the last three weeks. The house is disgusting. It’s totally overwhelming (I don’t even live here and am taking a leave of absence to be my mom’s caretaker). 

It’s clear that without my mother’s ability to caretake moving forward, this set up is no longer sustainable and they need to be in a more accessible home and where they can get immediate access to medical care.

343,"I (27M) have moved to a major city (~ around 1.5 million) since 3 years. Work, place to go out and opportunities are easier to find here as well as being engaged in a community, and I also found good friends. Although I meet my family once or twice each month back in our small town (~15k), my mother expressed her concern that she wants me to move back home and stay in for indefinitely. She also offered to care for me forever (doing dishes, making food etc.). My parents do live mostly by themselves, so they have little to no friends which may have emphasized their decision to get me back. Home is not very far as I need 4 hours to drive.
The small town is getting older and the people leave to the bigger cities, I love my parents and want to care for them and I am afraid that moving back will turn out to be a bad decision for myself. There is a bigger city (~250k) in an one hour driving distance, but jobwise it doesn‘t offer much of what I had studied, also, I think it will be harder to form new bonds as an adult and start from zero again. Relationship-wise my parents wish me to have a GF soon but also wish me to stay in the room where I grew up as a boy. 

My parents are good and lovely people, but I‘m also an adult who has built his own existence here and I have the feeling that they try to reverse time by putting me back into my childhood life. Our talks about distance between family members get very emotional for my mother who doesn’t want her children to be away.

351,"This is a long story TLDR at the end. It's a fuck up that's little over a year old.

Disclaimer: I really fucked up. I was the worst. I know this and I carry it with me. I still feel guilty. Please don't be cruel or hurtful. This is the worst thing I've done in my life, I'm sharing it in hopes someone can tell me if I can make it better. Y

So first, I'm 27 M.

This girl, let's call her T (25 F). We met in college. Instantly clicked. It was super cool, we had similar humor, our music tastes blended pretty well. We became quick friends and talked a lot about insightful, meaningful things. She started developing feelings for me. I had just gotten out of a very long relationship. She said we could be happy together but I got cold feet and I said no. This really hurt and dissapointed her. Eventually, that dissapointment and pain tore us apart. We became distant and she just straight up disappeared. I got really really depressed and hit some bad lows. We didn't talk for like a year. During this year I bounced out of depression by dating another girl, let's call her A(25 F). Me and A have been together for a while and everything's ok. T suddenly reappears and starts talking to me. I'm so so happy to hear from her again. We start talking and it's like she never left. I didn't have the balls to tell her about A. We agreed to see each other so we did, ate a couple of burgers together had a good time. At the end I was so overcome by sadness/happiness from seeing her again that I hugged her really tight, maybe she interpreted that as something sexual or romantic, for me it was an expression of affection. She wanted to met again but I felt extremely guilty. My guilt was eating me alive and when I couldn't take it anymore I confessed to both A and T. I told T about A and I told A that T knew nothing about us. T sent me straight to hell, of course. A forgave me after a while but we're not together anymore. I didn't cheat or directly lie but I wasn't honest and I can see how much pain I've caused. I never wanted any of that. It's been little over a year. In my mind it's not romantic or sexual, it's about a person I miss and I want back in my life. Is there coming back from something like this? Could T ever forgive me? What should I do? How do I get her back? Please offer genuine responses. Again, please don't be cruel or hurtful. I know I fucked it all up.

Now, just to clear up. Me and T did have romantic times but like I said, I was too scared to go through with it. Now I'm not sure if I want something romantic or friendship. I'd be happy if we could just talk. This story is about T.

TL:DR: I never told my female friend about having a girlfriend. She said she wanted nothing else to do with me. One year later I still think about her. Can I get this girl back in my life? How?",20Jul2018,1

353,"After high school I went to college to become a nurse. I just finished my second semester and I took 2 months of work off during the summer and have just recently gotten a job at a restaurant. These 2 months I took off were really about relaxing and thinking about what I want to really do in life. As rewarding financially as nursing is, I know for a fact I don’t see myself doing it. Especially not in the long run. I’ve actually found something that I think would be really cool to do and something that I am really interested in...I wanna breed ball pythons. It sounds crazy and very very different from being a nurse but I really have a lot of faith in myself that I can get my business going and build up some customers.

So I live at my parents house still and I spend the night at my boyfriends house. Both our parents are not okay with ball pythons. They’ve both said that they’ll let me get one if I finish nursing school. That obviously means my only choice is to move out. I don’t make enough to move out, at least with one job I don’t. And I know there would be no way I could finish nursing school while working 2 jobs anyways.

My plan is to quit nursing school, find a second job, save up for a house to rent, find a place that will allow me to build up my python collection, start breeding and then I guess see where things go. This is something I know I’m really into and I can see myself really enjoying. I just know it would be a waste to keep going to school for nursing.

I’m asking on Reddit because my close friends and family have basically told me to stay in school. I know they’re only saying that because they love me and want me to be a nurse. However, I know you guys don’t know me and I want honest, un-biased answers. Is my plan really that bad??? I can’t tell if I’m just clouded by my dreams lol.

She wont let my dad go and get tags for my car. she refuses to be flexible in taking me to the class even though shes doing nothing and forces my dad to get off work, take me, then drive back to work while she sleeps. 

I told her I wanted to get a job to have money to “do whatever I want with”. apparently this was the wrong thing to say because later while me, my dad, and my mom were sitting on the porch she was like “Alright lets lay some ground rules. You can’t go anywhere besides school and work with your license. Speaking of work I dont know what ‘whatever you want with your money’ means but Im not having it”. ???? what does that even mean? besides I just want to go shopping like any other teenager and I like to go and see my friends. Why is this such a crime to you?

The past few days she has been rude, touchy, and unappreciative. I cooked dinner and cleaned the house but when her and my dad arrived home they had gone to eat and fussed at me for waisting food. I didnt even know they had gone out! She also did not even say thank you for me cleaning and cooking and laundry and dishes and making her bed and giving our dog a bath. 

She invades my privacy. When I was about 12 she started trying to find out how to look at all my text messages and when she couldn’t she just locked my phone completely. I basically had a glorified alarm clock until I was 15. When I did finally get a real phone she tried all these shitty back door apps to login to my instagram and snapchat. My passwords for everything are now just a bunch of random numbers and letters because she cant control herself. 

She grounded me because I tried to kill myself in 7th grade. Grounded me. I was too emotional. I was too stupid. I didn’t appreciate what she was doing for me. I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and she refuses to get me medicated because she thinks itll make me weak. I broke my finger a few months ago and she didnt take me until late at night to get a cast for it even though she was off work and could of easily gotten me from school on my last day. When I told her I was sexually assaulted she didnt do anything besides say “I never want to hear about this again. Understand?” She back handed me tonight because I told her she shouldn’t hit anyone. 

I dont know what to do. I’m only 16 and I want to have a happy life but I cant get through it without my parents finical support. Im not close at all with any family and I cant get anyone else to help me. I am not going to call CPS because I go to a really nice high school and my situation in foster care would definitely be worse.  Anything would help.

362,"I am a single, 27 year old man of average or slightly above average appearance(as rated by women on the internet). I am confident, polite, clean, masculine, and articulate. I have a graduate education, a great job, social skills that aren't atrocious, and a lot of ambition(I have lived on my own since age 18 and just bought my first house). I only say these things so you know I'm not a smelly, unemployed neckbeard who lives in his mother's basement, which could easily explain the situation. I try my best to stay humble.

My problem is that regardless of how I meet young women...I just can't get them to actually show up to first dates. Online, at the gym, at the grocery store, at Starbucks...it doesn't matter. The interaction could go swimmingly, and they could seem very excited to meet up...but when the day comes...usually an hour or two before we are scheduled to meet, they cancel with a very transparent excuse and I'm never able to nail down plans again. Worse still, I've had several of them just stand me up completely and fail to show up to the bar or restaurant, leaving me sitting there waiting.

I should state that the sample size here is quite large. We aren't talking about 5 women or something. Over the 10 years I've been dating (not counting the 4.5 combined years I was in committed relationships) I've probably had somewhere in the neighborhood of 150 women flake last minute on a date. 

I have worked very hard over the years to improve both myself and my actions with women, and have found some of the advice over on r/seduction to be very helpful. I mention this because after spending a lot of time in those communities, I can't see where I'm making any major mistakes here. I am direct, I don't text too much or too often, I make plans early and I make sure they're clear (""This place, this day, this time"" rather than ""friday, we will figure something out"".) I make ""low pressure"" dates (coffee, beers, maaaybe mexican food), I'm not pushy, etc.

The women I've had success with over the years have for the most part been very ""stand up"" people, who are the type of people who simply are where they say they will be when they say they will be there. This is about the most attractive trait to me at this point because of the above experiences. That being said, I'm hesitant to just make the assumption that all of these 150 women were just flaky by nature...which makes me question if there's something about me that's causing the issue.

365,"Hi everyone. I have had a stalker for over 10 years. I have created a new reddit so that he \[maybe\] does not see this post, but then again.. he sees everything.

We were friends. Then weird things started happening. My boyfriend started getting calls from prostitutes and random women were claiming he was texting them. They would show me the texts, but they were from times where he and I were next to each other and his phone was not with him/I 100% know he was not on it.

Then a random email account appeared on our computer. It was full of replies to craigslist ads soliciting sex. Some pictures were of me and my boyfriend others were random people we didn't know. Then it signed out in front of our eyes. I tried hacking back into it. I was not able to, but in doing so I was able to see some of the back up email address, in a format such as g\*\*\*y@gmail.com \[not actual email\] but I recognized that this may be my friend's email. I typed his email in and it said the code to reset password was sent to him, listing the full email address that was his usual gamer tag/username for everything.

I knew he was the stalker. He often talked about hacking into routers, computers, and messing with people. I messaged him on facebook and he denied it and blocked me. I tried going to his house because I was genuinely confused and wanted to talk. He called the police on me and they told me I can't go to his house because it would be harassment. I explained the situation to them and they said ""there are no laws against these new waves of crime."" 

We felt we had nothing to do. But things continued.

My friend called me one day while I was out with my boyfriend. She said ""have you been texting me?"" I told her no and she figured it was my stalker as I had warned my friends about it. The next day she showed me the text messages, my phone number at the top. I was supposedly confessing my love to her and telling her I think she is beautiful. Thankfully she believed me.

Another thing he likes to do is create fake Tinder accounts with my boyfriends picture and talk with girls. He will create numbers on texting apps. My friends have come across them before. Sometimes they engage in conversation with him to see what he will say. It is always ""do not tell her, she cannot know.""

He also was fixated on a friend of mine that we lived with. He used her picture and posted craigslist ads and would give out our address inviting people to come for threesomes. Thankfully we lived in a secure building.

He has gotten my boyfriend fired from jobs for pretending to be him and it is taking a toll on both of our mental health. We do not know what to do. We KNOW it is him, but there is not enough proof to do anything about it. I know he is still talking to people pretending to be us, but I do not always find out about it unless someone questions me about something.

What can I do? I feel like there is nothing I can do. I do not have extra money for a private investigator... but I don't know what my other options are.

374,Just had a break in yesterday. I'm thinking when they break in what they consider is reward and the risk. My house doesn't seem fancy and they really don't have any reason to believe my house has any better loot or reward than any other house. So the question is how to make their break in more risky? First thing that comes to mind is video cameras. The thing is though that the act itself won't be prevented or risky. If they wear a mask the video won't be used until after the act is over and even then it's useless. So what is the best way to prevent future burglary?,20Jul2018,2
375,"sooo its like what? a month and a half left from my summer vacation aaand this whole time ive been looking to get a job, i tried to get a job at one of my moms relative's place(at which i worked when i was 13).. and I tried to get a job at Hardees(heck they don't even hire people under 18) and now all that's left is to get a job at ANOTHER one of my mom's relatives.....a not very close relative, you see i have worked for THIS one when i was 14 after the previous one, with the previous job everything was alright.. i worked hard, there were great people(great boss), and the pay was honest, but with the OTHER one...ehhh..not so much: the boss is douche, i worked as hard as the previous job but the boss expects even more sweat, also they paid me less than what they promised... in short this job is just horrific but its the last resort...but my question is: how do i convince the very same boss to hire me again this year? i COULD call them right now but im afraid if they say no i wont get a job anywhere this year, AND I \*NEED\* A JOB.. as if STARVING, plus even if they say no i COULD ask them again later like the next week but i dont want to seem clingy

376,"I only have two friends but I feel like they could not give a shit about me at all. If I died tomorrow neither of them would care.

My one friends constantly calls me fat and ya I’m fat but it’s annoying. She also tried to get me to convince my dad to lend her his truck which he would never do because she doesn’t even have a license. She told me I’m a square and that’s why I have no other friends. 

My other friend is a weird cat lady and any time I talk her all she talks about are her cats like they are people. Her family members were in the hospital and all she cared about were her cats. She also doesn’t care about me at all and she’s always just complaining about her jobs but doesn’t listen to anything I have to say. 

Also, I make good money and own my own home. They constantly tell me how I grew up too fast and how my house is shit meanwhile they both rent terrible apartments and work minimum wage jobs. 

I’m just done with both of them, should I cut them off or just let it fade away?

377,Long story short my mom has been favoring me and treating my brother like shit for like two years. Today she made him cry and I finally snapped. We argued a little and now she’s mad and more bitchy then usual. This is still stuck in my head. How can I forget about it?,20Jul2018,1
378,"I had a friend from 10 years ago whom I ended the friendship with on ugly terms. She joined a cult and my parents sent her a strong-worded message to her to stay away from me.

It seems like she didn't hate me and didn't have malicious motives for joining the cult, more out of naivety than extremism. She asked a mutual friend to pass me a handwritten message to say goodbye before she moved countries. I felt bad that I couldn't meet her one last time, as my parent grounded me.

I happened to see her as a recommended friend on Facebook after accidentally syncing old contacts. It seems like she had left the cult, got married and lived a fairly normal life as a school teacher.

Should I reconcile with her? It is unlikely that she will remember me after a decade since I changed names and moved away to a different country. It may be awkward as well as I am no longer the same person as I was before and we may be too different to get along as we used to.

Another reason that I think it may be a bad idea is that some of my ex-classmates were horrible to me (someone made a fake account of me to damage my reputation) and I want to forget that part of my life. I am worried that they may know my whereabouts if she is still friends with any of them, when I have done my best to erase my old identity.

Is it best to reconcile or let it go?",20Jul2018,1
379,"So my older brother, 22, has lived with us for a while. He is violent, has a drinking problem, and is overall very hard to live with. A couple weeks ago he drank, damaged the property, and went to jail. Our landlord evicted him and said he could not come back.

But he got out of jail yesterday and guess what... my mom let him come back here and is hiding him. She’s so soft. She says it’s just until he finds a place but I know that’s bullshit. He actually has a place to go: our grandmas. Which is where he and my mom agreed he’d go but I’m only 15 so I can’t move out. The only place I can go until he moves out is... our grandmas.

380,"Hey everyone!

I've been stressing over this decision for the past few days. So I got my roommate for residence and right away I realized we wouldn't be a good fit. I'm very social and outgoing and love parties. This person is very shy and quiet. While I wouldn't have a problem with my roommate not wanting to party, she just gives me a very weird vibe. She's very religious and certain things she's said to me have rubbed me the wrong way. Keep in mind that we have not moved in together yet.

I emailed my university about my concerns and they said they could switch me into a different room. The only issue is that this room is in a different residence, called the Thompson residence. The residence that I've gotten assigned to is attached to all the other residences so I've heard it's very good socially and for parties. However, the residence I could switch into is not attached to the resident complex. I have heard they do throw parties and are social, but because of the fact they are seperate from the other residences, it's harder to attend all the res parties.

I also face the issue of not knowing who I'm going to be paired with in the Thompson residence, so it could be with somebody equally as bad. However, I do have a friend in the Thompson residence who has said we could switch and become roommates if we both aren't vibing with our roommates.

I really don't know what to do. I know it might seem like a silly thing, but I really want to have the best university experience possible. I didn't have the best high school experience, so I want to meet more people and expand my social circle even more.

Thank you everyone for listening to my rant, advice would be appreciated!!",20Jul2018,3

Sometimes if he gets too stressed or upset he'll go and drink. My grandma is getting really fed up with it. Today while my grandma was at work, he came over to show me some flowers he bought for her. He put them in a vase then went to her workplace to give them to her. He then came back half an hour later passed out in the truck with a beer in his hand. I talked to my grandma on the phone and asked her if he brought her the flowers. She said she loves them and is happy he's trying to make things right. I couldn't tell her he came back drunk.

So to quickly summarize, 2000 in bank, looking to invest 250 right now and I want it to be a long term investment. I have a part time job so   I do have income coming in, but it's really not lucrative for me to spend more than 500 right now in investments. 

So given how little I can invest, should I be looking at penny stocks or ETFs? Before you say anything, I understand how risky penny stocks are.

390,"Me and my best friend have been friends for nearly 5 years now and I love her to bits she is legit my everything. But lately things seem different and I’m worried we are drawing apart. 

Everything seemed fine till about 5 weeks ago things started going downhill. As the summer holidays drew closer I noticed we weren’t talking as much, well, at all tbh. I kept trying to make conversation but she shuts me down by giving me short ended answers or just ignores it. 

After a while I’m having a shit couple of weeks so I kind of break down to her over text and explain how I’ve been feeling trying to find out why she wouldn’t talk to me and what I had done. But she never truly gave me an answer, it was always “I’ve just been busy lately” or “Just havnt been wanting to talk to anyone lately” but I can clearly see all the posts she puts up of her out with other friends and other friends have said she talks to them. After the breakdown and a few tears later she says she wants to hang out, she says she’s gonna take a day off work and we can hang out and talk and I say yes...

Fast forward to the day that (today) and it went pretty shit (which is great for someone already having a shit couple of weeks...) I originally thought we would go out for breakfast or if go round hers or something but none of that happened (granted she’s not the best at planning things out) I suggest we go see an old teacher as he was leaving soon but it didn’t work out. At this point we had only been together for about 30 mins so we just walked back to her place. Pretty upset that I didn’t get to say goodbye to my teacher I’m reassured that it ain’t all bad cos we still have the afternoon together... only that doesn’t happen...

I get to her place and talk for a little while (like 5-10 mins) and then she asks when I’m leaving... kinda hurt I ask why as I thought we’d get to spend time together (since you know, it had been like a month since we properly spoke or hung out.) she says she has friends coming round soon...

I’ve been going through a rough time lately so maybe I’m just overreacting but it just seems like she has no interest of being friends anymore or that I’m being replaced and I’m worried. Any advice on how I could salvage this? I want to make things right.

391,"So some details about my situation. I’ve been smoking weed consistently for about 2 to 3 years now since my sophomore year of high school. It’s the summer after my senior year and I’m heading into my first year of college. My parents hate weed, both of them. I’ve been caught multiple times and each time they drug tested me until I earned their trust back and then of course I started smoking again as all of my friends do and I didn’t have anyone to hang out with that wasn’t smoking. My mom specifically hates it much more than my dad. She doesn’t want it to be legalized and has a strong misconception about the affects of weed. I’ve tried to educate her about it but she is so close minded and stubborn I’ve given up on trying to get her to understand. My father on the other hand used to smoke weed in high school but hasn’t in a very long time. He’s for the legalization of weed as he knows he has no room to judge how other people live their lives, but he doesn’t want me to do it, as I am his son and I live under his roof which means I must follow his rules. Last time I got caught, my mom went as far to say as long as I continue to smoke weed, I don’t love her, which is ridiculous. I love her but we just simply disagree morally on weed. My biggest predicament is they threaten everything they can financially. College, bills, etc. I want to open up about how I am still smoking, but I am afraid that they will kick me out and then I can’t pay for college. My father does very well for himself, so I qualified for little to no student loans. What do I do? Do I open up? Do I keep it a secret until after college? I’m stuck, I hate lying and this is the only thing I ever keep from them. Weed has positively impacted my life in so many ways. I’ve been able to make a lot of friends, become more social, and I feel I’m finally enjoying life to the fullest. I’m surrounded by it constantly and I see so many of my friends and adults smoke and be successful, so I see nothing wrong. What do I do?",20Jul2018,5
