Also, if there is another subreddit I should try, please direct me there.

Thank you in advance.",03May2018,1

2,"It all started in September of last year at a place called “Job Corps.” Job Corps is a training facility operated by the federal government where low income youth aged 16-24 can learn a vocation, get their High School diploma and drivers license etc. also, you LIVE on center. You get three meals a day... have to wake up before 6:am every day, do chores, follow extensive strict rules and blah blah blah. 

Well anyways, this program is not for the weak. It is a harsh place with some pretty harsh people. I’ve been through the program once before in Texas, so I came in knowing what to expect (or so I thought.) 

At Job Corps, you will meet the worst people you can imagine possible (the liars the theifs and the manipulators) but also meet GENUINELY, the coolest people you can imagine. I thought I met a couple cool people... please read on.

I’m 24 and male. Never really had any true friends in my life. I had one and he ended up sleeping with my girlfriend of 4 years, after 9 years of (best)friendship with him. It’s been a long long long time since that occurred. But After that, (and still to this day) I’ve been pretty low-key on relationships and friendships. 
4 years went by without a single friend. And I was okay with that. I was content. I was “happy”

I decided to try out Job Corps one more time. I went to get a solid foundation. I promised myself I will not get involved with anyone because i need to focus. And I figured, none these people matter, I need to DO ME for once. But boy was I fucking wrong! :( 

The first day of job corps is on a Monday and you come in with several other students. Male and female. The whole next 4 weeks you are in classes all day with them. So you get to know them well. There was one girl who stuck out to me. (Never happens) she was fucking gorgeous and just an awesome personality.... the only girl in fact in that 4 year period who I can make eye contact with and not feel awkward and most importantly.... TALK.  Her name is being changed for this story but let’s say “Lily”
Sadly I found out that Lily has a boyfriend. but fuck it lol. I was perfectly fine with being friends with her, because she was just... cool. And different. And not ghetto like most of the ppl. And I’m not the type of guy to get in between anything. 
A couple days later Lily told me in class, all excited and happy that she has broken up with her boyfriend (of 3 years) for some guy she has met on campus a couple days ago. It had already been done and they were already a couple. I wasn’t jealous, I was just nervous for her.
Anyways.... her boyfriend (who ended up being my best friend) was fucking awesome too. I was so surprised. His name “Alex” ... Alex was a long hair, 6’2, tatted up rocker who was a (100% serious) devoted satinist. But I always looked past that. 

For the next 8 months we are all with each other 24/7 
We all had the same classes thoughout the day, we ate breakfast, lunch and dinner together and stayed out on campus till mandatory cerfew enjoying ourselves. 
I never felt so comfortable around people...and I was for once truly happy to have found such a great group of friends. 
I spent time giving advice to both of them on occasion during their fights and always promoted their love. I could tell it was genuine. And I totally admired that. 

Anyways, it always worked out like... I was broke they paid for me and they were broke I paid for them... a lot of money spent on each other and that okay we had some great times. And I never minded being a 3rd wheel it didn’t feel like that at all.  

I had to go to the hospital for respiratory failure one night and actually “died” for a couple mins in the ambulance. They were at that hospital the next day (could of got in trouble by the school for leaving without permission) and they stayed the whole night and next day with me...

Same thing happen with “Alex”... he had to go to the hospital. And me and his girlfriend traveled 2 hours by bus to see him and spend the night because that’s the kinda friendship we all had. 

The two of them knew everything about me. I told them my deepest, darkest secrets. “Lily” always used to go through my phone and find out more info... she got my moms contact and dads contact info just for fun and yeah that comes into play later.... she always made fun of me but I guess in a friendly way? 
They knew I was struggling with suicide and depression and they always used to tell me “it’s in your head” and “you can talk to us whenever” but when I did, it was always “you got so much going for you” and “damn that sucks” so it was not much help ever, but I can’t expect anything like that from them. There not my therapist. 

They knew I took meds and always told me I’m stupid for taking them and that I don’t need them... one day I was in one of the darkest places I’ve ever been. I was in my dorm on a Saturday afternoon. I said “fuck it” and impulsively took all 23 of my anti-depressant pills. I immediately texted “Lily” telling her what I did and how I fucked up. She said nothing. She sent her boyfriend in to my dorm to check on me. 
About 1 your later she asked if “I want to go get pizza with the two of them and talk it off” I said sure. So I come down to the courtyard where they were waiting...and they said “ before we go let’s talk” they just went on for 2 minuets how much of a dumbass I am and how stupid I am and that if I had a seizure then they’d have to tell my mother blah blah. I understood though and in some ways they were right. But that tough love or whatever kinda hurt.  They also made me give them the rest of my anti-depressants and they would distribute them to me every morning. I was fine with that. It was actually saving my life. I was really in the dumpster. 

I never broke down in front of anyone before. Honestly. But let me tell you. I’ve never cried as hard as I did in front of them. Saying “I’m sorry for what I did” “I’m so stupid” as I handed them my pills. They said “yeah we all learn from mistakes” “just learn from it” still not what I wanted to hear. Lol I just wanted a hug but they’ll never know that. :(

The next morning came and I asked can I get one pill and they said “we threw them out” “you don’t need them” I was freaking out. I knew the withdrawal effects and how I’ll feel without them. I explained that to them but they said “it’s all in your fucking head” after that they stopped hanging around me for a day or so because they got tired of me asking if I can please have my damn medicine. 

But I’m not a snitch. I didn’t want to tell on anyone. Especially my “best friends”
So I tried resorting to cutting. I didn’t get far. While trying to break the shaving razor to obtain the blade I cut my finger open and needed to be transported to the hospital for stitches. 
I come back that night and tell them what happened and that I’m feeling really fucking sucidal right now.... and first “Alex” hit me in the face “your such a dumbass” and “lily” just staring me dead in the eyes speechless. ... Alex said “do you” and walked off and Lily followed. I was left there alone. So cold. I was broken. 

So I went to a corner that’s hidden and started breaking down. I did not stop crying. Security had to come after cerfew and they had to call supervisors and other staff because I wouldn’t move.... wouldn’t pick my head up off my lap. Later on, when the whole school was sleeping, the security brought over Lily and Alex to talk to me and convince me to get up and go to bed. 
(This was soooo super rare that security let them come talk to me) but I listened. 

“First off, if you really wanted to kill yourself you would have done it by now, second this is just a cry for help, third we’re done with you, we tried to help” and they walked off. Lol that probably was the most painful moments of my life. But once again, what can I expect. I gotta roll with the blows. Take the punches??

The next day I wake up a 4am like a depressed zombie. I get dressed and leave the school (which can get you kicked out immediately) I had plans on killing myself. 
I texted Lily and told he I’m done and that she’s right “I do want to kill myself and this is a cry for help so here it is” 
And shut off my phone. I just couldn’t do it though. I stayed at the beach the whole day. 

Then Came back to campus around 9pm I was greeted by the police and security and everyone. I was reported as missing and sucidal. Lily had reported it.  So basically I got kicked out. 

After Lily and Alex found out they texted me saying “were so sorry if this is our faults. Your still our best friend and we love you” 

I loved reading that but it meant nothing to me at this point. So I blocked them.

Ithought I found the best friendship anyone could wish of having and here I was so happy then to be shot down like this. 

I just don’t like how the last physical interaction I had with them was them saying my sucidal issues are attentional after them depriving me of my meds and laughing about it.

So my question is/are
Am I over reacting?
Were these not such great friends? 
How do I stop feeling so broken from loosing them? (It’s been only 3 weeks) 

I hope this story isn’t all over the place I tried.

3,"So I’m a guy, 21, straight, in Uni and more or less an introvert unless it’s online activities or something I like eg Films and Games.

Spend most days alone which is fine, but longing for love, a GF. Though seeing as I’m hopeless at that, at least something to help me emotionally vent and feel comfort. I found some success with ASMR but I can’t listen to the same audios over and over and there’s few that I can immerse myself in.

In terms of what I’m looking for, it’s less traditional ASMR (binaural audio’s uncomfortable) and more passive role play, it’s more about the performance. I’m the sensitive/shy type so reassurance, empathy and comfort is what I’m looking for, as if they can see into my soul, hold me and tell me everything will be okay... told you I’m sensitive.

For some reference, ‘Let me Draw You’, ‘Comfort after a Nightmare’ and ‘Encounter with the Vampire’ by Teacup Audio have been the ones I resonated with the most up to this point. Don’t know if that helps but we’ll see.",03May2018,1
4,"I'm currently in a relationship that will fail eventually. I don't want to put her through this. I'm going to be halfway across the country for 4 years and I can't sustain this relationship through that. She's madly in love with me though, and I want to let her down easy. I want us to be friends but I'm scared to tell her how I feel. I feel like she'll be really upset and won't accept it. How do I do this? Any advice?",03May2018,1
5,"I wanted to ask here because idk if this was a thing to be mad about.

So just today I was in a DnD session where we added a new person to our group, Larry (not actually his name and all the names I list will be the same). So we we're playing a regular session with me (Dragonborn Eldritch Knight), Sam (Tabaxi Rouge), Layla (Triton Druid who was playing the first time), and Greg, the new person who was a ranger (don't remember race) and we were all level 3. 

So basically Greg had gotten a bounty for a Giant and had dragged the rest of us along (our pc's were meeting for the first time). So we got into an encounter with the Giant and basically it killed 2 people (Me and Layla) with Sam rolling Death Saving Throws. Greg had killed the giant all by himself but the exp was split evenly because it did an attack on all of us and Greg had mentioned when we died we could be revived later at a temple with the gold he got later from the bounty. So after the Giant had been killed Stripes was still rolling for death saving though but this is what I got mad at, Greg said to the DM and I quote ""with my alignment being Neutral Evil I walk over to Sam and Cut his throat"" and used the excuse of ""I wanted to give you a boost in exp for when you make new characters to my level"".

 So I was (at the time I thought) rightfully ticked off that he would kill a fellow PC just to give himself more XP and give that kind of excuse. Also we hadn't gotten to do anything in that fight except our druid turning into a giant centipede by request of our ranger because of poison fangs. But everyone was calling me a crybaby because I was whining that Greg had killed us all.

So idk know if Im in the wrong or in the right. I just didn't see it nessicary to kill of the only remaining PC alive just because you wanted a exp boost. I would understand if they knew he was gonna die or Sam had asked them to. So am I right or am I wrong?",03May2018,1

I don't know much about the other girl, but she seemed really nice, but when she sees my friend, she looks like she's ready to run away and won't look us in the eyes, and my friend seems... happy about it?

8,"So this actually happened a few years ago, but sometimes I think back on it since it was a bit weird/embarrassing/confusing to me.

A few years before this happened, my friend and his family invited me and a bunch of other friends to spend a couple weeks on an island in Greece with them at a villa they rented. They had also invited a couple that are friends with my friend's parents. At some point I guess I mentioned to my friends that I found the wife in that couple to be quite attractive (I may have used the terms hot or sexy - I was like 16 at this point). Then a year later on another trip that I couldn't attend, I guess my asshole friend mentioned it as a joke to his parents, who then mentioned it to the wife (-_-). Slightly embarrassing, but I didn't think I'd ever see her again, so who cares? Well, I get invited to my friend's Christmas party, and when I asked who'd be there, he mentions her and that she's divorced and that his parents mentioned that she was feeling lonely. At this point, I'm 18 and all our friends had just graduated and so this was also a family/friend get-together and celebration. I knock on the door and go inside and am greeted nicely by everyone that was already there. A little bit later she arrives and comes in through the door. I'm obviously slightly embarrassed and I know that my friends and even the parents hosting are not shy and are instigators, so I'm kind of worried that someone will randomly bring it up during a lull in some conversation or something. I look at my friend's mom (who I'm close to and is the closest friend to the divorced wife) and she smiles suspiciously. Out of everyone in that room (probably 15 people), she asks me in front of everyone to help her friend carry her bags upstairs to her room (she travelled from abroad and was gonna stay there for the weekend). So, of course, I do it, she follows me up, I drop off her bags in her room and intend to join my friends downstairs again. But she's comes in the room with me and starts talking to me a little bit, thanking me briefly. I turn to leave her room, but she stops me and asks me how I think she looks (keep in mind that I've never really spoken to her and probably the only real link between us is that she knows that I complimented her a few years back, if she even remembered me that is). She opens up her coat and does a spin to show me her outfit, and asks me if I think it's appropriate (for the dinner party). She was wearing a nice top and some tight black pants, which she showed me from all angles thanks to her spin. I smile and say something like ""ya you look great"". I was getting some minor signals that I wasn't entirely comfortable with considering the context, and made my way back down to the gathering and continued the evening.

The reason I'm asking this is cause I'm bored and it's a fun little memory to remember, but also cause later that night I told my buddy about it and he hyped it up like something major happened, but I didn't really think so. So what are you guys' take on it? Nothing much, a little something, or something more?",03May2018,1
9,"There's a girl who is now with my ex. When I was with my ex, she was into my ex. They're now together and in love.

I was always threatened by her all along. We circulate in similar circles and whenever I would see her out at music nights (when I was still with him, AND since they've been together) I give her *ZERO* eye contact. I pretend she isn't in the room. I pretend I'm having an amazing time laughing and joking and showing absolutely zero weakness or interest in noticing her existence. Deep down, I feel awkward and I'm actually really interested.

She, on the other hand, employs the opposite tactic. She stares at me (not glares, but just looks rather constantly, without shame) and has even ended up standing and dancing right beside or behind me numerous times. I would've chosen the opposite side of the room if it were up to me, but she comes right into my space and shows no shyness in staring at me. That's behaviour i wouldn't dream of doing myself as to me I would think it showed way too much interest. I could interpret this as gloating/aggressive behaviour but 1) she did this EVEN when I was with my ex, so she had no reason to feel superior back then, and 2) the ONE time I gave her some eye contact to see what she would actually do if I looked back, she immediately averted her eyes to ceiling in an almost cartoon-like attempt at seeming as though she hadn't been staring at me all evening.

Is this threatened behaviour (over compensation), or is she asserting dominance (actually completely confident and not at all threatened by my presence)? Are we essentially doing the same dance, in 2 different ways? Or just feeling completely different ways in eachothers' presence?",03May2018,1

14,"**TL;DR: I wrote a story about how my parents hate me because I'm gay and my teacher told me to submit it to a writing competition. I won and my parents are mad because I'm ""ruining their reputation.""**

Ok guys so I'm really dumb but we already knew that. I don't really know how to handle this situation because I'm proud of myself for getting the award and want to accept it, but my parents are going to go nuclear if I do that.

Essentially what's happened is that back when I was extremely suicidal, we were given this assignment to write a short story for our Creative Writing Unit in English. The day I wrote the story I was extremely emotional \(if men are allowed to be that\) because my parents and I got in a fight about my grades or something \(I've had all A's and B's this year though\).  

I was already planning on killing myself in a few days so I figured that someone should know my pain, and I ended up writing this story about how my parents never accepted me. Honestly I just wanted someone to tell me that I could be cured and everything would be alright, but in this life things never go as planned.

My teacher didn't read my story until after I tried to kill myself and was in the mental hospital, and he told me it was really good and I should submit it to a writing competition. Since I figured that I would never win anyways and he had already done a lot of work to help me submit it, I went for it. I don't think this man actually understood what I was trying to say in the story but he was being really nice to me so it would've been rude to decline, ya know?

Anyways, I completely forgot about it until yesterday when I got home from school and my mom was waiting for me. She handed me a letter from the school and said ""you better not embarrass me"" and walked away. Since the letter included the title of the story I'm assuming she had some idea what it was about. 

I read the letter and I won first place in the competition!!! I felt really good but then I read that first place winners have to read their stories aloud at the awards ceremony. I'd be fine if my parents weren't gonna be there but my mom told me later that she and my dad are going to come to the ceremony to make sure I don't say anything bad about them.

So yeah. I don't know whether I should decline the award \(if that's possible\) to keep my parents happy or if I should just go with it and risk the wrath of my parents. I didn't even want to enter the competition, I just wanted a hug.",03May2018,36
15,"I live a very nice life, we live in a pretty big house, I can't complain about that. But I am 16 years old, and I just butt heads with my parents a TON. They are EXTREMELY controlling.

I also don't do much outside of school, I just put a ton of work in there. My sister, on the other hand, does theater, and is quite good at it. It seems like my parents are always favoring her \(she is younger\). They are all work \- I recently was forced to uninstall Fortnite from my computer because I ""could"" play it at school, even though I do really well, and don't. I can't send a text without it being subject to being looked at later, and then I explain it. The first thing I have to do before I even start my homework is to go downstairs, and put my phone in the kitchen so it isn't distracting. They read my school email so they can know what is going on.

16,"My uncle owes both my mom and my other uncle a very significant sum of money. It's been about two years since he borrowed from one of them and has promised to pay a monthly sum that he never did, and it's been about a year since he borrowed from my mom and also never gave anything back.
Now, the problem isn't really that they need the money, but that he seems to be sinking deeper and deeper in debt. He bought a nice car a few months ago, and is going on vacation soon (and is certainly acquiring more debt to do so). He likely has a ton of debt besides what he owes my mom and uncle. And while my mom is willing to just let it go and not talk about it my other uncle is getting a bit angry about the whole situation and thinking of bringing it up to him. 
Now, this uncle has helped us financially a long time ago (though everything was paid back in the agreed timeline), so it feels a little bit wrong to even bring it up.
The only purpose of bringing it up would be to prevent him from continuing to make terrible financial decisions rather than getting the money back.

I love working out, and it's a passion. But football just isn't really fun anymore. It's fun when I dominate the opponent which is rare and now near impossible playing on varsity. The stress is getting to me. I'm constantly stressing about messing up and now I'm playing for varsity. 

It's spring ball, and it's been pretty hellish. I won't lie Im pretty worried for our first scrimmage. I'm playing with starting varsity as a backup and not doing well. I'm getting my ass kicked and struggling to learn our ever changing defense. I play inside linebacker. If I don't get moved down I'm looking at second string next season. 

Part of me wants to know what playing on 'friday night lights' is like but at the same time my GPA has gone to an all time low. My grades have fallen. I want to be more of a well rounded student because at this rate all I have going for my college application is 'football' and a below average GPA. I'm not good enough to get a scholarship so I don't know what's the point of continuing. I'm not having fun and I'm tired of the sport. But at the same I know this pain is temporary. I fear I will regret this decision.

Granted i can be immature at times, but besides that the people my age don't wanna do fun things besides drink and smoke, not really up for exploring the town.

The last girl i hooked up with was also a first year, i didn't know until a week later after we hit it off. She's nice and i broke it off because there wasn't much there so i told her we ought to be friends instead. Haven't talked to her since. Now i'm starting to develop a crush for a girl in a class i have, as luck would have it, she's also 2 years younger than me (though i thought she'd be older).

A 2 year difference isn't big for friends or a relationship, my parents are 5 years apart, when i went to my CC i had friends a year or two older, i still have friends my age back home, but it's the stigma of them being new and the pain knowing that i'll be long gone after they graduate.",03May2018,3
28,"So my parents used to be overweight and as they started losing weight I guess they decided to start their sex life back up, anyways the layout of our house makes it so that I have a room that is conjoined to their bathroom and also their room. I understand as they start up their sex life again they don’t know how to be careful in terms of keeping it quiet. Also not to mention they have a special sleep number bed that vibrates and their bedroom is right above our dining room with all of the china shelves, so naturally you can hear the China rattling and the vibrating. Anyways it makes me slightly uncomfortable and I don’t know how to approach them without making them uncomfortable and embarrassing them. I also don’t wanna sound like I’m giving advice on their sex life and that maybe they should wait till  I’m either asleep or out of the house. Anyways any tips would be appreciated.

TL;DR: due to the layout of my house I can hear my parents having sex, so how do I approach them and tell them without embarrassing them or making it sound like I’m giving them advice on their sex life.",03May2018,4
30,"My Dad is 86. I am 26. 

Growing up it felt like I had my life fucking made. I had a great group of friends, rock solid Identity, hobbies, everything. 

But at 14\-15 I lost 2 uncles and a gran to cancer. I had a girlfriend from 14\-18 who was bipolar, She ends it with me a bit after my 18th or 19th birthday, and my life has just crumbled around me. I chose her because I thought she was a safe bet at the time. Turns out I couldn't have been more wrong. I feel like I have been majorly grieving and feeling the loss of my dad since I was 18 and I'm thinking this may be why the relationship fell apart to start with. My Dad was the strongest person I know. and he is just getting older and older, To see his strength turn into humilty and weakness is heartbreaking. He used to be physically very strong and a good runner as well. Now his knees are playing up, he has diabetus, he has had prostate/bladder trouble. 

I have fucked up so many oppotunities with my life because I dont want to fuck off and leave him in his old age. I have gone through a stage of depression/frustration/punching through doors etc, and I don't know if its because I am grieving Dad or if its because I am unemployed after having shit job after shit job. I had a huge downward crisis/downward spiral, wasting a hell of a lot of money\- the rest of my savings \- on poker/forex. I racked up thousands of hours playing games, watching porn, etc and I realise now what it is. It is all trying to fill the huge void that has been left behind since Dad has got old. He was an absolute rock, and it feels like I have become the rock now. I have completely lost my identity. At 18 he was saying to me the best thing you can do mate is get married. 

I thought he was fucking insane, I didn't feel ready for marriage at all, and I wanted to live a hell of a lot more. But now I see why. Because carrying the stress of aging parents alone is fucking hard. 10 years back I was really popular, I had girls competing for my attention, but obviously through all this shit I feel like I would be a burden on any girls life, and its the reason I havent made a move on any that were into me. 

My grandparents are all dead \- and thats another thing, trying to figure out where I come from. As Dad has aged I have been more curious as to where I am from, what were my grandparents like etc etc. But it feels like the identity of being part of the family is just slipping away every dad bit by bit. 

I have pushed away the few mates that really knew me. I thought they were the problem, I thought my ex was the problem \(maybe she was a bit\). But Im realising a lot of all this shit is to do with grief.  

I feel like I have lost my mind and wish I just moved out at 18 and got on with my life. fuck, I wished I didnt listen to anything my dad said for the last 10\-15 years because its all been fucking wrong for me? or has it? I did 4 years at college doing graphic design and it lead me no where. I did 3 years as a food delivery driver, 6 months mcdonalds, a warehouse job, a factory job. but have been unemployed a few years now after everything has taken its toll on me. 

I kind of feel like I have retired before my time. I cant see the world the same way for the life of me and kind of feel like a ruin of myself.

I don't know how to be anything but myself so getting used to these changes is crippling me.

I guess my question then would be, how much did your world change when you lost your dad? Because right now I am feeling like I don't want to live at all in this fucked up situation which is my life. 26 seeing my dad get older every day. I dont know who the fuck I am as I let everything fall apart when this started happening. Every time I feel like I am comming out the other side of hell I go right back in it again. I cant relate to half the people I know anymore and Im starting to realise things will never be the same",03May2018,3
31,"I'm looking for some advice on whether I should do a Kickstarter campaign. I've done a couple of sculpts which initially were going to be exactly that but due to the impracticalities of storing large clay sculptures, I cast them in resin, and hey presto I've now got cosplay masks.
Seeking approval from complete strangers I uploaded them  to Reddit/Imgur where they were pretty well received, and I got a lot of interest from people wanting to buy them.
So I'm looking for some advice on how to go about selling them. Obviously there are the pro's of doing a Kickstarter campaign (if successful) such as having a definitive amount of orders to be completed within a specified timeline. 
On the the otherhand approaching the people that showed interest, directly means that I don't have to worry about the campaign being successful.
If you want to check the masks out you should be able to find them by looking at my profile. That's not a plug to get more coverage but for anybody that's about to give advice having a look at what I'm offering makes sense, TIA",03May2018,4

33,"I recently got offered a job at a restaurant if I complete my training successfully. This isn't my first job. My other job was also in a restaurant and I got fired bc I was too slow. I always have trouble closing bc it's a lot of things to remember and I get nervous. At my current job, I am told I am too slow. Apparently someone left a negative review about the restaurant bc on my first day of training I was going too slow. I am a slow learner. I always have been. I am especially really bad when I do things in front of strangers for long periods of time. I feel really anxious about this. I am thinking of quitting and looking for a retail job instead but I don't wanna disappoint the manager and my family. At this job I work 5 days a week and I don't have time to come home after school. I come back at 10. My mom told me to tell him I can work all throughout the week so I did. I just can't do it.

I thought it was just my lack of experience but my friend picked up overwatch as his first FPS game and gets placed to plat while I'm in still bronze after almost a year of playing.

36,"This is my first ever post and I created this account just to be able to ask this question. As the title states, I am the son of a sex offender. My dad was convicted in 2010. He stayed in jail for 10 days and had to live away from home for another 8 months. He has done 8 out of his 10 years of probation so far. Every month or so he has to talk to his probation officer, and I believe he has to take a lie-detector test every 1 or 2 years. As you can imagine, it wasn't and still isn't easy on my mom and my little brother and sister. 
It happened when I was in 6th grade, but I didn't really understand the consequences until I was in 8th grade. My really close group of friends abandoned me and spread this information along with fake rumors all over the school. Luckily, I entered 9th grade the next year so not as many people knew, and I had the opportunity to meet new friends just like everyone else. In 10th grade, it came back up. I started getting text messages from numerous people that I did or didn't know. It seemed like everyday someone new would text me, maybe an old friend from middle school, old basketball teammate, or someone in the grade below me. They all said the same things ""you're dads a sex offender GROSS get away"" ""did your dad every hurt you?"" ""why do you live close to me?"" As you may of already guessed, my house shows up on those websites, so if somebody didn't already know, they could easily find out. 
All this bullying and other stuff has settled out, and at this point if people find out, I don't really care. If they don't want to be friends with me because of that, then they weren't a true friend to begin with. I'm always glad that it happened to me first because I don't know how my siblings would handle it, or how it will affect them if it anything like that does happen to them.
On to the part I need advice about. Like I said earlier, this has been hard on my family, especially my mom. She is Japanese and met my American dad when he was in the Navy and stationed in Japan. She moved to the US and has been here ever since, visiting back every summer. I honestly don't know what she thought when it all happened. Why didn't she just leave, what made her stay and continue to live with our family? I know that if it wasn't for her, I wouldn't still be living here and I'm forever incredibly grateful for her. But if you have an Asian parent, you know that they appear sweet and loving to the public, but they're actually very strict parents. Ever once in a while, she will just go off on my dad, talking about how he is lazy or ruined her life or something bad that he has done. She just lets out all this bottled up angry, and all us kids have to stand and watch as the mom we love goes through some much anger and sadness and my dad can do nothing but apologize. I forgot to mention this, but my dad is a good guy, I think he just made a mistake one day. I can't ever truly forgive him for what he has and always will have put my mom through, but he is a great father and I'm glad he is able to live with us. Anyways, these outbreaks/talks honestly make me scared and question my family. For example, the one she had today was about how my dad constantly forgets his cellphone at home or forgets to charge it when he knows his probation officer is calling that week. I'm not a professional, so I don't know what things they need to do, and I'm pretty sure neither one of them would want to see a counselor. How do I get my dad to stop being lazy and fix his problems without always make him always sound like a criminal like my mom does? How do I get my mom to not bottle up all her angry and be able to coexist without these random outbursts that scare the whole family? Thank you all for any input. This is a very sensitive topic so I appreciate the help. ",03May2018,3
38,"Hi, so, to give some context, I'm a pretty short and skinny guy (5'4"" 110 pounds). I'm 17 and going to college in the fall

Anyways, I was wondering if height (and other physical traits) really matter to most women. Adults in my life all tell me they don't, which I find very hard to believe. I've seen how superficial girls around my age are, I'm not inclined to believe that their tastes will just change when they go to college. I guess I wanna know if I should pursue anything beyond friendship with a female friend during college, or if I'd just be wasting my time.  You can call me a pessimist or whatever, but from my experience so far I know to expect to probably be single for the majority of my life.  My personality won't help either, I'm weird,  shy, introverted, nerdy, and far too sensitive and caring. Basically, I don't have very many attractive masculine traits, so that won't help me. Sorry, getting off topic, but yeah, does height matter? If so, how much?",03May2018,4
39,"We’ve been best friends for 8 years and she has been really amazing, the best friend I’ve ever had, however we’ve never had a lot in common. She is religious, I’m not, we have opposite taste in tv shows,movies, clothing, you name it, but we’ve always had fun together and laughed a lot. However, lately I feel like these differences are starting to put a strain on our friendship. 

I’ve recently moved to Canada with my husband, I’ve been here going on a year but we’ve kept in touch nearly every day. Within the past few months I’ve noticed a change in her. She’s been rude to me a few times out of nowhere, and I know she’s been going through some things (wanting kids but still being single at 33, a weird living situation with her mother and recovering addict brother, really serious breathing problems to name a few) so I didn’t say anything about it and mostly let it go considering these things,  but it did really hurt my feelings. 

Her brother was in rehab with this guy who couldn’t be anymore obvious a douchebag. He’s a total narcissist, constantly posts selfies with captions like “If god made anything better looking, he must’ve kept it for himself” and other ridiculous things. He is always going on about Jesus and god, how he was saved, but when I went to an event, he was hitting on me pretty bad, and I told her I didn’t like him and that he’s not as Christian as he likes to think if he’s hitting on a married woman. When he got out of rehab he started messaging her and hitting on her, as he does with tons of other women, thinks he’s really special, then started asking her for money all the time. She told me she didn’t send him any but realized he was going through some things and wanted to be there for him. This was about 7 months ago. He’s back in rehab now and she said he kissed her about a month ago out of the blue, in front of a girl he asked to come see him at a church service they were having at the rehab. After that she kept talking about having dreams about him, and just being weird about it, I think feeling me out to see what’d I’d say, which I told her to be careful. I’m just so shocked that she’d fall for such a transparent tool, she’s really smart otherwise. 

She’s always complaining about stuff like her living situation, her mom is a slob, her brother and his girlfriend are always hogging her bathroom, she can never get privacy, her brother was supposed to move out but can’t find a place due to bad credit, so I suggest she move out on her own and she says she can’t afford it, which she absolutely can. She just got a new job that pays pretty well, but she doesn’t want to. I tell her to talk to her mom about things, she says she doesn’t like confrontation and doesn’t want to hurt her mom’s feelings. She always complains, and I don’t know what else to say to her anymore. 

Now to the thing that’s really got me upset and questioning if it’s worth trying anymore. She’s been having breathing issues as I mentioned before, she keeps getting sick and going to the hospital for breathing treatments. She complains about being broke, but is going and spending a $150 deductible each visit because her inhaler isn’t working. The real kicker is she smokes. I’d suggested she quit smoking a few months ago and she ignored me and said sh was fine. I’ve gotten so sick of hearing her complain about it when it’s self inflicted that I finally told her after she said she wanted to go to the hospital but didn’t want to fork out $150, that “the best way to breathe better and save money is to quit smoking. Just an idea. I’m guessing you still haven’t tried the Chantix your doctor prescribed?” She got very snarky with me, saying thanks, but she’s aware and doesn’t need a lecture and doesn’t want to gain 300 lbs”. All I said was “okay” because I knew it was pointless to carry on when she was getting angry like she’s been doing about everything lately. I haven’t heard from her since. It’s been a week now and not a word. This is the longest we’ve gone without talking for our entire friendship. What really annoys me is that I would never talk to her the way she has talked to me on several occasions over the last few months, but I tell her she should quit smoking when she’s constantly having breathing problems and I’m shunned? She’s too old to be acting like that and I’m tired of feeling like I’m always walking on egg shells with her, I never know what’s going to piss her off these days. I know she’s going through whatever, but I don’t think it’s fair to take it out on me. 

I’m visiting my hometown in 2 weeks and her and I had plans to have dinner while I was there, but I honestly have no desire to see her now. I don’t want to deal with all the negativity. I’ve been waiting for her to text me, I’ve got a whole speech planned out for when she does, but what if she doesn’t? Should I just let it go? I feel like she’s going to be bitchy no matter what I say. I also suspect she may be pulling away because she wants to pursue this guy and knows I’m not a fan. I told her if she likes him then go for it, but to be careful and not get her hopes up, so I feel like she wants to pursue him without worrying about my judgment, and the fact that she would fall for a guy that’s obviously using her has me questioning hers. Maybe it’s time we go our separate ways until she sorts her stuff out. 

Tl;dr: my best friend has been unusually moody with me, complains about things that she refuses to change, won’t take my advice, is dating a recovering addict that always asks her for money and is dating another girl, also a huge flirt. She stopped talking to me because I told her she should quit smoking since she keeps going to the doctor for asthma problems and I’m really burnt out on her lately.

41,"I'm a 3rd year university student. A requirement for our program is too complete an paid internship this summer. They held a job fair back in March and I thought it went well but I didn't hear back from any of the companies I interviewed with. I interviewed with 7 companies and I reached out to all of them, to keep communications between us going but I never heard anything. And I didn't let it get to me that much, and applied to other outside of it. I had 6 more interviews but unfortunately I got rejected. And this internship has to  be 3 months long, and I don't have much time to find one before June.

I've just been feeling really defeated because I've talked to my counselor and guides at my school and they don't understand why I'm struggling so hard. I thought maybe it was my resume but I got outside opinions and they say it's fine. I even talked to my professors and they are confused too. I made sure my linkedin is updated and professional, but nothing. I don't really know what is wrong with me, because I've had jobs in the past but finding one specific to my program has been hard.

All the rejection is just making me feel really defeated and I'm just worried because you can't graduate without completing one, and I'm worried I won't graduate. I have good grades and I'm on track to graduate, but it's only this preventing me from graduating next year. It also doesn't help all my friends found one, but I haven't. I'm already contemplating dropping out because of this, but I'm already so close to graduation. Also another thing that is a problem, that most of companies related to my field are really far for me. I live in a more small rural community and a lot of these places are in more populated areas, where a lot more of my classmates live and so I can't really apply to them. I tried before but it is too difficult to get too and also employers don't want someone who is 2 hours away by car or public transit.

I don't really know what to do, and I'm just finding myself to become really depressed because of this. I'm really feeling like giving up and quitting school because of how down I've felt.

48,"The scoop is essentially this. I'm graduating with a joint undergraduate program in Business (Accounting) and Sociology. Technically it's two separate bachelors degrees – BBA and BA. Accounting is what I started in exclusively, and I consider it to be my 'main' program, but I love sociology too. 

Graduation at my college is in mid June. The sociology grad ceremony is on Wednesday. The business grad is on friday. You can choose to go to one or the other, **or** go to both. My initial plan was to just go to the friday grad, because I know way more people in the business faculty. However, I unfortunately found out that my parents are leaving for an overseas trip on Thursday!! Obviously I was angry about it, but it would cost *way* too much to push back the trip.

For some reference, I don't have any real true friends going to the business grad either. My closest 5 or so friends all graduated before or after. I'm graduating a year late due to the combined program However, I do probably have 50 or so acquaintances or people that I consider to be 'friends' – just not ones I'd grab beers with. Obviously I'd like to see them, but I feel like I should be framing this decision around the people that matter – like my parents and grandparents. 

Also, I go to a commuter school and most people are staying here. 

So my dilemma is this: should I *just* go to the Wednesday sociology grad, even though I don't really feel like that's where I belong? Or do I go to both, so I can walk the stage twice? I'd definitely choose the latter, but I have a new job and I'd have to get days approved. Not only that, but I feel like it would be very anti-climatic to go through the whole rigmarole twice.

On top of the cheating he bragged about hanging out with his brother in law (good friend's sister's husband) and they pick up women at the same time...so now I know that by divulging this information 2 families and multiple children will be affected.

I need help, i had a girlfriend for 7 years, shes 23 like me. Everything was right and nice when suddenly she came with an idea to leave the country to do some voluntary work, i supported her but of course it was easily seen that i didnt like the idea of staying without her for 1 year, she started talking about me getting someone better and never said that we would continue together. After she said that to me she rarely wanted to be with me, she would always make an excuse and make something up to not be with me. One day we were together (probably only cause we went to see a show that i bought the tickets for it) but before getting there she crashed the car, she is well but the car wasnt. I went to the hospital all afternoon with her, after that, at night she said she was tired and i understood and wasnt with her, for 4 more days she would always make excuses to not be with me or it was late and she was tired(wasnt even late) or other excuse. I was tired of that and said im going to ur place so we can have our last conversation i need to know what happened i deserve it. She said if i went to her house she would call the police, we were always good together i never did nothing wrong i rarely hurt her i really like her i was shocked when she said that so i didnt go to her house. She later said that she didnt mean to say that she only didnt want me to go there. I said when u want to talk and explain me what happened once and for all u call me or sms me, meanwhile its over. Days later without knowing anything from her i knew from her mother that she said to her that we werent together days way sooner than when i broke with her. Can u help me? For me it lookes like she cheated on me or she likes other person and doesnt have the guts to tell me. Thank you

56,"Hello everyone, I'd appreciate the help you can give since everyone I know basically thinks I don't want to drive because I'm lazy.

Long story short, I'm almost 19, so I'm overdue for my driver's license. I got my learner's permit online, that's about it. My fear is that if I drive, someone will die. It will be me or a stranger, somehow. I live in Florida, which is full of lost tourists, old drivers and, (in my area) drivers who ""know a guy at the dealership"" that sold them a car without needing a valid U.S. driver's license.

My thing is, I feel like I'll be too oblivious yet be too careful. I have OCD, so I can't even do a test drive around a parking lot without whipping my head around every few seconds because I think a car will magically spawn and crash into me. Yet, I'm also the type of person who will look directly at you and won't acknowledge you exist because I actually didn't see you at all.

**TL;DR** I don't trust myself or other drivers around me so I'm scared that I will kill a person if I drive",03May2018,2

60,"I've been struggling with the fact that on and off it feels like no one really wants to talk to me. I'm very outgoing, upbeat, and sincerely want to get to know people and make new friends, but one case in particular has been eating me up on the inside. 

I recently had an outing with some family at a popular bar down the street from our house. I'm a single 22 year old guy with no strings attached and there was this really cute girl there that my mom thought I might get along with. 

She's seeing someone. No big deal. I approach as a potential friend because I just moved to the area and all my so-called friends in California decided they were going to cut all contact with me. 

I give her my phone number. Pretty sure she threw it away. No other advances made on my part. 

Fast forward to literally yesterday. I work at Walmart and we have a line of TVs on clearance that need to be taken off the shelf so people can buy them at a reduced cost. A moment into helping my fellow associate take it off the wall, I turn around, and guess who is there. 

Fucking, this girl.

Now, at this point I'm literally freaking out. When her and I first talked, we didn't really have any chemistry with one another. She wasn't very talkative but wore a large smile on her face, and was being very conservative and polite in her body language. This time, it's the same thing, but it's been three weeks since we last spoke to one another. 

So she asks to see something in the department. I go to show her, I give her the info she needs and expect her to turn and walk. Well, instead, she handed me her phone with an empty contact screen on it.

I'm confused now, because it feels like she might be texting me out of guilt. I usually only get one word answers from her, and I'm just sincerely trying to be friendly while no effort is being made on her part.

Any idea on what might be happening with this? ",03May2018,1

I want to be able to have the money with a partner to go away on holidays and we able to afford the luxury’s of life but how are we suppose to achieve that when she gets paid bare minimum. 

It bothers me but it’s not a deal breaker, she’s young and living her life so I’m not trying to hold this against her but I’m worried it’s going to start pissing me off more as the relationship goes on.
Please don’t get me wrong, you don’t have to have a job to be valued as a human being and well she does have a job but I know it bothers my family also that she’s got no life prospects and that upsets me.

I am not great at flirting, unless I am very comfortable around someone, and have had no luck with dating apps such as tinder etc. Also in that time i have had no one show much interest in me either.

- I am 25 F, single, no close family, a few close friends who are getting married/traveling/I don't really see anymore
- I currently live in Grand Rapids, Michigan. I've lived here my entire life, and I don't HATE it but I feel stagnant here and I want to see what the world has to offer!
- I just graduated from Dental Hygiene school and will have my license at the end of June (I will have to apply for my license again in the state that I want to move to). My student loan payments won't kick in for another six months.
-Currently I live rent-free with a friend(they are helping me out the past few months temporarily since my previous lease ended and I couldn't find a new place) but I don't want to take advantage of this situation for too long
-I currently work as a server at a decent restaurant making $300-400 a weekend and have saved up ~4000 so far and hoping to continue saving!
-Im really interested in hiking/seeing nature with my dog, art, and I like big cities. 
-The only traveling I have ever done was a quick 4day road trip to Philadelphia to see my sister, and we spent one day in NY. Other than that, I have zero travel experience! I liked the feel of large cities, but I am also really interested in mountains and seeing national parks! 
-WHERE THE HELL DO I START??? Is it a bad idea to start out a new career in a brand new state?

77,"I'm a guy (20), and I've lacked self confidence for most of my life. Without going into great detail, one of my parents constantly made me feel guilty about my appearance (mostly concerning my weight). This parent would continually tell me that the girls I liked in school would never go out with me and that I was good for nothing. I believe that long-term exposure to this type of ""parenting"" has conditioned me to put myself down. I always feel like I'm not worthy of other people's attention, and I feel super insecure when around people of the opposite sex. I feel as though they see me in the same negative light that I see myself. While I have a good group of friends from high school that I still talk to regularly, I struggle to form relationships with new people. At my previous college (that I spent 1.5 years at), I didn't have a single friend. I've always never been in a relationship with a girl, and I haven't talk to one regularly since elementary school.  

Basically, I want to gain self confidence and begin taking steps in my life towards achieving happiness. I want to stop putting myself down and start holding my head high. I'm 6'0"" and 230 lb. Ideally, I'd like to lose 30-50 lb and become healthier, however I feel as though that isn't solving to root problem. If I ever gained weight again afterwards, I'd probably be back at square one.

I'm writing this feeling restless because my savings are getting lower and lower and I'm feeling incredibly desperate. Usually, I would ask my dad for advice but he passed away a while back and unfortunately, I don't really have any other person to turn to for this kind of stuff.

I got laid off about a year and a half ago (I was working in the media industry) because of tax issues with my last boss. To pay the bills, I've been freelancing with video/photo work and tapping into my savings (some life insurance money I received). In this time, I've also been learning to code (using Udemy and other only tutorials). I code from 2-12 hours per day to get better.

Unfortunately, the main guy that I've been working for with photo assistance has been months late on payments and owes me around $1500 dollars. I'm down to just enough to get me through the end of next month (with rent $500, student loan payments, and around $50 for groceries/week). But I'm getting real stressed here.

I've applied to around 200 jobs (mostly video/photo, junior dev, and other various jobs) and have had 3 interviews, but nothing beyond that. I really would like to get a job as a junior developer, but my degree is in digital media and so I don't think very many people are taking me seriously. 

I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I think I have a lot to offer for a company and am very self motivated. I'm willing to really take any job to pay the bills, but would like to end up as a professional developer down the line.

82,"Okay, so, this might not be the most eloquent or put together but I just found this all out today and I'm pretty frazzled about it. I'm writing this because my boyfriend thought it would be a good idea to get some advice on the situation.  

Backstory: My parents got separated a little over a year ago and for the last couple months my mom has been emailing this guy back and forth and they're in like a semi-serious relationship. A month or two ago, she found out he had lied about who he was/his name/where he lived/literally everything about him and I thought they broke it off, but they recently started chatting again. Now, when my mom first began this relationship, I told her that under no circumstances should she ever send money to people that she hadn't met, and even if they had met, it's not a good idea. You can probably see where this is going. Turns out, this dude lives in Nigeria (HUGE RED FLAG, RIGHT?) and she's been sending him money regularly over the last month and a half. Like, to the tune of over 1000$. And that's just what I'm aware of. It could be more. 

I confronted her about this and told her that she shouldn't be sending him money, that she had no proof that he is who he says he is, considering the name he uses on Western Union isn't his 'real name' (that's probably a fake name too). She told me that she sends him money for food, despite having no proof of this, made me promise not to tell anyone else, like my brother or my grandma, the latter of which is VERY critical of her relationship with him for obvious reasons, and that it was her money and she could do what she wanted with it. Also something about knowing what she was doing/not going overboard/whatever. It's kind of all a blur, and I think I'm in shock that for someone who mocked other people for being stupid enough to fall for phone scams, she's fallen for this one. Like, my mom isn't stupid. She's well educated, she works for insurance companies, and is on a computer for her entire workday. 

Like, TL;DR, What can I do about this? Can I report his email or something to Western Union to notify them of the scam and hopefully make it impossible for her to send money to him? My mom doesn't password protect her laptop or log out of her email so it would be fairly easy (I think) for me to find the relevant Western Union information or his account details. I'm at a loss.

So turns out they offer me the job, and what makes me want to accept is that it has full benefits, 401k and room to grow. They also seem like a great employee friendly company, everyone I’ve talked to absolutely loves it. 

I really do like my job currently, but I don’t receive any benefits (working in construction) and there isn’t much room to grow in the company. But my schedule is really flexible, I can take off basically when I want, and the pay is good.

While we have some really amazing times together, there have been so many times that I have questioned the state of this relationship.

Even with that, I try to make a point to let him know he is my best friend and care about him. I recently opened up to him about something personal and his response was ""lol."" I was obviously very upset at the time because it wasn't funny, but his response was that I'm not very nice and that I needed to chill. I expressed that I didn't really like that response and he said to go get a therapist because he's not a free mental health clinic. I wasn't suicidal or anything like that, just genuinely in a bad place a needed a friend. From there this started a back and forth. I pointed out that he came to me in his time of need all the time and never gave him any shit about it.

86,"Hi Reddit! This is going to be a long one, so I apologize. To give context to my story and situation, I am currently a 20 year old girl in college who hasn't been in a relationship before, and this issue is mostly centered towards guys. I would also like to add a trigger warning for sexual assault, there's no graphic detail but please be careful if this makes you uncomfortable.

When I was 14, I was molested by a guy (16) on a plane. My mom and I were headed to a different country to visit family, and this happened about 4 hours into the flight when everyone was asleep and the plane was dark. We weren't even supposed to sit next to each other, but the lady next to me ended up switching seats with him in order to sit with her friend. I was really excited to have someone my age sit next to me, so I struck up conversation with him as we took off. My mom was in the window seat, I in the middle, and him in the aisle. Throughout the flight, we kept talking and ended up watching a movie that bored me enough to make me say that I was tired and wanted to sleep. He decided to sleep too, and when we got settled it happened. 
Needless to say, it messed me up a lot. I confronted him and he was dealt with, but I ended up with serious anxiety and intimacy issues after. That Summer, I would shy away from male members of the family because I felt disgusting every time they would touch me. I would have a fear of hugging my favorite uncle or my dad because I was worried their hands would drift to where I didn't want them to go. I've kind of always shied away from relationships ever since then, because I have a fear that if I were to hang out with a guy friend or someone I would be interested in, I would worry they would have expectations that I wouldn't be able to meet, or that they would try something and I would be too afraid to stop them.

Today, I'm doing a lot better than how I was before. However, I still struggle with relationships because I'm so skittish about them. These past few months I've been seeing a counselor to try and work on these problems because I know I have them, and I genuinely want them to get resolved. At this point I know I am ready for a relationship (or I would at least like to be), but I notice that whenever I get even remotely close to a guy in which something like that could form, I push them away and deflect suggestions to hang out. I know this is very unfair of me to assume every guy I meet is like the one on the plane, or that the guys I do have in my life expect more from me than what I'm willing to give. I know that I've definitely held myself back from any crushes I've had progressing, but it's so hard for me to even think about hanging out with a guy alone without being a little fearful of what could happen. And honestly, I'm getting tired of it.

I'm not expecting this problem to be resolved immediately, but I would really like some advice or insight as to how I can stop being so afraid of a relationship progressing. I would really like to give the people around me a chance, but how can I do so without being so damn afraid of that prospect?",03May2018,3
87,"I (24 M) have a crush. I know dangerous, especially 9 months after a big breakup. 

Anyways, this girl (23 F) started working at my job about 2 months ago. Her first week I barely noticed her until she got stuck on our CherryPicker forklift. I was one of the few people who knew how to get it working and got her down. Normally I wouldn’t think anything of it but she was really scared and ended up hugging me, which of course looking back was a spark.

As the weeks went by I noticed for lack of better words, her flirting, it was subtle due to our workplace environment. One night another co-worker starts up the talk of a group going to a bar after work, both of us end up going and all was well until she mentioned that she was moving soon.

The next day several coworkers confront me (and I believe she got confronted as well) thinking we were a couple. Apparently our mannerisms towards each other were “natural, and seemed to fit” and that we were both very flirty. This of course gave me more confidence in what I personally was seeing. So I asked her to a movie, she politely declined saying she was going to the same movie with another friend, and she didn’t want to spoil it for them. 

I accepted this and went about my day until later she messaged me and heavily implied that she was downtown and was wanting some company for drinks. Thinking it wouldn’t hurt I ended up downtown and we just chatted and drank for nearly 4 hours. 
During this time she told me a lot about herself, I learned that she would be moving to somewhere where I was planning to move within a few years. Unfortunately we both worked in the morning and ended up going our separate ways. 

Now I realized I had fallen hard for this girl, and I tried my best to play it cool. While at work I’d stop by her workstation every couple of hours to say hello (our teams work closely so this wasn’t out of the ordinary). She would wait for me to walk her to her car when we were off at the same time. Things were looking better and better, with the looming fact that she was moving. 

Now we are at the week where she is moving and I can tell she’s trying to pull away. I continue to try and tell her I will be her friend and a support as she’s moving away, in hopes that we will continue being friends. 

I’m well aware of how Long Distance is difficult as my prior relationship has had it, and I don’t want to make this move hard on her any more then it already is. I would appreciate some advice to help me not seem clingy or creepy.",03May2018,1

I do not want to quit. But I am literally barely sleeping and have no time for myself or anyone else. I haven’t had a day off since March. 

I feel like if I quit anything, I am a failure. If I quit, I will somehow be put in an emergency financial situation that will make me homeless again or something. I need mental health help I think, I am not really even sure how to find someone to help, but first I need to quit something or fix this situation somehow so I just have the basic time to do something. 

Is this normal? Do other people do this? Is there a name or special help for what I am doing? 

I just don’t even know how to stop this cycle. I am pretty happy through all of this but I am just so overwhelmed. I want to take a breather but I feel like my own self is telling me taking a break is failure, my friends won’t like me, I will hurt someone’s feelings or something bad will happen financially to me.

90,"I'll do my best to keep this concise. 

I work at a public library as a ""part\-time reference aide"". I have worked here for 8 months and I have earned respect from everyone in the staff, top to bottom. I am highly customer\-service oriented, technology adept and have very high productivity, relative to my colleagues. I am also in library school working on my masters degree in Library Information Science and I am due to graduate one year from now. 

The advice I am seeking relates to there having been a job posting a couple of days ago. It's for the reference department as a ""part time reference librarian."" The pay is nearly twice what I'm earning now, yet the job requirements are \*exactly\* the same as they were for my current position \(I double\-checked\). 

Essentially the problem am having comes down to the fact that I neither have my masters degree  nor do I have the ""New York State Public Librarian Certification"" \(...which requires a masters degree to obtain\). I just don't know how to go about this, since from a managerial perspective, I am highly\-productive CHEAP labor who is available for 30\+ hours a week \(this better job is 20 hrs/week max\) and I'm not yet qualified..... From my perspective, looking at this from a job performance viewpoint, I have earned this position unequivocally and I am nearly positive my colleagues would attest to that.

I know that my first order of business is to ask the assistant director \(in charge of hiring\) if I would even stand a chance of getting this job or if my lack of qualifications makes me a no\-go.... but I know these people and this system, and I anticipate being told not to interview. 

Therefore long story short, I would love to hear suggestions/advice on how to make my position understood \-\- that I get paid 30&amp;#37; of what a senior colleague is getting paid to sip her tea and stare at facebook half of the day, yet I produce far, far more than her. SO if I can't interview for this job, can I at least be given a raise in recognition that I am adding value that far exceeds that which is added by more senior employees? This is a public entity funded almost entirely by local taxpayers. Senior members should still be held accountable for their productivity or lack thereof. 

Sorry this wound up being really long. I very much appreciate anybody that has taken the time to read this and offer advice.

91,"  So, I've always been shy and have kept my distance from people but when people do talk to me I try to be the nicest I can. At my school, I have a reputation for being nice and quiet but I don't know if I should continue that. So many people end up being horrible and hurt my feelings(sounds stupid and makes me sound sensitive which I am:/ ).
 I recently have distanced myself from a friend who has broken my heart and I have been very rude and I think it's helping me hurting someone else to let others know how it feels to feel like shit. I know it's wrong but everyone else is so mean so I don't see why I can't be that way either.",03May2018,2
92,"Hi Reddit, currently I have the opportunity to apply for two separate jobs that are hiring within the same company that I work for. I'm fairly confident I can have my pick at either job and would like some advice on the jobs at hand.

My background: Currently I am a Maintenance Technician Level 3 at a warehouse that isn't all that busy and requires little actual work. I have a little bit less then one year of experience in my field, not including college experience. I have a degree in Robotics Technologies as well as a degree in Management.

Both jobs being offered are at the warehouse next door which is consistently busier and a lot more work. I feel like I personally need the busier warehouse to pad my resume and gain some real work experience.

Both jobs are the same pay scale, the same benefits, and the same schedule.

Job 1: Maintenance Technician Level 3 It is the same job title I currently hold except at a busier location. With taking this job I would be able to keep the current manager I have and enjoy working for. My manager has previously mentioned he wants me working for him at this warehouse and has mentioned to me that he wants to send me to manager training. With this job I would gain Conveyor experience, preventative maintenance experience, and possibly get to move up into management quicker.

Job 2: Robotics Technician Level 3 With this job I'd be able to put my robotics degree to use with a company that is one of the leaders in the robotics industry. With this job I'd be able to gain coding experience, robotics experience, and over time, career advancement.",03May2018,1

94,"So I grew up in a very religious household and for the first 22 years of my life, I enjoyed the community that was associated with it. All of my best friends that I have today are actually people I met through church as a kid. 


Growing up and doing more independent study, I began to question the existence of a creator and would now consider myself agnostic. I'm not a very curious person by nature so I've never been interested enough to study and find out where the earth came from. I don't care if it was a big bang or if it was god. I know that sounds ludicrous to a lot of people. How can someone not be interested in knowing the creation of all things haha. I don't know why I'm not interested either, so don't ask me ;P


Anyway, to get to my question. As someone who doesn't have any desire at all to build a relationship with god, but also as a person who misses the people that are associated with a  church, how can i get into a  community of loving people that a church generally has with my current beliefs as what they are.",03May2018,1
95,"I’m not sure if this is considered relationship advice so I just decided to put it on this sub instead.

So it’s been almost a month since my girlfriend broke off the relationship with me. She told me that there were things that worried her about our relationship in the long run and if it’d make her unhappy. She said that she didn’t want to risk dragging it out and wasting her time if there was a chance it wouldn’t change and that there’s no point if we’re just going to break up in the future. Ever since then, it’s almost like I’ve been forgotten completely. We’re strangers again. She’s continuing her happy life as if nothing had ever happened between us at all. She’s even started talking to her ex who she’s been off and on with for 3 years who also cheated on her multiple times and she said she hated him. It’s was my first true love and it’s like we never even shared anything. I don’t matter to her anymore. When I see her or walk past her there’s no reaction, no acknowledgement of my existence. I’m really trying my best to get over her. She has me blocked on all social media and I deleted her number, pictures, everything. I’ve tried self improvement. Talking to new people, starting the gym, etc. I still just can’t get over her. It’s like she stole a piece of me and has moved on in 2 seconds. What do I do now? The world keeps turning and it’s like everything I’m feeling is insignificant even though I can’t shake it despite how much I try.

98,"In less than a year, I will be needing to make the decision in whether to move to Mexico and continue my higher education, or stay in the states, and continue on my original plan of going to uni here, and beginning my life with this man.  
Now that's the tl;dr before the huge spiel...   
I would be moving to Mexico to give my grandfather company. I would live with him, and go to a university about 20 minutes away. I know the city well enough, and have looked into the school and its accreditations in America.   
However this decision stems from my grandmother's recent death. None of his children visit him, ( other than my mother ) and only about three of his relatives live near enough to visit him. He has unfortunately been alone since my grandmother passed away, and we can only visit him every other weekend.   
It's hard; my grandparents basically raised my brother and I, she was a young, single mom, a newly migrant, working full time. To say we were close is an understatement.   
So a big decision would be to move to Mexico and continue my studies there. I'd be able to find a job as I am trilingual, and the program would be 100% in English.   
However leaving my SO, and essentially everyone I know behind is a big decision. My SO has been extremely supportive. He told me he'll be there for me whether I move or not, that we can make it work. He even detailed plans for meeting halfway, or him coming once a month and vice versa... 
But I am extremely unsure of leaving him. He doesn't want to move, and I don't blame him. He speaks little to no Spanish, has no family here. His only tie would be me and my grandfather, and I find that unfair.   
I would be leaving behind my sibling, my friends, and the life my SO and I have planned ever since we started high school( a loooong time ago, I feel old ). We've looked into apartments, furniture, pets, homes, land, changed our higher education plans to match eachothers.....   
I feel like if I were to leave to Mexico, I would be sabotaging everything we've planned, but he seems supportive and happy either way, which I should be thankful for but I can't get past my own feelings. 
Anyone care to tell me why I feel so crappy about this? Or what would be the most logical decision? ",03May2018,1
99,"So one of my best friends I’ve known since middle school has hit a really rough patch and is fucking over pretty much everyone who cares about him and he doesn’t seem to care at all. 

Both him and I have been really great friends for a long time, and he was always a super nice guy and we hung out almost everyday. Anyways, after graduating high school I went to a local commuter college to help save money and he decided to go to a much nicer “party school” about an hour away. The tuition there is $20,000 a semester and his parents are paying for it. He’s always done well in school and his parents are pretty rich so I didn’t really think much of it. 

Anyways, at the end of his first year he comes back from school and we are hanging out again very frequently. He tells me that school went great and everything is awesome. I found out about a month later that he had failed every single one of his classes because he just stopped going. He didn’t tell me or his parents until he had to explain why he couldn’t enroll for next semester. For the entire year he had been telling his parents that he was doing great, and everything was fine. He lied to not only his parents, but also me. I felt betrayed in a weird way. I figured that if there was anyone he could tell it would’ve been me, but he didn’t.

He took a bunch of online classes and was eventually allowed to reenroll. Everyone figured that after what had already happen he would finally get his shit straight. It seemed like he was doing really well, I’d drive up about once a month to hangout with him and he would tell me how well he’s doing etc etc. I was glad he was on the right track. 

About a month ago I received a frantic call from his mother. She was telling me that they had a trip planned to Florida for spring break and my friend was supposed to be home by now but they couldn’t get in contact with him and they didn’t know where he was. His mother was in tears. I told her I would find out what was going on. This was at about 2 o clock in the morning, I had a paper due the next morning but I decided that my friend was more important. Honestly I thought he may had committed suicide because he had always seemed to have some sort of lingering depression. I call my other friend and tell him what’s going on and the two of us drive an hour and a half at 3 in the morning to go and make sure he’s alright.

We got there and we knocked on his door for about 2 hours. The lights were on, I could hear sound from inside, but he wasn’t answering. We got freaked out so we called the police, who told us they couldn’t do anything unless we knew that he was going to kill him self. I said fuck it and grabbed my wallet lockpick kit and raked the lock open, we busted inside to find him sitting on his bed watching TV. 

We told him we were worried sick and asked why he didn’t answer the door. He told us “he didn’t feel like talking.” Eventually we got it out of him that once again he had failed everyone of his classes because he never went. They kicked him out of school again. Another 20k he wasted of his parents money. 

He had been lying to everyone who cares about him for another year. The worst part about all of this is that he didn’t even say sorry to his parents or us. His two friends care so much about him that they were willing to drive almost two hours in the middle of the night to make sure he was okay, but he didn’t even care. He didn’t appreciate it at all. After we left I was happy that he wasn’t dead, but at the same time I was fucking pissed off. We drove two hours in the middle of the night to make sure he was okay, and we sat at his doorstep for another two hours knocking, and he didn’t answer because he “didn’t feel like it.” I was angry. 

It’s been about a month since, and he still hasn’t apologized to his parents or any of his friends. It seems like he has no remorse, it seems like he has lost all empathy he once had. Does anyone have any advice on how I can help him see the error of his ways?",03May2018,1
100,"A little back story, my bf and I (f26, m31) dated back in our home state. We broke up, he moved and ended up dating her for a short time. They broke up. She was at one point on his cell phone account but never had access to make changes. Long story short, we end up getting back together and I moved to be with him. We’ve been together ever since and have bought a home together. 

So today I went to *xyz cellphone provider* because of mine and my bf’s job, we get a contracted discount. That discount was recently (at the beginning of January raised 3%) I’d called customer service and was told all I had to do to get is adjusted was to get to a physical store with a copy of a pay stub and it would be fixed. Ok, cool. 

Went there today to find out that somehow, his ex was listed as an authorized user on the account and I no longer was. I cancelled my account almost 2 years ago and merged it with my boyfriends, we made sure we had any trace of her removed from our account. She was NEVER an authorized user to begin with. So I’m there trying to get this adjusted when I’m told I need a paper copy of his pay statement (ok fine) because the account is in his name, so even though I work for the same company, they can’t do anything with my pay stub. Not a problem, I can print one if you give me access to a printer. But then I’m asked if my name is really x and I go by z. Um, no. Z is his ex, who should have zero access to our account. Someway, somehow she was given access to our account BY THEM. I was told he could change it through their app but I couldn’t get ahold of him since he was at work. I am not faulting the store associate for anything here, she’s just doing her job. She claimed they “changed systems and maybe it’s a glitch” well, that’s a hell of a glitch to allow someone access to an account that never had it in the first place. 

We depend on me having access to our accounts because I handle all the bills (which I have no issues with, I prefer it that way) I managed to go on the app, deleted her and re add me. No verification from my bf required. Seems like a security risk to me. 

I called customer service and I’m not going to lie, demanded an explanation as to how this situation was even remotely possible. They’re only answer was that one of two things happened, 1) he gave her access or 2) she somehow got access to our account and made the changes. We don’t believe it was her, they haven’t talked in years and while she had what I’d call her crazy moments, she has since married and had a child. 

Anyways, my question is, do you guys think there’s anything else we can do with our cell company? We will be changing our login info and the passcode to the account just in case it IS her. But we’re quite upset over the incident here with no real explanation as to how or why. 

Tl;dr bf’s ex gf somehow got listed as an authorized user to our cellphone account while I was somehow removed.

102,"My best friend and I are both 17 years old and juniors in high school. We also both work at a resale/thrift store for teens (you may know the place, but I don’t want to say the name) in my town. Today, my friend worked, but I did not. After she got off work, she facetimed me and told me about a weird thing that had happened to her during her shift:

She was organizing a rack of clothes, which were located in the back corner of the store, when a slavic sounding woman approached her and said hello. My friend was startled because she hadn’t known that someone was behind her. The woman apologized for frightening her, then asked her if the polo shirt in her hand was an “original polo.” Neither of us have any idea what that means, but the lady went on to say that she was shopping for her husband, she works at the Kohl’s across the street, blah blah blah. She then asked my friend if she came there often. My friend told her that she works there. The woman asked her if she had any free time, or needed any extra money. The woman started talking about this “business” that she owns with “another couple.” She went on and on about this, but never specified what that business was, or what the job entails. My friend told her that she’s in high school, as well as an athlete, so she doesn’t have much free time. The lady seemed interested by this. “high school?” she repeated, “how old are you?” My friend told her that she was 17. The lady seemed interested by that too. As she talked about the business, she kept mentioning/repeating the fact that my friend was 17. She asked my friend to exchange numbers, to talk about the job. My friend told her to just give her her number and that she would call her if she was interested. The lady finally agreed and wrote down her number and first name on a little piece of paper. She told my friend to call her, text her, whatever she wanted to do- just get in touch. Then, the lady rushed out of there without buying anything at all. Not a thing for her husband, who she claimed to have been shopping for.

However, this friend was almost a complete stranger because we didn't know him nor has my brother ever talked about him. One thing he did ask is if it would be weird for this friend to visit, to which I replied why would it be weird.  

Anyway, the friend came to visit, turns out this friend is gay, to which I have no issues with. However, my parents are very conservative people and they are kinda worried about my brother hanging out with this friend. My parents asked my brother if he was gay and he denied it.  

Fast forward a few months, my brothers and I are in a group chat, and a 'deleted message' appeared on the screen. While the message was deleted, it did save a picture that came with it, and to my surprise, it was a half naked dude in a 'pose'. I did not mention  anything about the picture.

When I applied myself in high school for the first two years I had a 4.5GPA.

110,"Hey, first post ever! Okay. So I work at a daycare in a school age program (6-12 years old). I'm 21, and the other two women I work with in this room are in their late forties (I'll call them Sherri and Iris). I started working there in September, the kids and I get along wonderfully, they love me, and I love trying to be a good influence for them. 
Right off the hop, iris seemed okay, your typical middle aged lady, really eccentric, really friendly.  Sherri is really sarcastic and seems to bring a lot of her personal shit to work with her. It was fine, I go in for when the kids are done school for the day, get them their snacks, hang out with the kids, take them outside, make sure nobody breaks their necks or kills each other and sign out the kids. I'm the last person in the daycare every night. 
It seemed to be going okay for the first while, however I didn't expect there would be so much cleaning and housework required at this daycare, which is difficult because by the time I bring all the kids in from outside, (there's a ""required"" time for me to bring them in) there's little time where I have to do all this cleaning and housekeeping, watch all the kids etc before I have to go down to this room where all the daycare programs meet at the end of the day. 
Basically, Sherri, who I work with more than Iris, is lazy af. Doesn't do a single thing to help me at all. Sits around and plays poker with like 6 kids, while I'm left to do all this cleaning and watch all the other 30 kids. It's stressful. If something small isn't completed by the end of the day, I get hell for it. 
Sherri also likes to make snide comments to me and plays it off as sarcasm, and she's extremely intimidating if you say you don't like it. For instance, she said I'm like ""the fun little sister she can pick on""
One day a couple weeks ago, my mom had to go to the ER, I had y show up to late a half hour late, I'm distracted as hell because I'm worried, and get left with a shit tonne of work for the end of the day, more than the usual, and basically get told by Sherri and Iris that they ""have no patience for people who come up with bad excuses for not doing their job"" after explaining the situation. By the end of the night, I was so stressed trying to get everything done, I ran into my coworker Ellie who's like my work mom from the kindergarten room. I started crying I was so stressed, and she's noticed the mistreatment that's occurred before. I guess this was the last straw, because she went to the directors of the daycare and told them I was getting bullied in the school age room. 
I get questioned about this by the directors, I explain everything. They basically tell me that they've noticed this too and they're going to fix it right away. A couple of days later, I'm called into the office with Iris. We had a long talk, she cried she felt so bad and we were all good. That's been great since. 
Shannon went off the deep end. Went on a witch hunt for who went to the office and ""tattled"" on her. She then cornered me in the break room, shut the door and lost it on me for getting her in trouble. Told me it was all lies, and that she's been in this field for 20 years and she's never had anybody make a mess or make everyone lives hell like I have. My director heard her yelling from down the hall, came in, defended me 100%, which made Sherri dive even more off the deep end. She told her she was intimidating, and that she's the one at fault, which made Sherri scream some explicit words and storm out. The director was really great to me, but yet this woman (Sherri) still has a job. 
That leads me to today. I calmly said to Sherri that we should talk this out in a civil way because it shouldn't be such an issue. I started out trying to tell her that I appreciate how hard she works (which is a total lie, but I felt like it would be wise to not jump into all my grievances with her to avoid her becoming defensive). But no, she lost it on me and started screaming. Again. I told her I wasn't having this conversation with her if she wouldn't be respectful and left the room for about five minutes. I came back and she has this girl Vaness with her. Vanessa is my age and her and Sherri are very similar and get along wonderfully. She told me we were having this conversation in front of Vanessa because she was mad the DIRECTOR OF THE ENTIRE DAYCARE was there last time and defended me, so she wants Vanessa there to defend her. Which was super unprofessional and inappropriate. Basically, I was in tears by the time the kids came in. 
I want to quit, but I love the kids, I love my two directors and the staff in the other rooms. But they're clearly not firing her and I was told today by Tracey she's going around telling lies about me to other rooms and to the directors.
I feel like I'm in some shitty high school movie, but I need this job to pay for school. I don't know what to do. 

TL;DR: crazy bitch at work will not acknowledge that she's a bully, and says it's all my fault. The directors in the office are supportive but won't fire her. Now she's spreading lies about me throughout the daycare. I don't know whether to quit and risk not having a proper job, despite loving everything else.

111,"So the backstory on this is that she and I broke up in October of 2016. We were good friends after that as the breakup was amicable, and we caught up whenever we could after. However, in November of 2017, I was into this girl from my college, and we started hanging out.

I decided to ask my ex for advice on how to be good on dates by asking what she liked and disliked about me when we were dating. She didn't respond (she's busy extremely often because of schoolwork), and I and the girl I was into decided we'd just stay friends. However, I still wanted advice from my ex on how to conduct myself on future dates. I can PM screenshots of the following conversation to anyone willing to deconstruct this mess with me, since we can't post links on here. The summary is that I asked her, she got extremely upset and said she needed space from me, and started to ignore my messages. The last one I sent was January of this year.",03May2018,1

my girlfriend is in college and she has some problems coping with all the pressure and learning contents. Unfortunately I can’t help her, because I don’t know anything about her topics.

113,"Recently, one of my best friends (I’ll call him Jamal) began dating a girl who me and couple of other friends (I’ll call them Bran and Ty for this post) had completely removed from our lives for her rude behaviour, backstabbing and the mentality of only caring about herself. She also is what one would call a “Drama Queen” and drama is one thing we do not let get into our friend group as it is a stupid waste of time. (Ironically this whole thing has stirred up a batch of drama.) There are many examples I could use to describe why I dislike her so much, the best example being the one that finally drove me over the edge to get her out of my life. My friend Ty and her used to be close family friends, they grew up together. Around this time, they were both going through breakups. She was the first to go through one, and that night she went to Ty’s house and he comforted her for as long as she needed. When Ty’s relationship finally fell through, what did she do? Defended the girl that cheated on him and made his life hell for months before the breakup. The few times I was around her before I blocked her from my life, were anything but enjoyable as she made everything about her and didn’t care about anyone else. And now, Jamal has decided to begin to date her, and expects us to hang out with her and accept her back into the friend group even though he knows her track record and he knows we all don’t want her in our lives. Me, bran and Ty blatantly refused to be around her, which was of course taken very badly by Jamal and another one of my friends. I made it very clear that if I saw that she had changed for the better, then I could consider giving her another (one of many) second chances. But for now I don’t want someone that toxic in my life. After the argument tonight, I was told I should be ashamed of myself and that I should grow up. I honestly have no idea what to do. I want to make it clear that I’m very happy Jamal has someone that he is really happy with. On one hand, I know I could bring her back into my life and be around her, even if I would not enjoy myself.  On the other hand, I want to stick to what I believe is right, and keep her out of my life. I feel like an asshole for doing this to Jamal, but I can’t consciously let her back into my life like nothing has happened in the past.  Am I wrong for sticking to my morals? 

TL; DR: I don’t entirely know how I can sum this all up better then I already did in the title.

115,"**TLDR**: My brother and I got into a fight that turned physical and no longer wants me in his life. How do I talk to him when he wants nothing to do with me?

A little backstory. My brother is 17 and I'm 24(m). Our parents divorced 9 years ago when he was young and my parents had joint custody of him and he ended up staying a week at my dads and my moms. My parents divorced shortly after our older sister passed away from a long battle with cancer. I stayed with my dad permanently until college. I was mad at my mom at the time for leaving after my sister died and I never visited her when my brother would go over there. I'm not going to go into details but my dad lied about things my mom did to make me hate her. When I went away to college my mom helped me get the money and loans i needed and we rekindled our relationship. I lived hours away from home and my sophomore year my father asked me to take out a loan for 6000$ and give it all to him. I refused and he basically disowned me. Cut off my phone, took my money fromy bank account, everything gone. My dad was always an asshole and used to knock us around a bit until i got older and fought back. Anyways I was stranded in a town away from home with no money. My mom helped me get back on track but I have not spoken to my father in 6 years. I had to work full time to continue going to school and between school and work I didn't travel back to my moms but maybe once or twice a year. This went on for 6 years until this last December when I moved back home near my mom to be apart of my brothers life whom I had seen only a handful of times in these 6 years. For the most part the last few months have been fine when I see him every other week and we got along fine for the most part.

The issue: tonight my brother and I got into fight about some dumb shit and it turned physical a bit. I was playing on my pc talking to my friends and my brother comes in calling me a bitch trying to be funny. I ask him to stop nicely but he retaliated with ""you always bother me when I play games with my friends"". Its true I do. When he plays online I go in there and poke his head or some shit. I tell him to stop anyways and he gets mad and starts arguing his point over and over again. He goes to his room after a while and i continue to play online. I get up and pee maybe 20 minutes later and he's talking to his gf on the phone so I call him a bitch real loudly to interrupt to retaliate. After that things escalated quickly. We got into an argument that was basically the exact same as the one from 20 mins ago. He says something so I unplug his ps4s HDMI and he threatens to hit me. I goad him to do it and we get into a scuffle. No bruises or anything but we basically wrestle. I realize I have made a mistake by harming my brother as I am on top of him. I tell him I will get up if he agrees to talk to me and he reluctantly agrees. I tried to tell him how sorry i am for harming him and that I don't want to be like our father and it won't happen again. He says he wants me out of his life or dead and I start crying. I tell him how sorry i am for not being there the past 6 years and that I've already lost one sibling and don't want to lose another. He remains quiet and looks at his phone while I tell him how this was my fault and I was wrong to argue to with him over something stupid and to ever harm him and be like our dad. He just wants to be left alone he says and I plead with him to talk to me and tell me why he wants me out of his life but he refuses. I tell him how much i love him, how sorry I am for my behaviour and how sorry I feel for missing so many years of his life. I give him his space after that and he hasn't said anything to me since. I don't know what to do next. He leaves for his dads in 1 day and I really want him to speak with me before he leaves and is mad for a week. I don't know what to do to get to his anger for the 6 year absence but I just want to be apart of his life now.

116,"I have 19 classes left, which is 2 years and one extra class if I take three per quarter. I was planning on taking only two in Fall for reasons that are rather long so I won’t explain here. However, I could take three, I would just have to have one at 8:30am, which is very early for me. In addition, I would still have to take a class in the summer to graduate in spring.

My main problems with an 8:30 class are reduced in-class performance, especially on tests, and sleepiness later in the day, when I need to work on homework.

117,"So, I'll try to make this as short as possible: my job is making me miserable and I could use some advice.

I am a 20 year old male, currently in my first job, with moderate anxiety and a massive chip on my shoulder. I have always had a hard time facing my own problems and taking responsibility for my mistakes, and I will berate myself for days whenever the smallest things go wrong. That said:

It's been a year since I took up my first job and, looking back, I feel like I have learned a lot. I was basically a naive half-wit who had just gotten out of my diapers before that, and I am kind of proud of my progress. Learned to deal with hundreds of angry customers on the phone everyday, learned to deal with my terrible, natural born shyness, made a handful of good friends during the process etc. Things were going pretty smoothly for me until a few months ago, when I got promoted to a, let's say, 'shift chief' position at my company. Ever since, I feel like I have stagnated pretty badly and have not been able to fully handle the responsibility.  And it's been killing me.

What's making me even more miserable, though, is that my superiors don't really seem to give a shit. I've been laughed at, both behind my back and in front of me, for asking simple questions about what to do in certain situations. They all look at me with such distrust and disdain, they always look for someone else to do things I should be doing simply because they don't think I'm capable of doing anything right (and I've had people say it to my face, it's not really the chip on my shoulder talking in this case), they think I'm always all over the place etc. So, whenever I actually fuck up and do something wrong, it feels like the world is collapsing on my shoulders. It makes me constantly think I'm going to get kicked out as soon as they have an opportunity, that I am a terrible employee, that the company itself would be a lot better off without me etc. And it bothers me even more that no one ever seems to talk about it unless it's behind my back. No meetings, no discussions, nothing but a load of shit being said about me behind my back. 

I am by no means a kissass and I don't want to be, I despise people like that. I just wish I had someone there to actually help me improve and reach my full potential, whatever it is, and appreciate my improvements (which are happening, by the way) and my daily efforts to become better at what I do instead of just discrediting me for every little thing I do wrong.

I don't know what to do. Is this going anywhere professionally? Should I just suck it up and keep taking the hits until it gets better or is it time to start looking for a new job? I'm basically lost.",03May2018,1
118,"Hello, new poster to this sub. 

My ex texted me about 2 Hours ago saying that she is going to call the police and report me for id theft and harassment. 

Long story short, we have been together for 2 years. She all of a sudden wanted space and I suspected that she was cheating with someone else. She denied it time and time again, and wanted space. After a week of space, she broke up with me. Again, every cell in my body told me that she was cheating. Turns out I was right. I logged into her Snapchat because I remembered her password, and yep... she’s been cheating on me with numerous guys since December. Wanted to leave me for someone else. Had unprotected sex and all while I was with her. I’m over it at this point. However...

Ever since then, I’ve still had access to her Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, And Amazon prime. She never changed her password, and used the same one for every social media outlet. Lol. So I’ve done a bit of snooping this past week. Nothing crazy. My friend wanted fortnite Amazon prime skins, so I gave him her information (stupid of me). It showed up in an email and she knew it was me. Then, I logged into her twitter from my pc, and the same happened again... she got an email saying it was from me. 

This all lead to the text that she recently texted me. This is the first time she’s contacted me in about a week. No communication since I initially found out about the cheating through Snapchat. 

As of earlier this morning, I rid my computer of all her stuff, as I no longer waned to do with anything about it. 

My question is, can I get in trouble for harassment ? Id theft ? My uncle is close with law enforcement and said I should be good. Just kinda worried. Worst case he said she could get a restraining order, but he doesn’t think she’ll do it because it’s time consuming. 

Is there any advice someone can give me? I’m kind of scared and would like to hear from someone else. Yea I know, what I did wasn’t cool and should have just walked away. I’d like to just get positive advice though! I know what I did was wrong and I’m ready to rid myself of this situation! I have finals tomorrow !

119,"I will try to keep this short. I am a writer working in entertainment and film, living in Los Angeles. Male, I am 29.

120,"Ok, so long story I guess.

I was in this fairly long relationship. It was going on for nearly 8 years. We had a house, combined our bank accounts, everything was together, pretty much everything was the way you should have it in a relationship.

We knew each other really well. I knew her from high school. I helped her through the death of her brother, she helped me through a cancer scare. We should have been good for each other right?

However, I was incredibly unhappy. I don't really understand why I was, but people that know me was saying my ex was incredibly manipulative and controlling of me. Like I couldn't visit my family, have female friends, or anything. Constantly monitored my phone and whatnot. Anyway I don't think it was healthy so a few months ago I ended it all and walked out. But I was fine the way it was like this.

The part I'm struggling with is the information I found out after it was all over. She was emotionally cheating with someone she worked with. Basically ignoring me but talking to someone else when she was at work. (when she was around me, she was always on her phone and she would stay up late maybe on the phone with him). Plus I found out within the last year of our relationship she was seriously considering cheating on me (her words) physically with the other person or she may have actually gone through with it, I'm not sure but I feel like she did. I know that right after we broke up, she hooked up with the guy days later and they may be dating now.

Anyway, I'm just having a hard time coming to terms with that information. I was all for wishing her well, hoping she was gonna find happiness after it was over, but that new information just stings. I'm hurting, I feel angry, I feel lied too, betrayed... Like I dunno, I can't sleep, I can't eat, it's really taking a toll on my mind. I have no confidence, I have no self esteem and I don't know if I can ever open myself up to anyone ever again.",03May2018,1
121,"**Brief background:** Since this February, my dad has been going through his end stage of kidney disease, and needs to rely on a dialysis machine to keep his kidney functioning. One of the critical drawbacks of having a completely malfunctioning kidney is a drastic decrease in immune system response. 

So for the past month my dad has contracted two major illness already, the first one being stomach flu which lasted for about two weeks. Once that ordeal was over, he quickly caught the shingles disease. Hell knows what other loads of diseases he'll bring in to our home once he's done with shingles.

To exacerbate this issue, my family has already been dysfunctional for years, meaning that my mom and my dad are basically enemies living together. My dad is cold, self-centered, full of denial, likes to blame others, is hard to negotiate with, and often swears to us or himself; pretty much everything that sums up a toxic relationship. My mom has been suffering from depression for three years because of the hostility and bitterness of the situation. My mom means 100 times more to me than my dad, which pretty much sums the father-son relationship, which is non-existent. 

There is a solution to this—and is quite possibly the only solution—which is for my dad to move away from us. I mean, think about it, he's sick, he hates his family (I can't emphasize enough the amount of deriding insults he's thrown at us), so what more of a better way to enjoy the rest of his limited lifespan than to enjoy it by himself? Initially we wanted him out of the house because of the hostile environment, but now the disease-prone environment just induces this need even more.

This seems reasonable, but my dad doesn't want to change. At all. Despite living in a shithole of an environment for years, and despite it negatively impacting both his physical and mental health (he clearly suffers from stress), he still chooses to not take action. He said (basically threaten) several times that he'll move away from us in a heartbeat, but he never does. 

If we want him to move away, money is also a big factor. Without the ability to work, he has to rely on several government income support programs..... which he never seemed to care about. I mean, you get free money for fucks sake. It's as if his attitude towards all this is *""fuck all this shit. My life is fucking shitty anyways so why even try?""*.

Urging him to take action is IMPOSSIBLE. Every time my mom wants him to start applying for the income support programs, or to start finding another apartment to live in, he'd burst into flames and start engaging in verbal attacks as if we threatened him or something..... but we didn't. Take today for example, my mom nicely went up to him and told him the truth that his illness is a threat to both our health, and he basically replied with *""why the fuck should I care? Stay away from my area of the house and you won't get them.""*

So now, we are trapped in this perpetual cycle of not only coping with his negativity/hostility, but now also with his sicknesses. Talking about ""change"" would just make him furious, and when he is furious he can be extremely violent so my mom doesn't ever try to fight with him. How can we break out of this?",03May2018,1

My mother is one of the most supportive &amp; loving person in my life. Even though I love her I don’t really wanna move back home. I feel stuck&amp;unhappy when I’m back there but, overall it’s just not what I pictured for myself after graduating.
 
Why I don’t wanna go back home:

I’ll be moving back home in a month and I’ll have no where to sleep but the couch my mom and I will share in the living room because my druggy uncle won’t leave our house.  He’s gone completely crazy. There’s also another couple living there which makes the house even more cramped. All of them only moved in because my mom wanted to leave for her home country and thought I’d be a “good idea” to rent out both of our rooms. I didn’t mind it until I found out my uncle has been doing some weird shit and doing drugs.

But this is what worries me the most: 

I’m dreading to move back home because I feel sophicated &amp; unhappy at the thought of never leaving the ghetto neighborhood I grew up in. Every time I’m back something happens whether the police is involved or we are struggling to get a long with neighbors/altercations etc...  I don’t wanna be in this environment for the rest of my life. I’m scared that staying there will set me back. The whole reason i went to college was to get myself out. As a kid I always told myself I’d leave and never come back. I’m scared that my dreams of traveling, living my life to the fullest and etc.. will be stalled/ won’t happen because of my family/personal situation.   

I can’t stay in my college town because the job opportunities here are pretty bleak unless you’re going into nursing. I’ve had  no luck in getting a job this semester. And the ones that offer me a job only wanna pay me $10.50 for working 30 hours a week... that’s not enough to live off once I’m done and have to pay my bills +loans. The only thing I have is a little over $1,000 in savings. I don’t wanna waste my saving on rent just to stay here for an extra month. Im willing to suck it up but I know this will mess with me mentally/emotionally. I want out of my house because I want to move on. I don’t wanna go back to a place in my life I didn’t enjoy. I love my family but I DON’T wanna move back. 

I should feel proud that I’ll  be graduating  but I low key feel like a loser. Success to me does not equal me moving back to the hood and living a busic life. I’ve always had high expectations for myself but this feels like the all time low for me and has been for a while. The only thing I’m hanging on to is the “things happen for a reason” kinda thing. Right now I’m hoping something will cross my path and steer me in a new direction.
How did you strategize what your next step where going to be after  college? What would u do?

Weird couple and my Uncle (a drug addict) live with my mother. 
They don’t wanna leave.

I should also note that I noticed ant traps outside of my apartment neighbors complex at this time. It was a minor nuisance, I mean, who wants to be in their bathroom and have the little fuckers crawl up on you while on the toilet or while in the shower, etc., but I digress...

I told my landlord and he kindly gave me ant traps. *Big mistake.* The ant traps in the bathroom attracted *hundreds* of ants towards the traps to the point where the bathroom was near uninhabitable. At this point my partner and I left for a trip and when we came back there were far less ants, but the issue persisted.

Anyhow, once fall came around the problem pretty much stopped. Now, today, the problem is back. Walked into my bathroom and bam. Ants all over. We are not messy people and leave absolutely no food out. The landlord said last summer that the source of the problem is likely from in between the structural wall separating our apartment and my neighbors apartment, and that something will probably need to be done to kill the source. We never brought the issue back up so nothing was done. How should I go about dealing with this issue with the landlord? Ant traps will not work, we’ve had them out this entire time but the problem doesn’t stop. I can’t imagine dealing with this issue daily over the next six months of hot weather. Are there any laws in the states that put the onus on the management team? How could pest control even get in between the apartment walls? What should we reasonably do to handle this issue?

Probably a bad idea to just add someone I met for a day, but I thought he would like to have someone to practice English with. At that point, he didn't show any signs of romantic interest.

So he didn't say anything for a month or so until now. Just got a message saying ""Do this for me please? Luv you!""

Is the ""love you"" part is just being friendly? I hear girls throw the word around a lot platonically, but I have never heard of a guy said that non-romantically (the men in my family don't express their love and concern verbally).

I am married anyway (he didn't understand what ""husband"" means when I mentioned that I was married), so I am not interested in a romantic relationship. If he was just being friendly, I didn't want to blow him off for no reason. What's the best way to say this?",03May2018,1

141,"I need help with what to do about my younger brother. He’s had some kind of mental illness most of his life, being checked by various doctors and yet they still can’t pinpoint what exactly he has. For the past few years my brother has suffered from depression along with suicidal tendencies.

Now i’m not 100% sure if he really wants to end his life or if its something that keeps his mind at peace, I do not want to take chances finding out. I love him tremendously. It would devastate me if he went through with it.

At the start of this year he had a mental breakdown and was put in the hospital. He was in there only for a few days and I don’t think he got the help he needs. Sometime after he was released, he started taking his medicine and went right back to talking about suicide.

Lately he has been self harming fairly bad, talking about dying more often now. I am at a loss as he doesn’t want to be admitted into the hospital. He is only 15.

I feel like she's giving me hint and wants me to talk to her (for instance, when I am in front of her she begins to walk faster than me, even cross a rather dangerous crossroad, just to be in front of me, and when she is, she regularly glances back, as if to see if i'm still behind.

149,"I have a long history of being socially awkward. I struggled with communicating as a child and had to go to therapy for it. Now that I'm 24, an adult, I still haven't overcome my issues...and they've gotten worse. 

See, when I was a teen I was shy, but had a bit of confidence and loved life--had hobbies, didn't think about my looks or thought I was good looking. 
Over the past few years people, however, have said some really snide, cruel things about my appearance. I genuinely have never heard any good stuff in real. 
So, I can't unsee anything. I was crying about that somehow because I had a severe panic attack in real, and a breakdown--still reeling. 
Crying online was basically my only means of coming into terms with it. I have no social network in real. Old best friend who moved away. Two online friends. Just stuff like that... 

I got some sympathy, sure, with that post. People accusing me of fishing for attention (despite the pictures no being available). Ouch, but I could understand. Perhaps I was sick of screaming into the void and needed someone to scream back...it's reassuring to not feel alone. 


Then this one person came along. They accused me of lying. Of my ""story"" having no emotion. And that I was making fun of people with BDD...making everything up. 
That someone that looks like me...well, that it's impossible for me to have never been complimented in real. To clarify, it wasn't on Reddit, it was another website where if you dug, you could find my pictures--at that time I really didn't want the pictures to be seen but they did anyway. 

I wasn't lying...at the time I was even crying while using the keyboard, and the chest pain I felt was still with me; I have bad anxiety and asthma so, yeah..double the trouble. Anyway. It hurt like a b*tch to hear t hat--and the person acted as if they had outed some sort of villain. 

The real thing that hurt was the idea that I came off as emotionless, like a sociopath, or something. Reminded me of my flaws. 

I have had people I've had platonically intimate experiences with, sure. Deep talks. Been told I'm vibrant when I just forget myself...that I'm real, that I'm genuine. But that one little comment made me fear that I was nothing. That I was just smoke and mirrors, and just plastic (God, no wonder why my skin is so unsettlingly shiny). 

This feeling...god. It was pretty nasty--I felt terrible already, but this? It made my entire life seem to stupid. Is everything I've ever said fake and arbitrary...? I don't know anymore and I can't stop staying awake, my nerves fried, my chest hurting...I don't know how to process thing. 

I already had enough securities to begin with, but now it seems like there's something broken with how I am...

150,"In high school, I was never the pretty girl, I had few friends and tried to isolate myself and hide behind everybody else to prevent bullying.

I met somebody my sophomore year who took me out of my shell a little and we progressed, I dated him well into my senior year and my friends forced me to break up with him after he was caught at a party when he was supposed to be at work.

He is bisexual and had a lot of flings with men in our relationship. at first I felt like it didn’t matter because I loved him.

I got jealous, and paranoid. He wasn’t using me for a front, he actually did something very romantic where he pulled me in front of a huge audience and sung to me. 

During prom, he would often tell me “dont bother with the other girls because you’re beautiful the way you are.”

he memorized my favorite things, we did everything together, we had the same friends.

It’s been a year or two, and I recently forgave him after our break up. I’ve had a few small relationships.
They always end up emotionally distant or abusive.

I started talking to him and I just, remember all of the good times. He’s been depressed and went through crap, he started cutting himself awhile back and the first person he came to? Me.

We weren’t even talking at that point. He just.. came to me.


Here’s more background about me:

I have tons of small problems that just pile on, I have severe depression, anxiety, adhd, body image issues, thyroid imbalance (congenital hypothyroidism), really screwed up eyesight (legally blind in left eye and nearsighted in right) I live with my grandparents and I haven’t had a stable family relationship due to never really having a good family home, I’m failing out of college because of a million different things from mental illness, down to having to study three times as hard just to even obtain something in my brain.

I don’t drink alcohol, smoke weed and I only take my Adderall when I’m studying, I’m on some kind of depression/anxiety meds and it’s been changed several times.

I’m sorry for rambling and overall being just so overbearing and if this isn’t allowed I’m really sorry. I just I’m exhausted and stressed and lost.

I feel like it’s just so.. empty..

153,"Mid\-30s. A neverending stream of very intense but not\-quite\-life\-shattering \(haven't ended up homeless or in jail, yet\) have left me with serious problems being able to take the world seriously. I probably have some mild form of PTSD or other dissociative disorder along with depression, etc., although the primary affliction I am suffering from is poverty and the failures caused and exacerbated by that poverty. Prevents you from bouncing back, it does.

But after years and years of things going pretty damn badly, against a backdrop of continually intensifying surreality, a chance finally appears in front of me. A chance! It's a good chance. Realistically, it might even be the last chance I'll ever get. 

But my subconscious mind has had enough. It isn't enough for me to be able to \*intellectually\* believe that this chance is a really good one, nor to know exactly what it will feel like once I'm in the zone and able to function in life again \(I've fixed myself before, so I know exactly what to expect\), nor even to know what the tricks are to get in the zone.  My subconscious doesn't respond to reason. So sure, I can get in the zone for an hour or two, but I very quickly fall out again out of boredom or despair or misplaced priorities causing me to obsess over a triviality or \(occasionally after something particularly and absurdly frustrating has just occurred\) short little bouts of hysterical laughter. 

I try visualizing success and focusing on the desire to achieve a goal, then I try visualizing failure and focusing on fear of that failure, then I try straight up ass\-kicking just DO it, then I try coffee, then I try booze, then I try mindfulness, then I try turning on the TV for background noise, then I try turning off all unnecessary electronic devices and installing LeechBlock and removing all other distractions... I'm trying anything and everything, but it's no use. My subconscious just laughs and laughs and flips me the bird.  He insists:

&gt; ""No. No no... I am done. \*\*Done.\*\*

 I can consciously control my actions, sure, but I can't control my attention span or energy levels. And I just can't limp my way through the tasks before me. I really have to be firing on all cylinders for at least 12 hours a day for at least a couple months here or else I \*will\* fail.  

He fucks with my ability to properly perceive and interact with the world.  An entire day can pass without me remembering that oh yeah, I do have a best friend and we're supposed to be working on this project together. Unusually good luck can send me into a mild panic attack; unusually bad luck sometimes triggers waves of weird mild euphoria as my subconscious does his little dissociative magic.   Oh yeah and I made the mistake of blinking once and we went from 20\`16 directly to 2018. \(Yeah I know a lot of people complain about time going by quickly, but for me that was just... scary.\)

I need to wake up from this horrible dream and I need to do it yesterday. I have exactly one person in the world left who is really pulling for me and I think I'm about to let her down because \(apparently\) my subconscious is unshakably convinced she is about to stab me in the back like everyone else has.

 \(The fact that she lives across the country and is married to someone else who would be terribly jealous if he ever found out we're as close as we platonically are does not leave my conscious mind with a lot of ammunition when it tries to rationally debate this shit with the subconscious. Not that the subconscious gives the slightest crap about rationality to begin with.\) 

I don't have the money or the time to go soul\-searching or see shrinks, but I feel like the answer could end up being some ridiculously simple CBT\-ish trick. 

So.... simple shock therapy ideas for awareness and/or motivation?  I welcome any and all suggestions, including sarcastic ones.",03May2018,3
154,"Ok, so about a month ago I was in a really bad head space. It was shortly after a break up and all I could think of was about her. I’d over analyse everything and stay awake at night because of it. Overthinking is something I do quite a lot, and it’s something that at the time I wish I didn’t.

So I signed up for counselling.

I thought it’s about time I put to rest problems with staying in my head, and maybe address other family issues from way back when.

The thing is, it took them a month to arrange something. And in that time I feel a lot better, I mean I’m still worrying about stuff, I still think of my ex, but I’m happier now, hell even just getting on with work can even make me smile. But they called Just now and said an appointment is tomorrow. I don’t want to waste anyone’s time, but I feel like I don’t need it. That time could be used for someone else, someone who needs it, as there’s a waiting list. I phones my mum back home and told her I signed up and she was proud and so pleased I made that first step, the thought of cancelling sounds weird but logical if that makes sense.

So what do I do? Do I phone up and thank them but say I don’t need it anymore?
Do I go to the sessions as there’s only about 4 of them, and hell I might gain something from it?

I’ve been dating my girlfriend since we were freshman in high school, and being a sophomore in college, that makes it 5 years of dating. As freshman, I did some questionably controlling things: asking her not to talk to certain people, not to hang out without me, etc. I do feel terrible about this and since then I’ve never done things like this since that time. However, since that time, she started to take it back onto me, doing the same things I did to her but 10 times worst. I wasn’t allowed to talk to my best friend of 4 years (now 9 years), she wouldn’t allow me to have fun if it didn’t involve her. Fast forward to now. I met a group of people on overwatch, and decided to add them on discord, one of which is a girl. My girlfriend randomly went on my computer and searched through my discord, finding my conversations with these people and the girl. Despite being completely harmless conversations, my girlfriend grabbed me by my hair and started furiously punching me in the face. She then started playing victim and eventually made me block this girl from my discord and any other social contact I had with her. I’ve tried multiple times in the past  to leave, but consequences of that make life 10 times harder, as we share a similar friend group, and I’m extremely close to her little sister(these consequences have once nearly pushed me on my edge this past December) .

Thanks in advance.

165,"Hello everyone,

sorry for the long story, I tend to draw things to unnecessary lengths. tl;dr at the bottom.

I need your advice about taking or not taking a job. I am not from America I'm from Europe. Why am I telling you this? See, the advice I'm looking for will be general, I'll just adapt the terms to get you an understanding of my current situation. So if there are any misunderstandings - please tell me.

I'm 29 and I've worked in this company for around 3 years daily as first-level-supporter for a software. To spare a bit of details, we just did customer support for a program.
The IT-departement is pretty small overall but it's a nice team, first to third level work together very closely. The company as a whole is a family business and the bosses are not exactly the nicest people on earth - but they are managable. I had to deal with this 2 times in 3 years and could usually work things out one way or another. Getting screamed at isn't nice but I can live with that. The payment was ""okay-ish"" for the time being - I was an unskilled power and the firm was always fair or rather the HR was.

Anyway, while working in this company without experience I became a valuable member of the team and am seen as a hard worker. Also because I took my A-levels in late school while working for them. They saw that I am resilent and can bear my workload while also doing a good job.
By no means am I perfect. I argue a lot of things to ask questions and can be a pain in the butt discussing things.

Now onto the situation, I graduated the late school in june last year and wanted to study at a university. Meanwhile my boss offered me a position in our second-level support team which also takes care of third-level support partly.
Back then I didn't know what I wanted to study - just went after my personal tendencies and began to study to become a teacher in English and Education. I declined my companys offer but stuck around to earn just a bit money, at my old job.
Since two or three month I am unhappy with my situation. It's my second term and by the book I'm doing fine. My courses are good, I get along with the people around me, but I feel out of place at my university.

And I don't mean it in a negative way towards my university. I could finish my terms and get everything done - but my company got wind of me being unhappy and more or less told me that their old offer still stands, they've seen that I am adaptive and can do a lot of things other first level supporters can't do. ( I was a nerd before I got there and knew a bit about PC's and had an apprenticeship for 3 years. )

So they offered me this ""old-new"" other position with around 3k before taxes, and 1,8k after taxes.
As a teacher I would make 4k before and around 2,3-2,8 after taxes.
[Please keep in mind it's Europe.]

On one hand I would have to continue to study for four more years and on the other hand I would get less at the beginning but had more range upwards in later years. Also I would have no extra education but would be specialized in the systems we actually use and every other firm in our field of work.

What would you guys do? Any ideas? I'm totally overwhelmed by the situation. I keep in mind that I am not that young andmore and I might not be able to go back to university once I leave it due to financial and motivational reasons.

tl;dr: For me it's either continuing going to university and studying to become a teacher, but after 5 years will pay out, I guess. The other option would be to go back to working in my old firm and try to get raises and also other areas to work in since I'm good at my job.
Neither choices will make me happy. But I am not that great at deciding for things so I need your advice, people of /r/advice.",03May2018,1

Unfortunately about a week after we started talking, I had to move away for a while. Not a long time though and as we were getting on SO well, we decided that we'd keep talking and meet when I'm back in the city.

So time went on and we eventually became a massive part of each other's day. We were talking at every opportunity that we could. Long phone calls through the night etc. We became quite close. Established that we have a tonne in common. We both made it clear that we want to go on a date and we were very excited to meet.

Suddenly he changed. I mean *suddenly*. He stopped messaging me first. He stopped carrying on conversation. He just seemed different. I asked him what was up and he told me that he's got a lot going on right now and is having some problems. So I backed off and didn't message him for a week. Didn't hear a word from him so I checked in to make sure he was okay. He said he was still struggling. This pattern repeated itself a couple of times.

He's now moved away to another country for work and will be back next month. On the day he left, I sent a message just to say safe trip and hope you're okay. He replied once to say thank you and when I replied to that, the conversation died. Left on read again. It's been almost exactly a month since we last spoke, because I haven't messaged him first.

I was so excited about this guy. We got on so incredibly well! How can he go from talking to me non-stop, planning dates, phone calls that went on for sometimes 5 hours at a time, to just nothing. Not even bothering to message me anymore? I can't stop thinking about it. Fair play if he lost interest or decided he wasn't into me anymore, that's fine. But why can't people just say that? Why do people have to just fade out and hope you get the hint? It's rude. It hurts.

172,"I have always had a problem with socail anxiety and found it hard to make friends. I have put a lot of work and thought i had a really close friend. We had been for nearly 3 years. There had been a few times when it made me start to question it. Eg. I had to bail on a plan we made because of work, i apoligised profusely and tried to make it up but she ignored me for around a mounth, and still brought it up later.
 Fast forward she got mad over something super petty and stopped talking to me altogether. It looked like the end and i felt bad for a mounth but moved on. 3 mounths later she messages me again, not really apologising pretty much saying its my fault. But wanting to talk again. 
   I don't like to hold grudges, but i dont feel we have a lot in common, and she admited that part of the reason she stopped talking to me was that she was jealous. I don't want to compete I'm just working hard and doing my best. 
 Please help, I have never been in a situation like this before.

173,"I like offensive memes and jokes, the darker the funnier to me. About a month ago I posted meme on my story that I thought was funny. My friend texted me that it wasn’t okay so I sincerely apologized and took it off my story. I’ve tried me best not to offend anybody, and I’m fairly sure I’ve done a good job. During this afternoons lunch, my friends and I were talking about what were we’re going to do better next school year. I asked if I could do anything better. 3 out of the 4 friends I was talking to were quick to say my humor. They told me I needed to cool it down, but I thought I already have been. My last friend told me she admired my sense of humor and I didn’t need to change.  The others, seeing I was embarrassed and upset, quickly changed their minds and said that my humor wasn’t quite to their tastes, but not awful. I guess my question is, how do I find a balance of my dark humor and other’s humors?  How can I stay true to myself, but at the same time, please others?

176,"There's this guy who lives in the next room and is incredibly nosy, to the point that he asks (casually) if I was the one who posted something on Reddit (I never told him my username) and when I asked directly he said ""he saw the username *once*"". When I go near the computers, I see the sites I'm regularly visiting, subreddits I go to.  Even shows and video games that I watch. I'm 80% sure that guy is reading this right now or will read this in the next few days. I'm absolutely sure he's been glancing at my comments and posts.

It's incredibly annoying since I'm paying for the guy's living conditions for over a year now. And the least he could do is respect my privacy. I mean, it's not like I go through his accounts. 

I like privacy. I *enjoy* browsing online and not having to look at the back of my head to make sure nobody is watching. I'm a lurker, I like going through different sites. What I don't like though is having people go through my comments, posts, and web history out of nosiness or curiosity.

Now I started locking my computer screen whenever I leave the room or minimize to desktop when he's nearby. But I always notice that when he is near the doorway his eyes go straight to my computer's monitor. I don't say anything but it's disrespectful and annoying.

177,"It all started back in 2013. I loved the idea of having a bucket list and completing as many things as possible before you die. Many people have one and it's a good thing to have, right? Well, at first it was for me too but after awhile I got too obsessed with the idea of a ""perfect"" life. I would lose sleep and fail some classes just because I would rather spend most of my time browsing websites for new bucket list ideas that I hadn't thought of before. The list grew longer and longer but still, I wouldn't complete a single thing on there because when would I have the time to do it? I really hope you're starting to see my problem here and if you don't, bare with me because there's more.

Fast forward to sometime in 2016. I got really involved in social media. I found really cool people to follow on different social media platforms and I started to lose interest in continuing my bucket list. Sadly I replaced this habit with watching what other people do in life and telling myself that I'm gonna do the same things as them which is leaving me with basically no dreams or thoughts of my own. I replaced bucket lists with obsessing and forcing myself to save literally everything I see on the internet that I think that I might wanna do sometime in life.

This leaves us where I am today. It's gotten so bad that I change my mind about my life and my future several times a day. I've never told anyone about this. It's something I've been stuck with in silence and it's been bothering me for so long. During the years I've actually developed some dreams of my own and I try my best to stick with them. If there's one thing I've learned since my early bucket list days it's that nothing in life is free and you earn what you deserve. The thing is that when I've tried to let go of this bad habit of mine it's working for a couple of days and then I'm right back at it again just because I'm getting bored with having the same goal for too long.

So, what I wanna figure out is: How do I find myself again? What am I gonna do to not lose track of my goals? How do I take one day at a time? ",03May2018,1

I have this feeling that i cant do anything productive because I'm afraid someone is going to call my phone or ring my doorbell/visit me. It doesn't make any sense to me why this would be a problem, I can always answer a phone call or answer the door if someone were to visit. Sometimes when I decide to be productive I'm holding myself back from going all in and instead over the course of an hour or two I become less and less productive until I'm back to doing basically nothing just so i can be ready to answer that potential phone call or answer the door. 
There are times where I'm productive for 8-10 hours or so when i get really into what I'm doing, but on the occasion that I do get a phone call or someone visits during the time where I'm actually super focused I feel the need to drop everything I'm doing and give them 100% of my attention and my heart begins to beat rapidly, even though I know the phone call will be over in probably 3min and whoever is visiting is either someone I'm expecting or Jehovah witnesses.

In that time, it has had extensive use and survived travelling multiple times between the UK and Spain, and I'm very fond of it. It was an upgrade from a Celeron 1.7ghz processor, 6GB RAM and standard integrated Intel graphics to a 2.4 - 3.2ghz i7, 8GB RAM and 2GB of dedicated video memory, enabling me to significantly increase the number and quality of PC games I could actually play. Functionality-wise it still works pretty damn well. I've had to change the battery once, but that's it. It still runs at a decent speed and I still get a lot of use out of it. Once I get a job after graduation and move somewhere permanent, I want to build my first desktop PC, but I still like the idea of having a portable computer, so I'd quite like to keep this one.

I need help, i had a girlfriend for 7 years, shes 23 like me.

After she said that to me she rarely wanted to be with me, she would always make an excuse and make something up to not be with me.

I went to the hospital all afternoon with her, after that, at night she said she was tired and i understood and wasnt with her, for 4 more days she would always make excuses to not be with me or it was late and she was tired(wasnt even late) or other excuse. I was tired of that and said im going to ur place so we can have our last conversation i need to know what happened i deserve it. She said if i went to her house she would call the police, we were always good together i never did nothing wrong i rarely hurt her i really like her i was shocked when she said that so i didnt go to her house. She later said that she didnt mean to say that she only didnt want me to go there. I said when u want to talk and explain me what happened once and for all u call me or sms me, meanwhile its over. Days later without knowing anything from her i knew from her mother that she said to her that we werent together days way sooner than when i broke with her. Can u help me?

To my knowledge they came to the united states illegally. They both separated in 2008 and have been living apart since then. My dad has been supporting myself, my sister(20 F), and my mom for 10 years now. My mom has been riding this wave since then and has not worked since I was a young boy. Currently, my mom lives with my sister and it has been tense for a while. That itself could take up a huge post. My sister is currently in this state of annoyance with my mother. My mom is the type of mother who likes things a certain way and often gets offended when criticized. I love her but I understand the annoyance. My sister is also in school and living off my mom's cooking, cleaning, and money. They are in this state of relationship where I could very well see them separating as well. My mom is a good person and does love the both of us. I love her too. She has suffered a lot of trauma from the relationship she has had with my father. She still receives the money in order to live and he gives it out of duty. Its a fucked situation. I stopped receiving his money but my sister is using it in order to go to school and pay for rent.

198,"My wife and I have been together in total almost 15 years (including courtship period.) While we were dating, we would share dreams together and I would make promises like ""we'll have a huge house and lots of money..."", just sort of open ended, lovey promises.

Anyway, fast forward to today. I can make $90k+ USD a year between my job and a handful of side gigs, but this leaves me working literally all the time, from the moment I wake up until I go to bed, no weekends ever. I actually don't mind because I like my work, but it does get stressful at times. My wife does not work but she is still quite busy as a stay at home mom with our son. We don't have other family in our city, so it's rare that she can get a break from being a mom (just to make it clear that she's not lazy and laying on the sofa all day or anything like that - she's a really attentive mom, reading to our son a lot and taking him out for walks to play with other three year olds, etc)

My wife cries most days about our situation, often in front of our son. She claims this was 'not the life' I promised her because we live in a one bedroom apartment in a big city and can't afford ...anything really (our son goes to an excellent nursery that is extremely expensive for us, which leaves only enough money for the basics and a small vacation getaway once a year, which is never relaxing for us.) Anytime I try to point out that $90k isn't exactly poor, she gets really angry and says I've given up on our dreams and that I'm an idiot for getting a humanities degree, which she considers a dead end. --Her heritage is Asian, which has something to do with this statement I'm sure.-- She is usually quite keen to get me upset about something so that I'll engage her in a fight; this has become a hallmark of any moment we are together -- at the breakfast table, while driving somewhere, etc etc, never a peaceful moment. She did not finish high school and is not professionally skilled in any way, so she isn't capable of doing anything to contribute financially. Pointing out that I can't physically work more than I do sends her into despair.

I'm not sure why I'm sharing this here. I guess I just feel like typing it out. If anyone has been through something similar and can share how they got through it, please share. I do not want to get divorced. I'm hoping this is something that couples similar to us grow out of.",03May2018,1

Sister and Boyfriend have been together for a little over two years, very serious, living together, potential marriage type shit. About a year into their relationship my sister casually mentions to me that one of his friends (of 4/5 years) within a group chat with all of their friends came out rude and aggressive towards my her, calling her a c#nt, while her boyfriend didn't say anything to stop it. That continued for three weeks until the guy gave in and knew he wasn't going to split them apart. I told her to confront her boyfriend about it, but she didn't. 

This week the situation came up again, sister calls me upset that her boyfriend wont stand up for her, continues to hang out with ""C#nt guy"" and leaves her at home when they hang. I tell my sister I will talk to her boyfriend, what I would do if I were in his shoes, trying to comfort her.

I especially like watching an anime or a film with him, or with her \- but never with both at the same time. Then it's just an anxiety nightmare.

I don't want to do some of the stuff they're doing, so I could just refuse, but I worry that I'm letting my time with them slip between my fingers. It's like a clock ticking and telling me that my time \(presumably my time with them\) is running out and I need to do something. But again, if I don't like what I'm doing, I'm gonna complain and ruin their fun. This ""clock\-like"" feeling is present in nearly all aspects of my life, though with slight variations.

This does not happen with any other girl, except her. It has caused trouble in our friendship. I don't know what I'm feeling exactly, but I know it's toxic and dysfunctional and I have to stop.

It could be jealousy. But it could also be envy that they have a more interesting and fun friendship than I have with any of my friends.

I seem to captivate people with charm, and when they're ""hooked"" on me, they find out about my faults and flaws and it always ends with me being an asshole to them. That is straight\-up manipulation. That is a very bad thing to do, but I ended up doing it; getting myself into relationships I can't make the effort to keep, and yet crying my eyes out when my friends do what every single person *should* do about a toxic person in their lives: cut me out.

The last thing I want to do is making him choose between his girlfriend and his best friend. That is one of the worst things you can do to someone. I wouldn't wish it on someone I hate, much less someone I love.

But I'm *already* making him choose, just by not doing anything about it. So far, he's ""choosing"" me as in he's choosing to spend time with me instead of with her.

Since I have no idea how to deal with I'm feeling, I feel like the only way I can make things truly fair is by cutting myself out. The only reason I'm not with both of them right now is because I'm a squeamish asshole. My friend has not, unlike me, done anything wrong. They want to talk to each other, but I'm sure I make my boyfriend feel chained to me because of this whole situation.

She deserves his company way more than I do. Yes, I will suffer and get very sad being apart from him like this, but in my opinion, I *deserve* to suffer for being such an asshole.

He knows of all these things that I feel. I told him. He agrees with me that I'm wrong. Yet he doesn't want to get away.

I quote, word by word, *""Either it's us two or us three, but you're not leaving because of this.""*

If I just quit the call using ""I deserve it"" as a justification, *he's* going to get sad and not enjoy his time with my friend. So it only makes it worse. If I tell him ""bring her in"" and mute the call to suffer, and leave them both there, he'll quickly realise that there's something wrong. And I really, really don't want to lie to him. Or to her, for that matter. That is just wrong.

I know the right thing to do would be to just get over this forever unexplained, irrational distress \- since I don't even think they like or might like each other or anything like that \- but I'm afraid I don't have the emotional skills to do that. Developing them takes time, and in the meanwhile, I'm going to feel more and more guilty over taking him all for myself. When I have a minimum of emotional skills, it might be too late to repair myself and control the guilt.

So I'm stuck. I don't know what to do. Please help :\(",03May2018,1
207,"Background info: I'm a distance student at the end of my doctoral program (two classes left, already finished my preliminary exams, going to be working on my prospectus this summer).      
Yesterday, like the title says, my program of study self-destructed in a very literal sense.  We're having a mass faculty exodus.  I'm losing my entire dissertation committee and my advisor.  A friend in the program who's actually on campus went to the department office and did the ""I'm not leaving till I get answers"" thing and was only told that there's no plans to hire more faculty members and they're basically dissolving the program.  But rest assured they were going to place the existing students with new advisors (and then she got politely escorted out).  
 Thankfully I'm done with all the actual courses in the program itself and my last class is a research class in the fall.  The problem lies with the dissertation.      

This morning I wake up to an email that they think they've found a potential committee chair for me and I'm **really** unhappy with their pick.  On an academic level, her research interests don't align with mine *at all*.  On a personal level, I've taken a class with her before and she was condescending, unapproachable, and never answered her emails.  

To say I'm stressed about all this is an understatement.  This same crap happened to me 15ish years ago when I did my Masters.  Huge faculty turnover, I got an advisor with wildly different research interests, and my thesis wound up being on a topic I had no desire to write about and no interest in and if we're being blunt I'm deeply embarrassed by it because it turned out awful.

I'm just feeling sort of lost right now.  Is it bad form to say, ""I don't want this person to be my chair?""  I feel like I'm a choosing beggar but I have a REALLY bad feeling about working with the one they're suggesting.  How the hell do I find committee members with the entire program gone?  Can the school just say, ""Too bad so sorry"" and leave me stranded without finishing my degree? (And before anybody asks it's a proper accredited university, not a for-profit.) Not being on campus is making me feel even more helpless because I can't just walk into people's offices and advocate for myself...instead I'm stuck with sending emails and phone calls and hoping someone answers.

If anybody else has gone through this or if anybody has practical advice I'd really appreciate it.  ",03May2018,1

212,"My roommate is alright, but she's a huge bum. Honestly, I don't know how she got into this school. I have never seen her do homework/go to the library once (not that I care, her grades are her issue). My problem is that she's ALWAYS in the room. I feel as if I get no privacy, and on top of that she sleeps in the dark until 1pm every day (on weekdays. weekends its 3pm). I always feel like I need to tip-toe around. But when I try and sleep, she plays movies out loud and talks on the phone. Also, I can never study in the comfort of my own room, and when i try to go somewhere else (especially during finals week) every place is full of people. She also loves to lock the door. One day I left for 10 minutes to put on makeup in another bathroom (I like to play music while getting ready and she was sleeping), I came back and the door was locked. I banged on the door for a solid five minutes, texted, called nothing. I had work in 15 minutes, so I hid my $1000 worth of makeup in the study room two rooms down the hall and ran to work. A half hour later when she woke up, she texted saying ""sorry! i was sleeping."" (Weird because she is usually an extremely light sleeper, I get up to use the bathroom she tells me to be quieter). I said it was ok, asked her to grab the makeup bag that I hid TWO ROOMS AWAY (a 10 second walk) and she goes ""I am so tired and sleep deprived. I don't want to get up."" At that point, she has been sleeping for at least 10 hours. And on top of that, the girl acts so tough because she's russian and always says was ""raised on the principles of hard work."" 1. she was born and raised in america. she is american. and 2. she talks down to me saying ""american girls dont get it"". 3. She acts more spoiled and ""american"" than I do. she OBSESSES over boys like its high school, she is superficial and obsessed with her appearance, she is self-centered as fuck, and she is LAZY.

He first started making excuses and then when I insisted he called me a junkie and involved it illegal activities that I’m not using my card. I told him whole thing but he denied.

220,"Hi guys,

To put it plainly, my husbands family is still close with his ex\-wife's family. They still comment on each others Facebook posts and tag each other \- the worst thing for me is that they still have his ex listed as their sister in law on Facebook. Not to mention, they've been divorced for 3 years now. I first met my now husband while he was going through the divorce and it was a bad one. His ex wife tried to take everything \- and I mean EVERYTHING. She tried to take the house, car, his retirement, health insurance, and tried to make him pay for her school loans. It was absolutely ridiculous. He spent a fortune on legal fees and ended up winning the case because his ex\-wife doesn't work and didn't think she even needed a lawyer. She even brought her mom in to the court room to act as her lawyer and the judge literally laughed at her for thinking that was allowed. She's a 27 year old child with no plans to do anything in her life. Her mom is a 40 something year old child who feels the need to comment on every single one of my husbands family' posts. But, my problem stems from the fact that his family just doesn't care about all of the grief and pain his ex put him through. When I first met him, he was completely broken. He was so distraught over the divorce and having found that she cheated on him. He's a Marine and was away on deployment for about 8 months \- upon returning home he found out she wanted a divorce and was soon with another guy. To say the least, I despise this woman and her family for trying to take everything he worked for. And I'm furious that his family will look blindly at the pain they caused him and still be friends with them. What do I do to get them to understand they are causing strains in the family? My husband and I don't even want to be around them due to the disrespect they've shown us throughout the last few years.

No matter what I can look back and say those times were really helpful. Fast forward to now, I finally decided to make the decision to move out.

I remember even talking it out with her, both of us trying to figure ways to get us all to hang out, and myself find a way to hang out with them by myself.

226,"So around February my financial advisor offered me an internship. He briefly stated that I would be his personal assistant and research associate. Additionally, he told me I’d be getting paid for this at a decent wage for an intern ($3 above minimum wage) and that I’d be working around 10-20 hours a week. At the time I didn’t have a job so I immediate took his offer. I did some work for him in the end of February and he basically stopped contacting me. 

Fast forward to now, I got a new job as a security guard at a local mall and I’ll be able to work 30-40 hours a week at just $1 above minimum wage. Some of my friends work there and they know I’ll have a great time working there. 

At the same time, my financial advisor also contacted me about my internship over the summer. He brought me in for a meeting and he started speaking about all these goals he has for me over the next 5 YEARS. Additionally, this internship program I am a part of is really about selecting “people who really want to be financial advisors”. 

Some background info: I’m a first semester finance student who switched from computer science last semester. Although I like Finance, I’m not confident enough to say that I want to do this for the rest of my life. I may get it as a degree cause I understand it and it’s a good degree to have, but I wouldn’t want to work in the field. 

By me continuing with this internship, I am basically committing myself to his company for the next 10-15 years and I’m not sure about that. Although this isn’t in writing, I personally feel obligated to his company if I begin this process, since he will be investing a lot of time and money by helping me grow. 

I honestly don’t want to do it. I understand that it’s a wonderful opportunity, but I just can’t commit to anything right now, considering that I’ve already switched majors once and I don’t know if I want to do this for my career.

Anyway, this all started when uni started after school, went to uni thinking it would be the greatest time of my life and it was not I got bullied really bad with people leaving rope in my room and with messages about how I should kill myself.
PLus through three years of uni i was going out with a girl who I assumed was the one and I was so happy with her at the time to find out at the end of a relationship she had been cheating on me the whole time and had parties going out ect where I was never invited.
So I came out of uni with depression, anyway I started drinking allot on nights out to forget the pain and because my friends of 11 years stopped messaging me and talking to me because they did not understand and frankly did not care because I was no longer cool or wanted to be cool i just wanted to be happy.
But it's been four years since all of this has happened and I still think about it every day, they are all still close and I’ve tried so many times to explain or get into contact with them as they were my life but none of them care, they think im mad and bad news. 
I am 25 now and I have no friends no life, I have a good job but I go home every weekend for the last four years and just sat in by myself. I just think this is the one life I have and it has been throw away. I just can’t take it anymore, I feel the best parts of my life have been lost and I’m finding it too hard to wake up in the morning. 
I’ve not logged into facebook in over three years because if I log in and see a photo of them It makes me so depressed and I found out last week that my ex who was horrible to me is now going out with my ex best mate.

My sister, on the other hand, is bitchy, never helps and is constantly being condescending towards my mom and telling her she hates her and how she’s been raised.

I don’t mean to brag, but we’ve been brought up in a very privileged household. She really doesn’t have all that much to complain about. Two things that she does complain about are her weight (really not even that bad) and her acne. I try to help her eat healthy but I’ll walk into her room and see she’s eaten a whole bag of chips and like half a litre of coke. My acne cleared up because of a well known brand, and she refuses to even try it because it damages her skin, even though she washes her face 6 times a day as an attempt to clear her face. And the worst? I give her advice and my parents yell at me and say I’m bullying her.

My parents are not even trying to hide it anymore. Tonight my mom forced me out of the shower for dinner, I came downstairs to find dinner had not been made and she just wanted me to make the table, which is all fine and stuff except my sister was literally sitting in the adjacent room watching tv. If I asked if my sister would help, my mom called me ungrateful and told me to stop trying to defer work and that my sister would clear the table when we were done. Who cleared the table cause their sister was too tired? Me. This happens nearly every night without fail.

Another thing is my sister can literally say anything in the world to me, whereas if I say a word I’m the devil. The other day, she called me a bitch and told me that everyone would be happier if I killed myself IN FRONT OF MY MOTHER and not an eyelash was fluttered.

Once a year she'd travel to the capital to meet with some clients. She'd inevitabley meet with this guy, business related or not. I don't really have a problem with that. 
The past couple of years my wife and another much older female colleague have had to travel a significant distance once a year. 
This year my wife is telling me their plans. They want to take time off over there. It's more than half way around the world, so of course they should! It would be madness not to. So they book 5 days on a tropical island after the business trip. All good. 
A few weeks later my wife just casually drops into the conversation that this guy is going. He wants to meet with the company owner to discuss business. I'm immediately upset, but try not to show it. I have anxiety problems, sometimes things like this hit me hard. So I bottle it up until I can figure out if it's a real problem or not.  
I think this is a problem. 
So it turns out that this guy has organised a trip with multiple destinations. He meets my wife and colleague there, they have dinner with the owner. Then my wife and her two colleagues spend 5 nights together. The older colleague is in her 60s, and not up to much.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. My wife says he has lost his job and is going to his parents in another country for a while. She has a trip to the capital two weeks later.

The day she comes home she tells me the guy went with her. I thought was in another country? No, he's back this week, he flying out again in a couple of days. She the  proceeded to show me photocopy the gig, and this guy, that she'd sent to her work colleague.

I'm a 9th grade high schooler. One of my friends hasn't been in school for about a month.

Recently, I haven't been exactly nice to her. I blamed her for some of my problems, and pushed away our relationship because I felt I would stay out of trouble by doing it. 

I wanted to apologize for what I'd done, but like I said above, she just up and disappeared one day. I wasn't able to say sorry until today.

She tried to commit suicide about a month ago. She came back today. 

I don't know what to do. I feel personally responsible for this. She attempted to kill herself for completely different reasons than what I did to her, but what I did certainly didn't help. 

She still thinks she is worthless and that no one cares for her. It's wrong, I care for her even if I didn't want to before. 

I'm just worried that she'll try to do it again. And maybe she would be successful the next time.

I don't know what to do. If she kills herself, I would feel personally responsible for it. I need help. I don't know how she feels. I'm not a depressive kid. Yeah, I'm pretty sad. All the time. But not to the point where I'd ever consider killing myself.

I don't know if I could live with myself if I don't do anything. I feel like even if I do something, I would still feel guilty if she ends up doing it.

I don't know. I don't know. I'm just worried for her. She was getting better with her depression before some situation happened, someone she knew got thrown into jail, she got like 5 misdemeanors.

Thankfully, most of these things have passed! I only have my research project and finals left to worry about. It's looking like I'll get all A's, and my interview went better than I expected it to. The problem is I've had maybe two or three nights over the past week where I've had an absolute breakdown.

I feel like it's understandable when I've had barely time to shower and make meals for myself, but then I spend some time working with these grad students I'm friends with, who I imagine must work at least as much as me, and who have much more in their lives too like kids they have to care for.. And they're so chill! They'll cut things SO close to deadlines, but remain certain things will work out.

I've been getting better about my own time management and doing work way ahead of time, but when things do sneak up on me like they did this semester, I don't know how to deal with it gracefully. I think I worry too much, put too much weight in doing things perfectly, and it ends up impacting the whole process.. Like if I weren't so high-strung in this one area, I'd be able to get roughly the same/even better results without all the breakdowns.

I've been telling myself these are just growing pains and the calmness/certainty will come with the more practice I get with having a stressful schedule, but idk how true that is or if it even comforts me ; . ;

Any advice??",03May2018,1
237,"I recently got a job as a janitor just to have some work experience. I'm not really interested in the money bit. However, it seems my mom was not happy with the fact I got a job as a janitor. I think she would have been more enthusiastic if I worked at Best Buy, like she suggested. To me, I don't mind this job, but the fact she is secretly unsatisifed really annoys me. You wanted me to get a job, and I now have one, and now you don't want me to have one I managed to get mostly on my own? What do you guys think? ",03May2018,1
238,"So basically, I've been looking at jobs in Belgium, Japan, and Mexico. They are all government affiliated, provide accommodations (so they find you an apartment and help you set it up), and include job experience I'd like for my future career. I know to achieve the goals I want, any other job or place I live is just going to be a stepping stone/detour until I eventually get to one of those jobs.

I lived with my parents throughout college, saved up and worked to pay for college, am graduating with no debt and between 5,000 and 10,000 in savings. My parents have not financially supported me since I was a teenager, but they do let me live at their home and eat there for free because they wanted to help me complete college. I have a credit card I've paid on time for the last 6 years since I first got it. I have purchased my own cars before and maintained them, gone on trips on my own - I'm financially responsible. I know that if I move somewhere and it's unsustainable I need savings to fall back on and enough to get somewhere I can sustain.

My family very much wants me to move out locally before taking one of these jobs farther away. But moving locally will mean buying a car (that I'll just have to sell in a few months when I leave the country), paying a deposit and moving costs for an apartment that again, I'll be paying to move everything back out of in a few months. And that sounds like at minimum 2,000, and probably 4000+ dollars just to move out locally for no long term reason. I will probably be paying around that much when I move to a new country to get settled, and it seems foolish to me to move out locally just to prove I can and waste thousands of extra dollars.

I know how to cook, how to maintain a home, how to get places on my own and organize things, and on top of that all the programs I'm looking at help with accommodations. So I am guessing it will be somewhat similar to when people go off to live in dorms and the university helps set them up with the dorm. Except, the job programs I'm looking at give you personal apartments so no roommates. Lots of teenagers move out to dorms away from their parents, and parents rarely freak out that their child will be unable to handle the sudden change. But if their kid was paying for their dorm themselves, then it's a pretty similar situation. 

Most of my friends agree it seems like a waste of money to move out locally if I just plan to leave soon, and if I don't plan to stay for any considerable amount of time locally for a job. But my family is horrified at the idea of me moving away if it's not local first. Although... when my older sister moved out, they freaked out about her moving a few miles away.

tldr: Is it wiser to move directly to where I plan to work and have a job lined up, or to move out locally first and get used to living independently first, even though I do not plan to live locally for more than a few months post graduation?",03May2018,1

241,"There was a group project that required a presentation aspect. I was assigned to work with two of my classmates. The professor told the class that he wanted these presentation to have a creative aspect to it (so nothing basic like a PowerPoint or oral presentation). 

At first, I met with my group and suggested a skit. Everyone else in the class was doing a skit, and these classmates said they were open to it and we could discuss possibly doing a skit. However, when we finally got a chance to meet up, they expressed interest in doing a rap battle. I have social anxiety (no excuse, I know) and the thought of rapping in front of my peers and making a fool of myself scares me shitless. I told them this and they agreed that they would rap while I acted as a narrator of sorts.

Next time we met, I tried to contribute to the lyrics but had a hard time doing so because, well, I'm uncreative as fuck. I did try but they kept saying things like ""that doesn't make any sense as a rap"". So they basically wrote the whole thing themselves. They decided to scrap the narrator position part and told me to just rap and ""no once cares if you can't rap, if they laugh they'll be laughing at the situation, not you"". At this point, the presentations were set to take place two days in the future, so it was too late to switch groups.

I tried pumping myself up to go through with the rapping. The day before the presentation, the thought of rapping in front of the entire class got to be too much for me and I just sent them a text that said ""I'm sick. Go ahead and present without me and I'll contact the professor on my behalf"". I figured they had done the whole project anyway and it was my grade that was at jeopardy, not theirs. The assignment wasn't even worth that many points anyway, and since I'm making an A in this class it wouldn't mean anything if I didn't do it. 

The next morning, the day of the presentation, my group member texts me ""Are you still sick?"" I didn't respond because I'm an asshole and today was supposed to be the last day of class so I'd just ghost him. After class, the same classmate texts me and says ""The professor hated everyone's presentations and he's making us redo them next week."" Since I was planning on this week's class being the last day of class, this put me in a predicament. If I miss next week's class, I'll fail even though I have an A because more than two absences is an automatic F (I missed one day at the beginning of the semester.)

I don't even know how to try to fix this. I thought about telling my professor the truth (I was not on board to rap in front of the whole class) but I'm afraid he'll try to make me work with the group again, who made it clear that they're pissed with me. 

I'm so nervous I've seriously contemplated just not going and failing the entire class and retaking it next semester. I KNOW I'M AN ASSHOLE. ",03May2018,1

247,"Hey reddit. I am 25 and experiencing a bit of a quarter-life crisis. 

When I was 12, I was honeymooned over the idea of flying jets in the Navy/Air Force. I brought up my GPA from a 1-something and took on a bunch of honors courses to bring these grades up to the upper 3.5-3.8. I joined a bunch of extra curriculars, Varsity sports, etc with no prior training or experience. On the fly.

Anyway, I graduate with honors and stuff. I do an AFROTC scholarship with my local college. Long story short, I was unqualified to fly because of my height. I dropped out of college, and gradually begun a mental breakdown that propagated a “paper trail” of a mental health history that bars me from any military service whatsoever.

I was basically shelled up in my room,  barely functioning, and only coming out to eat, use the restroom and spending rest of my time to sleep. I was in the hospital for a good long time to shake me out of this fog. I literally had no energy, will to be awake, or will to live for that matter.

It’s 5 years later, mentally I’m back on my feet. In college, i noticed I excelled at biology and psychology related specialties, and I am very fascinated with the human brain. I don’t have any family obligations or verve to socially “settle down”, but, I want to go in for the long haul and possibly pursue medicine- psychiatry to be exact. The psychiatrists who looked after me saved my life and I’ve seen “bad” psychiatrists ruin the lives of people as well. I think it’s a beautiful and important role to play in society, especially with pioneering advancements in neurology and behavioral based science.

The problem is... I feel guilty for not having served my country. That window is now narrowing and im reaching an age of no return. People tell me to join up and lie about my health anyway, but I’m on medicine and I have been for the past 5 years. It’s not that easy for me.

I look back on this as a great failure that I thought I was over with but it still haunts me. If I go into medicine, that seriously is great, but my childishly naive/optimistic perspective tends to not want to let go of the image of me as a Major. And it hurts.


Anything you can say to help me smooth this path down would be appreciated. Thank you.

Parents should be required to pay a $5,000 bond each (so $10K total) that is paid back to them upon a child turning 18 y/o when they have a child. The bond is forfeited if the child has to enter foster care. Additionally, parents must pay a further $10,000 bond for each year that their children remain in foster care and this debt stays with them as a deduction to all earnings like child support.

Failure to pay the bond upon the child's birth must be followed by sterilization of whichever parent's bond(s) has/have not been paid with a reversible procedure that may only be reversed *after* they pay all outstanding bonds and pay for both the original procedure and the reversal.

Finally, the interest on all child bonds would be used to pay for the sterilization procedures and any surplus should go toward paying for half-way houses for foster kids/orphans who are still young adults.

I realize that this might not be politically achievable in the United States because Catholics (or at least the Catholic Church) oppose not only abortion rights and prophylactics, but are also against sterilization - in which case the Catholic Church could be permitted to pay these bonds to whatever degree they feel appropriate. Additionally, the courts might find that the state does not have the right to assess sterilization as a criminal penalty for failing a civil obligation (paying the child bond). However, I am less interested in the political and legal challenges such a bill would face and more interested in moral or logical arguments against the bill. Would it be morally just for the state to demand and enforce responsible reproduction and would such a bill lead to less human suffering and/or the betterment of the common good?",03May2018,0

Being an international student, she has welcomed me to every single family holiday (I know all her family now), has invited me to hang out in her hometown with her high school friends to the point where they are my friends too, she has always been there for me to help with anything.

We´ve hung out almost every day for the last four years, and we talk daily even after we see each other. I am 100% certain we will always be in each others life.

So for graduation, I wanted to give her a nice present so here´s my idea:

She loves to read, and we always joke that she would read anything. So I wanted to make her a handmade book, where all of her family members, friends and loved ones write out their favorite memories of her, write graduation wishes and have pictures. So each chapter would be one person. I already asked all of her family and friends for their help and everyone is eager to help. Everyone says that its a very thoughtful and cute gift, I just want her to have a book literally of all the people that love her.

I am excited to make it, but my problem is that I don´t know how she will receive it. I think it might be too thoughtful that it might make her uncomfortable or guilty you know what I mean? or receiving that gift might make her feel like she owes me something (which she doesn't) or if for whatever reason down the line she wants to end our friendship she will feel like she can't cause I made this grand gesture...

(I am sure someone reading this has seen at least one example that i am talking about.) I mean some woman just leave me speechless with how damn good they look. It has become something i look forward to seeing. I try not to stare but when i see something so attractive i feel as though i may have a heart attack. But i love it. Today i was carrying on with normal activities and i notice a woman wearing a extra tight shirt. I have never seen someone wear a shirt like this in public. It might not have caught my attention like it did if she wasnt walking around with out a bra. Each step she took they gentley bounced. I could see the outline of her breast and hard nipples pointing out. From this man's perspective they were perfect. It was the best part of my day and she had a great ass as well. I even noticed other woman checking her out. One of the reasons i try not to look so long because i dont want to get caught myself. I cant imagine she didnt notice what she wore or looked in the mirror unaware of how much she was showing in public. Regardless my dick was so hard it was difficult to hide. Now that the warmer weather is in full swing, im sure to see more attractive woman wearing less and less. Anyone know of any sub reddits with images like the ones i described? I swear you could make a grocery store kink out of this.

I can go a few days eating only 700-1000 calories, but I get discouraged when the scale shows very little progress compared to how much agony I have from constantly being hungry.

He already told his parents and is seeking help with a therapist already. I notice things aren’t getting better though. His depression seemed to start during school. His parents don’t want him to go on Xanax which he has a prescription for. I agree. It sucks though because he is a close person who I trust and feel comfortable around. I try to ask to hang out and just chill for us both to get out of the house but lately he has just saying he doesn’t want to. I don’t want to force him aswell. He did say however that over the summer he wants to hangout a lot and do lots of outdoor stuff which sounds great to me.  The other friend is always busy with sports and stuff.  It just sucks to be in this situation. Do u guys think it will get better over the summer? Where friend 1 maybe starts feeling better and friend 2 has more free time.,03May2018,3

283,"Let me begin by apologizing for what might end up being a really long post.

I am an unemployed 32-year-old with a disability.  I do have an Associate's degree (don't worry, this is all relevant in the end), but it's one that I regret getting as It seems to have been a mistake as far it's relevance in the ""work world"".   So much so, that I've never held a ""real"" job (not counting a high school job).

As a result, I've spent a number of years now ( - not as many as you'd think though as I graduated in 2012 due to multiple circumstances), struggling to look for and find a job.  I've come to realize that the degree I told you I regretted getting set me up to not really be ""qualified"" to do, well......pretty much ANYTHING.  

I have looked into countless entry-level jobs in a variety of industries that I am either ""not qualified for"" either as a result of my poor degree or just sheer inability to succeed at basic tasks (in part due to a learning disability to go along with my physical disability).  Oh, that's the other thing, one my disabilities is physical, which significantly ""cuts down"" on the number of jobs I can apply to and reasonably expect to get.  

As a result of all these years of failure, I've become HIGHLY bitter/cynical, depressed and basically just about ready to ""give up"" on finding a job - as unrealistic as that is.  Unfortunately, I've also developed a large number of bad habits:

- I'm undisciplined
- lack commitment 
- am unaccountable
- afraid of change
- full of excuses
- lack willpower
- I'm TERRIFIED of getting out of my comfort zone (to the point I basically refuse to do it in whenever I can avoid it)
- Have bad time management
-my priorities are probably out of whack
- Have realized that I've become quite lazy/lack a real ""work ethic""
- I'm ""not the most responsible person in the world"" (although not the least, either) 
- oh, and I'm a complainer

I know that's a long list, but I wanted to be honest.  

Anyway, I need help figuring out how to improve myself and how to better pursue jobs that I might actually get.  I cannot begin to express how sick and tired I am of looking for and applying to jobs - which is largely where the bad habits began to form.  I know that's not okay, as that's a vital and mandatory part of finding a job, but at one point there I frankly just ""gave up"" looking entirely for a little while. 

I need advice on how to improve myself, and how to better pursue the job hunt.  Are there avenues I might not be pursuing or ""ways in"" to entry level positions that aren't abundantly obvious?  I'm perfectly aware that at this point, I'm also struggling because due to my relatively advanced age and total lack of experience that I'm probably losing out on positions to younger, recently graduated applicants.

Anyway, I guess that's basically pretty much everything I have to say and look forward to any and all advice - I don't even care of it's ""bad"" advice, I'm so desperate I'll take any advice.  Oh, and congratulations (and THANK YOU) if you've actually made it this far down this ""TL;DR"" post and are still paying attention and care about my problems.",03May2018,1

I believe they somehow hope that he'll just 'get it' one day and start talking and learning. He's 14 now and can't do almost anything by himself. He's lazy and obese. It's pathetic. I doubt he'll ever become a proper human being. 

I believe they expect me to take care of him when I stablish myself as an adult. Thing is, I hate him. And I can barely take care of myself. I believe I still have some time...I'll go to university and all that I guess. I've been having a lot of trouble with trying to believe that maybe I could live a good happy life in the future and find something for me to do everyday, so I really don't like all this added stuff. I have another, younger brother, but he's a spoiled brat who'll grow up to be a pathetic loser, so he doesn't matter. I'm the eldest, so of course they expect me to take care of the autist one. 

I wonder if I could just leave them all and never come back. It sounds really hard to do, considering I'm really not the best example of taking charge of your life and being responsible and mindful and all that.

289,"Here’s my situation. I’ve been married for over a decade. My wife was my high school sweet heart. She was, and still is, a very attractive woman and I love her dearly. Over the years we had two children who I love with all my heart. I honestly couldn’t ask for a better partner. But something has been weighing on my mind for many years now, and I’m not sure what to make of it. 
Like I said, my wife is amazing in almost every way. Except one...Sex. I feel terrible saying it because we do have sex, and it is good. But it is plain, infrequent, and leaves much to be desired.  I have an overactive sex drive (what man doesn’t though?) and my wife is just the opposite, but for a very good reason. Growing up, my wife was molested by her step dad for many years and it affected her in a lot of ways. 
 1) She is ashamed of her body, even though it is beautiful. I am still so attracted to her physically. I tell her as often as I can how beautiful she truly is. But she does not believe me and dismisses my compliments by putting herself down. 
2) She only has sex when I want to. She does not initiate or seem to enjoy sex a lot of the time, and has told me that she mostly does it so I can be happy and not cheat on her.
3) she will not do anything outside of the ordinary when it comes to sex. Rarely does she perform oral on me, and won’t let me give her oral sex under any circumstances. And I love to give more than I love to receive. So other things like role play, tying her up, ass play, toys, dirty talk, porn, or just plain old rough, loud sex are all off the table. 
4) She does not trust. She always has a fear that I will leave her and I have to reinforce the fact, to the point of exhaustion, that I do not desire other women.
5) She is very independent and has a lot of problems with authority. Even though we’ve been married as long as we have, she still has a “You can’t tell me what to do” attitude about even the most trivial things. 
  I believe a lot of these issues are caused by what happened to her. And I can’t fault her for that. She is broken, and I feel like it’s my responsibility to love her and help her heal and live as close to a normal life as she can while dealing with her scars. 
Now if you couldn’t tell where I’m going with this, here it is. I feel like I am unsatisfied sexually. I have this need to experiment and experience things I haven’t done before. I want to know what it’s like to be with a woman who has no hang ups in the bedroom and would be willing to do whatever we dream up without second guessing or embarrassment. I want to experience an unexpected enthusiastic blowjob in an unexpected place simply because she thought I would enjoy cumming down her throat. I want to tie her down to the bed face down and eat her pussy and ass until she couldn’t take it anymore. And I know this one isn’t realistic, but a threesome would be nice before I die. But these are things that I know I will never get to do. I try not to be selfish. I try to be understanding, but that doesn’t stop me from having these thoughts and feelings. 
I don’t want to lose my wife. I don’t want to lose my kids. I don’t want to lose the life we have built together. I don’t ever want her to feel like she isn’t good enough, but isn’t that the message I’m sending? How do I keep my wife and live out these sexual fantasies? Am I an asshole for asking someone who’s been molested to do non typical sexual acts? I’ve told her that I want to try other things, but the answer has always been “ no, that’s gross, think about something other than your dick.” I refuse to cheat on my wife. She has been loyal and faithful to me since high school, and I fully intend to do the same for her. I love her. I only want mature and realistic responses for this. I sincerely do not know what to do.",03May2018,1
290,"It occurred to me recently when he had a ""day off"" from her. It was supposed to be a day he has to himself, but she showed up and took over not allowing him to have alone time with me, his best friend.

She lays a guilt trip on him because of his hobbies or what he likes to do in his spare time. She works but it is the bare minimum hours so the hours she isn't working, he has to spend that time with her. He makes excuses for her saying her friends are off at college so that's why he has to spend so much time with her. The only time he has to himself is when she is working (which is rare) or he is sleeping. When he was in between jobs, she told him that she is okay with him not working as long as he drives her to and from work or wherever she needs to go.

I think he is in a relationship he is too comfortable with. They dated a little in high school but broke up. So she knows his family, they know her.

So I’m 22 and staring down the rest of my life working in a factory in one of the poorest states in the Country. Last week  I worked 72 hours. I generally work anywhere from 60-80 hours a week. The factory I work at is large scale production for a big name Car company. 

It’s not the worst job I’ve ever had and it pays the bills but it’s incredibly depressing seeing this as the rest of my life.

$9.50 an hour. Wake up at 4am with a 30 minute drive to work, get off at 6pm just to get home dead tired with only enough energy left to eat and shower before passing out to wake up and start the cycle anew.

Many of the people at this factory are pretty elderly. There’s one man here who is 79 and had his leg chopped off by a forklift a few years ago. Others missing eyes, hands, some arms, etc. All of them too poor to retire.

If you die on the job here your family is only compensated $1000 for funeral arrangements. (If you know anything about funerals, you know they cost way more than $1000).

My day generally starts with me starting up my forklift and keeping a large industrial press fed with sheets of metal that it smashes into car parts. 2 guys at the back catch the parts and put them into a buggy, then I take the parts to the stock area, keep my guys fed with buggies, keep the press fed, refill my forklift, try not to kill anyone.

That’s my day. I’ve been here almost 2 years. I don’t do drugs, I rarely drink, and I don’t have the time to hang out with friends. What little downtime I do have is usually spent at home resting. But the more and more I think about how crappy my situation is. The more I think “why bother? Why shouldn’t I just go home and put a bullet in my head right now?”

Why should I bother working myself until my body gives out only to die alone crippled and poor? It’d be easier just to get it over with now.",03May2018,0
299,"My husband and I recently relocated to South Florida from up north for his job. Being that we are now living where most people vacation, our friends and family have taken a heightened interest in visiting us here (ergo, have a free place to stay near the beach). We have had only a couple ""good"" guests, but most of the time, our guests have left a bad taste in our mouth and even left me feeling resentful, which I hate. I love being able to see my friends from back home but to be honest, most of them have been freeloaders. When we moved here, I had to quit my job so we are now living on one income instead of two, in a city which has a significantly higher cost of living (we sold our house and now pay 50% more to rent a one bedroom condo). We can manage just fine for ourselves but since we've moved here we have had so many visitors who expect us to pay for their food (or don't pay us back when we go out to eat) and cart them around all over town without even offering to chip in on parking or gas. It's to the point where I now make a point of eating in when guests are over to save money, but even when we do that, guests expect us to feed them 3 meals per day. I've even asked our friends/guests if they'd like to stop by the grocery store to pick up snacks or anything they may need in the way home from the airport but most times they said ""no I'm good"" then eat all our food. Look, it's one thing for family to come and visit and be treated a little, but it's another when friends ASK if they can stay at our place (just to be clear, not invited by us, but welcomed to stray) then mooch off us. My husband and I have a limited budget and don't often go out to eat our spend money ourselves so when guests expect us to house, feed and transport them everywhere it becomes a huge strain on us financially. Is it wrong of me to expect people who ask to stay with us to at least offer to pitch in for food? If not, what do I say or how do I approach the situation?

I finally decided to lose the weight, did it poorly, starved myself for 2 straight years. Went from 400+ to 200 even. At 200, I was being asked by people if I was sick and my family was deeply concerned about me. I'm 6'2'' for the record.

I was super weak, had no muscle definition, decided to start doing power lifting. Over the last 2 years I've managed to get quite strong, but this required me to gain a lot of weight too. At first I fought it very hard, I hated gaining weight but if I didn't I wouldn't get stronger.

I seem to have plateaued around 255-260, but I've also gained some considerable fat back.

When I was obese, online dating was basically pointless, I didn't match with anyone I found attractive, I've always preferred thin women and well not many thin women want an obese guy.

Anyways, fast forward to when I was 200... Still wasn't getting any matches with thin women... I was shocked and thought maybe I just needed to gain muscle in order to appeal to these women.

Now that I've gained considerable amounts of muscle, again, I still have absolutely no interest from thin women... Don't get me wrong, I'm not talking about anorexic teenagers, she doesn't need to be sporting ab lines or anything.

I'm starting to worry that this has nothing to do with my muscles or fat, and everything to do with my style / face / complete lack of photogenic abilities...

I shave my head because I was told my hair makes me look older, it's all grey and while I could dye it, I'd rather shave it if it doesn't count against me.

Ok, so here are the photos of my journey / where I'm at now, I am going to post 2 shirtless photos because I think it's important to see muscular wise the development I have made, but I don't post these on my dating app because apparently they're hated and well I don't look like a greek god.

310,"I don't like to drink, but I will with certain friends because they're fun to hang with and drinking is kind of what they're into. 

But now me and those friends aren't in the same place anymore. I'll drink when we get together, but it's not regular. Which is fine, because when I drink, I tend to get anxious and for days afterwards I'll feel very sad. Also, I'm an introvert who thrives when I'm by myself. 

Anyway, I have some other friends, but I don't really like to drink with them. I'll be honest, sometimes I'm not even sure if I like them, except for one. In fact, when they text me, I either get annoyed or I get incredibly anxious. But I feel like a jerk when I turn down invitations to go out. It've been over a month since I've seen them and they want to go out drinking this weekend and I don't want to go(tickets for this bar party is like 50 bucks), but I also worry that this time if I say no, I'll get bombarded with texts about how I never hang out. 

I've just been feeling very lost lately and my life is feeling like it's lacking direction. Sometimes I feel like I need new friends and to make new connections that I can sort of relight some life in me. But sometimes I feel like I've reached a calm that I've haven't felt in years. It's been awhile since I've had a drink and since then my head just feels clearer.

311,"Since freshman year of high school, I’ve been really into video production and editing. I’ve been focused on that for the entirety of high school, and now it’s my senior year and I’ve been admitted to a college to study media arts. My parents, family and everyone knows this is what I do.

However, I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of being in law enforcement. I love the idea of being a police officer. But I’ve never pursued it, or taken any of those “cadet” classes during high school. One reason I’ve never got into it was because I thought I wasn’t fit enough, and never could be. But September last year, I started working out/eating right and I lost 30 lbs, I’m a female, 5’2” and I was 145,  now I’m 115 lbs. I’ve also toned some muscle and I’m in way better shape. I feel like I could definitely get to a point where I could do law enforcement now, but now it’s my education that doesn’t match up. And nobody knows that I’ve ever had interest in this career, except maybe my boyfriend but I’ve only mentioned it as more of a “what if” scenario a few times. 

Is it too late to change my career path? Do you have to go to college for law enforcement to get into it? Or should I just go with what I know I do best and am on track for? ",03May2018,0
312,"this person is a movie actor and a public figure so its ok to give out their name. his name is eddie schweighardt. think of him as jacob satorius but a piece of shit. this is a small list of things he did:

he bullied kids in elementry school

he continued to insult kids in middle

he got expelled in middle school

he acts like hes better then everyone else

he flexes like hes ricegum

he said that a girl who was a little thick should have an eating disorder to look nice

he shoved a girl down the stairs and broke her wrist and hand

he calls almost every girl a whore or slut behind their back

he insults everyone

everything past being expelled from middle school, he has gotten away with. apparently he is gay and has an iep. since the school is ran by liberals (the retarded ones) they dont do anything about it. they would probially get sued thogh. this iep makes him immune to any type of repercussions. he literally has a teacher escort him to each class and bathroom because he is scraed that someone might say something mean to him and hurt his feelings. its perfectly fine for him to say stuff though. he also purposely uses the iep as an excuse. he literally said, ""i have an iep so you cant get me in trouble"" he literally reports people being mean to him and gets them suspended and shit

a few days ago, this girl who was in my school got hit by a train and died. the whole school was crying and exremely upset by this. so then this tawt goes around saying ""she just killed herself for attention"". he said that directly to the girls friends. the whole school created a petition to have him removed from the school. everyone signed it. the principal just ignored it. he gave the empty responce of, ""i know why your upset, ill let you if anything happens"" basically he just talked with eddie for 10 minutes and sent him back to class. once eddie found about about this petition, he hid behind the guidence counslers. he got away with it.

since im not very liked at school, nobody is listening to my idea of threatning a walkout. i think that something needs to be threatened, otherwise a petition is just politely asking them to do somehting. in a school where throwing a pencil at someones arm will get you suspended, this kid is able to shove an innocient girl down a thing of stairs and break her hand and not get in any type of trouble.

so basically there is this twat at school who thinks hes special and is able to get away with anything and i want to find out a way to lynch him

Once I'm graduated I will not be able to live in school housing so I have a week to find housing and have six months to find myself a job to afford housing and tuition payments. 

I also am finding myself paying a few hundred simply to further my education by applying to PA school and it's a competitive program and if I am not accepted I will not get my money back. The issue is to be successful and be able to afford PA school I need basic housing, transportation to AT LEAST my part time job among other factors. 

My family cannot help me out as they are financially unstable and live in section-8 housing. There are no spare rooms and it's cramped as it is. 

Ive contacted people who are renting out more affordable rooms on craiglsit are not responding. This is more of a last resort thing and I'm nervous because I would be living with strangers but beggars can't be choosers.

327,"I tend to ramble on when it comes to personal posts, so I'll try to be as succinct as possible: I really need guidance on how to move forward with my life.

I am about to be a university, community college, and trade school dropout. While I have many excuses on why this is so (diagnosed ADD and depression, lack of well-developed work ethic, etc.), they don't account for the fact that four years of my high education is basically down the drain. Last fall semester I was basically forced into trade school by my mother to pursue an associate's degree in Radiologic Technology. This fell through; I ultimately did not attend many classes due to episodes of depression, lack of confidence that getting a degree in this field would guarantee a job, etc., etc. This semester was supposed to be my final chance to try and get this degree that I have no faith in; it was basically a repeat of last semester. I have not told my mother the truth regarding my grades yet, but will soon have to tell her due to my brother being in the know of my failure.

My mother/family pay for everything; I only pay for amenities for myself such as internet and my phone bill, so I have no real knowledge how to handle myself in the outside world. I don't even know how to do my own taxes, for Christ's sake. Currently I am considering my options. In terms of work experience, I have about two years in sales and about three in customer service (Chick-Fil-A mostly). I failed all my classes in University and trade school, and I transferred over from community college to trade school with only a few credits from my Communications major, which I wasn't really all that serious about. Maybe about a couple of semesters worth? What really stresses me out is the fact that I'll be under four years of education debt and no degree to show for it.

Honestly, this was a long time coming. I feel like I've been doing all of these diversionary tactics and hiding from the truth for so long that I barely know what I've been doing anymore. I just hope that there's any hope for a screwup like me.

329,"I’m a high school senior graduating this June. I’ve just been offered two different jobs this summer, and I don’t know which one to take.

**Option A: Internship with a children’s hospital**

Overview: It’s an 8-week, 20 hours per week, $14 per hour ($2,240 total) position at one of the best children’s hospitals in the country. Tasks will include playing with children, sanitizing toys, cleaning medical equipment, delivering flowers and gifts, and operating the gift shop.

Pros:

* I want to major in Medical Lab Science, so this is a great way to make connections and learn more about that career field.

* My sister did the same internship last year, and she said it was completely life-changing and made her appreciate life more. It’s a great way to build character.

* It’s only 4 days per week, giving me more time in the week to potentially have a second job.

Cons:

* The commute is 1.5 hours there and 2 hours back (walking and riding the bus, since I can’t drive). Even though I’d be making a lot of money for a part-time position, the amount of time spent traveling might negate that. Also, I’d realistically have to get up at 5:30 every morning just to get there on time.

* I’m uncomfortable around young kids and am not looking forward to hanging out with them (although one could argue that this is just a hurdle I’ll need to get over, and getting out of my comfort zone could help me grow as a person)

**Option B: Summer job with the Student Conservation Association**

Overview: It’s a 6-week, 33 hours per week, $11 per hour job ($2145 with unpaid lunch breaks) where you work on park and trail maintenance projects.

Pros:

* The commute is only 45 minutes, and I could get up slightly later in the day (just by half an hour, but still lol)

* I did this job last summer and loved it (even with some bad coworkers), so I’m pretty confident that I will love it again this year. It’s really fun - there’s a camping trip, kayaking, visiting a water treatment facility, etc.

* Although I’m intent on Medical Lab Science, my second choice in a career is Environmental Science.

Cons:

* It would probably be easier to have a second job through the hospital internship because I’d be working fewer days (though it depends on which hours of the day they schedule me for)

* My parents and sister are all really happy that I got the hospital internship, and I would probably disappoint them if I took this job (I’ve always disappointed my family, so the hospital internship would be a good way to finally prove myself to be capable of something)

Although there’s plenty to be learned from the SCA job, I’d be missing out on the life-changing experiences of working at a hospital (my sister saw kids with cancer, macrocephaly, mental disorders, etc. - she says it changed her perspective on a lot of things)

In addition, I’m not sure whether it would be better to have this hospital internship under my belt, or to stick with the same job so that I can have some proof that I stick to what I do and I’m not a “job hopper”.

336,"As a bit of back story to help set the stage, my wife is 30 years old, has BPD, and comes from an emotionally abusive upbringing where she wasn't allowed to ask questions or learn anything about being an adult. Due to that, she never really learned anything about personal finances. She understands money comes in from paychecks and goes out to expenses. That's honestly about it. One of the traits of her BPD is she's a very impulsive person as well, especially with money. To the point I had to be 100% responsible for our finances and turn off her bank card.

The problem is, she can't seem to stop herself from taking my bank card or a credit card and spending money anyways. She also never wants to make good financial decisions even when I'm around. She doesn't seem to see money as real. Its just this thing she can buy stuff with. There's no real consequences. Cash is a no go because she will spend every penny of it the first chance she gets. She fully admits this.

The problem is, due to this behavior and me being stupid with money and decisions in college and after, we're drowning in debt. We both have student loans, credit card debt, car loans, a personal loan, etc. I've wanted to get out of debt for years now but every time I broach the subject it goes no where. I've tried showing her the budget I use to pay the bills. I've tried the envelope method. I've tried talking to her about the basics of money management. I've tried asking her to read about the basics and do research. She says she will then never does.

I fully admit that our current financial situation is largely my fault as well. Especially because I know better and make poor decisions anyways. But I want to change. I want to be out of debt. But I feel hopeless when I have a wife who continues to spend money behind my back, won't talk to me about finances, and won't even try to learn.

So at this point, what do I do? Do I just try to push ahead on my own with the finances? Is there another approach with her I'm not thinking of? I refuse to believe there's no hope. I want to fix this. I'm just not sure how.",03May2018,2

A little background: I was raised in a super religious family (we were in a cult, if I'm perfectly honest) and grew up believing that being gay is the worst thing you could do to God and your parents. Obviously, as I grew up and developed an understanding of the real world, I found that I didn't agree with that sentiment. I realized that love is love and people are beautiful. I found myself looking at women differently throughout my teen years, and I thought I might be bi (I'm a woman). I moved out at 18, about 2.5 years ago. I feel like I'm a completely different person now, having been able to develop my own opinions for the last few years. 

I've been dating since I moved out (it wasn't allowed before that) and have mostly met men. I had one short relationship, but other than that I've been single since I was born. 🙄 I've gone out with a few women, but it just hasn't ever really worked out. One woman was married and wanted me to get involved with her husband as well, which I wasn't comfortable with at the time. One girl was just looking for a hookup, which I also was not comfortable with. I've always felt that I could be in a relationship with a woman, but after the date I had a few days ago, I feel very confused.

I met this girl, we'll call her Mary, on Bumble. We seemed to click, we had a lot in common, we had some good talks over text. We met up for coffee, she seemed like she had fun, and I had fun too, but I didn't feel a spark at all. I kept forgetting that I was on a date and kind of just acted like I would if I were hanging out with a friend. No subtle flirtation, no witty banter, no sexual tension. She's adorable, and I find her attractive, but I didn't feel the thing. Now I'm having serious doubts. Thinking back, I haven't ever really felt the thing with a girl before. But then again, I haven't felt the thing much at all. I know I'm young and shouldn't expect to magically figure myself out right away, but I honestly don't know what I want. I don't want to waste anyone's time or hurt anyone. What if I just want friends, not girlfriends? How am I supposed to know? And how am I supposed to figure it out without hurting anyone's feelings?

A lot of times whenever I'm heading to the front of the store to clock out for the day, I'll walk past my crush at her little work station that she works in and I'll quickly say ""See ya later"" or something just to let her know that I have no problems talking to her and also as a little sign of casual flirtation. But today I walked by her working and I didn't say anything to her. I just kept walking and went to punch out for the day. I didn't do it to ignore her or be rude or anything, it's just that I get so nervous around her sometimes and it can be hard to talk to her.

Now I'm worried that she's gonna think I'm ignoring her. I don't want her to think that me not saying ""bye"" is a sign that I don't like her and that I'm ignoring her now. Am I overreacting? I wanted to say ""see you"" to her, but I just didn't and now I'm freaking out and worrying that she's thinking that I'm ignoring her. I hope she doesn't have massive anxiety like I do.

350,"Long story short, I love where we are living, my mom fucking hates living where we are living. And is planning on moving as far away as she possibly can across the country. But why? That is where the long story comes into. Now this is going to be a long one, so grab some popcorn and listen to me ramble out of anxiety and stress. I am quiet literally going back 36 years to where my brother was born, so I will sum all this shit up. At the bottom there will be a really short story, but not everything will make sense if you just read that. I just kinda need to tell some people about this and maybe find some people who have maybe gone through this and have some advice.


So 36 years ago in 1982, my brother James (fake name, for obvious reasons) was born to my mother and her then husband. Shortly afterwards, my mom divorced him and demanded child support be paid for him at an astonishing rate. Even a lot for child support today. And she got everything she demanded and was basically not working at all because she was claiming all this money for him. Until a month before his 18th birthday she said she hates where they were living and wanted to move and was going to leave him there. This surprised him so much because she has always talked about moving away from there when he turns 20 and has his life straightened out. But she just decided that the place they were living in causes her too much stress and bad living conditions (which was untrue, from what I’m told). Sadly his father had passed at this point so he had no one. He was an 18 year old kid who just had no mother or father anymore because his (technically “our”, just throwing that in there Incase you forgot) mother. So he decided to go to college to become a police officer, this will play in later. 

Then about a year later my mother found my father, they never really married but for a short time. They divorced right after I was born. And my mother gained custody of me and demanded 2x the normal amount for child support for some stupid reason and that when I turned 17 my dad would not have to pay child support and on top of that my dad also demanded that she at-least stay in the same city as me so we could be close (I will explain this later why he chose to do this, it will all make sense). So my mother had to stay in the same place. And for the next 14 years my mom got the extreme rate of money for me that was never spent on me, which I always found weird but never noticed until now (Again, I’ll explain later). Then about 2 years ago we decided to move up to a nice town in the most northwest part of the country in Washington State. Live has been great. Within about 6 months of moving here my mom told me she would be moving when I turned 19 so that she could make sure that I’m settled in and have a good life. Which I was fine with, I saw no harm in it. And ever since I have found a life for me, a promising job at my local church that pays well even for a 16 year old. Then about 2 weeks ago my mom walked into my room and said we needed to talk. So I say there and listened to her talk about how she is so stressed out here and wants to move away. So in my mind I was thinking down to Cali or Oregon. But nope she is moving to the farthest possible place from where I am. Far southeast Florida. Which hearing this noise fucking destroyed me. I have kinda accepted it at this point. But that’s not what is hurting me right now. And with this I kind figured why she would move out a week or so before I turn 17, but I remember as a child hearing about how my dad didn't have to pay child support when I turn 17. Which got me thinking, but it will make sense later. 

So previously I have mentioned a bunch of weird stuff that didn't make any sense, so I am going to go back about 16 or 17 years and explain it all. So back to after my brother got into the police force. SO my brother now knowing what has happened to him and everything looked up to see where his (our) mother is and try to contact her, but (through not too legal ways) found out that she was doing the exact same thing to my father that our mother did to his. So he took it upon him to warn my father about this and try to warn me about this. So he got into contact with my father and told him everything and mailed him a letter that was for me when my mother decides to move out, like she did to him, explaining it all so I didn't go into search about my mother. So fast forward to a couple days ago, I sat down with my father and talked about everything that is happening. And he instantly started crying, and of course I did too. He went into his closet and pulled out a letter, and told me ""I have been keeping this for about 10 years, and you have to read it now. This letter is the only reason I demanded that I stay around with you so you don't end up like your brother"". And this blew up my fucking mind, hearing all those words and just now finding out I have a brother (well I do have another one that is on my dad's side that I am very very close to, which thought I would mention cause I might talk about him). So to sum up the 3 page long letter, he told me everything I said before. With my mom trying to get as much money as she can for him. And told me that he was worried that the same thing was going to happen to me. So he took it upon himself to find my dad and warn him about it. So this whole time my dad knew this was going to happen, so he hid this from me and fought very hard to make sure that he would always be around me, which the only reason he did (other than cause he loved and cared for me). And now here I am at my current point, crying my ass off knowing my mother only wanted me for the money I could make her and now that it is all gone, she will be gone too. She doesn't know that I know. 

SHORT STORY:
Mom fucked over her ex husband and abandoned him, and forced him to pay too much money for child support for their son. She moved away from her ex and hasn't talked to him since. I didn't even know he existed until just now. Then she proceeded to squeeze as much money out of her ex for their son. Which all worked. Then once my brother turned 18, her ex husband technically didn't have to pay her anymore and stopped paying. And around that time my mom also abandoned my brother. Which led him to become a police office to try to find her again, but subsequently found my father and warned him about what she did to her ex husband. My mom married my dad and had me, another boy, and tried to fuck him over the same way, but since my dad knew what she was trying to do, he demanded that they at least stay in the same state so that when my mom abandons me I will have someone. So now my dad does not have to pay child support when I turn 17, and in about 2 months I am turning 17 and my mom is moving out about a week before I turn 17. So I brought this up with my dad saying that it was a bit fishy, he started crying and gave me a letter from my brother (that I didn't even know existed until I read the letter). Explaining to me what she did to her ex husband 30 something years ago. So basically all my mom wants is to have a kid to make money off of so she doesn't have to work. Which destroyed me, but I have gotten over since then. And now I need to figure out life after my mom leaves. 



Now here is the advice part, is what I am doing to cope with this and how and what should I do life after this (bad grammar and word use, but at this point I don't care, I can't stop crying). I just don't know what to do about my mother, should I just let her go and try to move on. Or should I fight for her to stay even though she doesn't give a shit about it. I am not depressed or in a bad mood over this, I am just extremely stressed and anxious about it all. Like how is life going to change, will she even want to see me after all this happens. It is fine if you have no advice or anything. I have more than enough people around me to help, I just want advice from someone who might have had this happen to them or something similar that can give me tips to help me get through this all.
Sorry for this long spill of words and a story, but I just wanted to let me heart pour out onto my keyboard. I am not suicidal or depressed so don’t worry about me in that respect.

So I am going to go make sure my hand is okay because it is starting to go slightly numb. ",03May2018,7
351,"So I’m one of the millennials who is actually lazy and entitled. I’ve always been this way, which wasn’t much of a problem for me when I was a kid, but now I’m an adult having to support myself. Yet I can’t seem to shake these negative personality traits, which are holding me back tremendously.

I have zero motivation or ambition for anything involving work. I do the bare minimum and give up easily. I lack confidence in myself to do things, or maybe I make things out to be harder than they really are. I’m constantly thinking and planning but never doing. I’ve wasted years of my life just staring at my phone and computer screens. You might think that could indicate depression, but I really think I’m just lazy and entitled. Though, being this way does make me depressed at times. I was very fortunate to have a loving mother who cared so much for me that she did everything for me and gave me whatever I wanted. I really admire the people who put themselves through college and in debt with no family support. I could never do that, and I’m glad I don’t have to do that. But I still have these horrible habits that are holding me back from succeeding.

My family can’t support me anymore, so unless I’m able to change I’m going to go down a dark path. My cousin who is older than me and who was probably more spoiled than me has totally screwed his life over beyond repair and is still dependent on his parents at age 40, unable to get a job. I fear that I will become just like him unless I can somehow gain the motivation to overcome my lack of motivation. It seems impossible. Has anyone else overcome their laziness? How did you do it?

TLDR; I’m a spoiled only child with zero motivation to work and fear I will become like my deadbeat cousin unless I can figure out how to change. If anyone has a personal story of overcoming laziness that would be fantastic because I find it hard to believe it’s possible. Thank you",03May2018,1

358,"I'm just x-posting this here since I'm not sure where the right place to post this is. I'm hoping that if I can't get advice on the CS-related stuff with this, that I'd at least get into some conversations with people about this since I really need to flesh out my thoughts on this. 

Also, for anyone that isn't familiar, CS internships are notoriously hard and competitive to get, especially for anyone that isn't a junior.

Also, fwiw, I am interested in doing things in my career past just programming. I'd totally consider getting an MBA and going into management or something, but that's a long ways away.

**tldr:**

Worked with a study abroad provider to find an internship for me, assuming they'd find one where I would be doing programming. They didn't and I have little interest in the project I'll be working on. It's not really related to computer science and might not even fit on my resume. The program is really expensive, and I'm not being paid. Should I reneg?

**Pros:**

* Will be in a foreign city for the summer
* Non-zero chance to do some programming at the end + potential to be kept on as a remote developer
* I won't have to find something else to do over the summer
* The non-refundable deposits we've made won't go to waste (although this is kind of moot since it's still less expensive than taking the internship)
* Maybe I get some of the crypto I help develop?
* Maybe it will be an opportunity to widen my skill set into kinda-bizdev stuff
* Not really a pro per se, but reneging on the offer would make things pretty awkward between the company I'd be working for and the placement company, since the company I'm working for told me stuff about the project without me being under an NDA

**Cons:**

* AFAIK, I'm the only person interning in STEM of the other people in the group
* The entire program including visa fees is really expensive and the internship itself is unpaid (assuming I don't get any of the crypto I develop)
* I won't be home for the summer (I've been really homesick while at uni on the other side of the country)
* I've heard poor things about the housing that we'll have (Chapter Kings Cross if anyone is familiar)
* The internship doesn't have anything to do with programming right now
* I'm worried that I won't get good mentorship, since I'm fearing they're basically putting the task of developing/planning/doing bizdev for a WHOLE NEW CRYPTOCURRENCY on my shoulders
* Likewise, I literally have no idea where to start with the bizdev behind cryptocurrencies. I have a tiny bit of interest in them (I own a small portfolio), but I've really lost interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain tech as a whole recently. I don't follow markets or any coins, I just check my portfolio every morning and that's all I've been doing for quite some time now. I like to say I know enough to know that I don't know enough to do this project. Even if I do complete the project, I wouldn't know where to begin with programming a cryptocurrency.
* To be perfectly honest, I'm not sure if this would even fit on my resume since I think the other projects/internships/etc. that are on there now are more relevant to STEM
* I am interested in studying abroad for a school semester, but I am afraid that, if I pay for this internship, I won't have enough to pay for another study abroad experience
* I am seriously intimidated by the project. Like it's lowkey freaking me out
* Experience might not fit on my resume, and might not necessarily help me get a CS internship next year

**WARNING: LONG RANT/STORY AHEAD, ALSO LONG BECAUSE THIS IS ME JUST FINDING/COLLECTING MY THOUGHTS**

As background, I'm a sophomore computer science major at my current university (although I'm technically a freshman in major standing since I switched from mechanical engineering the summer after my freshman year). Back in January, I applied for ~150 internship applications through both cold-contacting companies and through online applications. Of the few that I actually heard back from, they all said no. I have decent side projects, good (albeit non-CS) past experience/internships, and a good GPA, but I assume me being a sophomore is what hurt my chances.

Not wanting to not have anything to do over the summer (since I had interned places for the two previous summers) and having a lot of interest in studying/living abroad, I thought it might be interesting to work with a college study abroad provider to find me an internship over the summer (since that's one of the things the providers offer).

So, I applied online through one of the providers' website's and eventually heard back that I was accepted into the program. I was excited, but weary that I wouldn't get placed into a computer-science related internship. I talked to one of the advisors when I applied, and she assured me that they had computer science (or at least STEM) majors work with them in the past to do internships.

Eventually, I had to talk with the placement advisor to sort out what I am interested in and what I'm not interested in. In that talk, I made it clear that I just wanted CS (programming) role. But I also mentioned that if absolutely no programming internships were available, that I might be interested in something like business development (which was a bad call at the time, imo).

Fast forward about a month or two, and I get an email from the placement advisor saying I have a provisional internship offer. As I feared, the role was not for computer science or programming, but rather to do with cryptocurrencies and scoping out the development of a new crypto currency for the company which has no experience or background with cryptocurrency. Now I mentioned in the initial talk with the advisor that I might be interested in something to do with cryptocurrency, but only in a programming role (and with the expectation that if I was going to be matched with a company that had experience with crypto so I could be mentored about what I'm doing). 

I sent the advisor an email back explaining that I wasn't really interested in the role (especially since my interest in cryptocurrency had waned since the initial meeting) and that I didn't think I would be comfortable or particularly good at the job either. Nonetheless, I agreed to interview with the company as long as I could say that I just want to do programming, since maybe they'd have another assignment for me (and that it would be me interviewing them as much as them interviewing me). I also asked that the advisor still look for placements for me in the mean time.

Well, the interview was less of an interview and more of the guy I was talking to explaining the project I would be working on. The entire conversation was set as if me interning there were a set thing. The person I talked with told me about the project and that (despite not being an NDA) said it was pretty much a company secret (the project is in total stealth mode right now) and that I couldn't disclose much to others about that I'm working on (what I've said above isn't revealing enough to break that IMO, and well I'm not under an NDA anyways). This was pretty weird to me since it didn't give me a chance to question them, and I couldn't say ""Stop! Stop! Don't tell me any secrets because I might not intern here."" for the sake of the interview (I didn't want to ruin any chances I had). I was kind of upset since I didn't get to spin the interview my way, saying that I just wanted to do programming. What they did say, however, is that as long I do enough enough research and work ahead of time (at home, before the internship) and if I worked fast enough there, that I might be able to get some programming in at the end of the internship in actually programming the cryptocurrency (it's not anything technical, it's just supposed to replace money a la bitcoin) and that they might retain me afterwards as a remote programmer. 

I sent a follow-up email to the advisor after the interview asking if she had found any other placements for me. She responded today saying that she wasn't able to find anything. So I'm torn between taking the placement or reneging on them. I've written down some pros and cons above.

If I do reneg, I'm not sure I would have any internship opportunities back home. On a whim yesterday, I applied to a few positions near my home (silicon valley thankfully) I found through LinkedIn, but I highly doubt I'll even hear back from any of them. I could also email the startup I worked for last year doing mechanical engineering work, but I'm afraid that would be kinda awkward with me contacting them so late and coming back doing different work than what I did before (even though I LOVED worked with that startup).

So yeah, I really can't decide whether or not to take this. I email the person at the company I would be working for an email asking specifically what I'd be working on in the project, so hopefully that'll help me make up my mind (I'm hoping he says that I won't be leading the project and that my work will be kinda insignificant). But I also don't want to be narrow-minded.

370,"Hi everyone,
Sorry for my english, it is not my mother tongue.
There is a guy who attends the same university as I do. I met him around 6 months ago and he has been asking me out since then. He is attractive, charismatic and funny.. These characteristics made it really difficult for me to resist him, but I somehow managed to remain rational.
So the thing is that initially he wasn’t aware that I knew that he has a girlfriend and he kept trying to flirt with me. After rejecting him multiple times, I finally decided to let him know that I know about his girlfriend and that I do not find his attempts to go out with me as appropriate. Despite all this, he continued to flirt with me and even started kissing me on my cheeks whenever he saw me. One time he kissed me slowly on my cheeks three times within like 50 seconds.
Now he has stopped trying though and he has blocked me on whatsapp. He blocked me because I left him on seen for the second time, and I guess it was unbearable for his ego. However, he keeps saying Hi to me whenever he sees me. Before he blocked me, he would always stop to talk to me whenever we bumped into each other, but now he barely says hi. I don’t understand why he is acting this way now as if I am in the wrong.
What do you guys think? Do you think that he actually perceives me as being wrong in this situation? That’s so weird.",03May2018,1

372,"Im a stay at home mother of a two year old. I don't have a job and it sucks. I feel useless. My husband makes a good amount, enough for all our bills and ability to treat ourselves. I keep our house very tidy and clean so when he gets home he doesnt need to anything. I make dinner and feed, bathe our child before he comes home. He is very restrictive when it comes to money, if I ask for a sandwhich he guilt trips me constantly. If I ask to buy something in a store he will tell me no in public and go on a guilt trip without just saying no. I dont ask for big things like diamonds or jewlery or cars, maybe its the 4 dollar ice cream. Recently i asked to pick up some bags of rocks from the home depot for our sitting area and he went off on me. I tried to explain it wasnt a lot of money and we have a jar of quarters i could pay for it with, but he still brought me on a guilt trip. I mean is my work worth nothing? I dont bring in the money and in my opinion he is way more frivolous. When i shop by myself our grocery bill is significally smaller than if he picks out the things. I have also been lent well over 10,000 from my family over the past four years. I just feel trapped, like he is totally controling, i save up the coins so i can maybe buy something for myself, but i feel like the things i do are worth something, when i bring it up he screams and yells and tells me to take care of the finances, i agree because i feel like i can totally handle that, i grew up poor on almost nothing. But when it comes down to it he criticizes my purchaces and makes me feel like i am a child. How can i handle this situation? I am not emtitled at all and i am greatful for my husband and his job, buuuuuut why can't i make small purchases for myself? ",03May2018,2

379,"I recently applied to grad school. Got into a couple I applied to, and to my delight, got onto the waitlist for my ""reach"" school.

The school I've been planning to go to (School A) is in a big city. After I got in and accepted School A, my husband starting applying for jobs nearby and recently got his dream job. Great! All is well.

Today I got accepted off the waitlist at my reach school (School B). School B isn't really that much ""better"" than School A, but it is a big fancy name-brand Ivy League school. However, it's in a small college town with no good jobs for the husband. So, either way, he'd stay in School A's big city. 

Pros of School A:
- Can continue to live with the husband (and split domestic/fur baby responsibilities)
- Already put down a deposit, told people this is where I'm going, etc.
- Being in a big city will make for easy networking, transportation, etc. (I've lived in big cities for many years and prefer them)
- It's still a really good school with the same average starting salary as School B 
- Last minute change is hard, logistics, etc.

Pros of going to School B
- Fancy Ivy League school that will help with job prospects / general perception for the rest of my career
- Could still see husband on the weekends (only 1.5 hours away) 
- Located in fairly cheap city (two small apartments in each city would cost roughly the same as one larger apartment in big city)
- Has been my dream school since undergrad 

Basically same costs either way. Biggest factor is having to live an hour and a half away from my husband, which would really really suck. But, I'd get the chance to go to an incredible school and probably get more job opportunities. It's only a two year program.

380,"My friend (let's call him ""Sokka"" to avoid saying the word ""he"" too much)'s mother forces him to study way too much, drowns him with assignments, after school activities, and he never gets any free time. Obviously this is terrible, but I wasn't going to be one of those ""Your parents suck so I'm not your friend"" kind of friends, so I meant my own business.


          Sokka was always a Nintendo fan, and we always played Splatoon together. We hung around a lot, and video games is pretty much what we connect with. But as of recent, I’ve been logging on with him only to hear his mother yelling at him in Korean and then hearing him say “I’ve got to go sorry.”

Now enter May 3, 2018. We get our test results back in Science and Social Studies. We show each other our results and I am extremely surprised to see a 70% on the corner of each paper, considerably lower than my scores. I ask him about his scores, and he tells me. 



It turns out his mom’s an idiot.


She makes him study stuff that is on the Ontario  curriculum without understanding that we live in Alberta. She thinks that the curriculum is the same regardless of where you live. He says he’s tried convincing her, but she must always be right and is the boss of him.


Now what do I do about this fucking shit? His bad grades are going to get his phone and his Nintendo Switch taken away, AND his grades are bad. Please help, I’m just trying to help my boy out.

383,"I'm looking for the cheapest wearable that has a smart alarm ie will vibrate when I'm in light sleep, but also has a few extra features.

I want to use the smart alarm feature without a phone nearby or my phone off.

It Has a substantial vibration with regards to length of time and strength of vibration.

I bought a Mii band 2 and it needs to have a phone constantly connected via Bluetooth and left unlocked. Also the normal alarm only vibrates for 10 seconds then snoozes itself. Pretty useless as an alarm.

384,"I live in Texas, and I’m going to be driving to Ontario, Canada next week to visit for the month (I’m originally from Canada).
I have a puppy that’s a little over a month old. In order for me to cross the border back into the U.S., I need to show proof of my pup’s rabies vaccination. The issue is that she is still too young for the vaccination (they have to be at least 4 months old)... and my puppy could be denied entry back into the U.S. because of this. 
Has anyone ever crossed the border with a puppy under 4 months old? There must be some way around this. I’m not inclined to leave her back home in Texas for that long, and all my friends/family in Ontario really want to meet her!

Yesterday one of my coworkers worked a really hard shift: They had to deal with a couple irate customers and they had a really difficult job that wasn't meant to be theirs handed down to them. I felt bad about them last night after I went home, so today when I saw them in the break room before I left, I told them thanks for being such a good sport, and tried to give them a $5 bill to buy a coffee or snack with. But they declined the offer, and I didn't want to be rude, so I didn't ask their reason why.

However I am still wondering, since I'm not good with social situations, did I cross some sort of line? I know some people are odd with money, but it's probably hard for me to see their viewpoint since I almost always take no-strings-attached money.

387,"I’m a 23 year old African American male. I come from a poor family. Raised by mom with a younger brother and an older sister. 

I’ve been working sense I was legally able to (age 16). After the age of 16 there has never been a period in my life where I’ve not had a job. All of my money went to help my mom pay bills.  I never complained, I like working and making money. During high school I worked 25+ hours a week and graduated number 7 in my school. 

Fast forward a few years, I have a great job making a great salary and loving what I do. Life is great except one thing, my mom is driving me crazy with her finances. She always needs money... 

I’ve spent my entire adult life helping her out in hopes that one day she would have her finances in order. It’s been 7 years and they’ve only gotten worse and don’t look like they’re going to get any better. 

My older sister has never helped her as she moved on with her own life. I took my moms financial burden as the middle child but now I am getting burnt out. I’m at the prime of my youth and I want to be able to spend my hard earned money how I want. I want to be able to save, invest and go on vacations. 

I have carried her burden for as long as I could but I simply can’t anymore. I have my own financial problems (student debt) that I need to focus on. I want to build a secure future but I can’t when at any moment my mom says she needs money for bills. 

I am thinking of cutting her off. My younger brother now has a full time job and he is able to help her.

She would assign me some tasks and I would return if to her for to check. She would scrutinize everything up to the last detail and would escalate me to our boss every time.

Now here's the dilemma. After all that ruckus, my boss is serving me a performance improvement plan. I have until tomorrow to decide. However, here are the caveats:

1. If I accept the performance improvement plan, I will still be under my co-worker's scrutiny.
2. For the next four weeks, if I don't meet her standards, I will be left with no other option but to resign.
3. This will go into my HR file. Posing a threat to my future employments.

So i go over there and i asked what happened. Apparently, they had taken Devlin's ball as a joke, and where going to give it back, but he didn't find this funny. In fact, he just got really mad and started cursing and yelling. (That's what brought me over there in the first place.) Then he shoved the kid and punched him in the arm. 
After class, i asked the coach to talk to Devlin, and see if he could work  it out. I left shortly after that, and thought that nothing really happened. At the end of the day though, another kid comes up to me and tells me that Devlin got a referral for the punch. Now, i feel like i betrayed him in telling on him.

It's been two months since I've been home, resting and starting on my medication, which hasn't been the easiest thing as my body's been adjusting to the drug, Escitalopram/Lexapro, for those curious. My mother is quite the narcissist, which is the opposite of my father, who's caring and loving; however, earlier this week I had an argument with my parents, and I'm not sure who's in the wrong. My mother came into my room yelling for an hour, talking about how I'm lazy and am no good like all the other kids, nothing out of the ordinary. My father comes back from work and hears the argument from upstairs, comes upstairs and attempts to help her simmer down, as he usually does. However, this time I told him my mother wasn't being 'sane' and that made him angry, my mother grabbed me and held me down as instructed by my father and he went on to beat me, I managed to get away from my father and gently push my mother aside to run away to the living room; both my parents chased me there and I threatened to break two vases if they were to carry on with the beating as they approach me from both my left and right side, but as they charged towards me I ended up breaking the vases and they carried on with the beating. At this point, it got pretty violent, I was blooded and bruised on my arms, stomach, knees and thighs.  I tried to get away by running down the stairs, however, my mother pulling my hair and my shirt, coupled with my father holding me down made it difficult. I've had enough, I would never hurt a women, let alone my mother, however, I pushed her aside and ended up brawling with my father and throwing him against the wall and then pushing him to the ground and cussing him out for resorting to violence. I haven't spoken a word to my father since, I've been in my room mostly for the past week and don't speak to him, nor have I seen him as he's busy with work; should I bother apologising?
