1,"I'm not sure what I should do and I could use some advice. 

I got accepted into Fall 2018/19 semester to my dream university which is in St. John's, NL Canada, and accepting this offer would be extremely beneficial to my future. That being said, my girlfriend and I (and all of our family) are in Vancouver, BC, which is over 5,000km away. 

The problem is, my girlfriend is currently 5 months pregnant, with our baby being due mid-October. We are both confused as to what the best option for us is. We are both young and have very little money (I would use student loans to pay for university). Additionally, we would be receiving some sort of child-tax benefit while we are in Vancouver (though I'm sure St. John's has something comparable) and for these reasons, my girlfriend and I are hesitant to up and leave Vancouver which has all of our friends, family, and general support. If we went to St. John's, we would have literally no friends or family there for the birth of our child.

That being said, this is an incredible opportunity that I am weary to pass up.

What do you suggest we do? Is it worth it for my future (as well as my childs) to accept the offer, or should we stay put for now until the baby is born, so I can re-apply in a later intake semester?

3,"I have 2 different groups of friends one from back in secondary and one in college. I have the same problem with both of them that when I text them to see if they're free they either don't reply or say they're busy which is fine exterior that I've seen them out with other people from those groups. So same problem in both groups is making me think that I'm the problem. 

During the year I got asked once or twice to do stuff with the group from college but it was usually last minute as in they were about to head out and I just happened to be there. 

Today is making it out more that I'm the problem which is why I'm here.  I collectively texted the group from secondary to which none replied.  Found out 3 of them that live in the next town over were out that day.  

I texted one of the guys from college to see if he was free and said he was with his girlfriend who I'm also friends with but I let them have their own time. I later found out that they had gone out to another one of our friends from that group.  

I know I am the problem here I just don't know what to do or if I did something.

Our goal was to move by October of this year but we are both concerned what it would be like to live together because he's never lived with a partner before. I have. I've also moved across the country with my ex and that didn't work out, thankfully.

We have great chemistry and I think the only thing we need to truly work on is communication but I feel like that is with most relationships. I love him so much and this is the happiest and healthiest relationship I've been in. I just need some perspective on whether we should move in together now while we live in our hometown or wait to live together when we go out to California.",29May2018,1

10,"So I'm 18, freshman girl in college, well just finished my first year. One night I was p drunk and went to smoke w a friend and a bunch of his friends. One guy seemed interested but I had to take care of my friend so I didn't react right. Two days later, he asked me to come over and we made out but nothing below the belt, he knew I was a virgin. Twice after that we hooked up and I went a little further w him but I didn't have sex w him, he said he didn't want to take advantage of me. Then another time I went over &amp; we did have sex bc neither of us were thinking too much. This was all super secret so nobody but the two of us knew. Some shit happened to where I stopped talking to him for a month\-ish but then I hit him up to hang out and we started hooking up again, only had sex like 3 times, but then summer break started. Also, sex is SO FUN

Idk I'm not like SUPER bothered by it but I do want to be friends with benefits. I think I kinda like him but it might just be because he was my first? He doesn't like me but I wish he did though, but he's definitely not interested and he's super adamant that if we hook up next semester, nobody finds out, which is cool with me, but also I wouldn't mind dating him. He's made it clear that he only wants to hook up with me BECAUSE I've told him that I don't like him. 

Super immature mindset but I do think we'd be a good couple, we have good convos and I think if he were to stop being so closed off to the idea of dating ME, he would see that. But now I won't see him until the next school year starts and all I want is to hook up with him again, but he never initiated it, he would only want to do it if I texted him asking him if I could come over. So idk, I want him to hook up with me next year but I think I annoy him by always trying? Idk man I think I do like him and I've never really liked a guy before...he doesn't reply to me but we were sexting once and it was fun, but again, he never initiates this stuff, it was all me",29May2018,1

23,"So this is a weird one. My boyfriend and I are currently in the middle of fixing a dead bedroom problem. We've been together for 4 years and the situations has been a rollercoaster since around the 1 year mark. It was bad, then it was good, then it got worse. It came down to us having a very serious talk the other night about whether or not we were compatible and that if things don't get better then we'll call it quits and separate when our lease is up in 6 months. He agreed to try and fix things so that didn't happen.

So, to show me that he really does love me and is attracted to me, we had sex that night (2 days ago). I wake up earlier than he does so I was at work long before he woke up. When I got home last night I realized that he had a massive cold sore on his lip. I asked him when he got it and he said ""It just came on today. I could feel it coming up for the past couple of days. Why?"" And I instantly started crying and screaming ""AND YOU WENT DOWN ON ME?!"" He was confused for a second until he made the connection and then complete horror filled his face.

I started crying hysterically for an hour because I have a close friend who contracted herpes from a guy who went down on her with a cold sore. In the midst of my meltdown I accused him of doing it to me on purpose. I told him that it was really sketchy that I told him we might be ending our relationship soon and then he goes down on me with a cold sore, pretty much making it difficult for me to date again if I did contract the disease.

He swore up and down that he would never do that and he was genuinely hurt that I would even come to that sort of conclusion. I admit I was really upset but a small part of me still thought it was true. After a lot of crying, researching and talking I realized that he would never do that to me but that I had hurt his feeling tremendously with that accusation. I apologized profusely but I can still see in his face that he's hurt. I'm not sure if it's from what I said or if it's guilt from the possibility of what he's done but things have been tense ever since.

There's still a small chance that I didn't contract the disease but I do have an appointment to get blood work tests done to make sure in a couple of weeks.

I want to know how to do go about making amends with my boyfriend and also how do I deal with the fact that he possibly gave me a lifelong STD?

Also, I want to clarify that I know herpes isn't an end all disease and that a massive amount of the population lives with HSV1 as well as HSV2. I also know that with modern medicine it can be treated and flare ups can become dormant for a long time. It's just something I never wanted to contract or have to deal with. Especially the stigma attached to it. I'm still sort of freaking out internally about it.

**TL;DR**: Boyfriend went down on me with a cold sore, I had a melt down fearing I had contracted herpes, I accused him of giving it to me on purpose because we talked about breaking up the night of, I hurt his feelings and I'm still freaking out, how do I make up with him but also process my feelings about the situation?",29May2018,0
24,"I just can't seem to get over my ex...I broke up with her a few days ago because there were issues with my mom. I was afraid that my mom would find out I was dating her and that I would be outed (I'm a lesbian) and that my mom would be mad that I'm dating, since she didn't know about this. When I started dating this girl she was so amazing, literally the best girlfriend I could ask for. She was beautiful and always treated me so nicely. We had so many things in common and she was such an interesting person. I'm just so upset that I had to break things off and that it was out of my control. It hurts so much to look at her social media and see that she has moved on so fast, already looking for someone new and celebrating being single. I know that we weren't in love or anything, but I thought she would have cared more but maybe she isn't really the person I thought she was. The pain seems unbearable right now, and I'm afraid I will never meet anyone like her. What makes it worse is that the lesbian dating pool is really small and its so hard to find any girls near me that are interested in other girls. Even when I do find girls, I might not be attracted to them or have anything in common with them, they might be too old, etc. The only thing that has helped me with dealing with this is listening to music.",29May2018,1
26,"I (23F) have been with my boyfriend (25M) for a little over 8 months now. I met him about a little over a year ago and we’re doing pretty well. He and I live together and we get into petty fights here and there (my fault) which he knows and I try to correct myself seeing as to how he is the only normal relationship I’ve ever had. Past toxic relationships and whatnot have ruined me in many different aspects but not in a crazy way. I’d say we’re in love, I love him and I know he loves me but it’s not as passionate as I’ve felt before in past relationships. I’m wondering if that’s normal seeing as to how I was younger and partying and just wild, along with being in up and down relationships used to the chaos. The sex with my current boyfriend is the best sex I’ve ever had and he’s amazing but I find myself questioning what we have when I ask myself “could you marry this man” and I say ehh it’s whatever. 

Today my stepdad asked, could you see yourself having kids with (boyfriends name)... and I said well... and I just paused and I honestly couldn’t get excited about having kids with him and or getting married. 

So, is it too soon to be asking myself these questions? I’m happy and I love spending my time with him and I love growing what we have. The future is what is stressing me out. Also my previous boyfriend, he passed away, it was a crazy chaotic unhealthy love but it consumed me and I felt it in my very bones when I said he was the love of my life, he wasn’t but that was 2 years ago. 

Why do I love this man but don’t feel like he’s the love of my life? I don’t want to end what we have by any means. I hope this was enough explaining. I’m thinking it’s more time is all.

Should I ask him if he thinks this is just a fun time for us and enjoy it just keep rolling with it and see 

I would love some feedback please send your advice my way.

TLDR: I love my boyfriend,  when I sit down and ask myself “is he the man for forever” I can’t answer the questions with a yes or no. Do I ask him where he sees us together in the future or leave it alone? ",29May2018,1
27,"Long story short, I have been friends with this person for about 7 years (she was my classmate in school, we were quite close), but for the past year or so I started to feel really annoyed and pissed off at her. I don't find enjoyment in our conversation anymore since she would always talk about her crushes (or some random dude whom she always thinks is trying to make a pass at her) and she's always so negative and depressed all the damn time. Now, I understand what it's like to be down in the dumps but for goodness's sake every advice I've ever thrown at her, she'd never listen. I'm annoyed that she never has anything else to talk about, not to mention other aspects of her behavior I now find intolerable. I got into college last year (she didn't) and we started to drift apart a bit, but now she would randomly text me ""I miss you"" and I just have no idea what to text back. I'd just leave the text unread and she'd start asking why am I ignoring her, to which my reply would always be ""I'm busy, sorry"". I can't bring myself to tell her the truth cuz I don't want to hurt her feelings but I also wish that she would stop texting me. Is it okay to just keep ignoring her? I don't really know what else to do though, I've been ignoring her for a few months now and quite honestly I feel liberated a bit, well until she randomly texted me out of nowhere. ",29May2018,1
28,"I don't get mad often, and most of the time, my reaction to bad events and being hurt is to cry. I can name on one hand the amount of times I've gotten angry in the past two years. I get annoyed, but it's not often and it goes away quickly. I like to think I don't hold grudges, but because of this, I'm not sure. When something happens, whether or not someone apologizes, I drop it and I don't hold onto because it's not worth the conflict. I try to block it out, and after a while the hurt goes away unless I think about it. So I don't.

I was verbally and physically abused by my mother since I was five, I'm fifteen now. She would threaten me, call me worthless, use my fears against me, bring up old incidents, and beat me, among other things. It's because of this that I cry easily, and I'm quick to forgive because I'd rather not deal with conflict in general. I'm a walking, anxious doormat most of the time, and I'm fine with it.

But when I get angry, like really, truly, angry, I hurt people. And I hate myself for it. I yell at them, I tell them to leave me alone, and while I NEVER use personal attacks or insults other than telling them to go away, if they don't leave me alone I bring up old grudges, things they did in the past to hurt me, and feel really resentful. I can't stop myself in the moment- I use those things that they did to hurt them, whether it's reminding them about it, telling them how I truly felt about it at the time, how much they hurt me, and ignore their apologies. I repeat things they've done in the past to hurt me, to make them 'feel like how I did,' in a sense. Nothing to do with physical or personal attacks, though. Insulting people based off them and hurting their self esteem, spreading rumours, hitting people etc are off the table for me, since deep down, I think I feel like that's what separates me from my mother. 

And...it's satisfying. It's sick, but it's satisfying to hurt them back. To see them pay, I guess in a way. I want to hurt them more. I feel the need to make them feel like I did at the time, so that they'd see how shitty it was.

Which horrifies me.

I'm a terrible person, and I know it, which is why I tell people to leave me alone when I'm mad. Because then I can at least calm down, and then come back calm and rational. 

I think I might have an anger issue. My younger sister has emotional issues, too based off our upbringing. While I cry easily and I'm scared of adults, authority figures and conflict, my sister throws tantrums, physically beats people, and becomes very stubborn while screaming at them is she's provoked. She also hits herself when she cries. She always had, ever since she was a kid. She's 11. 

I'm sorry. I know I'm a bad person. But I'd rather not get yelled at by strangers please. I just want to fix myself.

31,"I would go right out and message her, tell her that I'd like to take her out (it would be seen as a friend date because we've gone out way to much, and it would require me to say, like on a date) but we've seen each other for like 20 hrs a week for the past 6 months in and out of school.  Honestly, it never seemed like enough time.  There were a number of issues about me asking her out, one the two of us were in the same program, and then working on a project together for the entire semester, and also I just thought it was a bad idea at the time, because I was a bit unsure of myself.  Also, she dated so much I thought that my chances were good to go on a date, but bad in the long term so small because she wasn't that interested in a relationship.

So every single time we went out together it just seemed weird.  She'd always end up pushing to spend more time with me, but always asking very tentatively.  I understand that friends go out to dinner (and have gone out to dinner consistently with female friends in college, and at work but not like this, usually like an hr 2 hrs tops, and not as much alcohol involved) we always ended up spending 6+ hrs together, getting shitfaced... only when she's drunk does she get comfortable, but honestly she never seemed really at ease with anyone despite being confident.

Then she started inviting me to dinner with her partners, all three of them, and they all seemed to know who I was though I never had met them before.  They all seem to know that I sorta like her and aren't offended by it, one time I stopped by to drop something off and they said that's all your're dropping by for, you could stay.  It just all feels really weird.  I'm flattered that she includes me as much as she has, but I'm worried that I might get jealous.

And I just don't know how to say that I like you as more than a friend.  Honestly, I've been so busy that I sorta pushed my feelings to the side to deal with so many other things.  I think that going to Grad school full-time and working full time + other side jobs sorta just never gave me enough time to think (Action is the enemy of thought).  Even though I've always liked her, and have always been attracted to her, but I've been attracted to other friends of mine, but it always passed.

TL;DR:I feel like I'm in a weird place with my friend and don't really know where to take it.  The dynamic and my place in her life was getting weird. I still felt important but like I was being crow-bared in because she doesn't want to lose me, I don't want to lose her, but even though I feel more objective right now, I know I feel elated the moment I see her.  Should I just talk to her, ""For the past several months I've really enjoyed spending time with you, it never felt appropriate to say anything, but its hard for me to see you as just a friend because I've found myself thinking about you so much.

33,"Hey I'm a sophomore at a high school in California. I've started off my high school career well with a 4.11 overall weighted GPA \(I took AP Chem and AP European history this year\). Since most universities in California really focus on sophomore and junior year, I really wanted to challenge myself next year.

So my class was the first to fully have the ""integrated math courses"" \(Math 1,2,3 etc..\) while previous had opportunities like Algebra 2 and what not. I'm currently in Math 2 since I'm a sophomore and it's really easy for me. Instead of doing Math 3 Pre\-Calc next year, I really want to skip the course and go straight to AP Statistics and take AP Calculus the year after. Of course, this would result in me doing an additional pre\-calculus course in the summer or online during the school year.

If I go straight to AP Stats, I'd be able to have the GPA boost that colleges would be able to see. I also enjoy math a lot and being able to challenge myself would be very fun. I'd also be able to surround myself with a more competitive environment. The downsides are: I was planning to take a precalculus course this summer or next summer at our local community college since I want to take AP Calculus senior year. The problem is that the classes are not guaranteed and could be interfering with scheduling so if it doesn't work out, I'd be forced to take Math 3C \(a junior\-level class\) in senior year. Another con is that I believe the SAT and ACT heavily revolve around precalculus and with me skipping it to AP stats would make it harder on me.

Another option is that I \*could\* drop one of my classes and take Math 3c alongside with AP Stats, but I really don't know which class to drop. As I really want to keep Spanish 3 for personal reasons. My schedule has to follow the A\-G requirements for college.

Her negativity about all this and any minor inconveniences was SO exhausting to me. I used to be similar, but I’ve worked really hard to take on a stoic mindset in the last few years because it really serves no purpose. 

Basically, I am pretty upset with her at the moment. I made it the whole time without snapping at her, but I don’t know what I want to do now. It’ll probably be at least 6 mo until I see her again, so it’s not pressing to make a decision, but it’s just pretty upsetting to me still.",29May2018,1

37,"Hi.

Aproximately one year ago I started uploading vectors and photos to Shutterstock. Mostly vectors though (like 90% I'd say), I didn't sell any photo anyway.

I've earned ~u$s20 dollars in this time. 

So that gives 20 dollars/year having 60 pictures (which is crappy but only 60 pictures).

Is it worth it to continue making vectors, say, make 2 vectors a day or is it a lost case?

What would you do?

39,"Clarification: I'm not in America; I'm in Japan. I am also not an assistant language teacher, but an actual teacher with a provisional Japanese teaching license.

I've been a teacher for nearly 11 years and have degrees in English literature and creative writing. I used to be very passionate about teaching, and threw everything I had into it.
Somewhere along the way, I became tired. I look at my weekly schedule with dread, testing periods with disdain, and administration with exasperation. I am utterly burnt out, and I feel like my lack of any kind of enthusiasm is bleeding into my work.

I am originally from the States, and I could go back... were I not married to a Japanese citizen. I also have three cats. My wife also cannot work right now due to a mental condition. This would make going to America even less of an option because of the staggeringly high cost of health care in America.

Lately, the things I have been far more interested have been database-related work. I love automating things in Excel, and have lately been getting into MySQL. Looking at options, though, jobs seem to want a minimum of three years of MySQL experience. Right now, I'm so exhausted that waiting three years seems like a tall order.

44,"So here’s the background on our relationship. We’re both 2 girls, same age (20, if that makes a difference.) We became friends purely out of circumstance, but I really only realized this later on. We’ll call my friend “S.” S’s mother was a babysitter, and she began babysitting me when I was around 6. I was at this woman’s house 4-5 times a week, so me and S naturally became friends. We were inseparable all through elementary school. Then, I moved out of my hometown when I was 14, and our friendship began to grow apart, as we lived an hour away from each other. I made new friends and essentially “grew up,” while she remained the same. I have recently moved back to my hometown, and spending time with her has been painful and is draining me. She has become extremely judgmental of my lifestyle, and is very condescending. I absolutely dread spending time with her. I’ve wanted to cut this friendship off for a while, but I have no idea how. I feel terrible, because her family is so kind (even though they are judgemental as well). How does one go about cutting off someone they’ve known for 12+ years? ",29May2018,1

After i had answered very joyessly, as i could then wish her a happy birthday, i heard that she was suppressively crying. It was a very awkward interaction involving her basically telling me off. I feel extremely bad about this situation, however it is a common occurence for my parents to make me feel guilty. I have a present for her and was planning on giving this when i returned home along with the card (this has been done every year i have been at uni for every family member as postage is very expensive).

The hardest part is that she still reaches out to me, feeling guilty for putting me into this situation since she instigated the fight by pulling a knife first. My testimony was thrown out because I was drinking, so that screwed me over..

I moved away from my hometown, I am unable to return due to the memories and fear of running into her- worse with another companion. She put me in debt, got me in trouble for the first time, stabbed me in the face, yet lost the case by taking a plea.

49,"This is a throw away for obvious reasons.

For some background; my sister and I are both in high school living with our parents. My sisters at the age where my parents can’t really effectively punish her anymore or she’ll just drive away or something. 

We are a lower middle class family we have money to treat our selves every now and then but not a lot. My mom busts her ass working three jobs to pay for us to go to private schools. My sister mostly hangs around rich kids in her school and as a result is now fairly spoiled. 

Recently she spent a shit load of money that was not hers to spend to “maintain her life style”. She also works a jobs so she’s been spending $400 a week so she can pretend she is rich.

NOW FOR THE THING. 
My sister and I have always been really close and she tells me most things and I’m dedicated to not being a snitch. I hate snitches. 

But the other day she asked to borrow $30 I asked “what the fuck for?” She told me her and a friend where going to start flipping OZ ‘s of weed and she was going to quit her job. I hesitated but ended up giving her the money as long as she paid me back $50.

Now this was fine and I just ignored this until earlier today when on the ride back from a Memorial Day BBQ with all of my mom, my step dad, my sister and, I in the car a huge fight broke out  regarding to money she spent without permission and how spoiled she is, and I realized how fucked my sister is. 

I’m now thinking I might need to tell my parents this for her sake. She’s got a year till she graduates and I don’t know what damage can be repaired by then.

I’ve had the best moments with her as I wished that she would never be replaced with someone else because she’s just perfect. Currently I’m in my second year of college and she’s with me since we both decided to go to the same university. 

A few days ago I took her on a date &amp; celebrated about our test we aced about Calculus II which is a pretty difficult subject and needed some sorta celebration tbh. We had steak, deep conversations, laughed, all that good stuff. Then we’d had enough and finally it was time to head home.

That time around she was the one driving and once we reached my house, before I’d leave the car, she would for the first time in forever bend over and give me such a hearty kiss, which surprised me. I’ve never really thought about having physical affections with her because honestly I would just think of her as my best friend and save all of that for later when we graduate and hopefully get married if I’m still with her.

She told me that she wanted to stay with me a bit, I didn’t see where this was going so I invited her in my house. Nobody was home at the time. I asked what would she wanna do, like watch a movie or something. She was just staring deeply into me and got closer and said that she loved me so much in a whispering tone. Then I think I knew that she might wanna have sex. She really did after some talk. And I didn’t see a problem with that

I took her upstairs to my room and then got really touchy and shit, stripping down till our underwear. I thought of pleasing her first so I decided to give her head. As I pulled down her BOXER BRIEFS, which I didn’t question because it wasn’t the time, an erect fucking penis slapped my forehead. I froze like a mannequin for 10 minutes mindlessly looking around. I calmly told her to dress up, pack her things and leave as I was holding back my tears so fucking hard. She told me that she didn’t understand but that’s when she made me scream my lungs out telling her to leave.

All these years I’ve been dating a god knows what fucking creature that is. I’ve never been more depressed in my life than right now. I don’t know what to do. Please.

59,"Hello guys,

Does anyone else ever find themselves replaying memories of a time where they feel they should have acted differently?

Today I have been thinking of this one time where a guy pushed me at a club. I turned around and he was a ripped dude. He pointed to a small girl that I assume he was courting in some fashion (as if to say ""she did it""). She was laughing. I was about 25 at the time, with my wife and some friends (I'm a man btw). No one else noticed, and I just turned back around.

What keeps bugging me is that I did not stand up for myself. I am kinda skinny but tall, but I definitely would have lost a fight with this guy if I started one. I have no fighting experience. I want to say that some logical part of me said ""don't worry about it, it's not worth it"", but in reality I was afraid. I am ashamed to say it, and this happened like two other times over the course of my life in different forms (and I wish I had stuck up for myself).

In the scheme of things, there are only really three times in my life this has happened, and I know they are insignificant, but sometimes I go to this strange place in my head and replay them thinking ""coward"".

Normally I just channel it into some form of excersise like a run or lifting weights and then it goes away, but  i wanted to hear if anyone else has experienced this and how they deal with it when it happens.

They would secretly make  plans and not tell me and that's the shittiest feeling ever man, its  tearing me up emotionally but I'm trying not to show it. Today we had  plans to go play basketball. My friend picked me up on the way, and his  girlfriend called and he put her on speaker and she asked, “Who’s all  going to the cottage trip?” My friend instantly paused, \(since he didn’t  invite me, and previously I’ve been invited to every trip\) and then he  said, “Us six, but I haven't asked R\(me\) yet..."" It’s obvious this was  another trip that they had planned but didn’t have intentions of  inviting me. What do I do at this point? Do I confront them, do I leave  it alone? ",29May2018,2
75,"If this is the wrong sub please point me in the right direction, I’m sort of new to this whole thing. 

TL;DR AT BOTTOM

Backstory kept to a minimum- 
Been with this guy for 4 years, started dating in high school, we now go to the same college. We did distance for a year while he went to a different college freshman year but sophomore year he ended up transferring to my school (I’m not the only reason he transferred but I’m sure it helped- better school overall, his twin brother went here, and a lot of his friends) 

Things were great for the first 3.5ish years. As most couples do, we had maybe one or two major fights where I thought it would be over. We came out stronger and better, and going into college we weren’t worried about being apart. No trust issues, no cheating, nothing overprotective or controlling on either end. We communicated well and even though we were physically far apart, I thought our relationship was stronger and better than it had ever been.

Then he came to my school and things were great. Except there were times when we would get into small fights about basically nothing. They’d last a day and then we’d be fine. But then small things started turning into big things, and some secrets came out. 

My boyfriend told me he has body dysmorphia, as well as some signs of depression. He has hard days, but I do my best to support him. He comes from a very wealthy family, never wants for anything (not saying that he can’t be depressed, just setting up some context for this next bit) his family has the resources to send him to therapy, but he doesn’t want to tell his family about what he struggles with because his family doesn’t believe in mental illness and won’t get him help anyways. 

Current situation-

I’ve always had a little bit more of a sex drive than him. I’ve always initiated (always asked for consent, etc.) been more hands on, given lots of compliments and affection. I feel like he has always struggled with reciprocating this, could it stem from body dysmorphia and depression? Lately he has even gone as far as to say that he is “too tired” to see me when he gets home from work (he gets home around mid day, plenty of time for us to see each other even to go to lunch or dinner) his older sister and other family members have even made comments about how little he sees me or spends time with me. 

I guess my main question here- can/should I contribute his lower sex drive and not wanting to see me as much to his mental illness or not? Is there anything I can do other than support him through this? Or should I be seeking help for him? 

TL;DR- 

My boyfriend doesn’t get physical with me very often, makes excuses not to see me most days, but struggles with body dysmorphia and depression. What do I do?

77,"So, my best friend (we're both in high school) isn't eating and hurting herself because she says she deserves it. We both have depression and anxiety and are very close with each other. She has planned her suicide and has thought deeply about going through with it.

I have never met her mother but I have her phone number. I just want to let her mom know before anything really bad happens to her. My best friend will probably be furious with me and probably won't talk to me again but I don't care, I want my friend to be well and I want her to live.

My question is, how do I let her mother know? I would rather do on a text message so my voice can't be identified.",29May2018,2
78,"So long story short this question is actually concerning two people- my husband and his young brother. I will start with the brother as this seems more urgent.

1) Younger brother was 3 (yes THREE) weeks away from graduating high school but he stopped going and did not graduate. Apparently, he has been dealing with some mental health issues (depression, anxiety, etc) and stopped taking his medicine. Right now he isn't working or anything due to these issues but he has started back on his medicine. When he feels he is in a good place and ready to get his life back on track, what are some options for him to get his diploma or GED? We are trying to get him to understand while college is not the answer for everyone, he at least needs to learn a trade as waiting tables don't pay the bills your whole life. And he is smart. His one time taking the ACT he got a 26 with no studying and staying up the whole night before. In order to get into a community college or trade school, he would at least need his GED. What kind of programs are out there for kids fresh from high school to get their diploma or GED?

2) My husband makes decent money (about 5k a month bring home) but has to work away from home. He didn't get past the 7th grade. He blames it on bad teachers/school culture but I know it is from having a bad home life and the people raising him feeling guilty. No one in his family has graduated from high school, much less college. Anyways, we lie on his resume and say he graduated Hs 18 years after his birth year. He hasn't had a ton of jobs and the ones he has had he knew people who got him on so background checks haven't really been a big deal. But he is tired of working off and looking to apply to a LARGE company in about a year or so where he can be home every night. Now I know they are going to do a background check and I feel this urgency to make sure we have his HS diploma/ GED box checked off. I also wonder about if he ever wanted to attend school as he would need that to attend. In his case, are there **legit** online programs that offer diplomas/GED? I have looked at places like Penn foster and just don't know anyone who has done these or how legit they are. 

I do want to state I understand they have to have the motivation to succeed. I am trying to find information to help and present to them so they know there are options and choices!",29May2018,1
79,"So, I’m probably going to delete this post after Tuesday, and I don’t want a horde of people telling me I’m suicidal and need to get help, only a few is fine. I also wouldn’t be surprised if the mods remove this because it’s weird.

I live in a Christian household and the only religion I respect is Judaism because it doesn’t care about your religion. I was always a nice, rule abiding, shy child. Even till now. But recently, my oldest sister has begun to cuss a lot, which isn’t allowed, and nobody would care. At first my dad would give her a warning and my mom too, but soon my mom wouldn’t care, and my dad slowly began to follow. She began to go to her friends a lot ( something I don’t have many of ), and they were and probably are still a bad influence on her. A few years ago, I had an emotional break down after she had become uncaring toward my pains and would hurt me ( She isn’t abusive ), and nobody would care, not even my parents. I then would never tell my parents that I was sick and would be a walking corpse, I eat less and tried to be as thin as possible because it seemed nobody cared about me or my troubles. Fast forward, another break down occurs after she begins to become extremely insensitive towards me ( I’m very very very physically weak ) and she closed a door on my head after repetitively kicking me, after my younger sister took my phone into her room.

So, I have made up my mind, I want to make up a “cult” and begin cutting myself to collect jars of blood over the course of the year ( I’m not stupid and I won’t cut myself to the point of bleeding out ). This idea came to me after I ran outside with a kitchen knife and tried to slit my wrist ( mostly my arm ). Luckily the blade was dull and I’m a wimp with emotional conflicts.

Here’s what I’m asking, how do y’all suppose I keep small amounts of blood from drying out over the course of days without cutting myself to the point it’s noticeable. We have a lot of cats, and a mean one too so...

80,"I’ve been dating this guy for around 2 months now. At first I thought it would just be a casual relationship, so I mostly hid the fact that I struggle a lot with suicide ideation. But now I feel like I could see this more long-term, so I’d like to be honest about who I am.

The only problem is his last girlfriend was suicidal and actually tried to kill herself 2x in front of him and sent him self-harm pictures, etc. So around when we first started dating, I mentioned that I always thought I would die by suicide (for context, we were doing the NYT questions to fall in love thing), and he literally burst into tears and was crying silently for 20 minutes while I babbled apologies. I subsequently completely backtracked on what I said, qualified that it wasn’t serious, it was something I used to think, I’m fine now, etc.

But I still kind of really think I’m destined to kill myself. I don’t self-harm and I’m not depressed (tbh idk what my damage is lol). In any case, I want to get better lately and it just bothers me that I can’t be honest with him. Honestly I have other close friends who can support me emotionally, so it’s not that I need someone to confide in/depend on, but I’m just uncomfortable with how I feel like I’m lying about myself. Yet I feel terrible burdening him with the information. I really don’t want to put him through anything remotely similar to what he experienced with his ex because it hurt him so much. I feel like telling him about my problems would be very selfish of me.

Any perspectives? Thanks for reading.",29May2018,1
82,"In 1995 i went overseas for 2 years. I left behind an awful relationship, i was just out of college. Well, the two years abroad was awful in many ways. I was under contract to teach English in Japan. I was placed in a really small town where there was a LOT of alcoholism, drinking after work...anyway it was awful in so many ways. I was extremely lonely. I started drinking due to pressure of prople around me, even though much of my childhood was spent watching my alcoholic father abuse my family. I started exhibiting signs of depression and anxiety and had panic attacks. 

FF to 2018, i came back in 1997. Wow i learned a LOT of Japanese there that i still remember, i genuinely love Japanese and the culture and genuinely miss it. But everytime i see a pic of my former town i have this inner twinge or flinch. 'So glad i'm not there anymore...' i mutter to myself. I truly cannot help it. A shudder of helpless ...rage or pain or anguish flows through me and i clench inwardly and start muttering to myself about how much i hated it there. 

And the weirdest thing is? I want to visit. I want to speak Japanese. I crave Japanese foods and the writing and all kinds of things. But some of the things i went through there - getting over my ex was a huge part of it, and being trapped alongside all the destructive drinking and being a participant in it myself, was another - i don't think i'll ever get over it. I don't think it'll ever leave me alone, it will never stop haunting me, i'll never forget how painful those two years were. Like pain was eating me alive and i couldn't do anything about it except succumb. 

Thanks for listening. I am on medication to control my depression and feel 100% better. I am married and was over my ex a long time ago. I no longer have anxiety attacks. I rarely drink. But it seems some things never leave you in peace.

So that girl is really getting really close to me. I feel good about it and I enjoy her company, but just yesterday she told me about this other guy. It’s not that he’s a problem, I just felt like she could’ve told me earlier. 
Apparently last year her aunt’s good friend’s son met her. The first time they met he put his hand on her shoulder while he said hi. Ok, weird. But worse, the next time they met he told her he had a crush on her. That’s so weird. They’d met twice and he already likes her? Ok. At least she simply said “ok”. 
I mean, she knows how this works and she’s not going to simply start getting close to him because the way he tried to make friends with her is so weird.

87,"Hello guys. Today, something really weird happened to me. Was using a dating app. Suddenly, a girl matched with me. I asked her why she liked my profile. She said she thought I was cute and that I ""honestly think I have a nice body and a big [insert word]"" I told her that I did not believe I had said things. She said ""will u show me tho"". She asked me to send her nudes. I, being a rational human being, said no, because it is inherently dangerous and stupid to send a stranger nudes. This kind of behaviour coming from a girl is really weird, don't you guys think?  Do you think she tried to do something fishy here? She said ""then do you wanna trade?"" and I was just about to type ""I appreciate that you find me attractive and also your kindness. I think you are cute aswell but I am not comfortable with sending nudes"". But first I typed ""Well..."" and at this point I wanted to get the hell out of the dating app, it was just too weird for me. I value my privacy. So I was just simply going to leave and not even tell her what I was gonna say. 

So as I was about to delete my account she sends me her nudes and says ""your turn"". I really think this is wrong. I have decided to simply go and delete the image from my phone. I wouldn't want a stranger out there to have my nudes, wouldn't I? So I believe I did the right thing. Hope this girl doesn't try to do this anymore with some stranger again.

88,"How I stop living in the past?

My heart aches when I think about the past. The days when I use to play in the streets, with my sister and friends, The days back in primary where all I thought about was playing in the playgrounds or Runescape back then, or in high school where My friends and I have our laughter and joy. The days before I grew up.

Now that I'm in university, I feel so burdened to grow up. 2 More years, get a career/job earn a living. My mind just wants to crawl back into the past and I tear up just thinking about how life was great, how it was simple back then.

How do I stay in the present and stop thinking about something that I can never go back to? How do I move on? I want peace in my heart and mind. Right now im so torn. I can definitely tell something's wrong because when I listen to old music like Queen / Beatles / Guns n Roses / Red hot chilli / MJ my heart just aches.

89,"Title basically says what the situation is. My current employer has been okay to me. However, I know I have only managed to keep my head down when it hits the fan. My complaints are:

The COO is a total asshole. He does nothing but shit on everyone below him. No exaggeration, every single person who is not an executive has no idea how he has his job. He has an art degree, is in his 4th year of online MBA school, and is COO of an engineering firm. He openly brags about his personal tax fraud and is has told the CEO to ""fuck off"" by yelling across the office. He has regularly to bitch to my team about things other teams have done wrong like their mistakes are our fault. I had to fix a 6 figure fuckup from another office last week. Instead of a thank you or good job I got scolded because processes that were set up before me, that I do not have the power to fix, and have warned them were extremely susceptible to failure, failed as I warned it eventually would.

They fired a good friend and mentor of mine because an executive needed someone to blame for missing a dead line. It took him several months to find new employment because of the blemish on his experience and sent him into a depression. All while saying ""We are always looking to hire! We can't find enough people to fill our positions!""

The fired one of our most senior employees a few week ago for the same reason. Same executive. I found out the executive told her to ""Pack your shit and get the fuck out. You're done here."" This is after having years of exemplary performance reviews \(information I have access to\) from her former boss. She didn't last 1 month under the executive.

My current boss is a great guy. I actually took my current job, despite having a better offer, just to get experience under him. He is not at work half the time for medical reasons, he's too drunk to work, or his psychotic girlfriend \(she went to prison for stabbing someone\) won't let him leave the house.

Obviously, I am going to take the job offer from my new employer. My work is at a point where I can leave and it would be the least disruptive it could possibly be if I leave with no notice. My current boss has been gone for 3 weeks now. I planned on writing him a letter and thanking him for the experience I gained under his leadership. I don't think my abrupt departure would impact him because he won't be back for a few more weeks. He is the only reference at this company I would want to list anyway. The only people I would piss off are the executives, none of which I give two shits about. My only concern is that down the road a potential new employer would call my old company and, God forbid, COO picks up the phone and blasts me, which it's entirely possible he will do anyway. I will likely take half of the company's work from their largest client.

What do you guys think? Is this $3.5k worth giving no notice for?",29May2018,1
90,"First I'm not suicidal but my life would be changed massively for the better if I knew why people want to attack or punish me for just existing. Let me give a few examples:

-A cop pulls me over for speeding pulls out his gun on me threatens to arrest me for not showing my license and threatens to shoot me for ""reaching"" for a weapon, when I was getting my licenses. This has happened to me 3 different times.

-going to a work interview and the HR director threatens to call the cops on me for waiting for him in the waiting room.

-Having someone steal money from me, then getting arrested for domestic violence after the cops admit that the girl stole from me. She got off clean.

these are the extreme examples but not the only. Usually i get fired because i cant play the office politics game. I cant keep going from low end job to low end job the rest of my life I need to have a place i can work my way up.

113,"I met this guy through a mutual friend. I met him at a party of hers. One day, I’d randomly added him on snap, and thought his stories were hilarious so I’d start commenting. 

Eventually, we got to talking more and more and we found that we had a lot in common. Like it felt like I was at home. We found that we have similar ways of thinking, a similar sense of humor, and similar view points on life. The feeling was very warm and familiar. We kept talking and the more I talked to him, the more I felt like an attachment was growing. One day he confessed he liked me, to which I was of course elated. 

But a new fear was kind of embedded. As we talk more and grow closer, I can feel myself feeling more fond of him every day. Not just how he looks, but just him. And I realized that this is the kind of person I would always want to have in my life. One day he took the words out of my mouth and expressed that he was scared because he felt that our growing attachement was a deep one.  I just can’t help but feel like I’m going to get hurt. How do I know if I even am falling in love anyway? This whole thing is very scary for me and i don’t know if I’m processing it correctly. Someone please shed some clarity on this.

114,"Hello Reddit.

I'm a 24 year old male living in Ontario, Canada. I've always battled with bouts of depression and apathy throughout my life, and about a year ago was diagnosed with primarily inattentive ADHD (long time coming kind of thing).

I carried out an undergraduate degree in chemistry and graduated in 2015 with the highest academic standing and many awards. I have always been pretty paper smart, although the practical stuff had always been a struggle for me  (consistent focus). I did my honours project with a supervisor that was able to send me to San Francisco for a summer to work in pharma and get some real experience, and I came back and started graduate school afterwards. 

Throughout my tenure I struggled with productivity and motivation on my research project. Eventually a combination of personal difficulty and a great weight of poor performance in my professional life (self inflicted, my boss was incredibly supportive), I took a leave of absence to gather myself where I only worked at a restaurant for 4 months. After I returned, I never really got into much of a groove and it didn't take very long to become consumed by depression. Eventually I just stopped showing up and lying in bed most of the day, eating delivery junk food, etc. I only got one email from my boss simply asking if I was coming back as I was still on pay roll. Another professor in the program had reached out to me as well.

It's been 8 months now 
and I've not said anything. A close friend of mine opened a restaurant/bar and I just work there right now, the money is good but I drink too much and it's not a career for me. I want to apologize to my prof but I just don't even really know what to say, and I just avoid it. I suppose I wanted to say something when I figured my shit out and get him a nice bottle of wine and let him know I'm doing alright, but I'm still pretty far away from figuring out anything. He was a really great and supportive boss and I try to avoid it, but I have a great deal of shame and regret and guilt thinking about the whole situation.

If anybody could help me with any sort of advice on just how to move forward and remedy thing as best as possible, id appreciate it. 

Thanks in advance.",29May2018,1
115,"Hi, I‘m 17 years old and live in Germany. I smoked weed for the first time 2 years ago and have been smoking daily for half a year now. Lately I started really focusing on being the best version of me by eating healthy, doing sports and improving in school (im not a A student now but at least I study a bit which I almost never did  before). I really feel like weed is helped me with all that and has also improved my mindset (being more positiv, seeing things clearer/different perspective, loving me and other people more) but I still have doubts that smoking weed could be bad for me especially because I‘m so young. I have a good long term memory but I noticed that my Short term memory was getting a little worse. I‘m currently on vacation and haven‘t smoked for 1 1/2 weeks now but don‘t feel like I‘m addicted becase I dont feel the need to smoke physicaly and bodily even though I didn‘t do a break since February.

116,"So, haven't seen a buddy and his lady for a while, last time I saw them they were pretty heavyset (id guess 230+) Saw them today and they must've lost a solid 40 pounds each. Found out they've been using Herbalife which immediately stuck out in my mind. I'd heard about the pyramid scheme stuff around the company. If they were just buying the product I'd shrug and say wow it actually is working for them. Found out they've also started selling for them too. 
I kept my composure and didn't say anything today cause I need to start doing my research and figuring this whole thing out, but I'm concerned. I imagine going about this wrong not only ruins the friendship but could stubbornly force them further down the road financially and I flat out don't want that. They were also morbidly obese last time I met them so frankly I also wonder if I should step in since they actually seem better than ever and i wouldn't want them to fuck up their health improvements. 
I know it's a lot but i can't talk about this with mutuals cause last thing I need is them knowing before I got my facts in order. And again I have zero expertise on how to approach this.

118,"Truthfully I don't think I did anything wrong in this situation but I just want to make sure I'm not being creepy. I was snapping on snapchat back and forth with a friend from university I haven't seen in 4 years. We were kind of close before and we'd open up with each other alot but it's platonic. She told me she had a tinder date last weekend and I mentioned I was doing my own human tinder where I was walking around and meeting girls. Then yesterday I came across an article on Facebook where they discussed a tinder experiment where a guy posed as a male fitness model and would send girls sexual messages and within 2-3 texts, girls gave him their number. I jokingly texted her the link and asked ""Is that you?"". She responded just now saying that makes her uncomfortable and doesn't happen easily.

I feel terrible and like I should apologize saying I didn't mean to offend her and I didn't actually think she'd be easy, it was meant as a joke. I'd hope she'd understand that and not cast judgement. I mean we've talked enough that I'd hope she wouldn't feel awkward about it. It's just I respect her alot and I was hoping to catch up with her alot now she's moved back to the city. Plus we've been trying to have dinner with some friends but it keeps getting postponed due to busy schedules with finance exams for all of us and now I may have ruined it with that text.

I could be over analyzing but keep in mind I feel this way because despite being seen as a social, friendly guy I've never really been on a date and am a virgin at 27 years old. I tried to make a change over the past 2/3 years to become more daring and have gone out and asked girls on dates and received positive reactions but either I'm told they have boyfriends or I'm given their number and we exchange texts but they flake when I ask them out and eventually don't respond plus I don't bother chasing girls since I don't want to spam them with texts. I've flirted for fun with coworkers and they've flirted back so I never felt like I made anyone feel uncomfortable.

Honestly it felt good just have a girl who I see as a friend and when she mentioned how I have alot of guts to go up and approach girls, I figured maybe we could reconnect and I could wingman her. I guess I'd like the feeling of helping as I've always been like that in school and stuff. I know in the past she's always said I'm a really nice guy and after graduating, I did send her a message telling her how much I respect her personality and how she accepts and treats others and she really enjoyed it. I just hope that this isn't that big a deal and she doesn't forget all that because again it's been 4 years and we can maybe hang out again. Although I'm probably iffy on just hanging out alone with her since I don't want to make her feel uncomfortable.

So am I right in just apologizing and letting her know my honest intentions of that joke? I mean we've argued before but never where I've felt sleazy/creepy. I figured after that I can just try and suggest a date for all of us to meet to change topics or just ask how her dog is.",29May2018,2

126,"TL;DR: I want to know how to unlink a TV from the YouTube mobile app so I don't ever see the notification to continue watching on a TV ever again.

So I'm watching videos late at night, as one does. I was taking a dump as I was watching a video on my mobile device, as one does. Then I stop the video to wipe, as one does. After finishing up, washing my hands, and leaving I see that the phone said ""Continue watching"". I thought that was a neat feature they added but as I tapped I read ""Continue watching on 'Master Bedroom TV"".

By the way

Squad is a military simulator similar to Arma 3 but there are differences. In the game they have mortars. These things are loud and scary. When they are falling right next to you, in real life you kinda gotta yell to say anything audible in game. One particular video's title is name ""US SUBERFOB UNDER HEAVY MORTAR FIRE"". The video's author is Karmakut, who is known for yelling no matter what happens.

Anyways

As I tapped this button, I audibly yell ""NO!"" and then I hear my parents wake up with a not so pleasant jolt as the TV in their room starts playing a video with heavy mortar fire. I have never ran into my room as quiet or as fast in my life.

How do I prevent this from happening? I unlinked the TV in the ""Watch with TV"" section in the settings but how do I make it so the notification doesn't ever pop up again and can I make my device forget the TV all together like you can with WiFi?

128," Good night /r/Advice. I'm pretty depressed, anxious and a lot of bad things that sucks. Lonely as f*ck, yada yada yada. But besides that, this night i bring one of my conflicts that i can't pick one choice easily. My future. Next year i will be graduating at foreign trade college, but this fact really doesn't matter at all, i'm doing it not for life, but for some professional basis, and it's okay, totally off tread. Well, but before i join this college i tried for 2 years entrance exams for history college, failing miserably (i live in Brazil, where you can only join public university by entrance exams). So i kicked it off and decided to dedicated my life to music. Music is my true love. Is where i feel embraced, removed from the world many problems and i can express myself truly. I joined a music school that USED (emphasis here) to have a good reputation and music college through distance education. I was wenting well on the music school for almost 2 years, but i was beginning to feel that the reputation the school owned was buried and long forgotten, making me consider the investment that i was doing (IT WAS F'ING EXPENSIVE BTW) and where i could reach with that degree. Well, i got the fuck out. It was the smartest choice... not the happiest... but the smartest. And this leaves me where i am today. Getting my foreign trade degree i don't know where to proceed. If if seek my academic interests in history and social science or if i seek being a professional musician again. Clearing both choices: i have true interest in human sciences like history, sociology and psychology; and for me deepening in this studies is something beyond personal achievement (as in the case of music). I'm nonconformist and restless with how the world actually is, and studying history in particular is the best way for understanding how bad scenarios that we have today happens and with social sciences what we should be doing to avoid making the same mistakes, as well with the help of psychology. These are mine INTERESTS and i would be happy studying it on a university. For certain, there is a level of personal gratification on dedicating part of my life to one of these sciences, but definitely not as much as it is with music. Music really embraces me. I grew up as the ugly duckling, never being part of my city, never being part of my school, don't getting along with the other kids, until heavy metal music finds me. Trying again dedicating my life to be a professional musician, specially in my genre, takes a lot of time. A lot of practicing. A lot of contacts. A lot of struggles. A lot of LUCK. It's ruthless, but it's a bigger dream than pursuing an academic future. Conciliate the both things? I'm afraid not. Not at the same time at least. I'm getting a technologist degree and i'm already without time to practicing my instrument, now imagine joining a public university... Yes, i could still be playing, but not in the same seriousness level, doing it just for fun. So... should i try to seek my dream again? Should i still try university after that? 
 Thank anyone reading it in advance. Any alternative advice will be welcomed. And sorry for my bad english (by praxe).

 *my aspirations as a musician aren't that impossible, i never dreamed on being a popstar... actually recognition in the genre i like (specifically DEATH METAL... shout-out to any metalhead reading it) is not a great deal, but even joining the professional environment for a brazilian boy is harder. The metal scene i desire to join is hailing from the US and from Europe. So...

I was depressed, scared, suicidal, anxious, and I stopped sleeping until absolutely necessary. My counselor told me that it was possibly the worst case of emotional abuse he's ever seen.

Although my dad and his wife are nowhere near as bad, my step mom hits a lot of the same beats. She points out everything we do wrong, she invalidates our arguments and shuts us down even if we're trying to say something. I often find myself unable to speak at all around her. She always brings up things we've done wrong in the past but nobody can bring up her flaws, and when she does it it's ""out of love"". She'll tell my sister that she has to love her, but doesn't have to like her, and then complains when my sister doesn't want to be around her. That and she tries to validate everything she does by twisting the Bible and shoving her religion onto us.

But today is the boiling point. Today she proved to me that she'll go the extra mile to humiliate us. She told me after I went on a bike ride to put the bike by the shed. My sister and I have always put the bike behind the house for years, and that's where it was when I got it today. My stepmom had shown that she doesn't care about the bikes because she didn't even know we had a working one, so I thought that she just didn't know where they went, so I put it back behind the house, where I had got it. Like an hour later she comes into my room telling me that I can't follow directions for shit and I won't be able to hold down a job because I refuse to listen to directions. I tried to tell her my logical reasoning for putting the bike where I did but she wouldn't listen. She just kept telling me that I was wrong over and over. I felt so dumb even though I knew she was overreacting.

An entire hour later she tells me there's a turtle by the shed. I was so fucking pumped to see a turtle, and when I got out there I saw no turtle. She then calls out the house ""Oh, I lied. The turtle is up front, I just wanted to make sure you knew where the shed was."" She always does stuff like this over nothing because she wants to make us look stupid. She wants to get a good laugh over and over when somebody makes a mistake, no matter how small.

137,"Here's my background, I have an MA in Psychology and I have determined it was leading me into a career path that I wasn't interested in. Currently, I'm almost done with a certificate program for marketing as part of my career change process.

I was a student researcher for about 2 years, nonpaid for course credit, where I assisted my professor in their research and completed my own project for my thesis.

I never interned for a marketing position (since I was in PSYCH mode) and only worked professionally as a behavior specialist for 3 years. My resume is very very thin.

I was advised to call myself a ""Market Researcher or Marketing Research Professional,"" because of my background in research (and I am knowledgeable of market research concepts through my classes) when I have been calling myself a ""Marketing Student or Psychology Graduate."" I was also encouraged to be flexible with my ""titles"" to make myself more marketable to a marketing position. I was told that my problem is I'm marketing myself as a student and not a professional. That I really should try to shoot higher because I have an advanced degree and I need to market myself and organize my resume with marketing titles.

What do you guys think of the advice I have been given?

Also, there have been instances where I did not put my research experience under ""Work Experience"" in job applications since I wasn't paid, but maybe I should (would that be lying?)? Currently, I have ""Behavior Specialist,"" ""Graduate Student Researcher,"" and ""Student Research Assistant."" If you think changing some of these titles is acceptable, what marketing titles should I replace it with?

I'm currently more interested in event marketing but I was advised to do market research since it's an easier crossover for my background and it will open a path to event marketing than trying to enter with an event marketing position. Not sure if this is true, but I hope so.

139,"So I’ve been a part of this friend group since around my sophomore year and I just graduated high school. These guys have been there for me for a while but we don’t have too much in common. I love music and going to the gym and so do my friends but that isn’t the only thing I like to do. When I want to do random things, like climb a building out of random interest all my friends do is bitch and say how stupid that would be and they never seem to look at the fun side. Another example: I love snowboarding and last winter I broke my collarbone and whenever I mention how much I love snowboarding they are always like “yea I love breaking my collarbone too”. All I really hear from them is negativity. 
  The other major thing that bugs me is how correct they are. If I say one thing that is not the correct terminology or something they get on my ass about it very fast. For example, I thought it would be fun to just blend random foods like a peanut butter and jelly and then drink it, and I called it a pb and j shake. And they are like “I feel like there needs to be ice cream for it to be a shake”. I don’t care what classifies as a shake. I could care fucking less. I just don’t see why they always need to point out the imperfections of how I say things. 

They just make me so depressed and angry all the time and it really bugs me.

141,"I live with my cousin and her boyfriend. They have 2 dogs and two cats that are all have fleas. 
It’s awful watching the dogs scratching themselves constantly throughout the day and through the night. It must be incredibly distressing for them. I finally brought up the issue enough for them to bathe the dogs with some kind of flea shampoo.  But unfortunately that doesn’t do much of anything especially when you aren’t treating them or the rest of the house. 
They’re convinced that it’s completely due to the season changing to warmer weather and “only lasts a couple weeks.”   Which has been said for over two months now. They only use natural remedies for fleas but if it’s this severe, “natural” isn’t going to cut it. I try to be understanding but I’m so frustrated because it’s hard to see them suffering so much. Any advice on how to approach the conversation with either of them? They both tend to be very resistant to suggestions and challenge anything that is different from their ideas. ",29May2018,1

144,"Last year around this time I made a new friend. Over the year we’ve become very close, talking literally everyday whether it s through the phone or in person. Looking back, she’s become someone very different than who she was when I first met her. One thing to point out is that she is religious, Christian. At the start of our friendship this was very apparent and probably the first thing you notice about her. Practically everyone who knows her knows how openly she shares her beliefs. What’s been racking my brain is how different she is on the outside (to people not really close to her) than to people she trust. 

I’ve been christian my whole life, mostly because my parents. To be honest I don’t know much more about the religion than what is taught in early age Sunday school. 

Another thing about me is that I smoke weed, have been for about 4 years at times smoking a lot more than other times. This is something that I don’t talk to this friend about but it has come up and she does know I do. 

Then about 2 months ago she inquired about it and then just started smoking. At first I was unphased by it. But now, it is just running through my mind how she pushes her faith and beliefs to people but behind closed doors loves her pot. Not 6 months ago was she crusading against my use and urging me to reconsider my lifestyle. Now all of a sudden she has jumped sides. 

The thing is that she still is extremely religious. For some reason it just really bothers me. I know it’s not my life and she is free to do whatever she wants... but it does not sit well knowing how quickly and how profoundly people can switch up. She even ended one of her closest friendships because she found out that her friend smoked weed occasionally. 

I guess I just don’t know how to feel about this. Am I over reacting and over analyzing something that is normal?

147,"I have a lot of interests, and am good at quite a few of them. I've spent four years in college/university and taken enough courses to complete a degree, but I changed programs so much that nothing has amounted to anything. 

I dropped out recently and started on a new path. I liked it, and had a some very successful projects and was beginning to get a reputation. But then it started setting in that this was the future I was pursuing, and again I got cold feet and went into a new direction. Now I've moved halfway across the world and haven't even wanted to tell anybody because I don't want to be 'that guy who lives in Japan'. 

My question, I suppose, is, why don't I want to do anything that gives me a title as 'that guy'? Like, I do photography, and I enjoy it, but when people ask me ""are you a photographer?"" it makes me want to never pick up a camera again. How do I get over this fear of 'labels'? It's gotten in the way of my ability to stick with anything for longer than a few weeks or months, and one day soon I'm going to run out of money and become stagnant working a minimum-wage job while everyone around me advances in their careers. I understand the value and practicality in one picking a single path and advancing in it, if for nothing else than to have enough resources to pursue all the other interests one might have. My problem is that I have a cycle of choosing something that I can say ""this is what I want to do! I've finally got it!"", being let down by the realities of that thing, and then suddenly finding interest in something else and seeing a clear path to success in that thing, changing to it, rinsing, and repeating. The only things I've really found myself advancing in are things where I either have no choice, or where some complex or addiction leads me to become thoroughly skilled with it.

About a year ago I began taking medication for GAD and depression. I thought that was the ticket. And certainly, it's helped me in many ways. But the underlying issues still remain. I haven't attended therapy, and I suspect that that may be the next step for me. The problem is that where I am from, that costs money, and to have money for it you have to earn more than minimum wage, or have health care benefits. Neither of which I have. I feel very stuck, and it's certainly not helping the GAD and depression cause. 

I've tried finding forums or literature by people who have similar struggles, but I can't seem to find anything, or at least, I don't know where to look. Pls send help.",29May2018,1

151,"So I started a new job last week and I'm in a classroom training. There's quite a few people in the class and I just so happened to sit beside this mid twenty to 30 year old woman. 

So throughout the week we start talking casually and I start to notice as the days go on she is acting overly nice to me and not to the other guys sitting around us. 

I learn that she was married so I didn't think much of it, and at the end of the week it starts to get weird.. she starts playing with my hair during our break at our table and grabbing my hand etc ""to see how soft it is"" by her words and is EXTREMELY flirty. I keep trying my best not to flirt back and make her think there's any interest. She continues to do things to get my attention like butt into conversations I'm having and throwing small objects at me to get my attention. She also likes to kick my shoe and kind of trying to play one sided footsies with me.

While I wasn't completely convinced she's looking to perhaps cheat on her Husband, one of the my new fellow coworkers who I knew from highschool is walking out of the training class with me during lunch and he's like ""Bro, you have an opprontunity here"" and I knew before he even said it what he was talking about. He tells me how she's 100% looking to fuck and how ""I'm an idiot"" if I don't try. I was glad someone else was picking up on what was going on because I really thought I was just over reacting to her actions.

So in short, what the fuck do I do? I can't straight up tell her to fuck off or make her uncomfortable because she's a really.nice woman.

So a few months ago I met this girl (friend of a friend, she is studying in another country and has a boyfriend) and she is amazing. Beautiful, charming, extroverted, smart, spiritual... basically everything I would ever want the girl of my dreams to be. I dont want to fantasize but what can I do, It’s the truth! So in a few months from now, me, my best friend (who introduced me to her) and two other guys are going on a two week camping trip so she is going to be around me a lot.

I really don’t want to fall in love because she is studying abroad and has a boyfriend (but what the hell does my heart care about, right?). I know it doesn’t because I met this girl for a short time and now every time I think about her my whole body just fires up. Also, she is moving in with me and my friend for one semester next school year and if i fall in love it will be a disaster. 

My friend gave me advice on this. Like: ‘don’t view her romantically’, and she shared with me a bit of her personal story which also helps(guys fall in love with her all the time and this is not exactly pleasant for her). But I don’t know if I will be able to hold myself despite her good advice.

I don’t want to view this as such of a bad thing, but I know what kind of a mess love can make.

We ended up exchanging skype info, and kept in touch after that. We spoke everyday for a month almost. I felt like I knew him you know. He was supposed to be studying medicine at ucla was 19, had two brothers, his mother left him when he was 15, his father was dating a 26 year old, he lived in beverly hills, he had a dog named charlie etc. Being as insecure as I was, he gave me a lot of validation and kept telling me that he loved me. And that he couldn't possibly live without me. But suddenly we get into an argument about me not showing him my body, and on the night of the 5th of July he threatened that he would leave me if I idn't comply. And in retrospect, I shouldn't have done it but without realising I had become dependant on him,and I needed him in my life so I said screw it and reluctantly showed him. I almost wanted to cry after that, but he said she would talk to me later that day. SO i held onto that. Eventually, when later rolled around, he said he couldn't talk to me anymore and that his anxiety is getting too much and he loved me. That's the last I ever head of him. Anyway, I decided to try to find any contact info I could by looking him up on the ucla student directory, but he doesn't exist there. I thought no problem, maybe he isn't registered? I looked him up on facebook, not there either I thought okay maybe he doesn't use it.Even his brothers don't exist. I knew someone who goes to ucla, they've never heard of him. So basically I don't know who I was talking to for that one month last year, yet I can't seem to get over him. SO i guess I'm trying to ask, how do Iget over someone that doesn't exist? I can't ever receive any closure, so I'm really lost and it really shouldn't affect me this much after one year, but I can't seem to help it. I was 16 when this happened, he was 19. I'm 17 now, and while I am generally over him I still get sad sometimes even tho I realise he was a manipulative, controlling asshole.

Consequently, I try my hardest to make sure I’m right on the brink of falling asleep when I come to bed so as not to toss, turn, or really wake him up while getting settled. Even though I make every effort to limit my movement and noise-making however, there are quite a few nights that this wakes him up and then HE tosses and turns attempting to fall back asleep which only makes it difficult for me to actually fall asleep. A lot of these nights he ends up not falling back to sleep and then I feel guilty he didn’t get to rest which only means we’re both sleep deprived, irritable, AND I feel guilty.

I am in my early 30s, I have a job in finance which pays the bills but does not make me happy. I earn okay but not overly great in my opinion. Yesterday a friend told me about his new job (which might not be that great after all) and the awesome money he will make there. It totally hit me and sent me down into a hole of frustration. I adressed this with my therapist and she asked me how I would imagine a perfect life. I couldn't even answer that question because I feel so unhappy and ensanred by my current situation. Materialistically my life is decent but I just don't feel happy. I took this job and studied taxation and economics because I felt responsible for my spouse (being able to pay the bills) and my family (which runs a business in finance). Now I feel stuck and hopeless. I was offered to do a masters program in finance which  would allow me to earn a bit more but well it's still the same field...and tbh I think finance can be somewhat interesting at times but it isn't my passion. I like stuff like education, history, psychology...I also looked into some programs to do these but they would require lots of time and also money which i don't have at the moment, I mean the bills wanna be paid, right? So again I feel stuck and I don't even dare to take any risks in terms of trying something new because of all the obligations.

My partner has been diagnosed with depression and been dealing with it since we were in high school. Now both 23. And she has managed to go work towards going to uni to make a career. Whereas I can't even do that.

181,"My wife was diagnosed with clinical depression 4 months ago, and it's really taken its toll on me too. So much so that I've just been diagnosed with depression. I've not been given any anti depressants as I've to try self help first but I've to go back in two weeks to see the doctor if I haven't improved any.


On one hand I want to tell her, I need someone to talk to as much as she needs me to talk to. She will understand what I'm going through since she herself is going through it too...


On the other hand, she will likely blame herself and stress herself out even more. I don't blame her at all though.


So, do you think I should tell her or not? ",29May2018,2

189,"I've had knee pains for over a decade, close to 15 years now. Probably the result of a job I worked at as a teen involving heavy machinery, lots of walking and carrying heavy loads. OTC painkillers (Tylenol, Aspirin, Advil, Motrin, Excedrin, etc.) don't work. 

Five years ago I went through a series of tests (blood tests, ultrasound, bone scan, MRI) with zero results, either positive or negative. I went to a specialist following the MRI who said he *might* have seen the beginnings of a condition called AVN, where the bones slowly die due to lack of blood. He recommended waiting and testing again in a few years to see if there was any development.

Several months ago I went and got another MRI. They came back spotless, squeaky clean. No AVN, nothing. The analysis from the MRI doctor was that everything is OK. I went to orthopedists and orthopedic specialists, they found nothing. 

Yesterday I shelled out about %20 of my salary to see the Head of Orthopedic Surgery at one of the country's largest hospitals. After going over everything, he told me that physically there's nothing wrong with my knees, but that for some reason the kneecaps are applying excessive pressure to the leg bones, and that there's nothing to do about it. No treatment, no surgery, nothing. He said that I'm basically going to have this pain for the rest of my life. 

I've not given up, I've got appointments with other specialists in other areas, as well as for a pain management clinic, looking for any sort of answer for this, but I'm slowly losing hope. I've gotten through maybe a third of my life, and I don't want to look at the next ~50 years and see myself in constant pain. I left this doctor's office in tears, and my wife wasn't able to get me out of it. 

What makes it worse is that I had already accepted the fact that my knees don't work and there was no cure, and then I got my hopes up again hoping the latest specialist would provide some sort of an answer. Now I'm going through the whole downswing again. 

How can I get myself out of this depressing state? I don't want to settle or accept the fact that I'm going to spend the next decades in pain, having to wince or cry out in pain every time I bend over to be with my kids or get up from my chair.

191,"Hello all, this is my first reddit post so bear with me. 

So two weeks ago I came home from work to find my living room of my apartment ankle deep with water. I immediately contacted my front office who sent over maintenance, they began attempting to locate the leak. The water was coming in from behind our oven (wtf). Apparently the vacant apartment behind us had a pipe burst and flooded that apartment and then flooded into ours. 

   So hours later and 150 gallons of water pulled from our apartment the office people explain because it was clean water we have nothing to worry about and they will have fans and a dehumidifier in our place for a few days. 

   So they put the fans under the carpet with the dehumidifier and we wait about a week. Carpet dries out, fans leave the apartment, we think everything is awesome and back to normal. 

 Then this awful chemical/ammonia/paint thinner smell starts emanating from our apartment. We can't tell if its the carpet or the linoleum in the kitchen (kitchen was covered in water) or if its from them professionally cleaning the apartment behind us. Both my husband and I are having sinus trouble and headaches and sore throats from the smell.

Has anyone had any experience with this happening? Or suggestions on how to get rid of it? Or should my apartment complex have replace the carpet and floors even for a clean water leak?

We are contacting our landlord again today, its been difficult to get them to do anything after the fact of the water incident. 

Also wanted to ask, we had 4 large fans and a dehumidifier running 24/7 for a week in our apartment and were nervous on how much that will affect our utility bill? Also should we pay the extra or should that be the landlords responsibility? 

Thanks! ",29May2018,1
193,"Yesterday I had a job interview somewhere. It looks like a great place to work \(it's an import food/beer/wine store and gourmet deli\) and it's conveniently near my place via public transit. To sum up, here are some pros and cons I noticed in the interview:

PROS:  
\+The manager said it's a ""super easy job"" and ""not rocket science at all""  
\+Like I said, near my apartment via public transit \(20 minute commute, if even\)  
\+Said that I seem like I've got the right attitude for the job  
\+*Very* good pay and hours considering it's just a retail job

CONS:  
\-Said he was ""using the opportunity to weed out some people who weren't pulling their weight and needed constant supervision""  
\-Said the store is open from 10:00am\-11:00pm, says he only comes in from 10:00am\-12:00pm, then 2:00\-6:00pm, and then we're on our own from there, hence why he needs people that ""need as little supervision as possible unless it's an emergency""  
\-No assistant manager or shift supervisor, even when he's not there  
\-Said he needs people who have great customer service and attitudes because the Yelp reviews talk about how excellent their products and variety are, but give negative reviews about the attitudes of the employees.

That's 4 pros and 4 cons. Should I be a ""big boy"" and be ready to do my job without supervision for hours at a time and take a job that will give me good hours and good pay and take the risk...... Am I just being paranoid? Or does the manager's self\-admitted constant absence, lack of other managers, and admission that a good bit of the current employees have pushed away potential future customers rightfully give me a ""danger, danger Will Robinson!"" gut feeling?",29May2018,1

195,"I really need some outsiders opinions on this one as I can't determine what's right and it's messing with my own perception and outlook.

To start I'll introduce the key people;

Me: 21, recovering from various mental illnesses and battling BPD, I'm self aware of a lot of my issues and I know I can be impulsive but I really try to work things out on my own

BF: Also 21, Absolute legend, been dating for 4 years now, he has been so patient with me through everything and incredibly supportive. We've discussed our future and are looking to marry in the next year or two. We have had a lot of rocky moments and he has breached my trust majorly on one occassion.

Friend \(F\):  26, complete sweetheart, known him for 9 years now. We had some history but it never amounted to anything serious.

My issue is that while I adore BF, F and I have recently started talking again and I've been incredibly drawn to him. I see BF as my long term partner and husband material, but I'm really curious about F and I know he and I have a lot more similarities than BF and I. It sounds weird but I really just want to kiss F and see what it's like.

I like to believe I'm endlessly loyal to BF but my thoughts of F are eating away at me. To the point I feel incredible guilt and contemplated killing myself to end my own shame.     

BF is really self conscious though and while he is my best friend I just feel like I can't talk to him about this sort of thing without him getting upset at me and thinking less of me. But he can see my mind has shifted and I'm distancing myself from everything including my own wellbeing.

F and I have always spoken but recently as I've been less busy I've been able to speak with him more and I've just gone nuts about him. He knows I have a boyfriend but still makes some moves towards me and it destroys me. He's lovely and a well meaning guy.

I'm just completely lost and I don't know what to do! Should I tell my BF? Should I tell F? Should I just let it eat at me? I feel like I'm imploding with shame....Help!",29May2018,2

Im looking for some advice in general about how to better my life.
So a little bit of context here. Im mid twenties. Engaged with 1 kid. We have little to 0 savings and financially just about scrape after paying monthly rent and car costs as well as food expenses etc.

Job wise im the full time parent at the moment whilst my partner works but doesnt earn a huge amount.  I have decent experience working but 0 qualifications. To top it all off I dont really even know what I want to do as a career. I was in the military for a few years and after getting a medical discharge it left me feeling a little lost career wise. 
We both want a fresh start where we have a clean slate and no past connections but have no money to move anywhere and no job awaiting us as it's hard enough to get one here let alone somewhere we dont live.

I have 2 good friends but one is currently travelling and the other one has recently moved quite a distance away so we see each other semi regularly. I had a local mate who i was pallying about wirh from time to time but over the last year I've realised how toxic this person is. He always tries to borrow things then doesn't return them, is always getting into dodgy situations and i genuinely see him getting into shit at some point again and if im mates with him it will just drag me into it. He never brings anything to the table only takes stuff away and when you ask for thibgs back or point out a what he did was wrong he gets defensive and brings up "" everything hes done for you"" even favours one would consider something any normal human would do.

 So I've been trying to distance myself as much as i possibly  can but he stays locally and it's become pretty hard. Im worried if I am too direct we'll just end up fighting etc.( i know if its this bad i need to get him to fuck. I also know the longer I leave it the worse it will be and that I cant just avoid the confrontation to avoid trouble.. But I feel like there must be a smarter way to deal with the situation without having to be so abrupt.) 

I was getting medication for depression etc and stopped taking it because of adverse side effects. 
I feel stuck. Stuck in my lifestyle. Stuck with this guy around that I cant shake. Stuck in this house with no plans to own my own house or car even on a distant horizon. 
I just want away from it all. To get a clean break.

Can anyone give me any advice
Thanks

199,"Background: I did my undergraduate in Psychology. For my masters I applied for a course on eating disorder, which was open to psychologist, nutritionists, doctors etc. We have 9 modules plus dissertation. 7 of the modules focus only on metabolism, nutrition, intestinal failure, cancer, gut disorders, allergies, IVs, electrolytes, pharmacology, surgery, anthropometry and the like. Only 2 modules are related to eating disorders, but still contain mostly medical information and medical treatment. There is little psychology, and most of it is stuff we learn in our undergraduate. We also barely touched any statistics, although this was supposed to be a master of research. 

Other psychology students and I have been discussing this between us for a long while. We don't see the use in spending 14.000£ for a master that teaches us how to be a nutritionist and how to stick a nasogastric tube in a patient's nose, when our qualifications would never allow us to do so. We also are disappointed that loads of what we learn is completely outside the scope of eating disorders \(e.g. cancer, surgery etc.\). 

4 other classmates left a letter of complaint to administration, we all left negative feedback anonymously, one requested a meeting with the dean of faculty to talk about this.

I sent an email to administration with these complaints as well. The genius from administration forwarded this email \(which was quite raw\) to my lead teacher without me knowing. He replied to me obviously defending the course. He did not sound extremely angry, but I am worried of what they could do to me. I also have an exam coming up with him. 

In my reply I apologized if the original email was harsh, but also stated my points and let him know that other students sent similar complaints, even to the head of faculty. 

Can this get me into trouble? Can a student get kicked out or do we have the right to complain if the course content is so bad/irrelevant? Has anyone else done similar complaints and what happened? How do I manage this? ",29May2018,2

207,"So I started a new job in healthcare just over 3 weeks ago. Within the first 3 days I witnessed abuse against a vulnerable adult and went through the process of reporting it and action was taken against the member of staff involved. Witnessing it all was the first red flag even though it was dealt with well.
In the three weeks I’ve been there I’ve traveled plenty to training sessions. I love to learn and took this as a great opportunity. 
However, after some time there I realised it wasn’t the job for me. It wasn’t challenging at all and a big step down from my previous job. Over 2 weeks I really began to hate it. I knew it wouldn’t be as full on as my previous job but I didn’t realise quite how laid back it was. I expressed this to my manager and he understood.
These 3 weeks have been purely shadowing and training. By the 4th week I’d be a fully trained member of staff and on the rota. This place involved lone working and I’d be on shift on my own. I guessed I’d leave before I became a fully fledged member of staff and left other staff members in trouble having to pick up my shifts.
I figured I’d email my resignation to my manager (he isn’t based at the place I work and I couldn’t contact him through phone call). 
He’s advised me that I work the last 3 days of my shadowing and training, however I don’t know why? It’s not stated in my contract, and surely there’s no point in training me for the next 3 days just so I leave after?
I’ve not attended for the last 2 days since I sent my resignation because I naively believed there would be no need (because why train someone who’s leaving?).

My problem is that I'm too friendly, I want to be friends. (or at the very least, acquaintances) with absolutely everyone I know.

210,"Hi, this is my first post here:

I'm gonna really try to make this short and simple: I'm a 24 y.o. student and I'm really bad at college, studying. I study sociology and it's simply put stupid and useless degree, the things we learn there have probably .5&amp;#37; of application in real life, if that. I can't seem to focus and force myself to study something so bland and utterly useless.

What I've been doing in my so far two years in this college is 3D modelling, design and texturing. Mostly for games, I freelance, last month I earned 3100 USD from freelance jobs and clients around the globe. I feel utterly guilty when I'm not studying, because I'm ""wasting"" my family's money living in another town. 

Due to me being reckless with my studying I even had to pay nice amount of money to actually re roll into some classes again without my parents knowing. And I still don't care if I pass or not, I just like living here alone and doing freelance.

Otherwise my social life is great too, it's just this huge burden that I feel that I have to finish this piece of shit of college degree just to justify my family's expectation. I really turn into angry and resentful the minute I have to open books up to learn stuff I don't care.

Disclaimer: Reading my post I know this  probably sound like I have some mental disability \(haha\), but I don't think so, I don't have problem with studying something that actually makes sense, everything I know for modelling and designing I learned by myself. 

Before this freelance career, I worked two other jobs and still was a full time student. All the money I earned I invested into courses, darn expensive PC and my own server. I just don't know when it's the time to cut ties with time waster that I call college degree.",29May2018,3

My first job many moons ago was another job that kind of just fell into my lap. It’s like I got it just for trying. Long story short, I found out why, it was a rotating door. 
With this new job, I basically sent in my resume, got a call probably not even 15 minutes later, interviewed 2 hours later, talked for 10 minutes, and got the job. 
This is what I know from the interview, other than job details:
-it is a revolving door
-THREE of the same position are open and needed to be filled
-just from the way the manager basically went on a frankly unprofessional rant about it being because people kept calling out makes me wary. 

Part of me is tempted to say “Thanks, but no thanks.” And trust my bad gut feeling, but the other part is thinking “broke college kid needs money. I only have to tough it out until August.”

We were that couple that people aspired to be. When we broke up, it was short and simple. We haven’t talked since.

The others are her having sex with other guys and still wanting to be back with me. Or me finding out that she’s moved on with another guy, and it drives me crazy.

Or I’m scared to find out that she’s moved on from me with another guy or has had sex with another guy (I was her first but she wasn’t mine).

Over these past 8 months, it’s been a rollercoaster for me. Some weeks I’m completely over her and cannot even fathom being in a relationship. But at times I just want to yell into the phone “I miss you so much!!!! Why shouldn’t we be together. Please tell me you’re not seeing anyone or haven’t seen anyone.” And at other times I’ve moved on.

Thanks reddit. I don’t know where I would be without you.",29May2018,3

222,"Sorry ahead of time, typing on my phone. I feel I'm at a crossroads in life. I (25M) live in a small town in CT with my fiancée (26F). All in all, we are sick of CT. As a young person, this state sucks. Jobs leaving, cities are crime ridden, wage inequality is sickening, and all young people are leaving. In addition I want to leave my new job (started 6 months ago). We really want to move to Portland, ME (my fiancée can work from home at current job while I find new job) but my dad has stage 4 bladder cancer and the future looks grim. I don't want to leave my mother, who would be left with a small horse farm to take care of if he passes, but I don't want to stay here either, nor does my fiancée, despite the fact she's been so supportive saying we can do whatever I feel is best. 

Portland would only be 3 hours away, but I would hate it if I wasn't able to be there for my family. I do have a sister who lives about 10 min from them, and I have asked them their opinion and they encouraged me to do what makes me happy. I just don't know what to do and could use some advice.

226,"Tl; dr: I'm a guy that travels constantly and can only think of women as people to connect with first and then maybe, eventually, have a relationship with. Should I change my mind to keep my sanity?

So, I'm a 33 year old man. Until recently I was at a desk job, clocking in, clocking out, phoning it in some days... you know, a *routine*. 

But my life changed about eight months ago. 

First, I got divorced. My (now ex-) wife travels a lot, and even though we loved each other, we couldn't quite make it work, so we decided to call it quits. 

Second, I started to travel on work. It began as a trickle, two weeks here, three weeks there. Then more seriously. I'm right now on a business trip that will involve me being in a new city every two days or so, *indefinitely* for the foreseeable future. Last week I was all up and down the east coast, in Boston, Philly, NY, and back to Boston again. This week same thing in reverse. 

Needless to say, I'm doing all this traveling alone. Again needless to say, being a relatively virile male, this leads to... unfulfilled needs. I'm almost always angry, mostly at myself, and whenever I see a girl my anger turns inward, accusatory. There's another one I'll never be with. There's another. A third. 

So, I got on Tinder. This I did a while back, when my marriage was headed down the tubes. I'm an average looking guy: my best picture scored a 47% on photofeeler. Tinder may not, perhaps, be the best hunting ground for people that look like me. However, I was desperate. 

I've been on two Tinder dates so far, both abortive. One of the girls tried to sell me pens from a briefcase she'd brought on the date. They were fantastic pens. I bought one, left. She still emails me Dear Customers from her professional email address. 

Then, recently, I had a long, very long conversation with a girl on Tinder---call her J. We matched when I was---very briefly---40 miles from her city, transiting airports. 

We connected. Really connected. J enables a side of me I didn't know existed: with her I'm funny and wear my past lightly and not as a badge. We can talk (text back and forth, that is; we've never actually spoken) for hours. I *like* J; I like the way she texts, at any rate, and I've always been one for reading. 

So I shuffled my schedule around so I could be near her city for the weekend, and asked her out. 

J said no, but continued to text me, throwing out other hints that she still felt a certain way about me. 

Then, I shuffled my schedule again, and asked her out again. 

She said no---again. The unkindest cut. Here's what she says: 

""I admit I have feelings but I can't see myself being with someone who travels so much."" 

 ""I don't want to fall in love if you will leave."" 

&lt;rant&gt; And then she has the absolute audacity to ask me if she broke my heart. And then she has the gall to tell me to stick around, that these were her ""current concerns"", that she's not saying it'll never happen. &lt;/rant&gt;

Look, I know the score. I know when I'm being benched. I've been polite to her texts since that conversation. She still has a piece of my heart. She has my Instagram. I have hers. I know she's real. A real person benched me. 

All this brings me to why I'm here. 

I'm told that people in my situation---travelling, a different city every day, atomized, distracted lifestyles, lots of beer, lots of unhealthy food---would do well to keep awake late on weekends and roam bars for easy women to take home. Unfortunately, I have never done this, and don't know how. I don't even know if this is an actual thing, or a convenient pop-cultural shortcut to intimacy that's actually far trickier irl. 

My question is this: is this my only option? Can I never hope to make connections like the one with J, because such connections presume a certain geographical stability that I currently cannot aspire to? 

If yes, then fine. I'll hire some dating coaches, play the game. No, really. I believe I'm a quick study. I can do it. 

It's like you can't bring a gun into a knife fight or what not. If it turns out that the essential tool to travelling constantly as a man, divorced, in his early thirties, is to flirt with a hundred women in bars (or wherever! I don't know! Malls? Da club? The municipal parks?), sure, I'll do it. 

I just hope it isn't. I *feel* like I'm going insane, though I know I'm far from it. Already I can sense the elaborate mental calculus that people do when by themselves. I'm not sure my current lifestyle is sustainable. 

Need some perspective. ",29May2018,0
228,"TLDR:
Girlfriends mother is in the hospital after switching to a new cancer treatment. It is taking a toll on my girlfriend both physically and mentally. I support her but still don't know how to talk to her about it in the best way.

&amp;nbsp;

Background
My girlfriend and I have been together for a year 4 months. She has one mother whom she lives with. Her mom has had cancer for many years, but despite that she has been living a good and active life. Recently she changed to a new treatments that overall would be better for her. With this change in treatment her health has gotten worse. A new cycle has formed where the treatment treats the cancer but her health and consciousness(loopyness?) declines. To receive the treatment she has to be already in good health.

&amp;nbsp;

Problem
The problem is my gf has been taking her to and from the hospital to treat her bone pain. Her mothers overall health has drastically gone down and it makes my gf very sad. I try my best to be positive and supporting but I end up saying the same thing like ""It'll be ok"", ""She's getting better"", ""You do so much for her, she's lucky to have you supporting her"". Overall I feel like I am not doing as good as a job supporting her as  I should. Does anyone have any advice on helping her and talking to her about it",29May2018,1

231,Been dating this girl for several years and really loved how things were going. We’ve had ups and downs but overall this has been the best relationship I’ve had. I wanted to even propose but money is kinda tight due to our living situation. Basically I’m making majority of the money in the house which is fine but bills suck all of my money every month which is why I’m looking for a higher paying job to be able to afford an engagement ring. A few years ago she found out that I talked to a few guys on more of a curious convo and we had a huge blow up but we squashed it and I kinda left it alone as well. She still assumes I’m bi but I could never actually date a guy and the older I get the more I realize that’s not something I’m interested in at all. She’s even told me that she’d be interested in girls so it kind of made me a little more comfortable with the situation. Well recently she found messages from a guy from a fling literally 4 years ago trying to rekindle but I wasn’t interested which is why I didn’t respond.  Now she’s claiming I never loved her and doesn’t want to be with me. Is there hope or should I give up? I really want to be with her but I just don’t think she was as open minded as she originally stated. Please be nice in comments. ,29May2018,1

238,"So, for the past 4 years of school I’m having trouble getting motivated to do my homework, learn for tests or make notes about what the teacher is explaining. The only time I can fully concentrate and do my work is when it’s absolutely necessary, and there’s no other time to do it. For example: I don’t study tests 2 days before it’s due. Now, you’re probably thinking: “Many other teenagers don’t either, what’s the deal?” Well, most teenagers learn it at least the day before it is due, I however, wake up early the day I have the test, (usually 5 am) and then start studying the subject for at most (if I even have the motivation for that) 2 hours. While this method has worked for the past 4 years, I’m slowly starting to notice it’s becoming harder and harder to get consistent grades with it. I would honestly like to be able to learn for the test at least a day before it is due, but I just can’t, I always end up not doing anything thinking: “I can just do it tomorrow morning.” I never do homework, as I’m never motivated for it and it never felt necessary for me to do anything. This is starting to show it’s results: I never understand what the subject is about for physics, maths, Latin and science. Only the day we have a test, and I learn for 2 hours, do I understand the subject enough to still get a decent grade. As for making notes of what the teacher says, I always forget I have to write down notes and only realise it after everything’s been said or showed, which is also the moment I realise that I wasn’t paying attention the whole time the teacher was telling something. Today I had a Latin test, and it went absolutely catastrophic, I had thought to easy of it and as a result I didn’t study enough resulting in me almost getting a black-out. I’m honestly worried that this trend is going to continue on to the other subjects, that’s why I’m asking you guys for advice on this matter. What can I do to get motivated, stay concentrated and not be lazy for school?

TL;DR: I can never find motivation for school unless I’m reaching the deadline. Which causes me to study the day tests are due at 5 am for at most 2 hours.",29May2018,1
239,"  TL;DR: My brother is suicidal and getting wasted every night. He blames it on his ex leaving him, but I think he has some underlying mental disorder that is causing him to behave this way. He had a stint in a mental institution, but they couldnt diagnose him because he wouldn't cooperate. What should I do?
  
I'm going to try and give you all plenty of background knowledge so please forgive me if it doesn't flow right or it's repetitive or rant-y.
  
My brother is 27. He's never made good choices and doesn't really accept responsibility for his actions. He also refuses to listen to and does the opposite if what people advise him to do. As of now he is suicidal and partying a lot, drinking and driving. 
  
His senior year of high school him and my mom got into a fight and he said something about killing people at school; she told him not to go to school talking like that because he's get in a lot of trouble. Well, the next day he told someone he wanted to blow up the school and was arrested then put in a mental institution. That kinda started everything in his adult life even though I would say the problems started in middle school with him refusing to do homework.   
  
Anyway, the felony terrorist charge was a setback for him, but my grandfather paid to have it expunged sometime in the 1-2 years following the incident. After it was expunged he was able to apply to college and got accepted, BUT when he got there he still refused to do his homework. With me and everyone else telling him he couldn't pass unless he did his homework, he refused. Flunked out and hasn't tried to help himself since. This was about 7 years ago.     
  
He's also always been super sensitive and absolutely hateful. Definitely thinks he can do no wrong, thinks he's a genius, etc. Just generally narcissistic qualities. 
  
Now things in the past year have really made a turn for the worst. His girlfriend of 6-7 years left him, and for good reason. He's a mean person and they would fight over the dumbest stuff. He would scream at her over the phone calling her a cunt and being extremely verbally abusive. Then they moved in together. He cheated on her with multiple people, they broke up for a while, and got back together. (I also want to add that I have *never* liked this girl and still don't, but no one deserves to be treated that way. )   
  
Almost a year ago she broke up with him for good and he has been going crazy ever since. All of the negative qualities i've mentioned have gotten worse and I'm really concerned about his mental health.   
  
Back in January or February my mom called the police on him because he was being so crazy and talking about suicide and being violent. When I talked to him he said that my mom and dad told him they didnt care if he was alive or dead, but they said they never said that. My parents do everything they can to help him and he is such an entitled asshole to them. For example, a few months ago he totaled his vehicle he saved up some money to buy it and they covered the rest. He's supposed to pay them back, but they still helped with the initial purchase. He only pays 200 dollars of the 550 dollar rent and has never paid any utilities. When he had a truck he absolutely refused to help with the farm.  He hasn't even gone to see our grandpa in years and Grandpa is the reason he was able to get a truck in the first place.  He wants to get a decent job so he can have nice things, but doesn't want to do any work to get it. ( Refused to do his work in college and when I suggested a trade job he said that was too much work).   
  
What I'm getting at is EVERYTHING bad in his (adult) life is a result of his own choices. I'm also the type of person who cuts people slack based on their upbringing. (For example, if your mother sold you to men for drugs as a child, I can totally see why you have a hard time making good choices in your adult life. The trauma you experience and how you are brought up totally effects the options you have to make your life better when you can finally make choices for yourself) I am not just blaming him for things that are out of his control. 
   
Now that I have gone into all that, I want to talk about recent events. You all already know his girlfriend leaving him sparked this spiraling descent into depression (?) and substance abuse. When it initially happened (Jan-Feb) my husband and I told him over and over again to block her on all social media. He claimed she would trail him along and stuff like that; giving him hope that they would get back together. He would be like ""oh yeah, okay"" but NEVER blocked her. Still, Things seemed to get better as time went on. He totalled his vehicle and I was really worried, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. He started going out and making friends. I thought it was a good thing, but he is so far gone.    
  
Ever since he got his vehicle he has stayed out all night literally every night drinking and doing coke. He comes home between 5am and 8am totally fucking wasted. He has also been taking alcoholic drinks to go whenever he leaves from wherever he's coming from. He told me 4 days ago hr had 7 dollars to his name (supposed to get paid today) and he has been out every night since.  I know he's partying because he's wasted.
  
A couple mornings ago he told my younger (13 y/o) brother that he wanted to kill himself right before my little Brother caught the bus. That bothered me a lot because he doesn't need to be traumatizing the kid before he goes to school. If he needs help, he knows my husband and I are available. I, of course, talked to my younger brother about it. Just to curb that whole situation to the best of my abilities. Afterwards, I called my older brother just so I could be like ""yo, that's not cool"". I also told him he needs to quit partying because it is HORRIBLE for his mental health. Like, I have great mental health and i've done my fair share of partying, but partying makes me feel horrible if I do too much. I *know* it has to have detrimental effects on him.  He also has this idea that no one in our family cares about him. His response to me saying he needs to quit partying was ""at least I'm around people who care about me""   
  
These people would not even fuck with him if he didnt buy drugs and party with them. People who don't discourage you from making poor life decision are not your friends.    
  
I guess I will end it there because idk what else to say.   
  
What should I do in this situation? I'm not sure how to even start a conversation with him. I know he needs professional help, but I don't know how to go about that, either. If anyone has any advice for me I would appreciate it. Or even advice I could relay to him would be great. I just don't know what to do and I don't want to lose my brother to suicide.  ",29May2018,1

I work hourly, been here 2 years, and I was going to ask for a dollar more. (Really expecting to get 50¢ if I can get any raise).

Yesterday, I had to deal with a guest/customer, something that is not apart of my job description, but interactions do occur. 
Yesterday, I caught this guest in an employee only area and I had to ask them to leave. 
It was a mistake on their part, but an honest one. I told them that this area was not open to the public and I'd have to ask them to leave. They cooperated, and I escorted them back to a guest area, but right when I thought it was over, they called me rude, and I could only apologize for the confusion, but rules are rules. 


They ended up asking to speak to my manager, (they went to another employee instead of asking me).


Before they called my manager, I warned her about the interaction, repeated everything I said, and she said that **I** didn't do anything wrong, that *they* were simply wrong. So she's on my side, but should I wait to ask for a raise?

We are currently doing apartment applications, so he once again talked about living on his own as he has for the past two years. Had a whole story about where it was, paying his own bills, etc. I casually made a comment to his mother and she said he did not ever live on his own. He claimed she was lying to be a bitch and bring him down. I was willing to drop it but his overly defensive attitude was a little odd. His family walked in just then anyways and all backed up that he never lived on his own and he stomped away. I asked why he's lie and he's respond with things like ""it's not even a big deal. And it doesn't matter."" I told him all I ever want is the truth. That I don't feel respected when he lies right to my face. And then he acts mad every time I catch him in a lie. He said he refused to apologize. We haven't talked AT ALL since the fight last night and we live together. I feel like it does matter, because we are moving out together and all his lies are annoying. At what point am I going to stop believing anything he says? His mom says his father used to be the same exact way and eventually lead to their divorce.
And no this isn't his only lie. At the beginning of our relationship, he claimed a girl he was texting was absolutely nothing until I woke up before him one day and saw an over the top flirty text. He's lied about where he works. At the start of his new job I took him lunch just to learn that he was somewhere completely different then what he told me. He had no reason to lie. It wasn't an embarrassing or low paying job. Then recently, we started doing job applications for our move and he told me he did three, but when he logged into his mail had no sent emails. He said he lied because he's going to do them so what does it matter.

But the thing is just that I'm a virgin (of sex, kissing, never even fucking hugged a guy really) and I'm just worried that it would mentally mess me up that I let these men use me. But then again it'd be great money I feel. And of course there's the whole risk of someone killing me, kidnapping me, etc. but idk.

255,"There is a supervisor at my work (well, technically head cashier, she doesn't have true authority over me) that I used to be close friends with. We are the same age and have similar interests, so naturally we developed a friendship. 

About a week ago, she called me at home (around 10 pm) to vent about another co-worker that had annoyed her. I didn't do much but listen as she was quite frustrated so I let her rant. After she finished ranting about what happened, she switched the conversation to me, and said something along these lines:

""Oh, and by the way, you and *co-worker* both forgot to clean your tills and I had to spend extra time cleaning them tonight and had to apologize to customers about it. It's not fair to me, and I'm getting tired of covering your guys' asses. I work my ass off while I'm here, and you guys also need to stop paging me down when I'm in the bathroom."" (I can't remember exactly what she said as it was a week ago, but it was along those lines).

I didn't do much over the phone except apologize and let her keep ranting, but after we hung up the phone I got really mad. I don't think what she did was appropriate. I understand where her frustration was coming from, but I wish she had of talked to me when I got to work the next day, instead of yelling at me over the phone about it late at night.

I confided in a couple of co-workers, including a manager who I know for a fact also got a similar phone call that night. Well, I guess she (the supervisor who yelled at me) was told I was talking about the situation at work, and she has now decided she does not want to be friends with me because I was ""bashing"" her. She won't tell me what I apparently said, just that she was told ""things"".

I tried to reason with her, but ultimately accepted our friendship has ended. Yesterday I worked with her for the first time since the situation, and she is CLEARLY not over it, and it's making me uncomfortable. I tried making simple conversation with her, (I can be professional, no problem) but she only gave me answers to be polite and REFUSED to make eye contact with me. When she was talking to us cashiers, she only looked at the other cashier when she was talking, flat out ignoring me. 

Now, while she doesn't have authority over me, she is supposed to be in charge when the manager goes home and she's supposed to make sure we're working and we report to her when there's a problem. But because of how she's treating me, she's making it really hard for me to work comfortably.

What do I do?

TL;DR - supervisor decided she didn't want to be friends with me after I apparently ""bashed"" her, even though she was the one who phoned me after work hours to rant about something I forgot to do. Now she won't make eye contact with me, ignores my presence, and is making working with her uncomfortable.",29May2018,1

258,"This guy and I were communicating every single day. All through the day &amp; we’d have phone calls at night that would sometimes go on for over 4 hours at a time.

We started planning dates and he would always say how he’d be honoured to date me. He’d always plan these beautiful sounding dates and I was just blown away by his creativity and romance. However on Valentine’s Day I asked him out and he said he was working that night so he couldn’t. I knew he was leaving the country in the end of March, he had to go away for work for a while. So I suggested that maybe we grab a drink before he goes and he said he had no free time before leaving and that he’d let me know if that changed. Of course, he never found any free time for me.

He responds to me if I message first, but he never starts up a conversation. Which is such a 180 from how we were communicating *all the time*. So I decided to confront him. I asked if everything was okay and I mentioned that I missed talking. He said he misses talking to me too, but has been avoiding talking to me because he’s trying to “blank everything out from back home for a while” because he’s having some intense problems in life. So he’s been treating his time away as an escape to clear his head. He just keeps reassuring me that it isn’t just me that he hasn’t talked to in a while, and then that’s it. He won’t continue any more conversation.

Every time I post on Instagram, he likes the photo. Every single time. But that’s the extent of our communication right now. I don’t know what’s happened or what’s changed and it’s confusing me to say the least. Particularly because he’s always painted himself to be a very straight forward, honest person. So if he’d lost interest or met someone else, he’d just say that. I know that the logical thing to do is to just move on but for some reason I just can’t stop thinking about him.

**tl;dr** I guess my question is, how do I move on from something that wasn’t really “anything” to begin with? Without closure or a definite “ending”? For some reason I’m finding it hard to stop thinking about him ",29May2018,3

260,"I've been at my current apartment for two years and the time to renew my lease is coming up.  I don't have any major complaints, but I might as well consider moving to a different place.  I make more money now than two years ago, but that doesn't necessarily mean I should spend it.  

I work in Alpharetta, GA, and it's about a 30 minute drive to work.  Not bad, but I could potentially move closer.  My current apartment doesn't have a tennis court, it might be nice to have one available.  I used to play when I was younger, maybe I could meet people who play tennis.  Some of the apartments have nice walking trails, or have a bike share nearby.

If I did move, I'd probably end up paying $250 more a month in rent.  I can afford it, but it's not money that I *need* to spend.

I'm worried about work. I have been working at my job for almost seven years now, but over the last few months, I've been nervous every day that, for some reason, I won't get my work done and I'll get yelled at or fired by my boss.

I live about 25 minutes away from my office, but what I worry about each day, is that I won't get my work done and that I'll be sitting at home, thinking I've done a good job, and I'll get a call from my boss saying, ""what you've turned in isn't going to work for me. Find something else.""

It freaks me out because it's happened before (sort of) and I think it has lead me to me to become nervous every day because I don't want to get yelled at or worse, fired.

At the end of the day, I always get my work done, so it's not like I have a logical reason to worry. However, I'm always worried that I won't meet my assigned deadlines. Or, my bosses personal requirements.

271,"So I've been unhappy with my current job for awhile now and i finally decided to make a change. I hit the job websites and i have two possible jobs. One, a high paying job that will require at least 50 hours per week, a 40min commute and another job that is 2 miles from my house, ok money(nothing special, but not horrible), but it'll be 2nd shift or weekend shift(3 12hr shifts). Job one will be a lucrative job, but will require me to wake up around 2:30am, 5 days a week, to drive 35-40mins. The job is for a well known Potato chip company, so id be restocking shelves with their products at big box stores or even smaller gas stations. The benefits are amazing, 2 weeks vacation after a year and even a pension after 5 years! The downside is i will be a fill in guy at first(no idea how long) so i won't have my own route, so my schedule will vary week to week, as well as working most holidays. Job 2 is something I'm more familiar with. Its a warehousing job, decent pay, and its literally 2 miles from my house. The main downside to this job is the only openings are 2nd shift(2-11pm) or weekends(3-12hr shifts). I think i would enjoy job 1 if it were a set route, but she told me in the interview that there might be nights when i think I'm off work and ill get a text at 9pm saying i have to work somewhere an hour away tomorrow, which i know i won't like.

I moved across the country to live with my best friend, her daughter \(18 months old\) and now her fiance... I have been living with them for almost 8 months now and have seen his true colors. He is not a good person. 

I feel as though I can no longer support her union to such a bad person. I can not be honest with her without making things more awkward and causing our relationship to drift farther. I tired to have a heart to heart with her once but it did not go well and our relationship has suffered since. 

I have extremely strong feelings to back out of being her Maid Of Honor but her wedding is next month in June. Either way I feel like the worst friend to her. I feel extremely guilty for pretending to support her and continue this charade of pretending to be happy for her when every ounce of my body is screaming for her to run the other direction. And also screaming at me to move back home and move on with my own life. 

Basically, I know I'm a horrible person and no matter what I choose to do at this point I will most likely hurt if not destroy our friendship. Which is why I am reaching out....I need advice desperately. At this point I myself am miserable trying to keep up this charade.

I understand when I said yes to being her Maid of Honor I made a promise to be her right hand women and be there in this process when she needs me, but I am suffering personally and at some point I feel like I need to focus on my own life and my own happiness.

It sucks because I really only see my family twice a year and that's usually during Christmas and Comic-Con.

297,"I’m adopted. A few months ago, thanks to an AncestryDNA test kit, I was able to find my birth family. My number one match was a man named Vincent, who as it turned out attends the same university that I do (Kennesaw State) and is majoring in the same field, (Political Science). 

After meeting him the night I got my DNA results, he gave me the contact information for my birth mother, who coincidentally enough also lives in my college town. 

After our more than 20 year reunion, she gave me the contact information of my birth father. 

Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m so glad I got the chance to meet him. He and my birth mother met while they worked in the same hospital as nurses; but that story is for another time. (Side note: my birth father is white and my birth mother is black). 

Anyway, before meeting my birth father, I stalked his Facebook. Holy. Shit. This guy is as far right-wing-conspiracy-batshit-crazy-believes-Obama-is-the-Antichrist- they come. 

I mean he literally believes that Obama is gay, is a government experiment to take over the world, isn’t a US citizen, etc. . . The list goes on and on. 

I myself, being a Democrat, and a political science student, find it extremely disappointing. I mean he is literally fixated on political shit that makes ZERO sense. 

Should I seriously take into consideration his political views, or ignore them? It already puts a serious dent into how valuable I see his opinions and the way he chooses to think. ",29May2018,2

I’ve been going to the gym and trying out some healthier lifestyle choices beginning this year and feel more confident and positive about myself and my life. Today I was walking with my friend and her sister to a barbecue place near my home when i see two men (around late 20’s) arguing with a young woman, suddenly they start slapping her around, before I can even think about anything I rush over to them to try to diffuse the situation, being a relatively tall big bearded guy I can look quite intimidating when I’m confrontational I guess?. They stopped immediately, long story short found out the woman short changed them and tried scamming them, but it’s still no reason to be slapping someone up like a rag doll, the whole time I was scared shitless, I was not looking for a fight, I felt frozen, couldn’t move my body at all when I was yelling at them to stop, felt scared about the situation I was in, don’t exactly know what I was scared of, scared of being hit, scared of being at the centre of attention I don’t really know what I was so scared of, my legs were shaking and I think the guys noticed that but still were willing to hear me out and sort out the situation peacefully. This situation just reminded me of countless times I’ve had any sort of confrontation whether arguing with friends or making a complaint at work, I just feel nervous and small. I try my best to mean well, I don’t condone violence or anything that can harm anyone, but when people need to be stood up to I’ll try my best, I just wish I didn’t feel so weak and helpless in these types of situations and cower within myself, do any of you guys feel the same way?

Seriously I didn't get my first kiss until two months ago (and I had to ask the guy to do it and he did). Like I question why a guy would hold hands with me, hug me, kiss me, or want to cuddle with me. I just feel like I have to keep my relationships with men private because I feel that they wouldn't want to be seen with me or have their friends know they have been doing stuff like hand and blowjobs with me. It's funny because every time I tell someone I'm a virgin they're like ""what are you waiting for? Saving yourself for marriage?"" I remember hanging out with a guy for the first time a couple months ago and he asked me how far I have went with a guy and I told him I had never even been kissed before and he was like ""are you fucking serious? You're 23 and have never been kissed before? You need to get out there girl.""

304,"I am currently a highschool student in Texas coming to my senior year. I have dyslexia, ADHD, ADD, dysgraphia, and Sensory processing disorder. All of these affect me from day to day. My school is required to give me accommodations, but faculty doesn't care. They reschedule tests for me to fit my extra time accommodation, but that causes teachers to give me more work than the other kids  for missing classes. Recently they rescheduled my ACT to give me even more time even though 3 trained proctors were free. This overlapped on a practice AP test I should have taken so my teacher gave me one night to do the entire test. While the other kids got 5 hours to do it at school. Another thing that happens constantly is that teachers announce my disabilities to the other kids in my class and they all make fun of me and call me autistic. And I'm not a sissy about getting made fun of but it's everyday and they watch everything I do to call me autistic or retarded.  I went to my principal about it and she wouldn't even look at me as I told her and nothing changed. When I went to take my AP test they made me walk out of the testing room with my proctor in front of all the other kids. And everyone started laughing at me and calling me the special kid with autism.  Then because I have to type my essays my proctor set up my test wrong. Which almost caused my test to be invalid, not to mention she refused to give me several of my accommodations. It took me days to get the school to not invalidate my test. I hate being like this I wish I was normal but I can't be and I need these accommodations.

I just want to ask if anyone else is dealing with this or has dealt with it. The school shouldn't be doing this to me legally. Should I seek legal help? I want this to stop because I don't know if I can take another year like this.

306,"I'm 19 and in school.


These past 6 months have been really tough for me as I've suddenly slipped into a period of reflection. I'm not sure what caused it, but I started to have really bad mood swings around the beginning of this year, and I couldn't really put my finger on it. Major self-reflection and introspection followed and anxiety/depression became the result despite usually being an upbeat and confident person. The anxiety is so bad I feel alienated around people I know well or used to at least feel comfortable around. After reflecting upon my life choices and social tendencies, I suspected myself of having a mental disorder out of panic and found many that I thought would have explanations. Failed friendships and relationships in my life seem to come together and make sense after doing extensive research.




 This makes the depression and anxiety worse.


I'm not sure what to do. I have priorities and goals to focus on as I'm in school and I feel therapy (as I feel is the appropriate option) would be too much on my mind and too much stress to handle altogether.




 Sometimes, I feel my mind slipping away from this idea and start to play with the possibility that I'm not mentally ill, and I simply just have some character issues to fix, and this is the sign. I'm sure this is my brain trying to run away from the problem, though. 




I'm not insured either, so I'll have to pay out of pocket which will be almost impossible. I want advice on what my next step for seeking help should be if I want to even find treatment and how I should assess these feelings. Remember, I currently feel that treatment would be a hiccup in my life that deviates myself on the path I've chosen to take.

1- I am always focused on the past, but I still have a good time in the present for the most part. It's just frustrating because I'm constantly missing friendships, thinking about missed opportunities, and just wishing some things could be like they used to.

2- All of my friends are growing up. They are all married, having kids, and they seem to enjoy it. I am married and have a great career, but my marriage sometimes feels like I'm being held down because I have such a free spirit. I love my wife to death, but she definitely is more plan oriented than me. I have no desire to have kids. I have two step kids and that is already so so hard for me. My friends are all so happy to be parents, and I just can't fathom that.

3- I am never satisfied. I get one thing, and then I am on to the next. I want to experience everything that I can. I am always selling things from past hobbies to move onto another.

It’s pretty nice but naturally there are still many obstacles to overcome for the residents who live here and not to mention those who grow close to the residents like myself.

I am a server and occasionally a bus person as well in the diner. Yesterday being Memorial Day we had a big picnic on our large back patio. Just about everyone came including their families. Well most of their families. Some didn’t have anyone to celebrate with. Such as this lovely woman named Angela (name changed for privacy reasons). She had no one to celebrate yesterday with but came to the picnic regardless. She has a lot of friends here but they were all either out doing something with their family or spending the picnic with their families.

This obviously upset her a great deal and she decided to go back to her room to eat instead. Today she told she used to be a beautiful singer. However since her moving in here speaking has been (to put it lightly) a very big challenge for her.

I want to do something for her to get her spirits back up. Maybe get her something to help her get through this. Any suggestions or thoughts are welcome.

326,"Let's start with my background. I performed very well in undergrad to get a mathematics degree with lots of courses in statistics and comp sci. I landed several internships as software engineers and was eventually hired as a full-time engineer. Through out undergrad and working full-time, I definitely felt exhausted. However, I could always find a way to meet or exceed expectations and so I thought it was just me being lazy or depressive. 

After a year of working and feeling like I didn't really accomplish anything at my engineering job, I decided to go back to graduate school. It felt great, and I was excited to land an internship at a local startup in my new location to hold me over until grad school started. The burnout got even worse as this startup was constantly trying to hustle everyone into being amazing. Thankfully, that ended and grad school started. Unfortunately, grad school was worse than anything I had imagined. The courses are interesting, but my department is severely out of touch with industry. When I try to ask questions about what we would do in industry, it becomes clear none of my professors even know how to respond and some even get frustrated. 

I have typically been a motivated self-learner. I attribute that to me getting my software internships early on while being a math guy. However, now I'm sitting at the end of my first year of graduate school questioning the real value in it and worried about my mental and physical health. I feel as if I could have learned everything I did over the year in only 3-4 months of dedicated study on my own. I would also be able to target marketable skills while learning it. 

What I need advice on is this: is it bad to take a year off for mental rest and self-learning? I think I need extended time off away from everything to just get myself into a position where I can actually enjoy what I do again find the curiosity I used to have. I technically only have one year left in my masters program, but it feels like an impossibility to even consider taking classes again (not even mentioning comprehensive exams).

331,"So I'm 17 and I'm still in high school, just finishing my Junior Year. My school always holds a week of exams the week before Christmas and Summer holidays so this week we have the summer exams. 

So far this year has been absolutely fantastic for me. I passed my driving test, managed to get myself a job for the summer and last week I was chosen out of my school to visit Lourdes in France with another few students from other schools which was an absolutely incredible experience. In fact, I don't have much bad words to say about my school. They've always been nice and fair and I've never actually been in any serious trouble during my five years attending, until today. My grades are typically average depending on which subject but we had a Maths exam today which is my poor subject but I really wanted to pass. Due to being in Lourdes and other issues, I've had no time to study or take time to focus on the exams and this never usually happens as I'm usually prepared. I didn't want to end my passing streak a week before school's out. 

When the paper hit the desk I saw nothing I knew and next to me were my peers writing and writing. I done an extremely foolish mistake of taking out my notes, looking at the answers and writing them down and of course, a teacher was behind me. I took the walk of shame when I was asked to meet her outside the exam hall and I'm sure most of my peers knew what had happened. I apologized multiple times, she understood and was calm about it and took me to the principal's office, thankfully, he also calm but I saw the look of disappointment in their faces. He let me re-sit the exam an hour later and I tried my best but probably failed. As soon as I left, I rang my mom and told her about it and she was okay and relaxed as she always is, but again, the disappointment in her voice hurt like hell. 

The principal filed a report about the incident which he would have to do and my maths teacher will be informed soon. My dad's reaction was tough too, I'd say he was the most disappointed out of everyone. I feel extremely ashamed right now. I don't cheat ever, only once or twice a while back but never like this. I still have exams this week which I will try my best at but I don't really know what to do.

333,"Spoiler Alert: This is WAY tl;dr

So anyways, had some friends back in town and the weather was glorious, so it felt like a great time to get out and about yada yada yada.  I ran into her on Friday, and she randomly told me that she always had a crush on me growing up. She was legitimately so young at the time when I was participating in varsity athletics and one of those girls that I remember running around and trying to sit with this girl that was around my age because the gal was her babysitter. Not really important. 

So as the night goes on, I'm getting pretty wasted and having a great time and then as the night is unwinding and I'm cabbing it home I realize I had an FB message from her. She asks for my Snapchat and I oblige. 

So we start messaging and I'm browning out hard at this time, but I know that the messages turned sexual. I think I remember her sending pics. I cannot say for sure. I know that I didn't send any because I had a buddy in the same room gaming. There is no way I was flogging the dolphin in front of him. 

So the next day is filled with a heightened state of disrepair. I check my phone to see some texts and I tell this girl that I'm sorry about the night before and she was fine. She asked what my plans were and if I wanted to go out on the river with some people. I thought it was harmless enough. Told her I was going golfing, but thanks for the offer.

So, I get done golfing and had forgotten my phone in the car and it had overheated. By the time I get the phone going again, I had missed 20+ messages. 16 of which were her. It really wasn't anything too crazy, or anything even out of line. But I felt like the entire idea of sending that many messages in between responses was way too much.

So I open up some Snaps on Snapchat, just to let her know that I've seen them and am not responding. She then says ""I'm scared right now, because I have crippling PTSD and I'm scared.""

So, I say ""scared about what?""

She says ""To be happy.""

I say ""Okay? I'm not following"". Clearly playing dumb.

She says ""I know that once I get happy it can all be taken from me."" 

At this point, selfishly, I'm thinking ""GOD FUCKING FUCK FUCK FUCK"" 

I say ""are you close to being happy?""

She says, ""Yes, I think so. Every time I got a notification from you, I got so happy."" 

I didn't respond for so fucking long. Because from my end, shit has really going awry at this point.

So I straight up tell her ""Listen, I'm going to be upfront with you. I'm not looking for anything right now. I'm not trying to get into a relationship because I don't know what the future holds for me and how long I'll be around this area."" I kind of softened it up, but that was the gist of it. 

&lt;Which is legitimately ALWAYS bullshit. If there was some girl I was really feeling, you would bend over backward to try and make it work. Even if she lived in fucking Tokyo. That is the starter pack for I'm embarrassed that I am even talking to you in the first place.&gt;

She says she agrees. And I'm feeling a sense of relief. 

So I feign some illness on Sunday and Monday in hopes that she would leave me alone and things would die down.

I would put her text to my response ration at 7 to 1 over that span.

So, today I wake up to a message saying ""Good morning! Hope you have a great day."" Which is a lovely thought and all, and bless her heart, but I was so fucking disgusted by it. My heart literally sank and I had a Peter Gibbons-esque ""case of the Mondays"" on this post-holiday Tuesday (that really is the brightside of all of this; it is Tuesday!) 

At around 9 a.m. she messages me that she had a parent chew her ass hard this morning. Come to find out she runs a daycare out of her house and according to her a parent came to drop their kid off there to day and she had told them last week that she wouldn't be watching their kids anymore. So she said that the husband of this lady sent her a really nasty message. I told her ""People say things when they get upset. I'm sure he is incredibly frustrated and spoke out of turn. I wouldn't take it too seriously.""

""Why ya gotta be so perfect"" was her response.

So as the day goes on..... she messages me that a lady I know well from growing up around her kids and she are discussing how great I am. 

As you can guess, I'm incredibly repulsed by this. I ask her how in the Hell did that get brought up. She kinda talked in circles about it. But now I'm really in trouble here, folks. I know this lady really well. I live in a small town and people talk. The fact that she already knows about us even speaking is bad news for me. And now I'm just thinking to myself that this isn't going to be good when they all find out how decidedly NOT great I actually am. 

The fact that I am mutual friends with so many of these people. My family has some status in the community. So, getting run through the mud here could be pretty bad for not just myself. Don't let me fool you, my concerns are nearly entirely self-involved. 

I cannot have this girl blowing up publicly on Facebook. 

My plan is to just continue to be nice to her, and reply sparingly, but to let this all die down and slowly peter out over time. Hopefully she will find someone new in the meantime. 

Let's hear how you would handle it?

334,"Hi, I am 22 yo male, just graduated from university (math&amp;finance degree) and I feel like I have no clue what to do with my life from now on.

Long story short: I grew up in some Eastern European country and at 16 yo I moved to Canada to study. I was pretty good at school and thus was able to secure a quite prestigious job at a small company in downtown Toronto as a management consultant which I will be doing full time now.

That said I have no clue anymore what I want in my life now. Moreover, I feel like beside my job skills (like being analytical, etc.) I don't have any real skill. 

Last few years I have been stressed about being able to succeed with women and basically all my life efforts were directed at trying to become better looking, more social, better at seduction and so on. During last few month I made quite a big progress in this area but I had a serious talk with one of my best friends and he told me that does not serve me well. By focusing so much on being liked by women I compromise my life, add too much stress to my life and basically base my happiness on whether women like me or not (which btw they still don't nearly as much as I would want them to for the effort I spent on this). I decided to completely put aside the whole women thing for now and just focus on my life and that is where I have no clue what I do from now.

As for my current interests, I closely follow MMA (huge UFC fan for past 5 years), I do fitness, I did martial arts in school but have to find new gym now since I will be moving to Toronto, I danced salsa and bachata a bit (also have to find new instructor), I follow politics and I enjoy reading about tech, business, politics and psychology

I kinda do have some 'goals' but they are very indecisive and my biggest problem is that every day I have new idea about what I want to do and by the end of the day its kinda gone and I want to do a new thing. The only consistent goal of mine is that I want to build my own business (Since I am already working in business advisory and I have expertise and I also read quite a bit of business related literature on free rime), but I have no clue what I kind of business I want to make since the best business you can build is the one based on your interests which I don't have many as you see. I have lots of small interests but none of them are really 'my passion' to the point I can make money off it.

As for the job I currently have is I actually like it because for a 22 yo I get serious responsibility in terms of projects I get and because its a small company diversity of tasks is also quite intellectually stimulating. But there are two big problems I have with my job which make me not want to turn it into a long term career: 
1) too much time spent staring at monitor which is horrible for health and for extremely social person like me
2) I can't make lots of money or passive income of it. Essentially my earning cap is salary+bonuses, whereas I would want my income to be more results based (which having my own business would be perfect for)

As for things I have been considering to make my life a bit spicier:
-getting a skateboard and/or bike. I feel like I want to do some sort of extreme sports to fill my adrenaline gap and that would be a good start
-joining improv/comedy courses since I love social interaction
-volunteering, I would not quite say I am very altruistic person but that could be a good way for me to meet people with good morals
-continuing dancing and combat sports training
(I like dancing but I am very bad at it, as for combat sports I like them but the skill is not that practical unless you compete)
-drawing (was good at drawing as a kid, but not quite sure I have a focus now)
-taking cooking classes, also a good way to meet people
-airsoft/paintball (I am big on military, history of wars was big interest of mine when I was a kid)
-traveling (already took solo trip to Europe and I loved it but its expensive)

Basically big problems with all of the above is either affording an interest (like airsoft or traveling) or having a focus (dancing or drawing) and I don't know where to start.

My personality:
Grew up as very shy introvert but arrogant. In my 16-20 I changed a lot since I started to feel lonely, especially moving to new country and I sorta became very social (and as I said also to get girls).
Mayors-Briggs - I am ENTJ
As you see I am also ambitious, but I feel its also quite a burden of mine because 'ambition' is very abstract. Its way better when you know specifically what you are doing. 
I don't do any drugs, barely drink and try to eat clean most of the time (although I eat pretty bad stuff at times to get enough calories for bodybuilding), don't play video-games or watch tv shows much but sometimes I do whenever I am tired, to recharge.

So yeah, looking on advises on where to start to get some sort of direction and fulfillment in my life, especially now, as I decided to give up on trying to rely for women to give me happiness. 

I also would like to outline 

**TLDR;** 22 yo, just finished uni, spent most of the last years trying to get women, did not acquire any valuable skill or passion, now don't know what to do with my life, would like to find a way to make a business that would allow me to try some of the more hobbies and focus on myself more.

Thanks everyone in advance for a valuable advice!

Everything I said in the text was true, they have treated me like their personal punching bag to vent to and never wanted to listen to anything I wanted to say.

Yesterday they sent a message asking me to pay them back, even though I owned them no money, I ended up paying them anyway just so I owed nothing and this could just be left.

341,"TL;DR: I've caught my accounts being used in different countries and don't know what to do.

Longer version: A few months back I was browsing through Netflix and saw a bunch of shows that it says ""I've already seen"" (Which I haven't) After a bit of investigation I found out my account is being used in two different countries (Plus my own). So I contacted Netflix about this, and they just said change my password. I did, but this week I saw there was still more activity.

342,"I've been at my current job for over 3 years. Not saying it's the worst job but half the time I really can't stand it mainly because of the employees. All the ones I liked have been long gone(except one that just left). For the amount of money I get paid I'm surprised I've stayed as long as I have. I know a little money is better than no money but I don't know if it's worth it at this point. 

So I'm just about done with 168 credit hours for a Real Estate License. I'm hoping to take the test in no more than 3 weeks from now and obviously have to pass to be able to get things started. However, it's not like I'm going to sell a house right away, but I can focus all my energy into Real Estate instead of my job. I'm also willing to pause on a few hobbies to save money.

I already have my schedule for June and makes me want to put in my 2 weeks today... Two Notes: The boss already knows I'm about to leave and said I could continue working there till I fully transition. Great. I was very appreciative but I'm just ready to go. Also, I live with my parents right now. Over the years they have seen the stuff I've gone through at the job and both at some point have said keep working there, or it's up to me if I want to leave.

I feel pretty confident about the test but if I fail I can retake it anytime till I pass for $40. Should I quit my job soon?

My mum has very high expectations for me which I know I will not be able to live up to. The two oldest brothers done really well and I’ve been told that I need to beat them.

I also feel like I’ve been given the short straw due to family issues which my oldest brothers didn’t need to deal with at my age. I’ve had to live with Jeff my entire life who developed serious anger issues which means that the house is 80% of the time just him shouting at my mum and my mum shouting back. Also he recently got into drugs which agitated him even more and his license got taken away from him due to speeding which means he spends even more time at home. I now stay silent around the house to avoid being shouted at or saying something wrong. I feel helpless when I’m around him because there’s no arguing with him, it’s always his way in the house. I know I’m most likely overreacting but he just really fucking pisses me off. He spends more time in my room than his room which means I need to go else where to revise or even out the house to the library just for a suitable studying environment. All this combined I feel has effected my studies massively. Because of the stress at home, the stress of studying and the stress of not being able to study I’ve become depressed and suicidal. Few of my friends know about my suicidal thoughts but none of my family as I know that I’ll be patronised by them knowing.

I don’t know, maybe I’m just genuinely stupid and looking for a reason or something to blame for the grades I am about to get. The exams haven’t even been done yet, I may be blessed with an easy paper and be complaining for no reason but I just want to know how I can prep my mum for the worst when she is expecting the best.

I've applied to everywhere I can think, and while I technically have a job right now, I get 6 hours a week max at minimum wage. I usually get rejection emails, or the interview goes poorly, or I am asked to leave my name and number and I never end up hearing back from them. 

I'm autistic, very socially anxious, and traumatized from my upbringing which is a cocktail for surefire unemployment it seems. Before moving, I didn't even have job experience.

The two fields are Military and Medicine. More specifically, the Marine Corps and a (possible) surgical specialty. 

My current plan is, while attending Community College part time, to enlist into the Marine Reserves. I've been in talks with a Marine recruiter for a while and I do want to join, even if its only the reserves for now. I also want to ultimately get my degree. 

If I joined the Marines (full time), my end goal would be to apply and hopefully make it into the Marine Raiders (MARSOC), which is the Marines' special operational forces unit. Hoping that I would join as an Special Operations Officer (SOO) if I went this route. 

If I went the medical route, I would hopefully make it into either a neurosurgical or orthopedic residency and finish that up and go from there. 

As you can see, both require a lot of time and dedication to achieve and neither option are a guaranteed success. As such, I will ultimately have to pick and choose one of the two options since doing both isn't really an actual/reasonable option.

356,"Hi everyone,

As I write this I realise this is a long one haha, I don’t know what information is useful or important so apologies in advance for the novel below!

So I’ve been dealing with this ongoing issue since I was a kid and at nearly 30 am still plagued with anxiety, guilt and stress over my mother’s situation. I’m hoping there might be others out there as siblings in the same situation, or parents going through this or have managed to change things, I’m open to any psychological input that might be useful also.

I moved far away many years ago and have for the most part totally disconnected from it all. I talk to my mum often on skype but I never ask about my brother and try to change subject if she starts to talk about him as it’s too stressful for me to think about her situation and makes me angry. She lies to me and covers things up anyway so I gave up a long time ago trying to help her change things as she refuses my advice and gets very defensive and accuses me of not being more sympathetic of my brother’s situation.

Problem is, I’m about to move back to the same city and I’m fearful being close to the situation again will upset me and take me back there mentally with all the anger and resentment I harboured towards my brother.

My older brother still lives at home with my mum and has done his entire life. He’s emotionally manipulative, abusive and controlling. He’s totally financially dependant on mum apart from government benefits he receives. Any work he rarely takes on doesn’t last long. I have witnessed him being physically abusive towards my mother throughout my life with threatening behaviour like punching walls, grabbing her etc. He wouldn’t let her have locks on her bedroom door to escape him or protect her valuables and would destroy the door if she put one on. I haven’t lived at home for a long time so it’s possible he’s done more than that, I wouldn’t know, she’d never tell me. My brother had violent tendencies towards me when I was a child also and emotionally tortured me via controlling behaviour and forcing me to remain in highly stressful situations where I had no escape.I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s hit mum. I don’t know if she’s afraid of him, I suspect in some way she likely is but also afraid of what would happen to him if he was left to fend on his own. I’m not afraid of him anymore, I just think he’s pathetic. Last time I was around him he skulked around and stayed out of my way, he knows I won’t put up with his shit and will call him out in front of anyone who might bear witness. He’ll always punish my mum for anything I do later though by ranting and raving at her so I stopped having a go at him a long time ago.

 I’m fed up with him using and abusing my mother financially and emotionally. He has ruined and controlled her life for years and I feel helpless to ever make it stop. I understand it’s not my responsibility but it tears me apart to watch my mother’s life become sadder and sadder the longer he’s there. 

I even feel guilty for moving on with my life and moving away for as long as I did. While I know my mum is happy I have a good life, a good job and a lovely husband, I feel like she’s always had a mixture of jealousy for my success/happiness and ability to escape that situation as well as maybe resentment/sadness for me abandoning her. 

My perspective though is that my mother is enabling this behaviour by making constant excuses for it and continuing to support him as she feels he’s not “mentally equipped” to deal with life himself as a result of our fathers narcissistic and abusive behaviour when we were growing up. I couldn’t tell you what is wrong with him as my mother never can, all explanations are very vague and usually stop at “you wouldn’t understand because you’re not sympathetic to his situation, your brother has alot of issues that are complicated”. Etc. I can tell you he’s definitely emotionally stunted in some way, narcissistic, has anger issues, depression, probably bi-polar as well. He can drive, maintain friendships, has worked, is capable of cooking food etc so he’s not exactly a 5 year old in a grown man’s body. 

When I say emotionally stunted I mean he takes no responsibility for his actions, blames everyone else for everything, likes to blame things on problems in his childhood often, has no sympathy for any of the shit he’s put my mother through, but plays the part of sad sorry little boy when he pushes things too far to get a reset with her and starts again. He will always put himself first and lives in total denial of his behaviour. I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s never sat down and really thought about why I don’t speak to him and what he put me through for a good 10+ years.

I do harbour some resentment (which I also feel guilty about!) for my mother for what I had to go through with him due to her refusal to stop enabling him. To me, it had always felt like she put one child before the other. Alot of my childhood and teenage happiness was sacrificed at the expense of my mother not being able to kick my brother out. She’s often said I’m “capable” and don’t have the issues my brother has and therefore didn’t need the same support. Which always made me angry.


To provide a bit of background:

My parents separated when I was maybe 13 and my dad left my mum for someone else, moved to another city and essentially started a new life and left us behind. One reason he did this and he told me so was because he could no longer stand to deal with my brother’s behaviour or my mothers worsening negative outlook on life and enabling behaviour regarding my brother. He’s a selfish man though and from what I can remember did very little to try and help my mum or address my brothers issues in his teens in any useful way aside from getting angry at him and putting him down, which made things worse. 

Basically his family was getting in the way of his happiness and he tapped out and started again elsewhere. I remained in contact with him for some years but got to a point as an adult where I realised he was a shitty person and not contributing anything positive towards my life except for my emotional need to have a father. I decided it wasn’t worth it and he wasn’t really a father.

I think my brother and I got on pretty well when I was very young but as soon as he hit his teens he became a real asshole and would bully and control me alot. We often both got punished by our father because of his behaviour, for example he’d hurt me and I’d scream and my dad would come in and whip us both for the raucous. No doubt my father’s actions when we were children damaged my brother alot, questionable things happened that I don’t want to talk about and have put behind me. I don’t know if we were sexually abused, the truth is I can’t remember anything but I have a general sense that it may have happened. Maybe my brother knows and remembers, I don’t have a desire to find out to be honest. I dealt with my father’s controlling behaviour and violent punishments alot better than my brother did, I don’t know if my father abused my brother more than what I witnessed and experienced myself though. 

Things got worse when my dad started staying in other cities for months on end because of work. As my brother got older he became more angry and more controlling. He started smoking weed heavily and had dropkick shitty friends around our house all the time when dad was out of town. You had to walk on eggshells around him, for example he might still be sleeping at midday and if you were making noise doing something he’d get up and come violently scream at us that he’s trying to sleep. I felt like he controlled the whole home and it deeply upset and disturbed me that my mother seemed to do little to stop it.

I spent years begging my mum to kick him out as I was really suffering living in that toxic environment. All the typical stuff happened as I got older. I fought terribly with my mum alot, started drinking and smoking weed, hanging out with bad older crowds, my grades got worse and worse, I lost interest in school and spent alot of time out of the house. I desperately wanted to escape my mum and brother. Eventually I finished high school and moved out. 

I met my lovely husband and we have lived together ever since. We moved away 8 years ago. It’s taken me years of distance from that situation to move on from it. There are lingering effects, the most obvious is i’m a control freak, I organise everything, I don’t like being at the mercy of other people’s plans. If someone slightly toxic comes into my life I will cut them off immediately. I’m very selective of who I’m friends with and don’t do casual acquaintances. I’m either very close to someone or not at all. I can’t cope with really negative people and I jump if someone shouts or gets angry.

When I moved out I no longer had to live within my brothers toxic environment but I had to witness my mother stuck in it, willingly. At first I used to get angry at her and tell her she needed to kick him out and basically put him down at every opportunity I had. I realised this just pissed her off and made her resent me a little for being so ‘mean’ about her son. She’d get angry and tell me I didn’t know what I was talking about. So I just started holding my tongue.

To this day he doesn’t work, he doesn’t contribute to any bills, he barely does any house work, he still has shitty friends over, he bullies my mum for money and use of her car all the time. She can never afford to do anything and spends most of her time at home. His behaviour has made her a really negative person and because they’re both living in this awful living situation she takes on some of his personality traits like a short fuse, easily frustrated, a difficult and argumentative attitude, super defensive, really unmotivated, depressive etc.

I can’t bear the thought of this being my mums life for the rest of her days on earth. She used to be a pretty happy person, she’s smart and funny and loving when she’s not in a super negative headspace. I want to spend many happy days with her in the future without my brother interfering  and ruining my relationship with her. 

I’ve actually recently even paid to fly her to me to the country i’m in for a month long holiday with myself and my husband before we head home. I’m kind of hoping being far away from my brother for so long will give her a fresh perspective on life, but i’m somewhat doubtful. I know he will still be calling her everyday asking for money and dumping his problems on her. She should be excited for this upcoming trip but currently she’s just stressing out about what my brother will do for a month, how he will cope, needing to give him enough money to keep him alive and entertained while she’s gone. 

Regardless of the outcome of this trip. I refuse to let my brother back into my life again when we go home. I’ve told my mother many times I don’t want to talk about him, hear about him or see him. If she doesn’t want to take any advice from me or let me help in anyway then I refuse to just sit and listen to her woes feeling upset and stressed about something I have no power to change.

The most frustrating thing is she mentions every now and then she wants me to have a relationship with my brother and that he misses me and it hurts her that we don’t talk etc. This really pisses me off when she brings it up and i’ve had to remind her on several occasions of the shit he put me through, why I don’t speak to him and how selfish it is that she expects me to sacrifice me mental well being for his. Let alone the fact we have absolutely nothing in common, have nothing to say to each other and no reason see each other. 

Well disjointed rant over. I’m tired and need a coffee and a chocolate after that exhausting rehashing of life! 

If anyone has any advice for ways I can help my mum without hurting myself emotionally/mentally or involving myself with my brother please let me know! 

And if any younger kids / teenagers are out there reading this and going through anything like the above, I encourage you to remain strong, focus on your school work, develop strong friendships with good people and try not to let your sibling consume your life. If you’re being abused or controlled in any way tell someone! I regret never going to counsellors or authorities. I didn’t want to embarrass my mum and feared they wouldn’t take me seriously. But no child deserves to grow up an environment like that, you deserve better! Don’t let this define you like I nearly did! Feel free to message me if you want some advice from my own personal experiences. I’m no psychologist but I know what I would have done differently now.

360,"So a couple of days ago I made a similar post but now my sister and brother in law (and their two kids) moved in with my dad and a lot has happened. There is so much that has happened that I will just make a list

My brother in law brought a camper where he planned on living ( yes 4 people in a SMALL camper) 

His dad and mom then RENTED him a bigger RV and that did not make my dad happy or anyone in my family happy ( it will most likely increase the electric bill)

So my brother in law has an RV, a motorcycle (that doesnt work and that he no longer uses), a POS car, and a car that they cant get rid of bc they owe so much money on

My sister isnt buying her own food and is leeching and when she does buy food she is getting junk food 

They spend a lot of time in our house, my brother was inside playing video games and he even brought in his own xbox to install in my parents home 

I love my siblings but she does a poor job of taking care of them and doesn't try to keep them quiet when they do cry

My sister is constantly washing clothes and leaving her stuff everywhere

I also forgot to mention that the place that they were renting before moving here is a mess. My uncle was kind enough to rent them a home for very little money but they left that home with a lot of holes in the walls and a very dirty carpet, my brother and sister still have junk in that home

And ONE more thing, this junk is just some of the things they have, they rented a storage to keep all their other junk

I don't know how to talk to them, especially my brother in law, him and his family act like nothing is wrong, theyre all smiles, his family is also the main reason theyre hoarders.

When I was a kid I was hit as punishment, till I was 10 when my mum took it too far. She cried and didn’t look at me that whole night, until my father took me to bed. I was never hit again, but she never apologized. I’ve been distant from my family since then, also because I would be yelled at a lot. My parents give rough love I guess. My family is good on money, they would buy me almost anything but the way they do it brought me down a lot. They would say “look at all the stuff you have, shouldn’t you be happy” “other mums would never let you get piercings” “you don’t love us, and we gave you everything”. This hurt me a lot.

I grew up in a pretty racist household, for my love of anime I was told that I would marry someone Asian. I was also told how bad people with darker skin is, how they rob, or rape. Of course I know this is all untrue and have no problem with people of other races or sexuality.  I won’t lie as a kid it did make me want to stay away from other race kids, at the time. I was also told at the time, that women are meant to serve for their husbands. My father would make me get him water or clean, saying “you’re a girl, girls are supposed to do this”.

Now I’m just kinda ignored, only brought up to friend if I do something good. Often my parents would have these mood swings, when they would randomly tell me they love me. It’s just odd to me, since almost my whole life and still I’ve been yelled at.  I was basically brought up by my sister, she’s like another mum to me. She was there when i cried and there to listen to me. Of course she moved out, and started a family of her own.  

I’m conflicted with my family’s love, I’ve been mocked. I’ve had people bring up my self harm, saying “oh look doesn’t that bring up memories” or “remember when you did that”. But why do they act another way in public, I don’t know what’s normal. They do things, and take me places where I’m uncomfortable. I get it their my parents, but I can’t deal with crowds or with people I don’t know. They don’t know what OCD or depression does to a person, if they did they wouldn’t look at me weird when I was my hand after someone touches me, or my rituals. I’m just that other person that makes the family look good. I don’t want to be faked loved anymore, please if anyone has advice please share.

370,"Hey r/advice, I need some help talking to a girl in my life

Last year I started school at a brand new high school and on the first day of school I met this girl and she was the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. During the year I started to kind of talk to her more and more and I suppressed my feelings for her because I didn't want people to know that I liked her. The more talked to her though, the more I realized how much I liked her.    I'm still angry at myself for not asking her out back then but at the time one of closer more trustworthy friends told me that she wasn't in to  dating so I decided to just back off and low low for a bit. 

Fast forward a year and this year has been pretty shitty. For starters, at the beginning of the school year I suffered an injury playing a sport and I was couldn't workout or anything so I was in an extremely shitty place to say the least. My confidence took a huge dip andy friend group basically fell apart so I didn't have anyone to talk to.

At the start of 2nd semester I got promoted to the 2nd band and I was basically around a whole new group of people and I made a new group of friends but I also saw that the girl was in my class now. During the whole semester though I only talked to her once and I caught immense feelings for her.

I don't know how to talk to her in person because of the way band is and the school year is ending and I want to able to talk to her again. I do have her Instagram so that's a plus. 

So my question is after all this time of not talking to her, how do I reconnect and ask her out (whether be via DM's or IRL?)

371,"Hey guys I am freaking out right now I don't know what to do or who to even talk to about this. Throwaway account for obvious reasons. Sorry for formatting I'm on mobile.


Tl;dr:This weekend we had a memorial day gathering outside of work, and I woke up in my supervisors bed, and I'm not really sure what happened.


So I work in a corporate office environment in an entry level position. About 80% of the staff are alumnae from the same college, we all knew of each other in passing or through attending class together that's how I got this job; through one of my friends there. As a result we're a pretty tightknit group and hang out regularly.

I was assigned to B's team, B is seemingly a nice guy, he's typically the life of the party at work and during out of work hang sessions. B clearly has a crush on me and has had one since I started working there. B won't say anything but he's always very flirty and a little too interested in what I'm doing. That being said I'm well aware of the complications that may arise from engaging in a relationship in the workplace let alone with a direct supervisor (don't shit where you eat). I've always been very curt, professional and friendly (within reason) with him and feel I have done nothing to indicate interest in him. My career is very important to me and I worked my ass off to be here so I never wanted to do anything that might jeopardize that. 

On to the day of the event, we all went out for dinner and drinks. The numbers started to dwindle as people went home, so B suggests that the rest of us go to his place to chill; which is something B would do after any drinking event as he's got a fully stocked bar down in his basement. We head over there; we play multiplayer games, we eat snacks, and crack jokes. The last thing I remember is playing Mario cart and the next thing I know I'm waking up with a splitting headache/migraine sans clothes in B's bed. B was passed out like the living dead so I hurriedly put my clothes on and got out of dodge. 


I really don't think I drank enough to get pissy drunk like that. I know my limit and I was no where near it, but that being said I didn't let my glass out of my sight the whole night. Even when we were playing video games I made sure to note where my glass was. In fact I'm pretty sure I was trying to eat snacks to sober up at that time. I'm not really sure what happened, or what I should do next. Part of me thought maybe I should go to the ER to be evaluated, but the other part of me was scared of the implications associated with either answer. 

He had been in touch on Monday  texted me a ""how are you?"" Which I didn't reply to. I saw him today at work and he kept glancing at me all day, I didn't make much effort to talk to him and when I left for the day he texted me a ""everything ok?"" I still haven't responded to to that either.

I’ve recognized a pattern of applause from my higher-ups: I only receive good feedback when I make personal sacrifice for the job. Examples include coming in on my days off, staying hours late, working even when I am sick, working through breaks, etc.
When I exercise my right to saying no (I.e. not answering the phone off the clock, saying no to covering a shift, calling in sick, asking for fewer hours, etc.) I am told I am not thinking in an “all for one, one for all” or “one team” mindset.
To say the least, I stress about my job off the clock. I have anxiety the day before I work and when I’m at work and when I leave. I want to be in good standing with my job and have often sacrificed going to classes or doing homework assignments to keep a good relationship. Even when I feel I have done well, I am still told how I could’ve done it better.
One of my bosses has yelled at me some times and told me that others have a low opinion of me. I beat myself up a lot about this job.

The negative environment I feel like I’m in is totally draining me. I come home exhausted and dreading the next day and I’m miserable. 

I’ve always kind of wanted to be a teacher, but the pay is really discouraging me. I’d be taking a 35% pay cut and I don’t know if I can even afford that with my student loans and bills every month.

377,"Hey guys! So I had made a similar post like a month ago but some things have changed so I wanted to make a new one.

Anyway, basically I graduated from college in December with a media degree. I had been applying to jobs for months in my home state (Ohio) and wasn't having any luck. Finally, I had decided I'd just move to California since I interned there a previous year and enjoyed it, and figured I'd probably have more luck finding a media related job in LA. A week later after I had resolved to just move to California, I got a job offer at a video production company in Ohio that I had applied to.

Sounds great and everything because that means I wouldn't have to move after all. EXCEPT I kinda was looking forward to moving there. So I decided to fly out to LA to visit some old friends this past weekend and see how I felt after being there. Well I absolutely loved it. There are so many things to do and see. It was amazing and felt like a big adventure. 

So now I'm back in Ohio and really conflicted on what to do. I have this job opportunity in Ohio that's a guaranteed thing. It is the logical thing to do to take the job because it's cheaper to live in Ohio and I could save up more money this way, and it's even in my field.

383,"I am an agnostic atheist who hasn't gone to church in at least 6 years, and have no intention of ever going back. My cousin, who is also my goddaughter, and whom I love  to death will be making her confirmation in 2/3 years. Now a days with the Catholic Church, you need to be a practicing catholic who has been confirmed and can prove it \(along will all these other documents\). I stopped going to church before I could make my confirmation because at the time, and couldn't make it afterwards because I was going to a religious school and needed 50 hours of community service before I could do it. 

I'd have to go to all these adult CCD classes for at least a year, and possibly have to attend church in this time period.

Theres also confession at a number of points, which I can only think of saying bullshit sins like ""my fav hoodie is mixed fabric"" and ""I like reading gay romance"" 

Best part? If at any point they think I'm not ""feeling it"" I can be dropped without a refund to the classes and my cousin is out support for this big day for her.

Now, I'm not officially ""out""  as an agnostic, but I do drop hints at it, such as calling out the church and hiding pedos, and stating that I won't baptize my children when I have them. 

So, I'm mainly looking for advise on:

*  How to get through the classes and be a believable christian without being a obvious liar
* How to not loose my mind in church
* If my zealot grandmother is manipulating me again, how to deal with that in such a public setting 
* Some suggestions on what ""sins"" I should confess

Going to community college would mean I have to move to a new town and find a place to rent.

I keep thinking I should work through December to save up and start school in the spring, but then I wonder if I'm just having analysis paralysis and trying to talk myself out of making a life change. I also JUST managed to pay off my undergraduate student loans in January and it feels idiotic that I'm taking more on within the space of a year.

393,"Hello. I'm a 16 years old boy. 6 months ago I met 2 new people. Right now this 2 people are my closest friends. Let's call them Emma and Tonny. I became best friends with Emma 6 months ago and our friendship really skyrocketed. 3 months ago I met Tonny. Tonny and Emma are in a relationship. I didn't mind at all that Emma got in a new relationship and Tonny is one my favourite people. I really love them both equally. I'd do anything for them and I'm quite lucky to be spending a lot of time with them. They are the only people I look up to and they made me a better person. Emma feels the same way about me, Tonny less so, even though he does know how I feel and I don't mind that he doesn't think that I'm his best friend, even though I do. I can't stress enough, how important they are to me. They are the only reason I'm haply and helped to be ome with myself since I'm gay in a country where I'm not accepted and I have misophonia. When I observe other people's relationships I rarely/never find a friendship as strong as ours. So, this is definitely not just a ""teen"" friendship that will be over bc of a silly argument. We've argued before and just the thought that after we graduate we won't be as close, made me and Emma cry many times about it.

Nkw that we've established how important this friendships are. My problem is that I always have the fear that something will happen to our friendship. Everything is great and realistically nothing will happen. However I can't stop this feeling. I've been feeling lime this for months and yes, I told them

395,"After years of not talking after high school, I decided to look her name up and see how she's been over the years. I sent her a PM and she replied, and we exchanged pleasantries. Things are very amiable between us. 

We've been hanging out multiple times a week lately. We chat and get along great with no problems. A few days ago, she told me that she is emotionally unavailable to be in a relationship. Note, I never asked her about possibly dating. She was venting to me that friends of hers are always intertwined together in public and she was being annoyed/jealous by it. After I inquired as to why she wasn't in a relationship, then she told me that she's emotionally unavailable.

Well, earlier today she changed her relationship status to In a relationship with ""Jeff"". Obviously not his real name. I'm conflicted here. I feel a little angry that she lied to me. I don't understand why she'd tell me something and do a 180 so suddenly. 

Now, the two of us were somewhat flirty with eachother. We brushed against each other and gave friendly pokes and touches. Nothing was ever implied and neither of us directly asked if the other wanted to date. 

I still want to hang out with her, and I admit that I was enjoying the time rekindled and hoped we could grow as more just as we did a few years ago. Though, now I'm having doubts. I don't want to sour the friendship by ostracizing her because she's in a relationship, but I can't get over the fact that she lied.

I highly doubt that she intentionally lied to me and then posted the current relationship, just to hurt me. As I said, it was a friendship and nothing more. I doubt she even guessed that I may have wanted more, since I never said anything. 

Any advice here? I'm cool with her being in a relationship, although a bit jealous. The lying thing is what gets me. I'm not sure if I can trust what she says anymore. What would you do if you were in my shoes?",29May2018,0

2. When we get to the spot, he tell me to instead go to a Kroger 7 mins away. I agree since he’s already in the car.
3. Kroger turns into neighborhood. I drive into a sketchy neighborhood. We’re supposed to be finding his “sister,” but he’s using the opportunity to ask everyone in the neighborhood for money out of my window. 
4. He gets out of the car to grab money from a woman. I bolt, done with this dudes shit.

398,"I recently started dating a girl (about 6 months into the relationship now). We’re in high school, for some background on it. For a while she’s been battling new feelings for girls, because up until a month or two ago, she had not thought she was bi. We found that she truly was bi because of the way she acts in the presence of another girl she’s interested in, and finding that she has crushes on girls she had not noticed before. I told her that I was perfectly okay with her hooking up with girls if she wants because I support her opening up about her sexuality. She hasn’t even come out to many people, so we’re still testing things out.

The thing is, today she hooked up with her first girl (with my permission, of course). I thought it’s be fun for both of us to talk about it, but I’ve noticed that I’m getting increasingly more jealous? I don’t even really know the word for it. But I’ve realized that because she’s bi, she sees guys and girls as basically the same in the way that she can get crushes on both sexes. So the way she’s hooking up with whatever girl she wants is basically the same as her hooking up with any guy she wants, which I’m not comfortable with. Should I talk to her about it and maybe tell her I don’t want her to do this anymore? Or should I just get over it and let her explore her sexuality?",29May2018,2

I was snapping on snapchat back and forth with a friend from university I haven't seen in 4 years. We were kind of close before and we'd open up with each other alot but it's platonic. She told me she had a tinder date last weekend and I mentioned  I was doing my own human tinder where I was walking around and meeting girls. Then yesterday I came across an article on Facebook where they  discussed a tinder experiment where a guy posed as a male fitness model and would send girls sexual messages and within 2\-3 texts, girls gave him their number. I jokingly texted her the link and asked ""Is that  you?"". She responded just now saying that makes her uncomfortable and that doesn't happen easily.

I feel terrible and I'll apologize saying I didn't mean to offend her and at first glance, I didn't realize how bad the messages were. And I never actually thought she'd be easy, it was meant as a joke. I'd hope she'd understand that we've talked enough that I'd hope she wouldn't feel awkward about it. I respect her alot and I was hoping to catch up with her now she's moved back to the city. We've been trying to have dinner with some friends but it keeps getting postponed due to busy schedules with finance exams and now I may have ruined it with that text.

I could be over analyzing but keep in mind I feel this way because  despite being seen as a social, friendly guy I've never really been on a  date and am a virgin at 27 years old. I've make a change over the past 2/3 years to become more daring and it felt good just have a girl who I see as a friend. She mentioned how I have guts to go up and approach girls, I figured maybe we could reconnect and I could wingman her. I'd like the feeling of helping as I've always been like that in school and stuff. I  know in the past she's always said I'm a really nice guy and after graduating, I sent her a message telling her how much I respect her personality and how she accepts and treats others and she really enjoyed it. I hope this isn't a big deal and we can maybe hang out again. Although I'm iffy on just hanging out alone with her since I don't want to make her feel uncomfortable.

So  am I right in just apologizing and letting her know my honest intentions of that joke? We've argued before but never where I've felt sleazy/creepy. I figured after that I can just try and suggest a date for all of us to meet for dinner to change topics or just ask how her dog is.",29May2018,1

Hello, F19 here. I've never been in a relationship, and I know shit about flirting and approaching boys. So, there's this dude in my class, we're good enough friends, we joke around a lot, although we don't really talk about deep shit. He's always teasing me, and always trying to correct me on stuff he thinks he's right about, even when he clearly has no clue. He told me he does this with everybody \(when I asked him why he kept torturing me so much\) and I think it might be true, I've seen him joking like this with other people, so I'm not sure it's a sign. When we talk he doesn't hold eye contact for a lot, like he'll look you in the eye for about a second and then wander and then back at you, all while talking with you. Not sure if it's lack of interest or he's really just awkward that way \(he's kinda awkward in general, sometimes stammers over his words, v cute\). He laughs at most of the things I tell him, which are all either silly or teasing. He has the most beautiful laugh I've ever seen like it reaches every corner of his face, like, how. I can't flirt. Like, how I talk with him is the most I've ever done in my life, since usually I'm unable to be witty with my crushes, and I just agree with everything they say, resulting little to no interesting. But I can't bring myself to touch him in anyway. Some days ago I saw him at a party, and I thought he wanted to high five, he didn't, and I awkwardly rested my hand on his chest, before fleeing because my friend was calling me \(it was a music festival, we had to stay together\). That's my maximum. A couple of times we hung together with a group in my class that is very tight knit, so we 2 were a bit on the outside of their inside jokes, and he kept leaning onto me when laughing \(we were side to side\), touching me like a couple of times. Sometimes I feel like he laughs at some of the awkward things I do as if he knows I like him and is amused by how much he can offset me, but he's never hinted any of this, it could just be that I've read too many slow burn fanfictions in my teens lol. He's single, but he told me today that he had to go to this kind of cultural event where there would have been many american girls, and he had to go home first to make himself pretty in case he met Scarlet Johansson or someone like that. He was joking, but if he liked me why would he have brought up interest in other hypotetical girls? Finally, although I don't really believe in leagues and stuff like that, aesthetically on here I've been rated at about a 5.5, so a bit above average. I have a very pretty face and am 5'9'' tall, but am a little bit overweight. I'm losing weight, so it might get higher soon. He's also a bit above average looks wise, I'd say at a 6.5 or 7? Idk to me he's a 10 but for reddits standards it's probably too much. He's very tall and very skinny \(no muscles\) and has a beautiful face with big light blue eyes and dark hair and a bit of beard. I know this is a lot but I really don't know what to do in these kind of situations. Is he interested in me? What should I do next? I'm getting more and more reckless because next year he'll go 6 months in another country, so the more that time gets close the less I care about consequences. I don't even know what I'd want to do if we get together somehow. I don't believe in long distance. But that's a problem for future me. Send help.

I am a female in my mid\-20s, and married \(will be relevant later\). As my username suggests, this anxiety revolves around shitting. Particularly, pooping in places when I am around people I know.

After years of normalizing this in my head, I am at terms with the fact that I have toilet anxiety that is negatively impacting my relationships and life experiences.

My husband and I are part of a core group of friends that go on trips together. For example, once a year we all go camping for 3 days, where there are no restrooms. This is a huge cause of anxiety for me because: I have never shit outdoors, and I cannot stand the thought of others knowing that I am shitting, or even worse, the possibility of getting caught. I am ashamed of this but each year I ate very little and also left the trip early so as to avoid having to poop while camping.

We are planning a week long summer road trip with this same group of friends. We will all both camp \(with no bathroom\) and stay in airbnbs that will likely only have one restroom. I really want to go on this trip, but I will inevitably have to crap at some point. I am considering backing out of the trip for this one reason.

I can't think of what exactly caused this issue, but there are some instances that I believe amplified the problem. Firstly, when I was in college a teacher at my uni was arrested for recording people in one of the single unisex bathrooms \(which I used...\). Secondly, a long\-ago ex\-boyfriend made some comment along the lines about how he does not like when I burp, and do other ""gross"" things around him because it takes away from the romance/attraction and ""femininity"" in the relationship. My husband doesn't think like this,  thank god, though I still try to not do these things  around him. If I do, I always apologize with the fear that he will one day become unattracted to me because of doing something that every fucking person does. The fear applies to others \(friends, relatives, coworkers\), too, that they will also think I am ""gross.""

My husband and I are newlyweds \(about a year\) and started living together after we got married. I actively try to avoid him ever knowing that I am pooping, going to the lengths of waiting hours to use the restroom until he leaves, etc. If I am using the restroom while he is here, the paranoia strikes hard. I fear that if he knows I am in the restroom he will think or know that I am pooping, and thus think I am gross/disgusting/unladylike. \(Which I know is fucking stupid, because everyone fucking poops. I do the courtesy flushes, keep the sink on, etc., but living my life like this in a constant state of paranoia has become very tiring.\)

I can only use private restrooms when at work or school, or I just wait uncomfortably until I get home. When I am on trips with the in\-laws, I try to be stealth and only use the bathroom before showering, or wait to use a public restroom, or just not eat and wait until we are home. This also makes holidays feel really shitty because there is no way in hell that I could crap at their house. This isn't healthy and I am often uncomfortable which always takes away from the joy of these trips, but it is like I can't stop doing this.

My husband knows of this problem, and I know that he does not think the same things my ex thought. He has been incredibly supportive, but he is not a therapist and I hate discussing this with him because I do not want to drag his life down with mine. He will \(understandably!\) be upset if I back out of the road trip, too.

I've never seen a therapist but I am considering it. \(How the fuck do you even talk about this to someone, *in person*? Hah.\)  The paranoia has been so bad lately that \(I think?\) I get anxiety attacks and then I feel like a fucking idiot afterwards, but the cycle continues.

Thank you for reading, and any advice is greatly appreciated.

Right now I'm in a program that will get me jobs \(if I'm able to pass the degree; I'm losing motivation\), but if I switch, the only way I can be competitive is to get a Masters or PHD.

4/5 months pass, they call me in for a meeting and offer me a role with a lot more responsibility and risk. But at the same rate of pay. 

The question I am asking is, how do I go about asking for a rise in pay and justifying it?

My plan is to finish my contract in 4 years and use the GI Bill to finish a SoftwareE degree and maybe a ChemE degree.

My current job is very flexible so I would be able to cut down how much I work and still be guaranteed a certain amount of hours outside of uni which would most likely not be the case with the new job. I’m not sure if I should persevere with my current job and just ignore the blatant favouritism or move on.

435,"I \(19F\) met this guy \(21M\) a few months ago through Tinder and I've always known that he was depressed and suicidal, and that he had a very nihilistic view of the world. We drank together when I first met him and he told me all of this. I also accidentally read through his journal at one point and there were a lot of darker thoughts in there. We became friends with benefits and that lasted for several weeks, but I wouldn't say we were exactly friends. I had just gone through a breakup and was using him as a rebound, and came over a lot at night. We'd do homework together \(we go to the same university\) and then sleep together \(sometimes it led to more\) but most nights we wouldn't talk very much.

He likes being alone and doesn't think it's worth putting effort into people and relationships of any sort because everything is temporary, and he doesn't see the point in living life. He doesn't care about people and is also afraid to care, but at the same time, he's lonely and wants someone who can understand him and relate to him. Even though my friends told me it was dangerous to stay with someone who isn't capable of feeling or caring about anything, I stayed with him because I wanted to prove to him that life isn't meaningless and that he's capable of forming relationships with others \(everyone else he's opened up to in the past about his depression and suicidal tendencies has cut off contact with him\). I could relate to his way of thinking and wanted to prove to him that people do care about him. I got emotionally attached to him and was affectionate around him because I cared about his well\-being and liked him, even though he couldn't reciprocate those feelings. I came over pretty often because I was really lonely at the time, and one night I came over even though he really wanted to be alone that day because I just wanted someone to be around. He told me that he needed space for a few weeks, and I didn't contact him or come over for three weeks. I knew he probably didn't want me to come back \(if anyone needs that much space that means they don't want you around at all anymore\), but texted him after three weeks and asked if I could come over again anyways. He said no, and I kept begging him for a while before leaving him alone. A few days later I texted him saying that even though he prefers to be alone, he's capable of forming connections with others and he can't spend his entire life pushing people away and letting relationships self\-destruct on purpose. I also told him that I hoped one day he would find someone or something worth his time and that he could message me if he ever needed anything. He blocked me shortly afterwards without saying anything back, and that was about a month ago.

I don't know if I actually have feelings for him or if it's just emotional attachment because I used him to get over my ex or if I just miss being friends with benefits\- maybe it's a combination of all of them. I still follow him on Spotify just so I know he's still alive and doing okay, and recently I've had the strong urge to message him through Reddit through a throwaway account \(without telling him who I am\) and talking to him there. Part of me does care about him and I want to know how he's doing mentally these days and I want to help him, but he doesn't want anything to do with me anymore. I know that there's no guarantee he'll respond if I message him through a random account and for no apparent reason \(he doesn't post or comment very often\), and that it's just not a good idea to get involved with him anymore. Can someone please talk me out of doing this or give me advice in general? It'd be greatly appreciated.

Tldr, a guy I was fwb with cut off contact with me because he doesn't see the point in forming relationships and I was being too clingy but I still want to reach out to him anonymously through Reddit to check on his mental state.",29May2018,1
436,"Someone roofied me with (I think) crystal meth in a nightclub. I was already super drunk and knew I was taking a mild stimulant drug but didn't know it was ice... the guy tried to rape me later but i was too out of control to lead me away, I think. 

 I went super psycho, got really gross / sexual / racist (?), did some kind of sexual stuff with someone in the bathroom... at the time I thought it was a sexual assault cos I was hallucinating and thought he threatened me, but I think I even instigated, thinking it's not real and hallucinating. Reality kept changing every second and I was terrified.

I confessed to all kinds of strange unhygienic stuff and acted in extremely unhygienic ways... some confessions were almost true but exaggerated, some made up. Think I ate food off the floor, tried to lick a toilet, tried to defecate in front of the man, and I think I remember that it occurred to me in my psycho state to consider biting the person's penis off... some of the tamest examples of just generally grim stuff. 

After the sexual incident was over, I burst out of the toilet and confessed to cheating in front of all these random men in the toilet queue, made up stories of how I'd cheated before, believing my own lies. And I confessed to loads of other weird disgusting stuff like paedophilia, incest, bestiality, terrorism, etc, trying to destroy myself. i made up nice detailed small stories to come across as weird, disgusting and/or horrible on purpose too. AND i said untrue horrible things about all my friends and revealed their 'secrets' (but mostly made up secrets) 

That night I said really weird racist stuff, confessed to a lot of fake beliefs to attribute to and destroy ""normal me"" and after the incident I went extremely racist and extremely abused people :( I thought I was my own evil twin or a possessing evil spirit and that I had to ruin the normal version of me. 

People also looked through my phone to find evidence of wrongdoing, and the worst thing is that there WERE really dodgy messages. Nothing I meant to be racist at the time, but really insensitive jokes, and stereotyping nationalities more than races. 

People also have videos of me being extremely racist, evil, abusive, cringey and gross. 

I guess I need advice on 1) How to try and make it right? I'm trying to give money to some anti-racism charities but it's not enough. 
2) Do I really believe all those weird racist things I said deep down? I think some of my confessions were inspired from racism from tv shows, but some I think came from thoughts that crossed my mind for less than a second and i didn't think about at the time. 
3) It will be bad for me when the video/s surface, although maybe I deserve it for being so evil and abusing people. 
4) I've become really mentally ill and tourettes-y as a result of this episode and want to get better? The whole thing was like a crazy nightmare and my brain was SO broken, I really did think I was a possessing evil spirit. I'm so grateful that my boyfriend has forgiven me.",29May2018,0

Granted I had a very shitty year but I'm having a hard time climbing out of the hole I seem to have dug myself. After her mom passed recently, my mom went batshit crazy and turned on me because she got convinced I loved my dad more than her. She's been trying everything in her power to make me move out ever since. She also attempted to make me look like a terrible person to the extended family. Some believed her, some didn't. The only thing worse than someone thinking you're a disrespectful asshole is someone feeling sorry for you because they notice that your mother is out to get you.

441,"Without getting too specific, I am having some challenges at work regarding my role, and how my role is utilized across different teams. My job requires me to use a suite of tools that were not necessarily built for a business like ours. Why do I use these tools? Because the company I work for develops these tools. 

Due to the limitations of the tool suite, as well as office politics, lack of workable processes, and a young and inexperienced workforce, I am constantly feeling like a failure. 

My predecessor, we'll call him Josh, had been at the company for 7 years before leaving early last year. There is perhaps no one in the company who knew the ins and outs of these tools better than him. When he said something couldn't be done, it was the gospel. I don't have the same credibility he did despite my over 10 years of experience in the role I am in. I find myself having to constantly say no to people.

So for comparison, imagine being a skilled graphic designer but you go to work for Microsoft and they want you to use Microsoft Paint for all of your design work. Your predecessor, while not being as skilled as you in design, was an expert at Microsoft Paint, whereas you are not. Does that make sense?

Josh quit many months before I was hired. He wasn't fired and as far as I know left in good standing. 

Anyways, on to the question. I can find Josh on LinkedIn pretty easily. Would be a totally stupid idea to reach out to him and introduce myself, explain the challenges I am having, and see if he has any insights? In the best of cases I find a peer who I can get some good advice from, perhaps the only other person on the planet who knows exactly what I am going through. 

Here are my concerns:

1. He might still talk to people at my job. I would like to believe our conversation would be in confidence but you just never know. I wouldn't reach out to him just to complain, but if it got back to colleagues, it doesn't make me look very good. 
2. It's kind of a weird thing to do. I have never considered doing this before in my career and I have certainly never had it done to me. 
3. This could all be in my head, impostor syndrome. I was filling the shoes of an expert on a specific tool but I have more experience in the skillset as a whole and I was hired for that reason.
