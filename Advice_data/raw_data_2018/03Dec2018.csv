1,"I was hurt at work. I am still employed by them but they took me off work. The reasoning and the backstory is a story for another day and another subreddit. So they are screwing me around on my pay. I am aware this is illegal. I am trying to deal with the legal issues of all this, meanwhile I need money. Like in a really bad way. So my question is do any of you know any legit ways I can make money from home? I can’t go get another job right now. I’m in a very toxic (abusive at times) relationship and I’m trying to save money to get out. But I obviously can’t even maintain my personal bills at the point (car, phone, etc..).

2,"We first started going out at the beginning of the year and slowly got more serious over time. We're part of a decent sized circle of friends and we decided to only tell them when we were ready, but that day never ever came.

The last 2/3 weeks of the relationship were a bit off, she felt more closed off than usual and was very rarely affectionate. Not completely unusual of her as, sometimes, that's just the way she is. I tried talking to her about it but she always said she wasn't in the mood or didn't want to talk about it.

A few days before the party she said she wanted to speak to me about us on the day of the party. I jokingly said ""if you're planning to break up, it's a bad time ahah"" and then she sent me a big text breaking up. About how she has been thinking and how she doesn't feel the same way about me but that I'm amazing and she hopes I don't stop speaking to her. We didn't speak at the party.

I replied to her text the next day and we talked a little bit about things, ending with her not answering me. That was about a week and a half ago. I feel like the way it was, the relationship wouldn't have held up much longer without compromise from both sides. But it seems like it was something she wasn't willing to do. I feel like we could have been something really great if we really tried but alas, she obviously doesn't want to.

I feel like she has outgrown me and just doesn't want to feel tied down to me while finishing university, I suppose. I totally get her in that regard and I want her to be happy. I'm obviously sad about her breaking up with me but at this point, I think I'm only disappointed in her for doing it the way she did.

I have not seen her since the party but we are both going to a mutual friend's dinner on Tuesday and I do not know if I should say anyting to about this her. I was planning on just being as friendly as possible without asking too much. I feel personally that I need some sort of closure in person to keep being friendly with her. I feel like it is too early for that now.

Like I mentioned, none of our friends know. So I want it to be as less stressful and tense between us as possible. It's most likely a matter of time for things to straighten out.

Does anyone have any tips or advice on how to procede in this case?

TL;DR Me and ex are part of group of friends. Dated secretly for 9 months and ended with her breaking up by text on the day of a mutual friend's bday party. Not entirely sure how to procede and stay friendly with her.",03Dec2018,1
3,"I have been defeated by creationists in a few debates before: [https://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/9gzci3/cmv\_taxpayer\_money\_should\_not\_be\_used\_to\_fund/e6807a8](https://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/9gzci3/cmv_taxpayer_money_should_not_be_used_to_fund/e6807a8). After that debate, I looked like the irrational guy in the end for not being swayed, and for being unable to provide the evidence he wants.

I can't just walk away from other creationists who challenge me to a debate because I keep encountering these insinuations:

* ""Evolution-peddling scientists refuse to debate us because they know that they are peddling indefensible lies""
* ""The truth does not fear investigation - if you refuse a debate, it goes to show that you don't really believe that your claims stand up to scrutiny""

Anyway, I was challenged to a debate by a creationist a few days ago, and once again, I ended up losing. At the end of it, he was like, ""Your arguments are flawed and delusional. You can't give any testable evidence for mutations creating novel features like multicellular lifeforms. Since you are clearly struggling to debunk my points despite all your best efforts, you are probably on the wrong side"".

Note that I am a scientist. It goes to show that I suck at my job if I fail at defending evolution against creationists.",03Dec2018,1

6,"I have an operation on Tuesday, I've never had one in my life and it's on one of the most important parts of our bodies, the eye. I'm honestly shitting myself about it and I have no clue what to expect (I've been explained the whole thing but I know nobody that's has the same kinda thing done for asking them), I'm getting really nervous and anxious even though it's over 24 hours away but the thought of being put to sleep is really eating away at me.
I haven't had the best of experiences with hospitals - since I OD'd in January and spent my whole time throwing up and now only 11 months later I'm being put to sleep and having my eye and the muscles connected to it being cut and played around with.

The operation I'm on about is called squint surgery, they roll your eyes back, cut the layer on your eye and then cut the required muscle that's attached to it and then move it, stitch it all and that's it. (Sounds simple but scary.)

Does anyone have any advice as to how I can go about this without making a big fuss or something? I want it done but at the same time I'm having doubts because I'm scared of being put to sleep.

Sorry if this question sounds pretty weird but I'm out of luck on any other options so I thought I'd ask here to get any better responses of any kind.

Also, apologies for this ordering/layout, I'm typing this on mobile and I'm just tired and want to get it done before I go to bed.

I feel like a failure, because I'm a man that needs to feel loved and wanted... I feel emotional, and I feel like no one cares or understands. There's such an expectation that men shouldn't be emotional, we should just ""man up"" and just get on with life... but I can't, I'm struggling and no one seems to understand.

13,"So today I met up with an old friend for the first time in 12 years, we used to be really close and I always had a thing for her but never admitted it. We just stopped talking one day for no particular reason, she got married and had 4 kids and so life went on. I recently split with my ex and so did she and this old friend gets in contact and suggests that we meet up, so I agree. We still get on like we never spent anytime apart. She starts talking about sex and things she likes in the bedroom, so I go along with it and then she throws a massive bombshell, she admits she used to be really into me so I tell her I used to feel the same way but didn’t tell her that I still do. The conversation turns back to relationships and sex and she’s telling me how she hasn’t met the right man for her but she knows what she wants, and every quality she was reeling off was every quality I have, it was like she was hinting at me but I’m terrible at taking hints. So she now wants me to go to her place next week to spend an evening with her. So my question is do I just admit that I’m massively in love with her and always have been and risk losing probably my closest friendship? Or do I just keep quiet and see what happens? I’ll also add we’ve made out before in the past and she was the first to lean into a kiss.

I took W on a date the next day and it turned out to just be drunk chemistry so we didn't see each other after that.

I haven't seen J since the semester started but I just assumed she was busy because of her schedule, and therefore wasn't going out on the weekends. Today, she texted me saying that she would've invited me out last night had W not been there because it would be weird for W. I asked her why and she said ""she's never vocalized that she would feel uncomfortable but I know her well enough to know thats how she feels. I don't want to go out with you two together, its weird for me too."" I didn't want to get into an argument so I backed off.

15,"I have come to the realization that I am not happy in life. A lot of things have been going on in my life to the point where I am just constantly depressed. Let me give you all some background story to it all so you can understand me better.

I'm a 19 year old middle eastern girl in college with a toxic controlling family, no real friends and an anxious relationship with my boyfriend. I have recently moved to the US to start college here as an international student, my parents tagged along with me ""to take care of me"" here even though I don't want them anywhere near me.

I've never had a good relationship with my family, they're very toxic and abusive but don't even realize it which has made me want to go to college abroad to get away from them but, in the end, they tagged along with me. This has made me very depressed as I absolutely hate them and can't live my life normally around them.

My dad is the main reason as to why my life is so horrible. He's a typical strict and religious middle eastern man that doesn't allow me to live alone or date which once again, makes my life horrible as I have to sneak around just to see my boyfriend once a week and have to live with my parents that I absolutely hate as they make me depressed and are the reason why I have anxiety.

I moved to the US to get away from my parents and also be with my boyfriend that I met online (He's AsianAmerican) and lives here. I wanted to be closer to him in order to end the whole LDR thing. Things have been okay and good for the most part but he does live an hour away and since he cant stay at my place because of my dad, we only see each other on weekends. 

This bothers me alot as I feel like my relationship with my boyfriend would be much better if we could see each other more often and at longer times without the stress of sneaking around behind my dad's back. Also, my boyfriend's car broke down and he won't be able to fix it till his next paycheck which will take 2-3 weeks and by then, i'll be going back home for the holidays for ANOTHER 3 weeks.

This means we won't see each other till the end of January which is very depressing to me as he is my only happiness in this world. I have offered him money to accept and lend for his car repair but he wont accept it. It makes me sad too because he's kinda nonchalant about the situation. How is he ok with not seeing me for 6 weeks? 

Another thing in our relationship is the fact that our honeymoon phase has ended and things have ""calmed"" down which has been hard for me to adapt to. I constantly crave attention and affection which he no longer constantly gives me. This makes me wonder if he even still loves me? He says he does and that our relationship has  matured and we are grown ups but I don't know. (He's also 23 and I'm 19, btw.)

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel very lonely, stuck, trapped, neglected and unhappy. I wish my parents would leave me the fuck alone and let me live my life normally. I'm fucking 19. I also am really sad that I won't see my boyfriend for THAT long and our new phase in our relationship makes me anxious..Am I overthinking the situation and am I just too needy and clingy or is he actually falling out of love or acting weird?

I feel so helpless at this point that i'm slowly losing the will to live. I no longer know what to do with myself other than cry and be upset. I just wish I could see my boyfriend more and that the attention and affection could come back as well as my family just leaving for good and letting me live the life I deserve and want.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr

I'm just lost in life due to strict family and the honeymoon phase supposedly ending in my relationship. I won't see my boyfriend for 6 weeks due to his car breaking and not being able to fix it on time before I leave for my 3 week holiday.

I'm miserable, to say the least.",03Dec2018,1
16,"**Background:**

So I dated this guy (Kevin) for about a year, then we broke up because I was going to college. We decided to remain friends, and honestly I felt that the relationship had run its course and I was ready for it to end anyway, especially because I am not interested in a long distance relationship. Throughout the relationship, we had high highs and low lows, the latter often being the result of our personal mental health issues getting the best of us. I often felt like I was performing a lot of emotional labor for him. We got into a couple fights at the beginning of this change, but now we're both happy with ourselves and each other. He comes to visit me at school often and also picks me up to take me home over breaks a lot of the time (I'm only 50 miles away). Of course, old flames never die, and we recently started being physical again (ie: sex) and even started calling each other pet names (baby, hun, etc.) again. We've agreed to let each other know if we become involved with someone else straight away so that neither of us gets hurt, because the physical aspect is a big deal to both of us.  So, basically, we still behave very much like a couple but without the label or explicit commitment.

**New Problem:**  
Recently, Kevin has been grieving over the death of a close family friend. Outside of me, he really doesn't have many friends or any kind of support system, so I've been there for him a lot in a talking-off-the-ledge sense (just like in our relationship). In fact, there was a period of time while I was at college where we didn't talk for a few weeks because I needed the space from him (he was quite overbearing at first), but I broke the silence when I caught wind of how bad he was doing and reached out to help him. He says he would have probably attempted suicide (again) if I wasn't there to reach out to him so many times. 

Even more recently, an ex-girlfriend of his contacted him and says she has cancer and only 4-6 months to live. He's distraught and feels like life is against him. I asked him why, and he says it's because ""she was the only one to reach out to him in a time of need."" Keep in mind that they were friends for a little while after they stopped dating, but then she cut off communication and they haven't talked in two whole years until she contacted him to let him know that she's dying. When he told me they hadn't talked in 2 years, I said that, in my opinion, he didn't need to introduce that kind of hurt into his life. I mean, she's the one who stopped talking to him, it's been two years, and she literally only reached out because she's going to die soon - if it was me, I wouldn't be hung up over it. You can't just stop cancer and death comes to everyone at some point. 

Some might perceive me as selfish or cold, but I kind of feel like chopped liver. What does he mean nobody was there for him? I've taken on his immense emotional burden for the last year, even when we weren't explicitly in a relationship anymore. I helped him quit cigarettes (he smoked 3-5 packs a day), cocaine (8balls every day), excessive drinking (entire bottles of vodka for no reason), self-harm, and not to mention the longest time he went without a suicide attempt in the past 4 years was when he was involved with me. Suddenly this bitch walks in with a bladder tumor and I'm nobody? I understand that I sound like the jealous ex-girlfriend right now, but this is only because he claims I'm the only girl who he's ever truly loved and had a meaningful relationship with. But this whole situation is making me think that what he said isn't really the truth. I understand why one would want to be there for someone when they're dying of cancer . . . but can you even call someone your friend if you haven't talked in two years? At that point they're just your ex. It makes me feel like he was been harboring feelings for someone else in our entire relationship.

Am I wrong for feeling this way? I'm still going to support him through this but I can't help but feel uncomfortable, like he's keeping a secret from me. I'm going to ask him to tell me the whole story because I won't be able to wholeheartedly support him without knowledge of the situation and clarity of mind. But does it make me selfish or jealous or prying to want to know the whole story? In the past, I was very open in talking about my previous relationships as learning experiences but he's kept quiet, claiming that they're all bad or not worth talking about. Was he hiding something from me? Or am I just overreacting?",03Dec2018,1

A couple of things just to give you some perspective. 

1. I'm a sensitive, dude. I just am. 
2. Im the only boy in my family. Raised with 5 sisters. 
3. I've never been a guy's guy. 
4. I don't really like joking around like most men do. 
5. I'm insecure about who I am so I think I overcompensate by trying to be tough. 

This is all coming after I was a dick to a couple of people I work around during the first week of my new job. 

I move shit around as my job, packages. We take boxes and load them into a truck. I've been getting different things told to me about how to do it. Company says do it this way but Drivers want it done X and when they come and see their truck not done X way they get bitchy. 

So being new when the Drivers come I ask then how they like they're truck loaded, ya know, just to be cool with them. Not make their job harder. Couple drivers just tell me to load right by there truck and they'll help load. Cool I do thag. No problem. 

These drivers usually when they come hang around on our workspace, chat, and eat while we're working. Fine. Right? Whatever I'm new. I guess everyone is cool with that.

Well second day of my job it got to be a problem when one driver was just not doing anything but talk and eat while all the packages I had for him start piling up and blocking the egress which I was specifically told not to have happen. 

So I tell this dude, ""hey man you start loading some stuff."" With a attitude. I wont lie. He tells me hell do it when he's ready and that annoys me so I go on about how it's a hazard and him and one other dude are giggling. 

I get annoyed and ask then what has laughing it, escalating like immature ass, and tell him he's no boss/hardass and doesnt know me. 

Then I get back to work. 

OG driver starts talking to my manager and I ask then if they're talking about me and he's like yeah, escalating again because ik a djmbass but this dude is just pissing me off now with his attitude, no excuse. I know. 

Then I get caught up by saying it's his job to load. My manager is like, |actually it is your job."" I know that. But when everyone here is telling me load by their truck and they'll help and driver is doing nothing and packages being stackes are starting to cause a problem what am I to think? 

Anyways. I'm cooling off and the driver says, ""What would you do if I wasnt here?"" I had my back turned to him and I just didnt say anything. By this time I was relaxing how stupid I was acting. In hindsight I was thinking about his comment and thinking, ""what a dumb comment. I'd do my job without you and your buddies cheating and eating on the platform.""


So advice for me? I know I'm too old to act like a teenager trying to posture up, overcompensate and prove he's some badass. But in certain scenarios and with certain people, just by the way the look and act, I tend to always turn a situation negative.

It's my first year at university. This semester I took a high level engineering course. I found it to be very difficult and to make it worse the professor, doesn't speak English the best and hardly gives effort into teaching. By the time we took the first quiz, I was confused on many things and didn't have a handle on things, but felt like no one else did. I got my score back and it was much lower than the average. When the second quiz came around I was ready and studied my ass of, but only received a 80%. The average of still really high at 19. This was where I started to feel really stupid. This continued on and I never was able to ever reach an 80 again. Then came the last quiz. To me it was the second easiest; to everyone else the hardest. Most said they didn't answer half the questions. By this time I finally have people know some people well and start asking questions. EVERYONE had the solutions (except for the last one). Apparently, the professor puts less effort into the class than I thought, because he reused the same quiz from the previous term. 

&amp;#x200B;

So this whole time I was feeling bad, everyone had all the answers. I was wondering why I was the only one that could answer some of the questions during lecture. Now I realize this isn't high level cheating and probably goes on too often, but I still feel very cheated. This will effect the curve of the overall course. 

But what to do about it? Do I confront the professor? I am guessing he has a clue since the last quiz was different. What do I ask for though? Do I go to the dean? what could/would any of these people do to help me? How do I ask for a better grade?",03Dec2018,1
31,I know this sounds  really dumb from the title  but I'm really insecure  about my hair I have dirty blond curly hair like really curly  so if I want to do a hair  style I like I take a flat iron to my hair every morning for about 40-50 minutes. So this girl goes out of her way to go to the freshmen hallway of my school to find me and duck up my hair cuase as soon as someone touches it a lot it slowly  turns curly  again.

33,"Hi all, I'm just about on the other side of what I would call a hellish period of my life. I was bed bound pretty much for three or four months - but, long story short, after two trips to the ER, multiple medication changes and hours of therapy I'm very happy to say that I'm very nearly back to where I was. :)

This feels amazing, obviously. I'm now ready to get myself back out there socially, but my low confidence is still holding me back. I put on a SHIT ton of weight over the past few years that I have spent the past few months beginning to work off (I still have quite a bit to lose, but I'm eating far better and exercising as much as I can). I've also recently moved. I haven't made 'best' friends yet, but I do live in a big city and it hasn't  been very long. I have quite a few friends(?) that I hang out with on a regular basis in addition to my very tight knit group back home - I feel a bit insecure about this sometimes but not all is lost.

Now I'm always that person gets no male attention in comparison to my (very pretty) friends. I'm nothing special physically, and to be honest I hardly expected any considering how much I let myself go. There was one guy back home who apparently liked me at one point, but I didn't realise (I'm still not wholly convinced it's true - I was such a mess lol), and was far from ready for a relationship no matter how interested I would've been. I'm pretty sure he has a girlfriend now. 

I'm trying to make myself more confident. I've invested in some new clothes and am generally taking care of myself better. My hair and skin looks a lot better and obviously the weight loss helps - but I really need to make a step to properly get myself 'out there'. I chicken out whenever I think someone's showing interest because I'm petrified that I'll have read the situation wrong. I know there's no direct cure for this, but is there a way to make it easier? Are dating apps worth it? I don't think I'd be very good because I desperately fear rejection.

Thanks all :)

34,"The title basically explains it, but I have a close friend at college who lives abroad, and is studying abroad next semester so I won’t see her for about 8 months after finals are over in 2 weeks. I’ve been attracted to her for quite some time but have kind of held off on confessing my feelings for her due to her leaving and worries about hurting our friendship dynamic as we often hangout with a third friend together. I think there’s a strong possibility she would want to go on a date with me but part of me thinks it would be better to wait until she returns next year to ask her out even with the possibility she starts dating someone else over break. Im just curious if anyone thinks there’s a benefit to asking her out now and seeing if there are mutual feelings between us or if that would be selfish of me, trying to start something with full knowledge we won’t be able to see eachother for quite some time.

35,"My girlfriend and I live in a 3 unit, divided row house in the city. Sound carries pretty easily in the building and, for the most part, people have been respectful of that until our upstairs neighbors moved in a couple months ago. It started as simple annoyances, music too loud, they slam their feet on the stairs, etc. But here’s where I am concerned and at a loss. For the past month, my girlfriend and I have been woken up early in the morning (like 5AM) at least 4 times a week to my neighbor VIOLENTLY retching. It sounds like he is puking his guts up so intensely that I thought it was a joke the first time I heard it. But it has been getting more frequent and is distressing. The other weird thing is that the noise comes from all areas of the house, not just one location. He also has been leaving at odd hours in the night. I know because he runs down the stairs and slams the door. This leads me to believe it is related to drugs but I don’t know. We also saw him two nights ago getting out of an ambulance after what appeared to be a welfare check. He lives with a girl with whom he is not in a relationship and she seems really really normal. And last night I met his mom who brought him groceries and seemed really nice. Obviously none of this confirms or denies any drug use, but it’s hard to get a read on him as he seems intentionally illusive.

I guess all this is to say, I plan on talking to him (or leaving a note) about slamming doors and being loud on the stairs. Am I reaching by asking him to... stop throwing up loudly? I don’t really know how to address that and don’t mean to be insensitive but the noise has been waking and keeping us up. But I feel bad for the guy. He sounds miserable.

And does this sound like drugs? I can’t imagine what else it could be but the frequency of these occurrences seems excessive for drug use. 

Any advice is appreciated. ",03Dec2018,1

37,"Ok so this is kinda of long and complicated. Feeling a bit in the middle of all this.

Situation: 3 bedroom 2 ½ bath townhome with two car garage in great area. 4 people live in this home splitting rent which is 1700.

We are all about the age of 22. I am Roommate 1, currently occupying Master bedroom with full two sink bath and walk in closet with Roommate 2, my girlfriend. Roommate 3 occupies next largest room and Roommate 4 occupies smallest room, both share a full bathroom and have standard sized closets. Half bath is downstairs with living area and kitchen. The rooms don't differ dramatically in size, but they are noticeably different, about 20 square foot increase from smallest to next largest room, not including the standard and walk in closets and the attached full master bath. Here’s where the tricky stuff comes in. Relationship was complicated with GF at beginning of lease, she didn’t sign it, she was not in the house the first month. Near end of this year when we thought we could improve an aspect of our relationship by her moving out, it only increased driving expenses and didn’t make much sense to continue that so she moved back in after one month of that.

My roommates and I were very civil about making verbal agreements such as allowing GF to move in, out and back in again. We have no issue on coming to agreeance on payments per rooms (since there was no designation on signing the lease, utilities always split evenly among us, rooms escalated in price when just three of us, and is split evenly having girlfriend in master with me, and since we all have been changing vehicles often we agreed nicest/newer cars get garage spot at no extra charge since parking is right in front of townhome). Roommate 4 has not been an especially great fit with Roomate 3 or myself, and I have spoken with him openly and he will be replaced upon lease renewal with Roommate 5, who jives with us much better than Roommate 4 (mainly cleanliness and drug/behavioral clashing issues).

Roommate 4 has not been an especially great fit with Roommate 3 or myself, and I have spoken with him openly and he will be replaced upon lease renewal with Roommate 5, who jives with us much better than Roommate 4 (mainly cleanliness and drug/behavioral clashing issues). e moved out the second time, again I was able to garner leniency till she returned, much to Roommate 3’s dismay who wanted to immediately start occupying the Master. With lease renewal coming up in a few months, and GF here again already, Roommate 3 still wants the master and says he won't budge on issue. While the shift in payments would be fair if we were forced into the middle room (400, 300+300, 700 vs the current even split ), my GF is very upset about the space reduction and having to share the separated bathroom with another person (Roommate 5). Roommate 3 wants the master with his arguments being in fairness it's his turn, he has reason to believe if GF doesn't sign the lease she can leave again, and wants to have a bathroom to himself and the convenience of if being part of the room. I felt neutral at first siding with neither thinking both their points were valid and not giving into the “obligation to side with GF” whether right or wrong. Roommate 3 says there is no reduction to his rent/increase to ours that will keep him satisfied in middle room. He also says he spends the greatest amount of time in his room, even though mon-friday I work on my computer from inside my room and spend time playing video games just like he does when I can and am not in there with my GF at the same time. GF also wants to sign lease to have the Master, and has shown genuine improvement toward crucial things I needed to see.  
So on one hand, I don’t want to cause turmoil between two people I care a lot about, from either one toward me or toward each other. I understand Roommate 3’s frustration and the fairness of it being his turn and the circumstances, but in equal weight is my GF argument of the reduction of space and sharing a smaller separate bathroom with Roommate 5, and has herself expressed even paying more to retain the master. Some other small things like the amount of stuff she has + mine, Roommate 3 has an indoor/outdoor cat that is not allowed in our room due to GF allergies that spends time in his room. Both are firm on what they want, I have had conversations conveying my GF points to him and they have talked as well with no progress. Roommate 3 suggested things like purchasing more cabinets for space or things to sort GF regular stuff (cosmetics and womanly hygiene products, I retorted saying that's akin to asking a woman to purchase a purse organizer) as he sees it mostly as a lack of only physical belonging storage space, and also acknowledges her blatant disappointment of the bathroom sharing situation.  If I wasn't with my GF this would not be an issue and I’d be out of the master no problem, but I am with her likely/want to be for the foreseeable future. And kicking him out would not accomplish anything positive nor would leaving since we wouldn't find something as nice with a great location and space for the price at all. I think he has fair arguments but now I've begun to side and give the upper hand to the two to a bathroom and space deal (he also says we have an advantage being a couple and not co occupants, which I understand). Advice?...

39,"I’m a 23F who graduated from school back in May. My parents offered to let me live with them for free for a year, until next May, while I get myself on my feet and am able to save money.

While I appreciate the gesture, I find it extremely difficult (mentally/emotionally) to live with them. My room still looks the same way it did in middle and high school; I’ve rearranged the furniture, which has helped, but my parents had promised several times to help me get new furniture and repaint the room with nothing to show for it. Instead, they’ve moved on (now years later) to say we can clear out the basement full of hoarded books, old mattresses and computers, etc. to make that my “bachelor apartment.” Again, I appreciate the gesture, but they put it on me to make it happen when it’s entirely their mess to clean up.

They ask me to clean the house for them, too, in exchange for the free room and board, which I wouldn’t mind if they made any effort to keep things clean, but they don’t. They are very set in their cluttered ways, and I personally cannot stand that. It would drive me crazy if I cleaned the same area every day just to see it go to hell as soon as someone gets home, which it always does. Somehow, I escaped the hoarding gene, but my family did not. Suffice it to say that I do very little around the house, but still infinitely more than anyone else.

Beyond this, they have a habit of mocking me. When I’m anxious, I tend to touch my hair a lot, and whenever I do, like clockwork, my dad will ask, “How’s the hair?” even though I’ve told him time and again that it isn’t related to vanity at all, but anxiety. It doesn’t matter. If I ask him to stop, he will still do it the next time he sees me touch my hair. This is one of many things that I’ve been mocked for and have had to suck up, otherwise I have a thin skin.

My only sibling is my younger brother (16M) who has Down syndrome, and while I love him to pieces, his behaviors are getting nearly intolerable. He has no comprehension of the messes he creates, of his strength as an older teenager (he shoves me around a lot), and of his unusual obsession with 15-second clips of toddler shows. It grates on my nerves to have to listen to him rewind and replay the same segment of Paw Patrol every single day...

I love my family so much. They helped me get through school and through the first quarter or so of my life. They still do a lot for me, like treating me to a new game console as an early Christmas gift, taking me on mini-vacations to different states, and a lot more. But, I feel like, in many of the places where it counts, they’ve fallen short for me.

I think it would be better if we split off. I’m starting to get short with them even for insignificant things, and I’d really rather not wear down those relationships if I can help it. Thankfully, I found a job here in my hometown as a Control Engineer, meaning I’ll be making almost twice the median household income of most families where I live and could easily afford a nice apartment for myself and all the costs that come with it. The question is - should I leave? Or should I wait the next six months out and hope things don’t get worse, meanwhile saving thousands of dollars for future use or saving?

TL;DR: I just graduated college and moved back home for free for a year, courtesy of my parents. My family and I, however, live very different and somewhat conflicting lifestyles. In short, they live in mess, and I cannot stand it. I have a good-paying job now. Should I move out now or wait and save the money?",03Dec2018,1

56,"I visited my best friend in France over the summer because she is studying/working there and I thought it’d be nice to visit her. I was treated so poorly by her when I was there that when I came back home I felt traumatized. I told her how I felt about the trip over the phone a few months ago but she didn’t really understand where I was coming from which had me even more upset. She ignored me, bailed on plans and just treated me like shit while I was there. So after the phone conversation I’ve spent a lot less time interacting with her but I found out through a mutual friend that she’s in town and he asked me if I wanted to join and hang out with them this weekend. I told him I had work but I felt compelled to reach out to her so we could hang out (simply for the fact that she’s in town and I don’t know when’s the next time I’ll see her). So I reached out to her a few days ago and she kept her messages really short and said that I should come hang out with her and our mutual friend. First of all, I was pissed that she never reached out to me to tell me she’s here and second of all that I had to find out through a mutual friend. But I still reached out to her because I felt like it was the right thing to do. I told her that I was working and to let me know another day she was free to hangout. She left me on read and didn’t reply until 3 days later. She messaged me asking if I’m free to hang out next Wednesday but I am not even in the mood to see her face or be in her presence anymore. She’s just so draining to be  around now. But some people I’ve talked to said I might regret not meeting up with her because I’ll never know when she’s going to be back home.

58,"Hey guys,

I don’t know who else to ask this and I have seen some nice people in reddit before. I am 24 and live in Malaysia. 

I am closing my video production company because I have been running it with the wrong partner for the past couple of years. I thought that I should go and work for another production for a few years but they wage and hours here are just too unhealthy for me. At least for now. 

My brother suggested that I go teach English in Japan for a year as the pay is good and I get to be in a country I love. I don’t speak any Japanese though but he says that shouldn’t be an issue for now. I don’t know if this is the right move or not and I would like to hear it from people around the world. 

Thanks for reading guys! I appreciate it if you write back :) ",03Dec2018,1
59,"I am currently a college student studying at Uni. I do not want to continue studying at university because I don't have any passion for my degree or any degrees I could obtain there.

I would like to go to technical school in another state so that I can pursue a field that I actually care about. They don't want that because spanners are more dangerous than computer mice.

I have rather controlling parents. They don't trust my with my own life, because I am a young adult and I make mistakes and they are too afraid of something bad happening to me to let me live my own life. They don't really care about me, but really only how much that I stress my mom; 

Recently, I had a cold that lasted over 3 weeks. The only concern my parents expressed was over how much my coughing was stressing out my mom. It was when I realized this that I realized that I have no control over my life and that every decision that has been made about me over the past 20 years has been made for my mom, not for me.

My parents have never encouraged me to do anything with anything more dangerous than an x-acto knife. They were content on me not getting my driver's license until I was 19 because the idea of me driving stressed out my mom. I only got it when there was no other way for me to get to classes.

I don't want to go to Uni anymore. I want to move out and go to school somewhere else. However, I am too afraid of my parents to tell them this. If I don't say it right, they're going to say no, and the only way I'm going to get to live my own life is by running away.

I'm really just looking for some at-home methods that you guys may have used. I used to have agonizing ear infections that would last weeks when I was little. My mom took to a doctor and I was too young to know what was going on but the way she puts it is that I have very sensitive and narrow ""sinuses"". Particularly my ear tubes. 


Everytime I get sick, my ears get congested and the congestion isn't as painful as it was when I was little but still uncomfortable and will likely last for several weeks after I've gotten over the cold. Sometimes it can last for a couple of months.

I've tried coconut oil and olive oil drops in the past but they seemed to make it worse and I'm afraid to use ear drops from the store because I remember the drops when I was little not working well either. Maybe they did and I was just impatient.

It's effected my hearing quite a bit and it's been difficult to sleep. I just really hate this and hope anyone can tell me anything different than what I've been hearing and reading about it.",03Dec2018,1

Let me tell you something he is really cute and my friends make fun of his hair and call him mop head to make me feel embarrassed by them. When I was in seventh grade me and him were in different school at that time so I didn’t really know him my friend was texting him so I want on instagram and added him then we were just talking and then I was like what high school will you be going to he said the high schools name and I was like ay I’m going there also. So then he blocked me Instagram and then I just forgot about him. Until we were in 9th grade we were in the same class when I noticed him. I was like this person look too familiar even though I don’t know him. Then on the first day of school we were assigned new spots to sit in class he sat right across from me.  Everyday i felt as if he was staring at me and he was, he would also keep coping me if I do something he would do it. Then time just flow by that’s when it was quarter 2 and we got new spot in class and can you guess were that teacher put me next to right next to him. I was really happy. I had this feeling that he was taking pictures of me on Snapchat or something but I’m not for sure. Then the next quarter started and I was sad because I will be leaving his class and moved down to another class but that’s when I got really happy because he ended up coming to the same class as me bro i was so happy.

We spent almost every single day together at school (we're both in college together) and we had so much fun. In May I even went to Brazil with her because that's where her family is from and it was the best time of my life. After I came home and she stayed there for a little longer, we began to fight more often because of the distance and problems communicating. When she got back from Brazil we saw each other a handful of times. I always had to drive to her cause she didn't have a car and the drive was roughly an hour and a half so I couldn't see her everyday. By August, I was just ready to get back to school so we could get back to the way things were and she seemed hesitant about it. One week in July, we had a big conversation about the things that we both weren't happy with and we had agreed to work on them together. In August, she broke up with me. I never got a chance to fix anything. She was saying that she was going through problems with her mental health and despite me trying to say that we could work through it, she didn't seem so sure and it ended. I neverWhen we got back to school, we had been talking about becoming friends again and tried for a long time. It always felt as though she was so cold compared to how she was when we were dating. She didn't seem to have any interest in talking to me when we would text but then when we would hangout, we would have fun just like we were dating again. On a few occasions we would have little fights over text and we'd each have our space but we would work it out. Last week she told me that she really couldn't talk to me anymore and I really couldn't try to convince her otherwise. I still love this girl more than I can express. I thought we would be dating for years and I keep going through pictures of us together and we look so happy. I had texted her since and she got upset with me. I just don't know how to move on. I've had exes in the past that I thought I was never going to get over but I did. But with this girl I just can't move on. I can't even tell her how I feel because whenever I do she'll just be more upset with me. I feel like this girl that I love so deeply hates me and I don't know how to deal with that. I would give anything just to be able to go back to talking to her but I know that I don't have a chance. All my friends have been telling me to let her go and move on but I just can't seem to do it.

63,"  So, my brother is 24 years old and he owns a few firearms, but he is extremely negligent with them. I can’t tell if he is ignorant or just doesn’t care about the consequences of his actions with a firearm. When he turned 18, he bought his first firearm (it was a rifle) and when we went to the gun range, he didn’t seem to know the basics of firearm safety, like keeping his finger off the trigger and sometimes letting the muzzle of the gun drift away from the target when he looks over his shoulder at someone else. Me, being 15 years old at the time, I had to teach him basic safety. Both of us were raised around guns, so firearm safety is second nature to me, however it doesn’t seem to be the case with my brother.

It only got worse from there when he turned 21, he went out and bought a pistol and wanted to get a carry permit. My state requires people to prove that they can even HIT the target, so it’s not a high barrier of entry. My brother passed the shooting test, but after he finished, he turned about 90 degrees from down range and somehow fired 3 rounds into the brick wall, Needless to say, he couldn’t get his permit for awhile. A few months after that we went to the gun range and he brought his pistol, after being there for about an hour some people got his attention and he sweeps (unintentionally pointed a gun at someone) 5 people that were standing behind him when he turns around. The range officer kicked him out for the rest of the week.

He never seems to put his guns in his safe when he is not using them and just leaves them laying around. This is important because my sister comes over very frequently and she brings her 5-year-old son with her, so it falls to me to make sure that my nephew doesn’t get a hold of HIS guns. I cannot trust him with any of my guns because recently he asked to borrow my AR-15 that I finished building earlier in the year. Me being stupid, I let him borrow it. He obviously went to the gun range as soon as I gave it to him, and not 3 hours later I get a call from my friend, who is a range officer at the gun range we frequently go to. He told me to come pick up my rifle, because he confiscated it from my brother. He then tells me that when people were down range hanging new targets. My brother was either unaware or didn’t care that people were down range, started shooting again and the range officers kept yelling “cease fire” at him until my friend disarmed him of my rifle. My brother was not arrested for this (surprisingly), but I’m sure he will eventually.

I have stopped trusting him with my firearms, but I am powerless to keep him from his firearms. I need some advice on how I can get him to be more careful with guns because I don’t want him to get arrested and convicted of criminal negligence with a firearm. Literally any advice will help at this point. He's not a bad person nor does he want to hurt anyone, he's just a *bit* slow.",03Dec2018,1

I have a beautiful wife of five years, but we've grown very distant for a while now (that's another story completely). We work totally different schedules which means we don't get to spend that much time together. We have a two year old daughter who is smart and adorable, we just bought our first house which is beautiful in this idyllic family-friendly community, and I finally got myself a new (to me) truck. I have a great paying job in leadership. It can be stressful but I'm very fortunate to have something like that at my age (late 20s). But amidst all that I feel so lonely and sad. No friends really, no good hobbies (besides video games and this), and the weeks and months slip by while I try to just keep going. On my weekends, I sit at home mostly and just try to make the day go by. 

 I'm a sociable person that likes entertaining people and having fun, and I feel like I have so much to offer in life, and so much to be thankful for, and more to be gained.

66,"So I'm an amateur photographer who recently got over drug addiction and am now trying to make new friends and get myself out there in addition to going to therapy.

Today I went on a little road trip by myself and while I was out I saw two young pretty girls doing a little photoshoot with each other. Two cute girls who are into photography just like me? Well I kinda HAVE to at least say hi. So I worked up some courage and approached them. I'm 26 and they couldn't have been much older than 20. I said hello, asked if it was okay if I took some photos too. I introduced myself and we took a few shots. Even though they were verbally okaying me being there they quickly got the fuck out of there. I don't like posting pictures of people on Instagram without being able to tag them and get their permission so I asked one of the girls for her insta she typed it in and were gone before I could so much as say goodbye. Her account was private and I checked back later and it said follow again. I feel like a huge creep and I do not like it one bit. All I wanted to do was meet some new people with similar interest. Should I just forget this whole thing and delete the photos? Would it be pushing it for me to reach out?

I approached confidently, made lighthearted small talk, and actually felt fairly comfortable with myself. So I don't think I was being too awkward or anything. I don't think I look like a creep either. I was wearing black jeans, boots, and a flannel jacket. Pretty standard stuff. ",03Dec2018,1

68,"I want to drop out, or at the very least take a gap year and just work at home or something. I'm so depressed and so lonely up here, I hate it. I just stay in my dorm all the time and wait till I can go home for the weekend. I do fairly well in school, like 80's and up in pretty much every class, hell, I'm in the honours program. I just feel horrible about being here, like I'm wasting my parents' money, like I don't deserve to be here. I have super bad social anxiety and I don't drive, so I never put myself out there to meet people. I have a few close friends but I've really only kept up with one friend from last year and honestly I feel like she doesn't care about me. All three of my best friends live at home and I hate not seeing them, especially my best friend. I hate being away from my parents. I feel like I'm too stupid to be here, and as the courses get harder I'm gonna stop being good at it. I also have health problems, and I have a lot of intense anxiety about it, and being up here means I have to go to the doctor's by myself, and I'm so scared that something health-related will happen to me and I'll be stranded up here alone. I want to go home and just work at some stupid easy job and not be alone up here all the time. I'm scared. 

I don't know if dropping out will dissapoint my parents that much. My mom probably won't mind, especially if it's just one year, but I'm so scared of dissapointing my dad. I don't know if he'd tell me he was dissapointed, he wouldn't ever wanna hurt me, and he's had mental health problems so I know he would kind of get it, but I feel like my family has this idea of me where I'm this smart, level-headed, accomplished person and I'm none of that. I'm so scared and alone and I feel like I'm not mature enough or smart enough to be here.

I don't think things will magically get better at home, I'm not super happy there either, but I think it would be better than being here, because at least I'd have people to talk to. I don't think I'll ever actually be happy, to be honest. I just don't want to be here alone anymore, but the thought of dissapointing everyone I know terrifies me. I want to get my degree and I want a good job, but I don't know what job I even want at this point. I don't even know if I want to keep going with my major. My head is just a mess all the time, and everything feels like it's moving so fast. 

Last year when I went home for Christmas I realised how much better I liked it at home than I did here, and now it's almost Christmas again and I feel like coming back afterwards is gonna destroy me. I'll make it through next semester no matter what, but I don't want to come back next year.

Should I go home and work for a year (at least) and try to fix my mental health, but feel like a failure and a dissapointment, or should i just suffer through, and maybe get locked into a job that I don't even know if I want anymore?

My problem is that they are unnecessarily loud, so loud that our car's alarm system often triggers, so loud I can't even hear my own TV when they are doing their thing. They have a set of those speakers used for events, a drum set, a keyboard, and a couple electric guitars for a place that is about 10x15 meters. They blast those as well as screaming very loud in what they call ""speaking in tongue"".

They level of noise they make is clearly illegal, from time to time we ask them politely to lower the volume, but after 15-20 minutes they are back to the same volume.
We sat with them one time and explained that if they don't moderate their noise, we might have to go to the authorities. They argued that one of the members of the church is a lawyer and they will fight back and take it to court if necessary. We don't want to go that way because we don't want to waste energy and money on this, knowing that the authorities tend to side with the churches here.

71,"TL;DR at the bottom.  

&amp;#x200B;

I got my bachelor's degree in in 2015 and got a job in an unrelated field by chance. I did well at that job and made some great connections, but I was let go after two years when the company was acquired. My next job was a bit of a shitshow. The working conditions were a complete nightmare and everyone was miserable; I ended up quitting after 7 months. The last straw was when HR brushed a huge sexual harassment case (not mine) under the rug, even though everyone knew about it.  

&amp;#x200B;

I've been at my current job for three months. Most of my coworkers are amazing, the work I'm doing is fascinating, and I've already grown so much as an employee. But I'm also working 50-60 hours per week and being paid for 40 (no paid overtime) and I'm breaking under the stress. Everyone here is overworked and underpaid, it's just the norm. I'm barely keeping my head above water and I'm having suicidal thoughts for the first time in years.  

&amp;#x200B;

If I stick it out here for a year or two, I'll have enough experience to move to a better job, and if I leave so soon after starting, my resume will look like shit and I'll have virtually no professional references. But I don't know if I can keep holding on. For the past year I've been dying to leave this industry and potentially go back to school, but my family and SO think I'm looking for a copout and just need to man up. I do see that I'm the common denominator in all of these bad situations (""if it smells like shit everywhere you go, check your own shoes"" etc) but maybe I'm just not cut out for this line of work.

After the break up of one of these girls I kinda stopped talking to her because she was friends with said girl. Then at the beginning of this last summer I went to a lake party and she was there and i found out that her boyfriend of two years and her had recently broke up because he had cheated on her. After this we became friends again and had a big group that we would go do stuff with and it was great.

Then one day she was having a rough day and wanted us to all go hangout, however everybody besides me was busy so it ended up just being me and her. We hit it off and had a great time and just sat on a pier and talked for hours. After this we started talking more and after about a week we told each other how we felt.

I was concerned that she might not be over her ex because when they broke up she was crushed for weeks and this was only two months later. But she insisted that she was fine, I really liked her and didn’t want to lose my chance so I accepted it and I asked her on a date and to be my girlfriend and things went from there.

We had a few minor fights but all in all had a great 3 months. Then one day we were sitting in my driveway in the car and she broke down and started crying and said that she needed to be alone right now because she wasn’t over her ex and needed to go to therapy over her brothers death which she never dealt with.

74,"Please read it all, 
So I’ve been going through depression lately and it’s caused me to think about a lot of things including my parents. 

I’m a gay guy in a very Islamic family, I’ve always been feminine most of my life which meant me and my dad didn’t have much in common and my mum tried to encourage me to do “manly” things but I didn’t really gravitate towards that stuff. My mum adored me and I could say that I was a mama’s boy because she treated me almost too well which contrasts with my dad who is strict and very traditional, I never received much praise from my dad for my achievements, in fact I don’t remember the last time I was praised by him. Which could be why I constantly seek validation elsewhere and pleasing others has become a habit for me. 

Early on I could tell my dad didn’t approve of the way I acted, It came to a point that i wasn’t allowed to do certain things like putting my hands on my hips or hanging around with my sisters too much because I was a guy and only girls do that. He favoured my younger brother who had better behaviour at school and was much more masculine and I was compared to him every time I had a shortcoming.

My dad never really took my feelings into consideration much, I was never allowed to cry because if I was never physically hit or hurt I had no reason to cry and that only girls do that and that I was the “devil” for doing so. I also have really bad social anxiety so I was really bad at answering phone calls or very social situations, I never really told them about this and when situations like this occurred my dad would shout at me or insult me for not being big enough to do simple things. I even had a situation where my dad started shouting at me because I was too scared to call in sick for school and I shouted back that I was scared to do it and maybe he didn’t understand but he told me to “grow up”. 


I’m 17 now and I’m more distant from him than I ever was and I’m not allowed to wear jewellery of any form because only girls wear it and my religion doesn’t like it and my dad threatened to hurt me if he ever saw me wearing necklaces again, he also insults my sense of clothing and complains about my friend group consisting mostly of females. I’m constantly insulted by him because I don’t follow my faith very well. There are moments when he can soften up and most of this stuff I neglected until now but for the past few years especially since 2017 I can’t stand the thought of it. Maybe because I’m the first teenager and my dad is very traditional they didn’t know to how to deal with me?

Then, when i was in 4th grade, Valen left. I since then have not been the same.

Important background info: Education is quite important to my mom. Sister and I are both good students, but I do a bit better in school than she does. This is not to brag; it’s actually important to the story. 

When I was doing my college search, mom was encouraging me to reach for the stars. She said she wanted whatever was best for me and was willing to pay a lot of money to make that happen. I’m infinitely grateful for this, but I’m surprised by the stark contrast between her approach to my college education and her approach to my sister’s. It’s more of a prepare-for-failure than a prepare-for-success ordeal. She’s encouraging her to go to a nearby 4-year college that is actually *inferior* to the local community college in terms of education quality. My sister hates that school and wants to go to some of the same schools I applied to (these schools have good reputations but aren’t elite). My mom is convinced she’ll be rejected. Like I said before, *my sister is by no means a bad student*.

That’s just an example of the various goings-on. It’s pretty obvious my mom has no expectations of my sister. It wouldn’t be so bad if not for how different it is from how she treats me. I don’t know for sure, but I think it’s taking a toll on my sister’s self-esteem. She’s a really good kid and I’ve seen her slave away at her schoolwork into the wee hours of the morning. She clearly cares about her education. I wish my mom would realize that this girl is smart and capable. 

I feel like it’s my fault, to some extent. I have a type-A personality and natural academic aptitude, and I think maybe my parents took this for granted, so my sister’s normalcy seems like a disappointment. I didn’t mean to get her into this mess, but how do I get her out of it?

82,"Before reading, I want to let you know that ""Ignore it"" is said a lot to me but this is beyond that. Okay let's start

Hey guy. So i'm 15 years old. I like rapping in my free time and I also study Japanese outside of school for my counties state exams. I didn't pick Japanese out of interest though. I won't get too deep into it but the choice was Japanese or nothing and I need extra points to ensure that I don't snooker myself after high school.
I also like dancing too.

My mum found out about all this when she caught me one day, practicing. I don't have any space to practice dancing so I do it in my room, I move all the furniture and make a clear space. She heard my footsteps. Since then, after finding out about my rapping hobby she's been torturing me with Kpop label applications.

After a while, I start practicing my dances with a blindfold on because I work better with muscle memory and she took a video of it once and posted it on her facebook. Literally everyone was commenting to send the video to all these entertainment companies.

She needs to realise that I am ASS compared to actual trainees and that it's just a hobby. I don't like to mix Japanese, Rap and dance together but she thinks I should.
She doesn't understand that I don't have a deep interest in Korean society/Asian societies in general. I am half asian but I am not Korean. 

It's everyday with this bs now. What should I do? She filled in one application for me and sent me the rest to fill in. She didn't even ask for my permission. I want to go to college and study business, not become a trainee.

What should I do?

83,"Hello, I am a freshman in college who has little experience with dating and I need some advice on how I should precede with my budding relationship with a girl. 

I joined a comedy club at the start of the semester in college and never really attended until the last few months in the semester. I enjoy the club a lot and I tend to go to their house parties all the time where we get pretty drunk. 

The parties are mostly with the same people and I know them all through the comedy club meetings, so we are a pretty close bunch. 

There was one girl, I’ll call her Daisy, who I didn’t talk to much during the club meetings but during this party we talked for around a hour and a half about all kinds of stuff. 

When her ride was about to leave she decided not to go and was willing to walk back to campus with me if we got no ride. Then both of us got a ride back 30 minutes later and we got to our dorms. 

She said that she wanted someone to walk back to the dorm with her (looking at me while saying this), even though it was literally 2 minutes away from my dorm. And when we (my two friends and I) walked her back she looked me directly in the eye and said “I had a really great time” and left. 

I want to have a relationship with her but I’m afraid I’ll get turned down and my relationship with the club as a whole will be weakened. And I don’t even know if she was talking to me because I was interesting or because she was just too drunk to give a shit (she didn’t have much to drink). ",03Dec2018,1

86,"Hey guys. This isn't like a major life-or-death advice question like I see here a lot, but rather just a simple one. I asked my parents to buy me a guitar and amp this summer, and they let me do so. It cost like around $300. So I'm a college student, so I've had a lot of schoolwork like normal. However, I figured I might be able to practice guitar somewhat during each week. However, I just haven't had much motivation to play it. I love music, especially rock, metal, jazz, hip-hop, and funk. However, I have a feeling that it's just the idea of playing guitar that doesn't appeal to me as much. I guess it's because I know a lot of people that play guitar, so it doesn't sound that exciting to me or make me motivated in a way. Anyway, I always try to listen to as much music as I can, and one thing I've noticed is that I absolutely love songs with really cool basslines. Since these are really common in funk music, I noticed this even more. That got me thinking: I think I want to play bass instead of guitar. The reason being that I hear a lot of cool basslines in music all the time, from older jazz to modern pop. That one Charlie Puth song (Attention I believe) had a cool bassline in the chorus. I enjoy bass parts more than guitar parts I've noticed. I guess I really just like how they provide backbones to songs, and I really like the low frequency sound they produce. Also, it would just sound cool to be able to say that I play bass because I literally know no one else who plays bass. Also, I heard that with bass, you don't have to change strings as often as you do with guitar. So, I feel like I want to pick up bass instead of guitar. Problem is, like I said, I got my guitar and amp just this summer. I kind of feel guilty for losing motivation like that. But I feel that bass parts are more prominent, so there's always gonna be stuff that I want to play. Also, I've heard more basslines in jazz, a genre that I love, than I have guitar parts. Would you guys say it's worth it to switch to bass for the reasons I listed? Also, for those of you who do play bass, is it still fun if I'm not trying to get a job as a bass player or something like that, just someone who wants to learn an instrument for fun? Also, is it true that changing strings is not that common with bass?",03Dec2018,1
87,"I am not a violent, misygonistic incel. I think women individually are often great. I have a few female friends, family,  co-workers, and bosses that are wonderful people. 

However, I think women's nature is really sinister. Most men that aren't looking Channing Tatum have no chance with 99% of women, and some end up single forever. Other guys who are unsuccessful with women can get women but they usually have to undergo tens of thousand worth of dollars worth of surgery. Such as hair transplants, leg-lengthening surgery. All for what? All for a woman who most are shallow to find him attractive.

Then, once a guy does attract a female, they get married, have kids. Then, after she finds a hotter guy with a bigger dick, she leaves him and takes half of his shit. And the cycle continues. Most women aren't this shallow and sinister. But enough of them are.

Anyways. That's my view on women. Just to put it out there that I am not sexist at all, just have some strong beliefs. But does this make me a bad person for having this beliefs? Can anyone prove me wrong?  ",03Dec2018,1

My fiancé ordered 3 items on amazon. We have informed delivery which basically lets UPS notify us when stuff is coming to either of our names. Amazon told us that we will get everything in 2 boxes. Although informed delivery told us we have 3 packages on the way and 1 of these packages needs to be signed for.

He is freaking out. Long story short usually if a package with drugs in it is intercepted they’ll make you sign for it because then they can prove you wanted it and intentionally took it (so you can’t argue that it just showed up and you didn’t know what it was). AND I KNOW WHAT YOU’RE THINKING and no, we did not order any drugs on the internet, but he currently has a court case going on for drugs (just pot) and he’s thinking their trying to ‘entrap’ him in someway. He’s been diagnosed PTSD and a lot of anxiety has been centered around the court case.

I’ve been trying to point out to him that he’s being silly but his stress is beginning to work it’s way into my brain too and I’m starting to think that’s it’s something bad. He keeps pointing out that I’m not taking this serious enough and that its not normal to receive packages that you don’t know where they are originating from, let alone have to sign for. And when we were talking about it I thought he was being crazy and acting like conspiracy theorist but now that I’m typing it out it is starting to sound a little concerning.

100,"Backstory: Used to work at a shop and became best friends with my coworker to the point where he was like a brother. He started dating this girl and from the first time I met her we locked eyes and I swear there was a connection. She ended up dating him for 5 years and they had a child together. I switched jobs and my ex-coworker resented me for leaving. I stayed in contact with his girlfriend throughout the years and now about 6 years have passed total. I have come to learn that he was mentally, physically, and verbally abusive to her. She has just gotten out of this relationship about 3 months ago and began frequently hitting me up. Their breakup left her with nothing and her scumbag ex will not help her with anything; daycare, food for the child, and etc. She is dirt poor and I feel nothing but the desire to help her with anything she needs. I am very well off financially so whatever she needs I give to her.

Where advice is needed: So me her and some of her friends went out to a bar in a more major city by us. We all have a couple drinks and are buzzed but by no means incoherent and unable to make decisions. So me and the girl (let's call her M) go outside for a cigarette. While we are out there I was leaning on the building and she came up and pressed against me and leaned her head on my shoulder. She looks up at me and we lock eyes and she kisses me. For the rest of the night she's all over me never left my side touching me and stuff. We get back to her apartment at like 2am and we kiss more and i lay down and she laid right down on top of me. For the next 4 hours we talk and talk about everything. All our fears and problems and everything that has ever bothered us. That's all that happens, nothing more, just kissing and talking. I have never had this with any girl. It was just such an immediate connection and it felt so right laying there with her. As we lay there I was thinking to myself that I want to be with this girl. Regardless of whatever problems she has or what she's going through or the fact that she had a child. In one moment I could havge had a second family. (This whole time she was just lying there in nothing but underwear and a tshirt). I was so content just talking to her that I didn't even notice anything else. Suddenly its 8am and we go get breakfast and then after I head out. Theres a hug and a kiss goodbye and I text her when I get home. She texts me saying that shes too fucked up in the head to get into anything right now and that she's afraid that all she would do is hurt me. She's admitted to having feelings for me and she agreed with me when I said that we would be good together, but she says she feels to broken to have those kind of feelings anymore, that until she learns to care for herself she can't accept someone else caring for her.

\-----

&amp;#x200B;

There is no sense in trying to hide it but I am a 27 year old virgin who's never been in a relationship or even had their first kiss yet. I had a pretty rough childhood and grew up in a home where my parents always fought, had on and off financial problems, and overall just don't have to many memorable moments I could be happy about. During my early school years I was always known as that weird/goofy kid that people never really wanted to give the time of day to. I was bullied often and even distinctly recall a day when I came home crying my eyes out because of how poorly I was being treated on a daily basis. I asked my parents to take me out of that school but thought just talking with the teachers was enough...it continued and I just decided to hold it all in and do my best to get through it. No matter how bad things got for me I continued to hold my head up high and pretend everything was alright and again still do this today. I'm very much the type of person to hide whats really going on because I've been conditioned my entire life to do so, my job is to make others happy. 

Why I was treated the way I was I'll never know as in my mind I was a normal child who just wanted to have a good time, make friends and make others happy to be around me. I always went out my way to make people happy and to this day I'm still like this, if others are happy then I'm happy. By the time I got to high school things got a little better although I still referred to as the weird kid and hung out with the other ""nerds"". I made a lot of friends, never had any problems with teachers or staff and was just an overall joy to be around. 

Just like most other teenage boys of course I noticed cute girls and often thought about sex and what it would be like to have a girlfriend; that's all they were to me though, just thoughts. All through high school and even my early twenties I knew I wasn't ready for either of those things, I very much so wanted to focus on maturing, becoming a better person and simply just get my own life in order first. Obviously during this time I had to watch all my friends get girlfriends, talk about sex and much more. There was even one or two opportunities to have sex but I wasn't ready. I didn't want to be that guy that just has meaningless sex with someone he does't care about to just do it; and believe me when I say I had and still have plenty of other guy friends growing up who all just had girlfriends to get steady sex and I didn't want that to be me, I'm better than that. 

Time continued on and I had to watch my friends all getting married and having kids, my family continuing to wonder what's wrong with me and why I don't have a girlfriend at my age etc. Then suddenly around the time I turned 25 I had an epiphany, I knew that I was ready. I was tired of feeling left out, I wanted to know what it's like to be loved and to give love, to come home from work and talk to the person who cares most about you and vice versa; sex was the least thing on my mind although I won't lie I want to know what that's like too. Fast forward to today I'm 27 and still have yet to experience any of those things I just mentioned. 

I've always been a very positive person and constantly look for the good to be had. Good things happen to those who wait they say but alas I'm still waiting. I'm by no means just praying for the right girl to magically fall into my lap but I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. For the first time in my life the feeling of slight depression has started to set in and I feel terrible about it because that's not the kind of person I am, one to feel sorry for myself. I know I have a lot of good qualities about me; I have a decent job, have my own place, drive a nice car, care about others, hit the gym often and am a pleasure to talk to. I'm constantly being told I'm handsome or cute, and even just today while at work a co-worker asked me if I had a girlfriend to which I replied no. They said have you looked at yourself in the mirror implying they liked the way I looked and was expected to be successful with the ladies, their words not mine. 

Believe me when I say I've definitely tried putting myself out there. Being an introvert makes meeting people in person rather difficult but I've also tried dating apps like Tinder or Bumble, Reddit and other means to no avail. When I've asked for advice from women they all seem to think the same way, which is that most women find inexperienced guys a turn off or intimidating because they don't want to deal with them. Truth be told I don't even know what women look for in a guy these days as how would I ever know if I've never had a girlfriend. Last time I checked there is no single woman on Tinder looking for a 27 year old virgin and everyday that passes by I get older and this problems gets worse. I usually tend to be attracted to women who are outside of my race which makes finding someone even harder. Also one thing I didn't think about until now is that even though I'm 27 I look not a day older than 17. This is a curse but also a blessing because on one hand I'll continue to look youthful as I get older but on the other hand no one is going to take me seriously or give me the time of day. I also live in the Seattle area which is considered the ""The Dead Zone"" for singles. 

I'm at a complete loss for what to do, is it just simply too late for me to find a woman? How do I approach dating apps, what do people look for on those things? I'm starting to give up hope and sink back into my depression and I don't want that to happen. I'm desperately trying to get on with my life but with no good signals to look forward to why should I keep trying.

119,"So here’s the sticky situation: I go to a very small school and we do extracurricular activities together. We’re also in the same group of friends, so there’s no avoiding this person.

To make a long story short, he’s my ex. The how and why doesn’t really matter. We agreed to just be friends, but things have been going downhill. It’s like he’s two faced. Let me explain. He has just been quite mean to me by just putting me down whenever he gets the chance. Whether it’s how I say something or an opinion I have or an answer I get wrong... He also argues when there’s absolutely no reason to!

But then he acts like nothing happened. He’ll be very distant and then suddenly, well, not. For example, there have been two instances when I decided to simply not text him and let him put in the effort if he wanted to maintain the friendship. We went a few weeks without texting, and then he suddenly started texting me about the most random (albeit, interesting) stuff. A few days go by, and then I’m the one doing all the texting again.

Fast forward and I decide to stop texting him again. Another few weeks go by and then we get into an argument at school. I won’t go into details, but it was very stupid and he became needlessly angry and was yelling at me. The bell rang so I just dropped it, but it disturbed me. I kinda ignored him for the rest of the day, and then he suddenly texts me again after school! I was just happy that he texted me so I responded to his joke, and then he didn’t respond. Weird, right? Like, why did he text me after all that time and then not actually converse with me? He texted me again a few days later and then did nothing to perpetuate the conversation once I responded.

Now my problem is that I don’t know how to act around him at school. I don’t want to be cold and seem like a jerk, but I also don’t think I should act like everything is just fine either. It’s also hard because we’re in the same group of friends. I have talked with him a couple times before, but his actions didn’t really change and I don’t think talking with him again would be effective. What should I do??",03Dec2018,1
120,"I just got through washing my hair and I accidentally got some water in my ear. I titled my head to try to get the water out, but my ear still feels clogged up. I can hear just fine but my ear still feels clogged, and I also hear grinding noises, which sound like bones grinding, in the ear that got water in it.

I’ve never heard this in this ear before until tonight when I got the water in it. I’m afraid that the water probably moved the “hammer and stirrup” bones or something.

So stupid me thought that I could probably put things back in place in my ear by putting my ear back under the water. It was really painful. I wasn’t thinking because I was panicking at the grinding sounds in my ear, so I stupidly put my ear back under the water.

If there is water still in there, does anyone have any remedies that could get rid of it?",03Dec2018,1
121,"About a month ago, we changed units in our apartment complex. The first trip we made to the new unit, I brought our box of important docs and the box containing my engagement ring. I know exactly where I put it (on the closet shelf) and I know for a fact the doors were kept locked and that I did not move the box while we transferred everything else over the next two days. 

About a week later, I was preparing for a work trip. I looked for my ring and couldn't find the box anywhere. Thought I probably moved it or my husband had, so I didnt think much of it. 

Over the past two weeks, I've been looking off and on for the box. It is nowhere to be found. Thinking over my steps and who has been in the unit, I recalled that our internet provider technician spent time working on the box in our closet during our second day in the unit. I feel awful suspecting, but there is no other explanation. 

I brought it up with my husband today and he really couldnt have cared less. It wasn't an expensive ring (therefore, not insured), but it was meaningful to me and I honestly feel hurt by how he brushed it off. Not that it really matters, but we were married two years before he gave me a ring from a jeweler. I'd purchased a $5 band off Amazon when we were first married, so receiving a ring was very special to me. 

I'd like to replace it, but now I dont know how to approach him about it. We're also working through a miscarriage and a tragic death in the family, so I'm probably more emotional about it than otherwise. Any advice for the discussion?",03Dec2018,1
122,"My friend and I have known each other for about a year and we've been we're basically dating in all but name for about 8 months. The problem is that she's trapped in an (emotionally) abusive relationship and she's made it clear to me she wants to leave on several occasions. I know there's still some love there, she's told me herself, the relationship has lasted almost two years and apparently the first year went very well but it's been abusive for a long time. Despite telling me that he's emotionally abusive, she thinks there's still hope, that it can be fixed. I want to believe her because this isn't healthy but it's been a year and things are only getting worse, I'm worried about her. She's clearly torn between him and I on some level. She's already stressed and I hate to be a burden, but this guy often has her in tears and I'm always trying to cheer her up and make her laugh. I love her and want her to be happy more than anything else, even if that mean us just being friends (but she's made it clear she doesn't want to stop being romantic with me). 

On one hand I want to help her, I know the guy myself (not very well, but I do know him) and could explain the situation. I worry that she isn't sticking up for herself enough and that it's going to hurt her if she keeps staying with him. On the other hand I realize how slimy it is that I have a personal stake in this whole mess. I know that when they break up she's going to come to me, she's told me that on dozens of occasions. Even now she often says I'm her boyfriend without the title. I hate the thought that us becoming friends may have had a hand in their relationship going down hill, which appears to be the case. Not only does that make me feel a bit guilty but I'd also feel guilty if I did anything, which sucks because I genuinely love this girl and I feel like I should help her. I find myself asking if I need to help? And if I do should I be the one to do it considering my stake in the situation? In the end I know that she's responsible for herself, and that I shouldn't act in a way that could negatively influence her life without talking to her first, I'm just looking for some guidance.

My bank account has always been kind of boundary-less for many years since I got my first job because our family had a lot of problems with paying bills and such. I have no issue with my father taking the money he needs, but lately he has been taking much larger sums without asking and taking a while to pay it back. Now he has borrowed around $2000 leaving me with roughly $200. I’m a student, I don’t have a lot saved. 

I have a really good relationship with my father but because of the tension it creates between him and my mother (she gets into argues with him a lot over it), I’m scared of bringing it up to him in case I hurt his feelings or make him upset.

136,"(South East Wisconsin) 

So I'll start out with how my fiance (both early 20's) and I met this wonderful lady (63 years old) that lives in our apartment complex. We moved in July 2018 and one day we saw this nice lady outside in her very pretty garden, and we stopped to compliment it. After a while of talking with her and then departing, we came to find ourselves a new friend in an unfamilar city. My fiance Kass is a lot closer to this lady than I am just FYI.

We didn't exchange numbers or anything like that but we do see each other regularly as we pass by. 

Now, this lady who we'll call Jane does have a husband that is 78 years old and is struggling with a whole host of medical issues; cancer, type 2 diabetes, amputations, mental illness, and now he is battling an infection that occurred in rehab a week or so ago. 

Let's go back to Jane, she has been 15 years sober and just over the weekend found out that her husband is dying due to this infection in his abdomen that spread. The doctors say the outlook is not good and he is experiencing hospital induced psychosis and calling her frequently in a confused belligerent state. She is now her POA (power of attorney).

So Friday night at about 11pm while my fiance was at work (she works til 5am) Jane stopped by and knocked on my door. I'm very suprised by this and I open the door and greet her and she is immediately overpowering with a grieved look on her face. She keeps asking me ""where is Kassandra where is Kassandra?"" while crying. I told her ""she's at work she won't be home til 5am, why what's wrong?' and I let her in. She tells me multiple times ""My husband is dying, my husband is dying and I am so scared"" at this point I could tell she was drunk because of the smell and her staggering. I grabbed my phone and let Jane call my fiance, and they talked for a while, basically saying the same things to my fiance and then hanging up. My fiance and Jane agreed to meet around noon the next day to check on her and talk. I then sit in my kitchen with Jane for about 20 minutes, and let her pet my dogs and cat. I listened to her and offered her a ride to the hospital to be with her husband, she kept declining and didn't really get much out of her besides that she's scared. I tried to offer her food or water and she said no. She then said ""I have to go"" and left. 

I was very worried about her because I &amp; my fiance have my own experience with alcoholic loved ones and only slightly scared she would try to harm herself. So I waited about an hour and knocked on her door, I got no response but her lights were on..I figured she probably just fell asleep from being so intoxicated. 

So anyhow about 11am the next day and my fiance sends me over there to go check on her again and again I get no response however her blinds are now open and last night they werent. So I figured we'll come back later. 

&amp;#x200B;

Flash forward to tonight (Sunday) we go over there before we go to the store for some stuff and check on her. She let us in and we talked with her for a bit, she tells us that she's been sober for 15 years and has been drinking a lot over the past few nights, not eating AT ALL except for maybe some cheerios, and she mentioned her kidneys hurt badly (go figure), so we offered to pick her up groceries and get some dinner so we can all eat together so she doesn't have to be alone. (she doesn't have anyone besides her sister who is also a heavy drinker). She agrees to let us get her paper towel. When we got there she asked us about our wedding stuff and we mentioned we're getting my fiance's wedding bands today. She ooh'd and ah'd at the pictures and said a whole bunch of sweet things about how it is to be young again. 

Before we left she goes and grabs HER wedding ring and tries to slip it on my fiances finger, she declines heavily but Jane insists that Kass takes it and she agrees to give it back when we get back. (This ring is HUGE let me tell you, the diamond was bigger than my future mother in laws $50,000 ring).

Anyhow so we depart from her house and go do what we have to do, and we come back later with a chicken and some older movies for her. She thought it was very nice but asks us to come back half an hour later so she can use the restroom. (which seemed odd, we thought maybe she was downing as many drinks as she could).

We get back to our apartment and she called me and asked us not to come over, and to come over tomorrow in the morning instead. I did ask her if maybe I could come and get the chicken so we could eat some for dinner tonight (we're broke college students, I felt bad but its all we really had to eat). I go back and she asks me to maybe bring a chicken sandwich over in 2 hours so I said ""yeah of course!"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Now this is where it gets really nuts. We came back over at 8pm tonight and we got her to eat some food thank GOD. She thought it was very good and ate half of it. She had an older black and white show on with very dramatic music and we sat there and listened to her vent as she ate. She kept mentioning how she was embarassed and brought out an old AA book and she tried her best to recite words from it while tearing up. 

OK, so now we're sitting her listening to her monologing and she suddenly starts calling my fiance Kassandra ""Belle"" who is her AA sponsor, this scared the shit out of me and turned this whole thing around. My stomach dropped when I realized she's hallucinating because I'm a CNA and I've dealt with folks who have alcohol induced psychosis, they can be very violent and VERY hard to redirect. She was eating the food ravenously and thought the TV was talking to her. She thought her mom was in the other room yelling at her and experienced pain as if someone was harming her. She started to get up and pace around which is when I motioned to Kass that we need to GTFO. We politely excuse ourselves but she is almost aggressively sympathetic in trying to get us to stay. As we're trying to leave Jane grabs Kass' hand very hard and says ""I don't want to have to hurt you"". We did eventually get out of there after she asked us to come and check on her at 8 or 9 in the morning. We're sitting in our apartment in shock almost. We're not sure what to do. We called an AA hotline and they told us to call the police to get her admitted maybe. But she CAN get into our part of the building without a key. We are the ONLY people that knows she's in this state of mind and health, and she will absolutely 100% know it's us that called. We would have no problem calling if other people knew, but we are worried about our own peace of mind and safety in our home. If she gets out and is very agitated that we called we're worried about what she might do.

140,"My sister has always been very shy ever since she was a small kid. She has recently been diagnosed with social anxiety and she doesn’t have it easy. She doesn’t have a lot of friends, and she never hangs out with anyone, the only people she talks and hangs out with is basically me and my younger brother. Recently she was doing practical (following a nurse at an old people home) as part of her education, and as a whole she was rather quiet. She still did everything she was supposed to do and helped with what she needed to. But apparently when they had a meeting with her(they were supposed to have meetings and give feedback) and there was three adults and her and they were telling her that she was too quiet and didn’t take enough initiative and that “maybe she should reconsider her career/education choice if she was like this”. And if you’re a young girl already suffering from social issues, this might affect you a lot. Heck, even your mental health is perfect this will still hit hard as you’re just a child and there’s three adults there and not even one of them is on your side. My father told me about how this had happened, and they’re going in to talk to the school and principal in a few days.
Practical is now over and she’ll just be going to school again, but I think it’ll be hard for her to actually go to school. It was hard enough for her to go to school even before all this.
She’ll probably skip school for a while at least now. Obviously her mental health is more important than school, and while I’ll encourage her to go if she’s able to, if she can’t then she can’t. I’ve also suffered from several mental illnesses so I know it’s very hard.
I want to be there for her and help, but I’m not sure how. Some parts of the year I’m not even in the country cause I’m working abroad, when I am here though we do live in the same house.
I try to spend time with her whenever I can. Today if she’s not going to school I was planing to bring her to visit our grandmother if she wants to. And hopefully we’ll travel to another country together during the winter just me and her(she’s already said that she wants to and we just need to figure out the details).
I mean practically if she ever needs something, I’ll be there and help her with it(if she needs money, a ride somewhere, food or just anything really). But I don’t know how to do the same thing emotionally. I’m not the best at emotions, so I don’t know how to show that I care. Of course is she ever comes to me with something I’ll listen to her and do my best to help her, but how do I actually show her that I’ll always be there emotionally as well?
Any advice you have is very appreciated. And while I’ve had friends with social anxiety, every person experiences it differently and there’s no one size fits all way to help.
She is getting professional help, the waiting times are very long so it’s a slow process, but she has started getting real help.

If you yourself have experienced social anxiety and similar things to what I have described, what helped you, what made things worse?
Any advice is extremely appreciated and I’ll keep doing research on the internet to see if I can find useful information that applies to her. So if you have any good helpful links, slide them my way please. Thank you in advance!

I have a better relationship with my mother but I don't like my father. He's charismatic and I would love for him to be my dad but he yells at me and puts me down. I feel like I never really had a father because he wasn't there emotionally and I think he hurt my self-esteem.

  
After I moved out, y mother argued with me to text my father and ask him how he was doing. I was upset because I didn't want to, the reason being his behavior towards me and him being the major reason I moved out.  
My mother agreed that some of his behaviors were unprecedented but she said it was because of his blindness, my father has macular degeneration and his vision deteriorated to the point that he can only read. My father can't travel anywhere outside by himself.  
She also said it's because he is trying to push us.  
I feel like nobody cares about how I feel or why I moved out. Nobody in my whole family sat me down and said he FAT\_BOSMA how are you feeling?   
On one hand I feel like she has a point on my father's poor vision causing his outrage; however, that's his problem, he's always been like this, I'd feel more sympathy if we had a good relationship but the disability(blindness) caught up to him.   
My mother says that he's slowly improving his behavior and it's going to take time. I honestly just don't care about my father and this problem is straining an already weak relationship I have with my mother.

145,"This is a post I made on r/raisedbynarcissists but I didn't get any replies. I need help please so here's the post:

Hi guys. I'm looking for some help with dealing with my dad. Its a long story so please bear with me. I'm a 22 year old guy and I'm finishing up my undergraduate degree. I was supposed to write my last exam last week Friday but I was unable to because of a panic attack in the morning. What led to the panic attack was that it was my last week at university and I had two exams that week, one on Monday and the one on Friday. My parents called me during the week to say that they are going to pick me up on Friday, the day of my test. Its a 4 hour drive to get to my university from home and I have to move out. So I have to get everything ready to be moved out on Friday and prepare for a 3 hour long exam from 8am to 11am. All of this left me stressed. My father calls on the Thursday to confirm that I'm being picked up on Friday. I tell him my situation and ask if I can be picked up on Saturday or Sunday instead. I sense some anger in his tone and he insists that I be picked up on Friday, emphasising that I don't have much to pack up and that he was going to be busy working on the weekend (he is self employed) ,which is true, but I feel as if its a bit unfair considering how much pressure I'm feeling at that point.

I'd like to go off on a bit of a tangent to explain somewhat recent events that occurred but will be relevant to this current situation. So a few months back, my dad searched my phone while I was asleep and basically caught me for weed. Its not something I'm particularly angry about because I wasn't supposed to be smoking that stuff, but what made me finally realise that there was something wrong was my attempts to come clean with my feelings. I told him about various mistakes I've made during my university career and what I feel about them, basically spilling my guts. But my father being the religious man he is blamed all of my problems on the devil. He went through my memes on my phone claiming they were satanic, went through a WhatsApp yoga group I'm part of to help deal with my anxiety and said I was practicing satanism because of one discussion we had about LGBT issues. This all culminated in him basically forcing me to turn myself over to Christ. I'm agnostic myself and I have no problems with people having their own faith, but I remember feeling distinctly angry and humiliated then, on top of having my feelings invalidated. What's even worse is that I had spoken to him about continuing NY studies to do postgraduate philosophy. I had already been accepted, and I was in the process of applying for a scholarship, but after that incident he became unsupportive of it. Lastly one day during an early lecture from 7:30-9:30, when I'm tired and have to do a presentation after the earlier events, I get a message from him saying that if I buy weed he will sue me in January. I was going to discuss this with a tutor who is also a friend and the message was deleted. I interpret this as a threat.

Coming back to the original story, I get my things ready Thursday night and wake up early Friday morning. I want to get some last minute studying done and I start to feel the build up of anxiety and the subsequent panic attack. I talked to the head of residence about this and all of my other problems relating to my father and I ask her to be around to help me talk to him, to which she agrees. She helped me get a sick note and I arranged to write a sick test. Now I wait for my dad to arrive. When he gets there the meeting is arranged and we have a chat, all three of us in the head of residence's office. What I wanted out of the discussion was to get my dad to actually try and understand my feelings and not just relegate all of his advice and ""bonding"" time to lengthy biblical lectures. After the chat it seems like he had agreed to let me stay until my sick test and then pick me up. I felt victorious. Not even five minutes later he gives me a call to come to his car. He says that he's taking me home and he was convinced that if I stayed I would pose my life. So I'm devastated and confused at this point. I reluctantly agree and tell him I'll sort out the forms with the head of residence while he goes up to my room to gather my stuff. I see the head of residence and explain my situation to her and she us just as baffled as I am, but her being the great person she is is willing to talk to him again. When he arrives at the office I tell him I really don't want to go home and he us adamant that he'll take me. I'm a foreign student, do he uses this as leverage because he has my passport and he said he will call the cops and embassy to take me home. At this point I lose it. I'm shouting at him and hurling insults l, unloading feelings of how I've never felt like a human in his household, how I've tried to make good and that's still not enough and causing a scene in general. He basically started to laugh at me and recorded me while I'm losing my shit. It was useless in the end. I got my stuff ready and went home. The head of residence did leave me with some encouraging words. She said I stood up for myself and that's what's important.

The car ride home was tense. But quiet for the most part. At this point its late into the night and we're still driving. He bursts out in anger saying how he has never been treated in such a way by a child, and his he felt embarrassed and humiliated. Good I thought. He said that my behaviour and panic attack was attention seeking. He also said he doesn't want to hear such from me again and he started to ask about my friends. I told him about them, and I told him his we share our problems with each other. Such things are private affairs he explained and he basically said I should only seek advice from him. With everything that's happened before I literally have to type all of this on my phone in the dead of night. The next day we have another talk and it seems like he is willing to see some things my way, but a few days later it feels like nothing's changed.

TL;DR Shits fucked with my dad, and even though he says he'll change, it feels like nothing's changed. Please help",03Dec2018,1
146,"I used to live in my parent’s apartment for about a year, until I got a job last year. The apartment’s next to their actual place where they live, but basically unused because of difficulty of access.
(long story)
Most of my stuff I’ve moved out but not everything, since it’s a pain to access (especially carrying stuff). So in some rooms are still some personal items, that I haven’t had time (or space for!) or direct need to move. 


So I get a message from my cousin, that he (together with his gf I don’t really know that well) went through my ‘abandoned house’ and found stuff that he wants to have, and ‘can I have it if you don’t want it anymore?’
I’m like; ok, what stuff?
And since he took some pictures of the stuff he wanted to have I get sent a picture of a personal sketchbook which he went through and thought was really cool.


Now I love my baby cousin and would gladly give my sketchbook (even though I really want to keep my sketchbooks for myself) but I feel super weird about them going through my stuff, even opening and flipping through notebooks and everything. I’ve got personal stuff there! It’s not ‘abandoned’ stuff. And doing it without me being there and asking for permission first just feels kinda wrong.


Now, I know I’m in the wrong for leaving my possessions in my parents’ apartment and expecting them to not do anything with it, especially for that long.’ (and without me saying it)
And he’s my cousin, I can’t really deny him anything he asks for JUST because I don’t really feel like giving it away. It’s not like I still use the sketchbook a lot, and I can take pictures.
Also anything else in the house he’s asking for, since I don’t have an immediate need for it and can more easily afford it (I can just replace most things afterward)
But I really feel like I need to ‘reprimand’ him or something or at least go like ‘I feel bad you just flipped through my things’, and not give the sketchbook. 


Am I being a bad cousin and selfish/petty here? what should I do?

149,"So a little backstory. 
I am a 22 year old guy from Denmark. My life has not always been easy. Turn back 3-4 years i was in high school. In high school i had my first “love” i put it in quotes cause now when i look back, it really just was me being a horny teenager. 
Well not to bore you with the details that girl cheated on me and i took it very hard. We of course broke up and i started going out with the wrong people, and ended up doing drugs. A lot of drugs. This kicked me sort of into a depression and for 1-2 years i literally did nothing with my life much.. 
I started working a job and i turned my life around. Currently i am studying computer science and i enjoy this alot, but the crossroads is this. 
I am now in a relationship with an amazing girl. I have never in my life met someone who quite gets me as she does. She can immidiatly tell when i am sad or upset. She understands me and all in all makes me a better person. I love her to bits. 
She lives about 2 1/2 hours away, now this might not seem like a lot but what this means is that i cant see her every day. 
Lately the thought of seeing her every day has become more and more important to me. 
For the past month i’ve been neglecting my school quite heavily. I need another year and im done with school, but i am more and more consumed with the idea of living with her. 
What the hell should i do. 
Move in with her and start a new school, or stay in school and keep it long distance.

I dont pay for school, i actually get paid to go to school, and i think i quite easily could start anew someplace else.
(my grades are fine and im somewhat of a smart guy when it comes to computers) 

We have been together for almost a year and half + 3 months of dating before i asked her to be my girlfriend. And we have been through so much together. And the thought of me not waking up to her beautiful face every day is haunting me.

150,"Well Reddit, title says all. I absolutely suck at expressing my emotions; it's always been people telling me how they feel before I could. I've been single for years but I wouldn't say I'm experienced in dating/romance at all, and now this. My best friend of 3 years that we went through so much together and learned from each other. Never a dull moment. Our friends occasionally teased us being a guy and a girl so close to each other, but I never thought about it until now.

I'm developing feelings for him, the whole attraction thing is here and I have no idea what to do or how to express my emotions to him or even if I should. He's the easiest person to talk to but this is just that one thing that leaves me speechless. I'm a very average girl,  I'm not too special, but he's the world to me even though he thinks that of himself. We both have some trust issues when it comes to romance, but he's never dated anyone in his life. 

I have no idea whether he's into me or not. We're rather close and jokingly flirt with each other, but I'm not even sure if we could take any flirts seriously at this point. I don't want to ruin our friendship; I'm with him and talk to him everyday, he makes my day all the time. We know everything about each other and losing him would be unbearable. I don't want things to be awkward, but I feel like I'm breaking my own heart here.

It got so bad that even when we had to cancel plans, I teared up. I even consider not texting him first or at all to distance myself. Should I even consider telling him at all or keep it all in? He's not the type of guy to pick up hints or drop any, I have no idea what to do. I wish I knew how he felt about me, and my intentions are good with him; I care so much about him, I just wish he could love me the way I love him.

I don't want to experience heartbreak ever again. I've had enough of that for two lifetimes. And this...welp, it wasn't supposed to happen, but it did. I just started growing feelings. I'm looking for advice on how to admit this to him and clear the air...or forget it and distance myself completely. I'm not sure what it'll mean for our friendship but I'm open to all advice.

155,"I want to apologize at the start for this long post. I  need this sub’s help. I really am at a loss of what to do. 

I am the oldest of five. I have 4 little sisters that range from 18 to 5 years old. I myself am 20. I’m the only boy. All four of my sisters will now be “homeschooled” by our mother who did not teach me anything in the last four of the five years I was homeschooled. 

A little background on my family: 

My mother was verbally and emotionally abused by her step-dad, my dad was as well by his step-dad. My mom’s mother, always let it happen and told my mom to let it in one ear and out the other. Anytime my mom threatened to tell outside help how bad it was she was always accused of being the reason he was so bad. 

My dad’s mother was the opposite, she was very overbearing on my dad and decided every decision in every facet of his life. Thusly, my parents have both decided to be the exact opposite - my mom is now like my dad’s mom, my dad is like my mom’s mom. 

I was pulled out of school in the third grade for “bullying” - Something I wish never happened. I can’t explain how far this put me back. My now-18 year old sister was pulled out of school at the same time. 

My mom homeschooled us well for the first year, but after that, she always told us to wait for dad to get home. My mom is unemployed, a SAHM. My dad works an 8-5, comes home, fixes dinner, cleans the dishes, takes care of the kids and puts them to bed. Then he goes and works OT from home in his office until 2 or 3am every night. 

Obviously, my dad has no time to sit down and help us with school. He would yell at us for “not making mom help us.” And then my mom would yell at us for “not making dad do it.” This cycle continued to the point where my sister and I would hide our textbooks, lie to our parents about doing work (on the rare occasion my mom would ask) and generally feel pretty shitty about ourselves and what we were doing. I dealt strongly with depression &amp; suicidal thoughts during this time. (Beginning at 8-9 years old.)

Eventually, our mom finally stopped buying us textbooks and school just didn’t happen. Anytime family would ask, it would be lies detailing how good we were doing. What strikes me most as odd is she would always have us in a co-op or a homeschool group and we would always attend and be involved. We would work on school there, that one day a week, but never the rest of the week. 

(Side note - my mom is the kind of lady who posts everything about her life on Facebook. She’s also the kind of person who is ALWAYS sick.)

Fast forward a few years and non-stop begging of my parents to let me get back into public school, I’ve graduated high school early, moved out on my 18th birthday, worked 50-60+ hours/wk between multiple jobs for two years and I am a week away from moving into a university an hour away as a freshman. 

My 18 year old sister has had no desire to get back into public school. She had a brief moment where she wanted to, for her freshman year, and my mom told her in a fight that “people don’t like people like you.” (My sister listens to heavy metal, pop-punk genre of music and has bright red hair) This terrified my sister and destroyed any shred of self-esteem she held. She now keeps by herself in her room for 18-20 hours of the day and doesn’t talk to anyone in the family. My parents make stupid comments about it but don’t do a thing to help her. She held a couple jobs for a few months and seemed to be on the come-up, but quit them because “she was working too much.” And my parents aren’t pushing her to do a thing so she is currently unemployed with the education of a kindergartener at 18. She is well-written and well spoken but has not been educated in any subject. 

My ten year old sister was doing great, has been in private school/then public school for the last three years. As recently as today, I assumed she was loving her new intermediate school. She told me today she is dropping out of the public school at Christmas break to join her 8 year old and 5 year old sister at a local co-op where they meet once a week. This devastated me. I LOVE my sisters and I don’t believe they are getting any form of education through this. 

From what they tell me, they sing songs to learn each subject and they don’t have any textbooks/workbooks they go through at home. They are supposed to, but the 8 year-old tells me that “mom forgets to do school every day, and that’s ok with me because I don’t like school.”

Obviously my two youngest sisters are too young to understand the damage that this is causing to their lives. I need your help, reddit, because I am at a loss on what to do. I thought my ten year old sister was doing so well in school. She refused to sit down and talk to me about her decision on school, telling me it is “mine and mom’s decision only, not yours.” 

My 18 year old sister has depression, anxiety and little to no social skills. She has no education, and can’t hold down a job. This is the path my three other sisters are taking and my parents are OKAY with this. I just don’t understand. 

We have no other family near us, although it wouldn’t be much help if we did. All of our grandparents know our situation but my mom is so controlling that if they disagree with her on any decision they lose contact to their grandkids for months at a time. 
No one wants to do anything to rock the boat. Their hands are tied. 

I’m a week from moving away into university and my Mamaw told me the best thing I can do is to move, wash my hands of this and just pray for them. But they are my sisters, and I feel so much like I have raised them as much/more as my parents. I don’t want to ruin my future by staying behind, but I don’t want them to not even have a chance of a future. 

I’ve considered contacting authorities but I’m scared of what lies behind opening that can of worms - I couldn’t imagine them taking my sisters away. 
We also live in a state that has no requirements on homeschooling - they don’t have to update the state or take any sort of testing. 

Please help me. I don’t know what to do. 

TL;DR

I am the oldest of 5 and I am concerned about the future and welfare of 4 younger siblings that are being neglected educationally and also emotionally. ",03Dec2018,1
156,"I'm a 17 year old Male 
When I was in the 8th grade me and some friends, who all went to the same school at the time, made our group of friends. After middle school, I went to a different high school than most of them, most went to the same school, but we still kept in contact through, weirdly enough, a Playstation party. We got online a lot regardless of where we went to school, skip two years later to July of this year. They introduced this girl to the group and it was an instant connection with her, and soon enough she became one of my best friends, and she lives near me, we would talk everyday and tell each other everything (even about her love interest). Which turned out to be one of the guys from the group, and I would try to help her and give her advice with issues she'd have with him. Skip some time later and he was sort of playing her with some other girl and it would break my heart seeing her deal with this, around this time she had invited me to her homecoming dance along with him so it was a weird triangle between us because we all knew what he was doing and I spent the whole night trying to get her to talk to him about what was going on, but seeing as how it was the second time we'd seen each other in person I began to see her in a new way and start to feel strongly about her so pushing her to fix the issue with the guy was excruciatingly painful for me but it was necessary because she's my friend. The dance had ended and they had talked but it was rather inconclusive than helpful, but nonetheless he stopped having contact with the other girl and was all in for a relationship with her, and then me and her talked about it as we always do and I tried to help her, eventhough I liked her as well but she didn't know that. Skip again a few weeks to as of recently and they're dating, and they really like each other and don't want to mess it up, both their relationship and their friendship because they think it'll make a gap in the group. You see, their worries come from the fact that they aren't good at relationships and are very new to actually trying so they fear that it will push each other away, yet they still very much like each other. Then there's me, the guy who loves this girl very much and wants her to be happy, and as much as it hurts to help with her relationship problems, I still do my best to guide her in the right direction. So my question is should I try to get over her and move on? Because I think about her a lot and I think she is the greatest person I've ever met and one of my best friends, but I can't keep going on being hung up on her, not knowing if there's a future or not.

157,"I have NEVER seen a brown cockroach in my life before last night. I had a cheap dresser full of clothes and towels that never get used in the master bedroom (where I sleep). The dresser was by a window that ants occasionally come in around. I kept a basket of medicine in the top drawer and went in or an ibuprophen late last night. Opened a drawer and saw a large brown roach on the external side of the drawer. It scurried away inside when I stood up and disappeared somewhere deeper inside the dresser. I went through the top drawer meticulously, bagging everything in trash bags and found no evidence of roaches. Thought maybe it was just one. Then I opened the second drawer and saw two nymphs crawling over a pair of old leggings. I hastily closed it up, taped every crack and got help carrying it out to our apartment complex's dumpster. I'm fairly sure the dresser was a nest and the roaches were attracted by a patch of mildew in the lower back panel. I never saw it before and I think it must be from rain that came in through the window when my brother opened it a month or two ago.

Day 1: a note is left on my car “Please don’t park hear”

I check with the landlord again and he assures me those spots aren’t designated. So I keep parking in an open handicap spot if it is available. 

Day 2: another note on my car “don’t park here”

I was in a different spot this time. I know they aren’t paid/designated for. I toss the note and go about my day

Day 3: a third note under my wiper “DONT PARK HERE”

Alright I’ve had enough. Someone really thinks these spots belong to them. More so I am worried they will fuck with my car since they keep putting notes on it and the tone is getting less pleasant. I get a dash cam and record who is putting the notes on my car.

It’s my next door neighbors. They have 5 cars. They only pay for two spots. So they’ve been claiming the handicap (and loading) area for themselves. I guess I didn’t get the memo. 

So I print out a copy of my text from the landlord explaining the situation. I put it on the windshield of one of their cars hoping they would see it and contact the landlord and hopefully stop pestering my car. 

I took some trash down to the garage two hours later and found my note ripped up in front of my car. Weird response. So I text the landlord and tell him the neighbors are acting weirdly agressive about this handicap spot business and I need him to get me a new spot. He says he’s working on it.

Today I found some trash on my hood and caught one of the neighbors throwing it at my car on camera. The trash wasn’t hard/heavy enough to do damage but it doesn’t send a good message.

The landlord doesn’t seem to care about the situation. I pay for a spot and I’m going to park in the garage whether this family likes it or not. If they damage my car I will have in on video. But it’s nervewracking feeling like I just have to let them keep harassing my car.

Any advice for what I should do? ",03Dec2018,1

166,"Im so afraid right now about my future. Im about to fail two classes this semester and just told my parents about it. 

My parents allow me to live with them even though I am 21. We split a payment on a family car that is in their name,  not mine. They pay for my tuition, and most of the necessities of life. 

I work part time as a delivery driver and make about 17,000 a year off of that. I also sell odd and ends stuff for another few thousand a year. 

When I told my parents it went rather poorly, but nothing that wouldn't be expected considering I just wasted 4000 dollars. I feel so fucking terrible, stupid, and like a total piece if shit.

My parents are going to prevent me from seeing any of my friends, watch tv, etc. Basically unless it isn't work or school I can't do it or else I will be kicked out of the house with no car (so no job), and no tuition. Also if I ever wanted to get my own car instead of paying for this one, I couldn't until they remove me from the family credit card, which I never use but has 10,000 dollars in debt on it. Meaning no loan or one with a ridiculous rate.  

I have one year left of college and just need to stick it out and do it. This next year will be like torture but I would be stupid to throw away my education right? 

I don't want to leave. I love my parents and it would crush them. At the same time the thought of what this will do to my relationships and my own mental wellbeing has me so fucking sad and scared. 

Leaving now would be the mistake of a lifetime, literally it would completely change the course of my life, but I just don't know if I can live under these conditions without going insane. Am I just being a total bitch? 

I feel like my parents have me trapped and know it. They are using it to structure my life in line with what they want. Im not even mad at them for it I know they love me and this will probably be good for me. 

If you can't im pretty torn and feel like both my choices are total shit. 

I don't know what to do and just wanted to share. Thanks if you read this. I know it's not that juicy.

168," I had a bit of a e-relationship with someone who was way older than me. Looking back I realize this was pointless. Anyways, they had severely damaged my self esteem for awhile. Calling me fat and ugly. Lying and cheating. I recently came back into contact with them and they made it seem like they wanted a relationship with me while I mentioned a joke that I was going out with someone. After this they said they didn't want anything romantic with me. Throughout this ordeal of this year they kept leading me on. I'm pretty sure they were a sociopath as they wanted to harm me and other stuff. Is there any way I can better protect myself against these types of people in the future? Thanks.

170,"How do I begin? There's this girl that really caught my attention as we had both just met and she was really cute and had an awesome personality. She added me on snap and I found out quickly that she liked me. We hung out for a bit and eventually kissed. Then she wanted to take things slow and I agreed. It's weird because she seemed to be wanting to go at a faster pace, but whatever. We continue texting and talking in school. Things seem fine. I tell her how I feel through text and she says she feels like I'd be a good boyfriend and she thinks she wants to date me. That Sunday we cuddled at the movies. Fast forward to now, a few weeks later. She says she doesn't have time for a relationship with family drama, basketball, and school getting in the way. I don't know if she is being sincere because she's had boyfriends while doing basketball. I still like her and I really want things to work out, but we haven't hung out in a while and we haven't really texted (although part of that is her mom broke her phone, she had to get a new snap, and she barely texts anyway, but now I feel ignored as I get left on opened sometimes). Ahh. Its weird because normally I'd take that  as a sign, but this Friday  she asked one of her friends, who is also my friend, if  she knew if I still was interested in her. It's also weird because she came over at a basketball thing and wanted pictures and apparently begged my friend to send them to her. She still exhibits signs that she likes me by talking to me in class, making eye contact, looking calm, dancing, smiling, etc. It's really confusing.

My boyfriend and his family are from Mexico and they used to always go back for christmas (We live in the United States.) He hates going so he doesn't go anymore. Anyways his mom and sometimes dad will always make jokes about my fiance's ""girlfriend in Mexico"".

For example:

Parents: Do you guys want to come to Mexico again this year with us?

Fiance explains that he doesn't want to go.

Parents: Oh you don't want [me] to see your girlfriend huh?

So basically we work at a retail warehouse. It’s pretty big. If I try hard enough I can avoid her, but sometimes our paths have to cross because we both are trained as cashiers. We are both armed with knives at all times because we open boxes to stock the store. The other day she threatened me. The threat was to stab me and carve a smiley face into my skin with her box cutting knife simply because she found me too uptight. We had no prior issues, she just doesn’t like my personality. She’s very loud and opinionated and I’m very shy and reserved, so naturally we don’t really mix. Since we started back in September she’s always been vocal about how I don’t smile enough or how I don’t laugh at her jokes. I’m friendly to her, but I’m not really working to make friends. Ecspecially not when I’m 17 and she’s in her 40’s. And I’m slightly socially awkward too so that doesn’t help. 

The other day I reported this threat to my manager. I’m genuinely scared of this woman and I don’t feel comfortable around her. She goes on angry rants all the time, and I’m afraid she might snap one day. And she’s armed and a very physical person so who knows what she might do to me. It’s not likely she’d stab me, but honestly I don’t know much about her, so I don’t know if she’s actually been violent in her past or if it’s all just an act. I am scared.

My manager is building a case against her because several people (4 in total including myself) have complained about her harassing them. But for now she still works here, and she knows what I said about her. I’m terrified of getting into a confrontation with her so I’ve been avoiding her, but it’s been affecting my ability to work. And I hate feeling so on edge all day. At this point I just want to quit, but we’re already slightly understaffed and I don’t want to be a burden to anyone else since I’m the main cashier and me leaving would mean they would have take someone out of stock and put them on cash full time, which at this point we can’t afford because we’re already a few stock people short.

188,"So it’s about a year long relationship. I’ll go through some of the details in list form:


She seemed great. We really hit it off and have a lot of similar interests.
-I saw she was smart and hard working and appreciated that.

She was a pageant girl.
-I’m not really into pageants, but I listened to her stories since she seemed to like the scene.

She had a lot of drama in her life from parents divorcing to some pretty messy drama in high school.
-I understand she had a hard time and all. Her dad is a real pos. About 400 pounds and does nothing but trash talk her mom.

In high school, she dated some popular football player and got in a lot of drama with him where they would break up, he would talk trash about her online and she would say stuff online too. This led to the “popular” kids not liking her. 
-From some details I heard, it sounded like she was a bit a part of the drama

When she tried out for the cheerleading team, they didn’t let her in. Her mom got involved and said they were only letting in their friends and people they liked, so she had the school force them to let her in.
-Her mom was heavily involved and definitely played a roll in stirring up the drama, so that struck me a bit weird.

She got bullied by many people saying she was just causing drama.
-Again, it felt like that might have been partly her and her mom.

She told me all about this pretty early on and cried about it.
-I realized she opens up A LOT very fast.

She began talking about her exes A LOT.
I know way too many details about these guys. How many shoes one guys has, his moms history of drug use, girls he has dated, etc.
-I just think this is distasteful. I’m not the jealous type, but this rubbed me the wrong way after a while.

She would bring things up in a way that would nudge me into asking about something where she would bring up details about her exes. She would go on and on and on until I just budded in and changed the subject.
-Again, I really wasn’t a fan of it. I never seemed enthusiastic about it or happy to talk about it, but she was awfully excited to talk about it and didn’t really catch my hints.

She dated some guy that would just use her for sex but would keep hanging around and said “I just don’t know what I saw in him, but I REALLY liked him”.
-Ok, so it seemed like it was a fwb but she didn’t want to say it that way or she didn’t have much integrity at that time.

Before that guy, she dated some guy for 3 years. She said she was over him but apparently didn’t have closure and cried when she found out he had a new gf. I asked her how she could get over it and she said she would need call him or just wait a long time. I said just call. She called while she was at my house (I know, kinda weird) but has been perfectly fine since then.
-Of course this wasn’t cool in my eyes.

She said she hates to be alone and needs the attention.
-Not good in my eyes.

She REALLY digs for details about me and my dating past. She searched my ex up on Facebook as soon as she knew her name. Her. And her mom gossiped about it. Her brothers gf Facebook stalked her as well.
-That struck me as invasive, insecure, and immature.

On that note, her mom is in her 50’s and is a real socialite. Gossips A TON. Loves expensive jewelry. That kind of stuff.
-I think her mom is hard working but is a classic pageant mom.

I eventually found out when my gf got a Pap smear that she has HPV. So I got HPV from her.
(Human Papilloma Virus. Not Herpes)
-I know it doesn’t affect guys as much as girls, but it really bothers me because I don’t want to pass it on to any future partner.

With that 3 year ex, her mom really didn’t like him and “forced” her to go on some date with some pharmacist because he had money. She told her not to tell her bf. She apparently felt terrible after and told him immediately.
-BS. Anyone with integrity wouldn’t do that.

She would continue to talk about her exes, random guys that hit on her, etc.
Example: “Last time I was here, there was this group of guys that were hitting on me and my mom and I thought it was so funny. We were just cracking up.”
I ended up telling her that it was weird she did stuff like this and she stopped.
-I feel like she’s trying to talk herself up and/or make me jealous.

A LOT of humble bragging. From talking about how pretty people say she is to her grades.
-This is just annoying.

When watching tv shows, she will say “He’s HOT” multiple times every episode where there’s some hunky guy.
-I feel it’s fine every once in a while but not 6 times a night.

She needs to see me every single day and is mildly upset if I need to get my own stuff done.
-I just don’t like the pressure. I’m self employed and don’t have structure like her school, so she doesn’t seem to see that I am pretty busy most of the time.

She is really good at at slanting things to make it seem like I am being bad or in the wrong.
-I am pretty good at stepping back and looking at things from the outside, and she I realize she can really manipulate a situation. Even sometimes when we fight, she’ll raise her voice, I’ll raise mine, then she lowers her voice and says I’m being toxic for raising my voice.

Well there’s a list of some of the factors in our relationship and my take on it. If I seem out of line in any of my views, let me know.

Thanks a bunch.

TLDR: looking to evaluate my take on my ending relationship with my gf and my takes on some of the situation?

191,"     My SO and I are both in college but live about an hour apart so I try to visit as often as I can to her place since she doesn’t have a car. We have been together since September so our visits have been few and far inbetween. She lives in the dorms so sometimes I will stay the night so I don’t have to make the drive late at night. 
     I have attempted to reach out and become friends with the roommate as she is good friends with my girlfriend but she doesn't want anything to do with me. I’ve tried helping her with studies, always offering to buy food and snacks, and general goodwill. The three of us have spent a couple nights together eating pizza and just chilling before with no romantic interactions between me and my SO just to not make it awkward for her.
     Recently however, I stayed over my SO’s dorm again yesterday and her roommate was visibly annoyed. After I left, her roommate opened up that she was annoyed because “She felt that I was getting in the way of their friendship and that because of that, she had nobody to talk to about her grandfather who had just went to the hospital”. Again, neither my SO or I knew what goes on in her personal life so she and I were stunned but we had both offered to console her about any personal issues she had in the past already. As well as, my SO still hangs out and spends time with her it’s just every 2 or 3 weeks or so. I would visit a day or two to be with my SO.
     So now, the roommate is irrevocably pissed at me, she doesn’t want to be friends with me anymore and the new rule is that I am not allowed to come over anymore.
   
    I just want to know who's in the wrong here? Have I overstayed my welcome or is her roommate wrong as well as what should I do?

195,"Just wanted to mention ahead of time that any breach of sub rules is unintentional! 

This is my first post I’m making so please bear with me :) 

I live in Australia as a high school student (if I already broke the rules, I’m really sorry). 
My family generally cares for me but for a bit of history:
My dad used to physically abuse my siblings and I when we were in primary school. He’s recently stopped and only chooses to verbally abuse us but has mostly improved with us. With our mother, he’s still very emotionally abusive and chooses to put her down frequently; in general, he has drastically changed but still continues to occasionally pinch us or hit us. He’s always hurt my other siblings more so in comparison, I wasn’t as severely punished for the little issues he has. There’s an understanding that he has anger management issues but he chooses to ignore this. 

Just recently, on the way home, he decided to bring up an event that occurred yesterday (Sunday). We attended this event where raffle tickets were given out. The first prize called out was for our number, and my parents had me claim the prize. To do this, we just head up to the stage with our ticket. This was at a Chinese event, and since I don’t understand Chinese, didn’t realise that the announcers had stated that if no one comes up in time to claim the prize, they will re-shuffle. Regardless, I still managed to collect the item (which was just Aussie hand cream). 
That ended well, right? Wrong. 

He brings this up while he’s driving the car and starts lecturing me on how I didn’t raise my hand to notify the announcers of my existence. Note that I still can’t understand Chinese and that I did raise my hand when approaching the stage whilst they looked around. Each time he condescendingly asked whether I understood or not, I stated yes whilst nodding my head. He obviously continues and repeats his ‘point’ on a few times and then I decide to jump in and tell him that I did, in fact, raise my damn hand. He doesn’t let this go because he has this incessant need to always be right. He changes the subject to how I don’t listen to him, but I jump in and tell him that if he expects me to listen to him, I’ll expect that he listens to me too. Fair? Apparently not. He doesn’t like the fact that I literally asked for him to be ‘patient’ and that sometimes I feel as though he won’t listen to me and so he starts talking about how I’m ungrateful and am stupid for quitting scholarship school. I quit scholarship because he used to hit me with a metal clothes hanger for any question that I got wrong, and also because I couldn’t properly balance my time with schoolwork and other extra curricular (which he forced me to attend). 

I know I should be grateful but I didn’t ask for any of this.

Eventually, he goes on a tangent, talking about how I don’t study enough and about how my brother corrects his shitty speaking skills. ((My dad has lived in Australia for ~17+ years and chooses not to learn basic English grammar - he still has basic skills but has an almost indecipherable accent to the untrained ear - this might be an exaggeration but idk)). I turn back to my brother and murmur ‘I don’t know what he’s talking about’ because that’s literally it. I don’t know what he’s trying to tell me... so of course, he swerved the car and tried to punch me hard in the arm (but didn’t do well because he wants to still be in control of the car) and starts screaming at me. 

I freeze up and can’t breathe (because of his voice) and didn’t say a word when we reached our house. My arm doesn’t hurt, I’m mostly just shocked. 

I was once adjusted to his abuse when I was younger because I thought it was normal among Asian households, but since then, have come to recognise that not all families are like that. I didn’t want to come home, but am inside anyway. His petty ass also tried to slam the door against me but that didn’t entirely work. My brother, also in high school, watched and didn’t do a thing (which was normal for us because we were used to that shit). I don’t blame him, but I do blame me because sometimes I fear that when he grows up, he will become like my father. 

I never really thought about it before but I realised that at the moment in which he got out the car, I wanted to call someone for help. I did. I called my best friend but she didn’t pick up. This rendered me helpless. 






Now I will finally ask for advice :) 

Where can I go and who can I talk to when I feel unsafe? I don’t want any severe consequences because my family can’t afford to break apart right now. He does not work meaning that my mum needs to input twice the effort to sustain us, and divorces right now would slightly mess up our school life which I can afford to lose, but my brother cannot. I know that in many instances, I probably deserved to be hit, but I don’t know if I want to leave my brother defenceless when I move out (which might never occur because of this economy) but yeah. 



P.s. I haven’t been diagnosed for mental health issues because my parents can’t exactly be bothered to check and are likely avoiding it.



So thank you for reading this! I know it might’ve been painful to read through since I’m a mess, but I’m glad you haven’t completely ditched. 
I’ve put in extra information because I might forward this into other subs, but for now, I think this will do. Sorry for any confusion and for the long text.

196,"I'm 24 years old. I still don't even have an associate's degree. I'm only two classes off, and eventually I would like to get a degree in education. But I'm stuck because I can't even pay off a stupid parking ticket, which is keeping me from registering from classes. And I can't pay it off because I can't get a job.


The only job I've had is with the school, and I can't keep that job because I can't afford to be a student. I can't get a job; even fucking McDonalds don't hire me. I don't understand it. 


I just feel like the entire world is against me. It's as if past lives are real, and in my past life one as a complete dick so I can't have anything positive happen to me.


I do have a few roommates who are my friends, but they're all extreme introverts who spend most of their time with their significant other. There's nothing wrong with that and I don't blame them for it, I just wish I had at least one other friend who I could spend time with. 


But I'm completely alone.

Now there are a lot of people whom I care about and that I really want to keep in my life because they’re really good friends, but the thing is that it’s extremely draining for me. Mostly because my concept of friendship is different than theirs.

I’m a really low maintenance person. You could stop seeing me for 3 or 4 years and the next time we met, it would be as if nothing had happened. You could text me once a year and I wouldn’t care at all. It wouldn’t affect our friendship. But my friends are really high maintenance (at least for my standards) and it is really tiring to talk to them all. I’ve already lost many friends because of this and I want to stop that, or at least, to not lose them at an alarming rate. Help.",03Dec2018,1

201,"My SO and I are both in college but live about an hour apart so I try to visit as often as I can to her place since she doesn’t have a car. We have been together since September so our visits have been few and far in-between. She lives in the dorms so sometimes I will stay the night so I don’t have to make the drive late at night.  

 I have attempted to reach out and become friends with the roommate as she is good friends with my girlfriend but she doesn't want anything to do with me. I’ve tried helping her with studies, always offering to buy food and snacks, and general goodwill. The three of us have spent a couple nights together eating pizza and just chilling before with no romantic interactions between me and my SO just to not make it awkward for her.  

Recently, however, I stayed over my SO’s dorm again yesterday and her roommate was visibly annoyed. After I left, her roommate opened up that she was annoyed because “She felt that I was getting in the way of their friendship and that because of that, she had nobody to talk to about her grandfather who had just been admitted to the hospital”. 

Again, neither my SO or I knew what goes on in her personal life so she and I were stunned but we had both offered to console her about any personal issues she had in the past already. As well as, my SO still hangs out and spends time with her it’s just every 2 or 3 weeks or so. I would visit a day or two to be with my SO.  

So now, the roommate is irrevocably pissed at me, she doesn’t want to be friends with me anymore and the new rule is that I am not allowed to come over anymore.  

I want to know who's in the wrong and what can be done from my side to help resolve this conflict if possible As well as what I could've done to help prevent this.

202,"This is a generalized question, something that has been on my mind for quite some time. However, I'll admit that I am specifically referring to one girl that I am speaking with right now.

We have been talking for a bout a week and a half now. I asked her for her number when she made a delivery to my house the other day. Super cute! Now, it is in my nature that I really get to know a gal before any sort of relations. Commitment has never been an issue for me, and I usually am talking to a girl with the intent of dating. This girl I am talking to now seems nice, but I am not looking for a relationship right now. I don't have anything against us being friends - in fact I encourage it!  But right now I honestly just need a sexual release; a no-strings-attached physical encounter. 

So my real question is - in general - how does a person that is used to getting to know somebody,  asking tons of questions, showing interest; take conversations/this conversation to a place where friends with benefits or hooking up is on the table?

204,"So....this require a little context.

I'm part of an online community and we do things together, like play games, watch shows/movies, etc..

Tonight 4 of us just finished watching a movie together online - at the end one of the community members (a female) said she was going to go to another of the members channels to watch a movie with them until she fell asleep..

What I felt when I read that was...an overwhelming sense of being upset and jealous.

Even right now as I write this I still feel it, and at the same time I'm thinking - This makes no sense at all.  Yea, this girl is cool, but at no point had I given actual thought to having a relationship with her.

However, all I can think about is, while we were watching a movie, they must have been PMing each other making plans to watch an other movie together afterwards, just the two of them.  She let me know about it, but there wasn't really an invitation to join, but it just leaves this knot in my stomach.

So whats the deal?  Why am I feeling this way?  It came out of nowhere; I don't know why it would matter to me that shes going to watch a movie with some one and would avoid inviting me/the other people.",03Dec2018,1

Both of them have self harmed within the past few weeks, and one yesterday.    I was the first person to find out that either of them did it. They are both depressed and talk about killing themselves on a regular basis. They say things like, “there’s no reason to live” , and other things like that. They’re both promised to me and each other that they wouldn’t hurt themselves but they have both done it despite that.  Often I try and provide support for them and try and help cope with their problems, but it seems after months of basically being a therapist there has been no progress made. I just fear that one of them might do something horrible and I can’t even imagine the outcome.

Skip 12 years to today.. he suffers from bipolar and schizophrenia and every day he seems to be getting worse and worse. One day he's his old self and all is good and others he is a diffrent person. This alone has been hard to deal with but what he just told me has me sad and confused 

He messages me about some music stuff same old talk but after a few hours of texting back and forth he talks about his master plan if he gets evicted tomorrow wich he probably will. He told me ALL his life his biggest dream was to marry a young girl and just ride of into the sunset and some NSFW things I would rather not repeat that he wants to do to a girl of this age.. 

Sorry if this is worded bad or misspelled in places I'm writing this right after it happend quick as I can just to get it off my mind.

For example, I’m a server at a restaurant and I often have awkward interactions with people. Which is not desirable for this job obviously...you want to be personable and confident. Now, a lot of the time I’m fine as most people just want to talk with each other and eat their food. Just be friendly, get their order, and you’re good. No problems with that. But when I get customers who really want to interact with me, I struggle a lot. I’m not witty. I’m not charismatic. I don’t know what to say when people make jokes (that usually aren’t funny). I just kinda awkwardly laugh. And then there will be an awkward silence and I’ll just be like “wellllll I’m going to go check on your food and I’ll be back!”

The younger one is a sophomore. 

They both have iPhones (not sure which kind), so maybe an iTunes gift card? But it seems so impersonal...

226,"In a few days, my mom is going to visit her side of the family and she wants me to come. More precisely she wants to go visit her father, whose health has been slowly on the decline for a while.

The plan is that we would stay at her sister's house and stay for a few days. Her entire family (her sisters, her cousins, her brother, etc) lives in that region so we are definitely going to visit a good number of them.

Here is where my problem arises. I absolutely HATE those people. They all have different things that make me hate them, but the biggest thing is that they judge me because I have a food problem (I cannot eat most foods, and not because of allergies, when I see most foods I feel like vomiting and I cannot put them in my mouth). Lunch and dinner with them is always awkward. They stare at me and constantly tell me to ""just try to eat a bit"". They often get angry when I won't eat anything they have prepared.

If my mom and I at least stayed at an Airbnb or something, and ate on our own, then I wouldn't be so reluctant to go. However, my family is French, and we do EVERYTHING in front of a meal.

227,"I’m 20F and I’m worried the only people outside of my family in my life will be a boyfriend, or eventual husband, and other men as friends. 

Since late middle school, my closest friends have always been guys. I know what you’re thinking, no I didn’t hookup with them or anything like that. I just got along with guys better. None of my girl friends wanted to play video games or skateboard or have anything I really considered fun. I got bored of girls quickly and my best friends became a lot of great guys I’m still friends with today. 

The thing is though, I’m not like a super tomboy kind of person. At first glance, I’m actually pretty “girly” and I was back then too. While the guys were great, I’ve longed for “girlfriends” forever and I just can’t find any that seem like, actually authentic and genuine people I’d enjoy time with. I’m in college now, and believe me I’ve tried... but literally every girl I become friendly with it’s just not a natural click. There are some barriers only really having guy friends that kinda sucks. 

The second part of the problem is that, since being a freshman in high school I’ve always had a boyfriend. 
I never hooked up casually, and this might sound like I’m inflating my own ego, but 2-3 weeks after a breakup I always got asked out and was interested in another guy. My shortest relationship was 6 months, and my longest was 2 and a half years. I’ve dated 4 guys. I’m a long-term kinda girl, and my boyfriends have always become best friends. I actually just got out of a relationship of two years last week, and this is when it all hit me: 

My boyfriend is *always* my *everything* 

I have nothing outside of it. We are each other’s best friends so we don’t really seek other people. When I do. It’s the guy friends. 

I honestly really just need advice on how to make friends that are girls (if girls like me even exist?) and how to chill with how serious my relationships end up being. I considered joining a sorority (I’m in college) but it’s like 100% not me, and when I was a freshman last year I tried being friends with sorority girls for a couple of months and they were the most emotionally abusive, shallow, and unstable people I’ve ever met. Honestly, the friendships went up in flames and made me seriously consider dropping out my freshman year from the hostile attitudes. 

It doesn’t help that I haven’t been single for a long period of time since I was practically a pre-teenager. They’ve just been super long relationships that become everything... and it doesn’t help with trying to make new “girl” friends. 

I would love to have a group too, the few girl friends I have are not too close and they’re sort of all “separate” from my usual group of friends. Is there something wrong with me for not clicking with girls? 
How can I fix this? 
Is it bad all my close friends are guys?

228,"To be clear I have been diagnosed with depression. That was at 16, and I'm older now. I assumed I had developed ways of combatting depression, but now I'm not sure.

I'm currently separated from my husband and I have been for a year now. We're still married but haven't spoken since last year. I live alone in the apartment we used to share. The beginning was really hard, but I've come to terms with it. I've moved on. I don't cry about it, I haven't in probably over six months. It's like that well is just dry. And even during the break up I functioned just fine. I went to work and paid bills reliably and became very independent. 

But I haven't dated. I assume you may think, of course I haven't dated because I'm married. But he was living with another woman within a month of leaving. The possibility of dating is there. And I've had chances, but I didn't take them. 

I go days without speaking to anyone, without hearing a human voice besides the ones on tv. And I'm okay with it. I keep my space clean. I make my bed and wash my few dishes every day. I overeat in ways I never have before. I smoke almost two packs a day. I can go days without going outside. I quit my job and didn't care. I had worked there for years, very high stress field, and one day I drove off and decided not to go back. I don't cry. I used to cry to relieve pressure. I can't anymore. I feel humor, I laugh at things. I find things interesting. But my car broke down and I didn't bother fixing it for three weeks. 

I thought until recently that I had just grown up, developed into the person I'm suppose to be. Not crying meants I was maturing and didn't need that coping skill anymore. Not talking to people, not feeling the need to talk to people, meant I was just a loner. 

But now I'm stunted with the possibility that I may have gone so cold that I'm unaffected by things that should bother me. Have I fooled myself into believing this is contentment? My apartment building burnt and I just took a picture of it. I didn't feel anything other than wandering if I still had a home or not. But I didn't panic, like I didn't panic when I quit my job. What I should have felt in those moments just kind of fell into a bottomless hole and didn't make a sound when they hit ground. I feel empty. Or do I? I don't know anymore. I just do what I do. I wake up, make my bed, smoke a lot of cigarettes. I was a vegetarian for eleven years and now I'm eating meat as of four months ago. I don't care. I used to care about the inhumane slaughter of animals and their use as commodity and it offended me. I don't care anymore. It's something to eat and I eat way too much. I've smoked three cigarettes while I've written this.

I guess I'm here to find out if anyone relates. If I'm overthinking this. Do I need to put effort into figuring this out, or just let it go? Any insight would be valued, I assure you. Also I apologize for how long this was, thank you for reading

I consciously know I did the right thing, but I can't help feeling that heavy, gross feeling that I really can't explain. It makes me wonder how people can consistently get into arguments and be fine.

231,"Hi, I’m almost 19 now. But I have a HUGE grudge against my mom.
I want to let everything go and move on, it’s just a big burden. I want her out of my life. 
I guess I’ll start from the first thing I remember from my life.
When I was 4, my mom was dating my 2nd littlest sister. I always thought this was fake until Riverview center determined I didn’t make it up.. 
Anyways, the guy made my 2 sisters go down on him. I don’t remember what happened right afterwards, but sometime later I remember running away from him. I tried climbing up my bunk bed, but he tore me away from it, he put me on the bed, I got back down and tried running off again. The bedroom door was 2 doors, he tied the doors by using a sock. He put me back on the bed, pulled my dora underwear off and penetrated in me. After that it’s blank.
When my brother was born (13 now)
I changed his butt and took care of him (I might’ve been 6 he was 3-6 months) while my mom slept all day everyday. I ate his baby formula because, there was nothing else to eat.
I remember her bringing guys in and out, always partying. Doing drugs. I would be forced to go to bed at 6/7 at 9 years old so she can have sex. (I would wake up to the noises and it would scare me) She would get herself food and told us to get stuff from the fridge but there was mainly rotten shit in there.
When I turned 7/8, I woke up to my grandmas (now ex) husbands hand in my pants. I went to court against him, he went to jail until I was 15. 
My mom used that (she uses it now too) as a way to get attention, but called me a liar when I started talking about what happened when I was 4. I didn’t go to Riverview center until I was 7/8. When I was 13/14, I would talk to the counselor at school. She called DHS many many times but they never did anything. I talked to a DHS worker about everything and how she treated us he told her and I got in so much trouble. She’s a pig, her house results in food, garbage, poop, piss everywhere. Disgusting.
I raised all of my siblings. I departed from all of them when I turned 15. I became pregnant, and my whole pregnancy was just threats from her. When I was in labor, she told me she was going to take my child if I didn’t let her come up. She said i couldnt raise him and that I was mentally ill. (I turned 16 in my pregnancy)
During my pregnancy, my grandpa died. I loved him dearly and the last thing I told him was that I hated him over some nonsense. She used it against me, said grandpa hated me. The last time I fought with her was when I was pregnant with my second (June 2018) and she used it against me as well. 
My sons parents took me in when I was 16, and they helped me so much. They’re the only family I have other than my dad but my dad lives 8 hours away.. he never knew what was going on because she made it that way.
I’m now with my boyfriend of 2 years, in our apartment with my (almost) 3 year old and 4 month old.
I hate her badly, and I keep thinking of the past. (past few weeks) and I just want to let go. I want to move on, kick her out of my life. I blame her for everything that happened, for putting me in the situation where I could be harmed. Her ex boyfriend tried hurting me because I told him I would kill him when I was 7, because he laid his hands on her but it was the other way around. Idk. I want to remember what happened to me, I know she did a lot of meth while I grew up.. She told me.. I just feel so sad. Like.. why wasn’t I good enough to make you a mom.. None of the kids were.. I have 4 siblings on her side. I just keep asking why.. I have two kids, who I put before myself. I love them deeply, and would never choose them before other people/drugs..
I just want to move on.. I don’t know. I’m getting a therapist, maybe that’ll help. I just want to be at peace, forget about everything.
Oh
She has a son, who’s 9 months. I worry for him badly, and it makes it hard to cut it off because I check up on him. I tried calling DHS but they still won’t do anything. He drinks old formula and just lays there on the floor while she’s downstairs doing who knows what.. I stopped by unexpectedly multiple times and he was laying on the floor. Emotionless. While she slept. He could fall down the stairs. Idk, DHS wont listen to me. Her Probation officer (drugs, stealing) wont do anything. 

I wish I can help.. but i cant sigh


sorry for it being so long.. ive never really talked to people about it.. ",03Dec2018,1
232,"First time poster and I'm on phone so I'm sorry if it has weird formatting also, sorry if there are any mistakes, English isn't my first language. It's kind of long so TL;DR @ the bottom 

So, for a bit of context, a couple weeks ago I took my driving lessons. It felt good and the instructor said that I did a good job, so after the last lesson I was pretty excited to show my mom that now I could drive and yada yada.

She wasexcited to see me driving, too so we get in her car and I was only gonna drive us to my aunt's place, it's like 5 minutes away on car and it's relaxed streets so I wasn't too scared and I was still riding the confidence high that you get when a teacher says you did good.

I take the wheel and everything goes great at first, maybe I was going like a couple miles over the usual speed for these streets but barely. Then at the last turn, just as I was turning to get on the street her house is at... I turned too fast, I couldn't control the wheel to make it turn back by force, I got immediately frozen and didn't hit the brakes. I panicked completely and I crashed into TWO parked cars and one of them hit ANOTHER car. So in total I damaged FOUR cars including my mom's.

My mom's immediate biggest concern is me. She's physically fine so she turns to me (by this point I'm crying and like shrieking weirdly out of fear) and she checks me all over for bruises. The crash wasn't that bad, the airbags didn't even pop out, but I had never been in a car crash.

My aunt hears the crash and comes out running, so does my dad who was waiting for us at my aunt's place, and they're also immediately worried for me and my mom. The owners of the cars were all around there and we all had insurance so that was resolved and none of them were like mad or anything, again, everybody was mostly worried and they told me like ""Hey, it happened on your first day of driving and it could've happened if you had been driving for 10 years, it happens"" and obviously it was an accident. Insurance took care of the cost and we only had to pay like a very small part (I'm not sure how insurances work sorry :/ ) 

So here's my problem. Everybody understood that it was an accident, my mom's car is in the mechanic and it's getting fixed, nobody was hurt and my parents were not mad at all, just extremely worried. Why do I feel so guilty, I feel so nervous and scared of driving again and I feel like I did something bad. Should I talk to my mom? I want to drive again as the little time I did was very fun and exciting, but I'm scared, what should I do? Any advice helps

TL;DR: I crashed my mom's car, she wasn't mad, just super worried, I didn't hurt anybody and insurance took care monetarily. I feel extremely guilty and nervous. What should I do? ",03Dec2018,1
233,"I got my phone taken away from me about a year ago because of something I did wrong (I admit was very very bad). My mom took my phone away and told me that she will give it to me in 3 years time. During my last semester this school year, she told me I can get it back if I got straight As. I worked really hard and ended up getting all As like promised. She told me that I can have my phone during the holidays and (perhaps) weekends as well and I am not allowed to have a password so that she makes sure that I am not doing anything bad. I am not satisfied with this. Everyone else I know has their own phone and none of their parents snoop through it. I get made fun of for being 'phoneless' by my friends and I feel left out a lot. How do I convince them that I should have my own phone and that they shouldn't be monitoring my use (I am a mostly good child and I don't get in trouble often)?

236,"Let me start by saying we've had our problems in the past. She's cheated on me, and we've gotten into fights probably more than an average couple. I still felt like the majority of our time was spent happy together. 

We recently hit a bit of a rough patch. She was constantly giving me attitude and started being increasingly active on social media and talking to other people. Then about a week ago she texts me in the middle of the night, ""This isn't working out"" and ""I don't love you anymore."" I begged her to reconsider or at least sleep on it and she told me she's been thinking about it for a while. I stopped by her house a few days later with flowers thanking her for the last three years and wishing her the best in the future and all she said was, ""you too"" and went back inside. 

I don't know what to do anymore. It feels like she ripped my heart out and stomped on it. Is it a waste of time to try and talk to her? I don't really have anyone to talk to because early on in our relationship she separated me from all my friends and I haven't spoken to most in years. I can't even sleep anymore.

It’s caused a rift between us and I know I can’t dictate her life but I really can’t respect her the same way.

239,"So, let me start off by saying I never intended to be a dog owner. Without getting overly personal, my ex died and his family gave me his dog. It wasn't something I'd asked for, and they didn't discuss it with me beforehand (this was a week after he had died). I didn't have even have a minute to think about whether I could take on the responsibility as I was grieving. My circumstances at the time were also drastically different (I was 19 and living with family) so I was able to take her in without too much of an issue. 

Now things have changed, and I've grown really attached to her, but with school and work I find myself thinking about whether the life she has with me could be improved if I rehomed her. I'm not saying she's neglected or anything, just that I'd want her to have a yard and another dog to play with. There's also the fact that I have to move soon, and finding an apartment within my budget that allows dogs of her breed/size (American Bulldog/50lbs) is a huge challenge. 

I love this dog to bits. She's my best friend and I feel guilty even thinking about putting her in a shelter/up for adoption, but at what point does it become selfish to want to keep her?

240,"So I came down to Florida to learn programming from my mother (RPG iSeries... which is actually pretty outdated but I was teaching myself for a while so I figured I'd have a pro teach me personally to try to boost my career... but I ended up changing my mind to Java, SQL, Python, Ruby.... etc...). Anyway, my girlfriend HATES Florida and does not want to stay down here and I honestly don't blame her. We aren't fans of the Mickey Mouse State. But she said she would do it for me... But I can't find any decent work down here (I was previously a warehouse supervisor for a medical distribution company) and I'm currently working at a 711 temporarily until I can decide what is best for me. She came down to visit me for 2 weeks and wasn't able to find work either (she's in financial compliance).

I've got an apartment lined up for a sweet price where I was before I left for Florida, but I don't have a job currently so I'd have to dip into my savings... which I'm trying to avoid doing.

Worth noting I'm actually in Orlando), and just study on my downtime and not have to deal with rent.... I'm kind of stuck right now.

To start, I'm a guy who's just not sure how to approach this tricky situation.. Sorry for the wall of text. Just a bit baffled.

TL;DR at the end.

Here's the story:

A few months ago, a person who I thought was a good (F)friend of mine invited me to a wedding and I happily obliged since it would present me the opportunity to do 2 things on my adult bucket list: attend a wedding, and have a reason to purchase and wear an expensive suit.

On the day of the wedding, I pick her and her friend up and take them to the wedding in my car. Being a good guest, I do all the research I can on being a good wedding attendee. I think I did a great job, congratulating the bride and groom and even gifting them cash as I know weddings can be expensive to host. I even put up both her and her friends share of the gift, which neither have even offered to repay. No big deal.

After the wedding where we've both been drinking and smoking, I'm ready to go home. Instead, her friend, whose boyfriend drove to the wedding venue to pick her up, invites us to a bar/restaurant where she worked to grab some food to soak up the alcohol. I was hesitant, but my friend insisted, saying she ""didn't want to go home to her parents house like this."" So off we go.

In my car on the way to the restaurant, my friend starts telling me how she's starting to ""like me"" and I immediately shut this idea down, as she knows I'm emotionally unavailable and wouldn't be the right fit for her. She goes on to explain how she can change that, and I respond with how she knows me well enough for that not to be true. She groans, and seems to accept it.

We get to the restaurant, we eat, and I have a few more beers while she drinks water. When we're finished and begin to head home, she again says that she doesn't want to go home like this, and asks to come over until she sobers up a bit. I see no problem with this, but by this time it's quite late. We get to my place, which happens to be a mess -TV on the floor, clothes everywhere- because I wasn't expecting guests and put the TV back on the table and turn it on for us to watch. While watching for about a minute, she starts falling asleep, so I ask if she just wants to spend the night and I'd just drive her home in the morning. I change out of my suit and into more comfortable clothes, and she starts saying how her dress is uncomfortable and she can't sleep in it, so she takes it off. No big deal, I think, assuming she's wearing underwear and a bra.

After taking off her dress, she complains about her bra being too ""hot"", since it's one of those sticky bras, proceeds to take it off, then asks me to feel the inside of the bra to see how hot it is. We hop into bed, ready to sleep, and end up hooking up, but it doesn't get far as the alcohol's effects are getting to me.. if you know what I mean. We fall asleep and by early morning time, we both get up and I drive her home since she had work, even loaning her clothes since she didn't want to be caught wearing a dress in the early morning.

That same afternoon, she sends me texts about what an amazing time she had, couldn't believe how amazing I was, and how even though I friend-zoned her, it didn't mean we couldn't f\*ck. Her words. My replies are brief and even mention that I'm not looking for a relationship.

Fast-forward months later, we're still in contact and text occasionally. She has a new boyfriend. We're still good friends. I even reached out to her when I had bad anxiety attacks and spikes in depression -which she knew about; the reason I told her I wasn't a good fit for her- and she always replied with comforting words telling me these thing would pass. That was almost a month ago.

Tonight, while out with one of my best friends since childhood who she knew before me, he tells me that they went to a bar together about 3-4 weeks ago. While there, she brought up the night of the wedding, telling him that I gave vibes that I was looking for a relationship and when she bit, I responded with a ""classic /u/weddingboxxx"" response: ""I'm no good for you"". She proceeded to tell him that after the wedding, she was ready to go home, but I insisted that we go back to my place. That when we got there, she expected to sleep on my futon but that I urged her to sleep in my bed. Telling him that when she got into my bed, I undressed myself, then undressed her, and at that point she figured she might as well have sex with me since we got that far.

I showed him the texts, and of course he believed me, saying her story seemed out of my character.

Normally, small things don't bother me, but after telling the story to my sister, she made me realize how severe this situation can be. She brought up Bill Cosby and all the rape cases that go on today and that I might just be another statistic if I don't speak up but I just don't know how to approach this situation. I don't want to destroy the relationship between my best friend and her by confronting her, because apparently the only 2 people she told were him and her best friend. But at the same time, I can't have someone basically throw a rape accusation at me. I can easily prove that I am not the aggressor here by simply revealing texts of the day after.

Additionally, she told my best friend that a few months after the wedding during another friend's birthday celebration that I kept staring at her in a way that made her current boyfriend feel some type of way. Another lie, as the birthday girl was who I had a crush on at the time. She even added that she wanted to tell one of our mutual friends, but couldn't because said friend had a crush on me.

I'm thinking I should invite her best friend to lunch to see what she's heard and explaining my side, but I know it'd come back to her anyway.

TL;DR

Went to a wedding with a person who I thought was a really good friend. We hooked up. She says she had an amazing time. Months later and in a new relationship, she tells my best friend and another person in confidence that I basically raped her. I have texts to prove otherwise. Not sure how to approach the situation without throwing my best friend under the bus, seeing as he's the one who told me.

This started about a week ago, I was organizing a Christmas party and had to add some co-workers on Facebook to keep them updated on the party 

I add this one co-worker. Let's call him, Luigi. 

Now a couple years ago I used to model, and there's one picture deep in my Facebook of me posing in a bikini with a Jean jacket on. Luigi one morning at work tells me ""by the way, I really like the Jean jacket"", I knew exactly what he was referencing. I brush it off. 

Now, the night of the Christmas party, I start telling a few co-workers that I used to play very high level hockey. He asked me if there's anything on the internet about my career and told him no. 

Later on in the night when the party is over I get  notification on my YouTube page that someone had posted a comment on a video of a work reference lingo which I immediately knew was him. After a little more creeping I confirmed it was him.

247,"I am currently in year 11, and have been constantly struggling with building a relationship/finding a girlfriend. I have gone to great efforts to try and make myself somebody who would be worth while dating, including going to the gym and even changing my school to expose myself to new people and force me to develop my social skills. However, despite all my best efforts I feel like the people who I am interested in always seem to be attracted to my friends who lack the traditional attributes which are associated with a attractive boyfriend. These attributes which I have really tried to cultivate in myself.

For example, at my school there where these two girl who where smoking hot; and somewhat popular. I was friendly with them enough to have them introduced to my friends from my old school. However, now these girls have been hanging around my two friends a lot and they are showing the quintessential signs of being interested in one another. I don't feel like this is in itself a problem, because I do respect my friends and these girls decision to be with each other. It's just that, one of them really lacks key social skills (don't get me wrong he is a fantastic person, he just shows the typical signs of having aspergers). The other one, is rather obese and has his own set of social shortcomings. 

I know how much this makes me sound like a shitty human being, for thinking and feeling this, but its honestly how I feel.

We have identical interests and adventurous spirits and I revel in now having someone to come kayaking and surfing and exploring weird new places in the middle of nowhere with me. I book weekends away and different activities for us. I do not value money, I value his company and time. He brings so much good to my life in every way no amount of money can match it.
I know he feels guilt about this and often tries to offer to pay half, which I usually succeed in refusing, though sometimes accept money towards diesel.

These conversations don't really feel real nor do they feel like conversations ""normal people"" have. 

Of course they are fun when we are having innuendo filled conversations but other than that I don't really see the point in making conversation.

Due to one of the people in my group having to take over the conversation when we talk about certain topics (money, jobs, driving, uni, ghosts) we have to avoid them which cuts our list of viable conversations in half.

Sure I can leave the group but that doesn't make having conversations any easier since I feel like I'm not, I don't now, *trained* in making conversation. If that makes sense?

I spent time talking to different people today, and the conversation was so normal that I didn't really know how to talk without being dumb/taking over the conversation (I hate doing that).

262,"Okay I must preface this by saying we are all in Western Australia. My grandma is mostly blind, deaf, never went to school, and is a Jehovah’s Witness. My mother is disfellowshipped. The boarder is a 38 yr old recently re-instated Jehovah’s Witness. This makes the whole situation super messy.

So my mother is the power of attorney and legal carer for my grandma because she is unable to handle her medications, legal documents, doctors appointments, financial payments etc on her own. My mother is the only one of 5 siblings who cared about her mother enough to take on this responsibility when my grandpa died.

Earlier this year my grandma invited a boarder to her house. We’ll call her Sharon, for privacy’s sake. Sharon was living at a women’s shelter, her husband and children abandoned her, and she was trying to get back to being a regular JW. Maybe she’s just down on her luck, we’ll give her a chance... we thought.

Fast forward a few months and shits gotten really weird. All of my grandma’s pets have had to be put down (2 ferrets and a chihuahua). Now the ferrets were getting up there a little bit, but they were healthy. One of them got a rotten tooth and instead of paying for the surgery, it was put down. I don’t know what happened to the other. The chihuahua was a rescue that my grandma absolutely adored and payed thousands getting her healthy after a neglected early life. Apparently she had a seizure and was put down because my grandma didn’t want to pay for medications, even though before Sharon moved in she would’ve done anything for that dog.

Okay maybe that’s just a coincidence.

Sharon also insisted that when there was a bad smell in the house it must’ve been my grandma because she “doesn’t shower and doesn’t change her Depends”. The smell turned out to be a dead mouse in the back of the fridge. The repair guy offered to clean it and reinstall it for free seeing as the fridge was only a few months old... but Sharon turned him down and instead bought a brand new $800 fridge with my grandma’s money.

Okay still a bit weird but nothing is technically wrong with what she’s doing.

The straw that broke the camel’s back is what’s happened in the last few weeks. After seeing a box of my grandma’s ornaments she’s been collecting her whole life at the front door my mum asked where they were going and Sharon told her to be donated.

My mum finally stood up and said “Sharon, you need to start paying half the rent.  That’s the least you could do seeing as the bills have doubled since you moved in.” And her response? “Oh there must be a gas leak” Um okay maybe she’s just dumb and genuinely doesn’t think that an extra person would cause the utilities to go up.

But she still hasn’t payed any bills nor any rent. Because my mother is power of attorney, the lease is in my mother’s name. My grandma (it’s her money but my mum physically does it) has been paying all the bills, the rent, and all the shopping. So my mum has really had enough of Sharon basically robbing her mother and told her to start paying rent or she can be out in a week.

Sharon’s response was to try and take my mother off power of attorney, move my grandma and herself to a new place that the lease isn’t in my mum’s name (which they haven’t been able to do because funnily enough everything is more expensive than where they currently are), and to pull the disfellowshipped card and say they aren’t allowed to talk to my mum. Sharon still hasn’t moved out and, if anything, has dug in deeper. She’s very petty and will lie to my grandma’s neighbour about if she is home. She blocked my mother’s phone number. 

Sharon has been taking my grandma to see her GP without my mum’s permission, and they signed a form saying that actually my grandma was mentally and physically able to take care of herself and doesn’t need a carer or power of attorney.

Sharon herself said last week that she could never be the legal carer because she has her own mental health problems and wouldn’t understand how to handle my grandma’s medication. 

So now my uncle is getting involved. He’s still a JW and is speaking to some local elders who have a lot of interesting things to say about Sharon. 

Also this isn’t about money. We wouldn’t mind still paying her rent if she wasn’t such a piece of work and was actually looking for work or at least helping around the house.

Mostly I want to give my mum some advice on how to handle all this. 

How do you tell someone who is conniving, delusional, and religiously brainwashed, that they’re robbing an old woman blind?

How do you tell an uneducated, religiously brainwashed, vulnerable elder that someone is taking advantage of them?

My uncle wants to threaten legal action. Is there enough to make a case?

Does my mother’s position as power of attorney and legal actually do anything in regards to my grandma’s medical records?

Does the Jehovah’s Witness crap have any merit in the situation if we do take legal action?

Basically we want this bitch gone but she’s very manipulative and unhealthy for my grandma so my grandma is on her side and we don’t know what to say to help her understand.",03Dec2018,1

The second was a plastic bottle that was dragged to our bathroom and had a puncture where the honey was pouring out of.

267,"I was 16(M) (19 now)  when all of this started happening. I'll TRY to keep it short.

Back when I was 16 I met this girl (15) through several orchestra competitions. She was real nice and all and we became close friends soon after knowing each other and was on the verge of dating each other. P/S: She was from another state. 

But somehow the immaturity in me at that time decided to date some random girl-friend of mine back in my high school. My friends adviced me that she wouldn't be a nice person (they knew her attitude well enough) but I kept ignoring it and went on being together with her instead just so I can fulfill my boasting needs of ""having a girlfriend"" ( disgusting, I know right? ). It was bound to be the worst 2 years of my life. 

That said GF was really possessive and she wouldn't allow me to socialize with anyone at all, and by that I mean NO ONE. When I was 18 I went to a different university from her so she decided a term whereby I wouldn't be allowed to be friends with any girls, literally not even a single one. When questioned on what if  I was in the same assignment group with some random female course mates for academic purposes she would requested that I form an all-boys group instead. Things got even worse when I wasn't allowed to even go out for a meal with my mates (all boys). The reason being I would gradually abandon her (???). She would also restrict me from attending any school organized co-curricular activities. To save you from the remaining details I would conclude that I slowly became a puppet/ love slave of hers for the next 2 years. Side note: I'm aware that as a responsible  SO I am supposed to be caring and all but what she did to me was really mentally abusive. 

Eventually with the help and convincing of my high school friends we've finally broken up in June 2018. She got so frustrated that she blackmailed my mother saying that I've got her pregnant (we had no sexual engagement at all) and threatened to lodge a police report on us. Things slowly boiled down and everything was fine ever since then.  

I've regretted every single decision I did when I was 16 (classic example of immaturity) but I'm glad the whole ordeal was all over. 

So fast forward to the present day. Should I fix my relationship with the girl I met in the first place? Our relationship kinda deteriorated over the years due to the ""terms of the GF"" but we do still keep in contact every few months or so. Or should I just give up on everything and start afresh once again ? For all I know she could've led a better life without me, and I deeply regret hurting her feelings 2 years ago by choosing the the wrong one instead...all because of my stupidity and immaturity.

270,"In my 3rd year of college and I just realized I’m most likely going to be put on academic probation for the first time. 

My situation:
I have been going to my local community college for almost 2 and a half years. initially I had planned to transfer to a university after 2 years but I took 5 classes my first semester of college and was completely overwhelmed, finishing of the semester with like a 2.3 gpa. After that I decided it was better for me to take it slow and transfer after 3 years. Everything seemed on track. I was taking 3 classes a semester and finished up all of my GE credits at the end of of my second year while bringing up my gpa to a 3.3. However this semester took a turn for the worst.  I withdrew from calculus after a month and I’m failing 2 of my 3 remaining classes. At this point I know I’m going to be stuck at community for a additional semester, meaning I will be transferring after 4 years instead of 3 and I’m going to be put on academic probation. My parents are going to be furious if I lose my financial aid. Additionally, I was planning on switching to another community college next semester to be with some friends but I doubt I can transfer anywhere under academic probation. All this combined is starting to kill my motivation to continue going to school.

I forgot to mention this but after I finished my GE’s I had to declare a major so I picked business cause it seemed useful/general. This is my first semester doing business related classes and holy fuck I think I picked the most boring major. I think the fact that I hate all my classes contributed to the bad grades, but I feel stuck cause I have absolutely no clue what else to major in. I’m starting to feel helpless.

I’m sixteen years old (F), the other day I got into an argument with a guy that talked to me and had sexual relations with me when I was 15 years old. He told me that sleeping with underage girls is normal and that it’s my fault we slept together because I went after him. It pissed me off because this man has used me, told me to lose weight, called me dumb and tried to get me to drop out of school so I could live with him. He’s 22 years old now but he’s a grown man and now I know that I’m not the person to blame. I was naive and I thought allowing guys to do that to me was acceptable. I allowed these guys to call me a prostitute, dumb, and so many other names. I didn’t think it was wrong because I thought everything was my fault. 

There’s a few other guys that have used me for sex when I was underage. Some still try to contact me when they’re bored and want someone to sleep with again. When I was 14 years old old there was a guy that was 24 years old and he’d take me to his apartment and sleep with me. He would compare me to his ex and tell me how beautiful she was. When I would argue with him he’d say I’m acting like his ex. When I gave him a reality check after he tried to contact me again this year, he blocked me. I also found out recently that he has a history for using women, lying and he even faked a suicide attempt so he can validate his ex’s feelings for him. 

At the beginning of this year I talked to a man that was 26 years old. I thought he wanted to be friends since he was pretty old and he wanted to introduce me to his other friends. He also told me that he was seeing someone so I wasn’t worried. We would hang out after I got out from school and just eat somewhere and talk. But then he took take me back to his place, give me alcohol and we slept together. I immediately regretted sleeping with him afterwards because it wasn’t right for me to do that, at all. 

After I moved away to a different state, I started to feel strange about what happened to me when I was 14-15 years old. I felt uncomfortable with who I was. I mostly blamed myself for what happened those years. I still look back at what happened and sometimes I feel unwanted, unappreciated. I’m trying to heal from my past but I’m scared of this happening to other people. They shouldn’t have to go through what I did. I don’t know if these guys are out there manipulating more minors or even women just so they can satisfy their sexual needs and then verbally or emotionally abuse them.

For some reason my mind links my self worth to how good I can make someone laugh and when I can’t make people laugh straight away it makes me really doubt myself. I think this stemmed from meeting my best friend who is extremely confident and seems to easily make anyone laugh and is very social, I love him to death but it’s making me more nervous. He and another friend are in the group that I want to join so there should be no reason I can’t just join but I always see whenever I try that I’m less likes all that I’m less noticed because of his loud and funny personality.

For background, I would have been really close friends with this person in first year, but when they got into a relationship during the summer between first and second year, I was completely dropped. When the relationship broke down this year, I was happy to gain them back as a friend - and they asked if they could do the projects with me.

Two of them have larger groups - and the majority of the group works well in both cases. But whenever the workload is split they're put with me, or request to go with me. In every occurrence of this so far, I've been left to do the vast majority of the work - as they're too tired, or too busy with other responsibilities. A lot of the time that I spend doing the project work, they're spending with their ex. 

I don't mind that too much, as my other great group members often rally around and help me. The real issue lays with the third project.

We've given the footage that I have collected over these months to the police however they are mostly useless and haven't helped much.

I think the next step is to set up a higher quality camera inside of the vehicle at night but I'm unsure if this will help much.

I have a general idea of when they commit the vandalism it seems pretty consistent on the times but not the days so its not as if I can stay up all night to protect our property as we all work full time.

Is there anything Im not thinking that may help?

279,"I’ve been trying to eat well and basically do the normal trudgings of life while having some very intense anxiety and depression issues.
I’ve been trying to at least eat well to help my mental health and hopefully my body.
I suffer a lot of body issues as most of my high school life I was overweight and had a breakthrough moment at 20 and lost 40kg in 10months (sorry to the Americans etc I have no idea what that is in pounds 🥺)
My boyfriend thinks I’m beautiful and wonderful the way I am but I can’t handle the standard of what a “woman should look like “ nowadays. Hot and sexy 24/7. 
I don’t even know how to even achieve that and really I’m trying to just lose the weight I’ve put on from stress and well enjoying life (used to be 55-56kg and now 61.5-62kg) 
I want to have the skinny stomach and toned everything and sadly don’t have the money to get myself a good set of melons to go Gaga at...
I just get in this cycle of exercising and eating well for a good while and losing a bit and then realising that maybe I’m perfect the way I am and the most of things I see on social media or the media in general is very much photoshop or fake and then I relax a little bit and then I see an instagram model, looking Bomb AF and knowing that a lot of guys and girls in the world think so too and then... I see me. My body. My face. My ass. My... disgusting stomach.. and cry and punish myself of stopping and getting relaxed and I can’t even believe my boyfriend’s loving words of encouragement or him saying he loves me the way I am cause all I can believe is that I am not good enough and those Instagram model and influencers is what a “real” guy wants. I’m confused and hurt and don’t know what to do. I’ve struggling so hard on what to believe and follow.. to consume myself to look good and maybe it will all be worth it or to never really work that hard for that gym/summer body that is sooo sexy to the rest of the world and that my boy will appreciate me even more.. 
my body issues are just stressing me out.",03Dec2018,1

&gt;^(Greetings to you)

&gt;^(I contacted you through this medium for a business that will benefit the both of us greatly, if handle properly. Am sure that we can conclude this in less than two  weeks or less. And I want our communication to be basically through this secured email to maintain the needed confidentiality and also for safety and security reasons.I got your contact through the Philippines directory and I contacted you through a secured high sms protocol services that connect to any local communication network available at it services. The message might come with an international number or a local number, the most important thing is that its objective is made and communicated for this reason.My name is Mr Hugh S. (Beau)) ^(Cummins III, I am the Co-Chief Operating Officer of SunTrust banks Atlanta Georgia USA and the reason why I contacted you was because there is this fixed deposit made by a citizen of your Country Late Mr. C which has been over due for a very long time now. And we have tried to contact the depositor and all to no avile. The Late Mr. C lived and work here in Atlanta, United State of America as a businessman and He deposited in our bank the sum of Four million, Ninety Thousand United States Dollars ($4,090,000.00) as a fixed deposit in 2012 for a period of two years. His deposit has matured and he has not come up since then to re-claim the deposit he made. We have tried to reach him and we could not get through his telephone number and no reply from his email. There was also no responds from the letters we send to his address here in Atlanta. This issue prompted me to carry out an independent investigation about his whereabouts and I later found out that he is dead. He died sometime in November 2014 in a fatal motor accident while on vacation in Brazil. In order to verify the truth of the matter, I went to Brazil and confirmed he was dead, it was a sad story for a kindhearted and generous person like him. This matter was not reported to our bank and nobody in our bank is aware of this except me. I also went to your embassy here in the United States of America and no information of him was found. I have also checked our records, there is no information of him relating to Philippines and he did not put nominee at the time he made the deposit. All these made it impossible for me to locate any of his relatives, since this is the issue, I want you to apply as his beneficiary in order to claim the money he left in our bank. I know there are lots of Filipinos living here in the United States of America but because of the way our bank works, it is only someone outside of United States that can successfully make the claim. It does not matter if you knew him or not, it does not matter if you had any kind of relationship with him or not, I will guide you all the way until the claim is completely made. It is not a matter of being greedy, we are not hurting anyone by making this claim and it is not the best to leave the money to eventually end up in the hands of few corrupt government officials in the Government Treasury while we have the opportunity to live better with it when claimed.)As the Co-Chief Operating Officer of our bank branch, the final approval of your application will be done by me. There is no risk of any kind in this, I will expressly approve the application once it comes to my table and you will have the right to claim the money. We will share the money into two equal parts when the claim is made and I will personally come over to your country for my own share of the money after the claim amount has been successfully converted to your name and transferred to you. Everything will be done legally and successfully as I am in a position to influence things in our favor. Right now, I have copies of documents relating to the deposit he made that you will file to back up the claim as his beneficiary. If you are willing to do this with me, let me know and I shall inform you on what next to do to make sure you receive this money.  I am waiting for your answer in order to tell you what to do.Thank you for your co-operation and remain ever bless.)

I need some quick advice on an appropriate gift for a girl I only met 2,5 weeks ago.
We have been really clicking and this is the first women in over a year I actually like spending time with, talking to her and doing other stuff apart from having sex.
Iam well into her, I think - not sure though - she is very much into me as well.
We have had sex twice.

285,"This is a serious thread, so only serious answers please.

FYI: I am a male.

Last week i attended a music festival (Subsonic). A group of friends, including myself, volunteered at this festival. In return we would receive a free ticket. 

On one of the days a friend of mine (very good looking) met a girl and her friend and they kicked it off pretty well. Later that day, my friends and i went for dinner and when we finished, the two girls joined us. 

There was one girl that i was interested in but it was clear that she seemed to be only interested in my good looking friend.

Soon after, the festival began and the party kicked off. Throughout the festival, the girl and her friend would join us at our campsite. We'd drink and have fun, but it still seemed as if the girl I was into, was still interested in my friend.

One night, the girls came over and thats when i decided to build up the courage to just speak to her and get to know her. 

It went beyond amazing. It felt like we were connecting on a whole other level. We were talking about our dreams, our family and friends. Our childhood. EVERYTHING.

At one stage of this conversation it seemed to me as if she turned her eyes on me. I began speaking about myself and my future and ambitions. I am very passionate about what i do and i think that got to her. 

This may seem completely ridiculous, but the way she was reacting, it felt as if she was being slightly turned on. It looked like as if we were connecting and resonating on some foreign planet that we only could see.

Throughout that night we made jokes about her becoming my wife and having babies together.

Now that the festival is over I cant stop thinking about her. My good looking friend sent me a screenshot of her sending him a friend request on facebook. NOTE: My facebook DP is blank (so maybe that could be a reason?)

I am completely stuck and i dont know what to take from this :\",03Dec2018,1

Sounds like I’m a piece of shit but I’ve only worked there for a total of like 4 hours and I’m not sure if I can handle it I don’t want to quit because I only just started but I really don’t think I’ll be able to improve because even just thinking about it makes me feel like passing out or vomiting. I have to work tomorrow for a couple hours what do I do?? Is it too early to quit?

I'm so tired and I feel so lost. I feel biased and sad and exhausted on a scale I can't describe. I become paranoid and check his phone often. I've become someone I don't like. I never invaded his privacy prior to knowing about it. 

Today, tonight. Again. I found content. I see it and immediately I am pulled back to a past I can't outrun. I feel so broken. 

Please someone give me advice. I love this person a lot. This person has tried (I have seen effort and guilt and so much repentance), and these days I ask myself if it's ever enough. It just feels like this person doesn't see the hurt in these innocents, while I feel it to an insane level. How can this person do this? Why? 

We love each other. But this thing, this ugly attraction this person has to online material like this, might just be my line in the sand. But I love this person so much, and have seen the effort put in to reduce and slowly stop this behaviour. What do I do?

288,"My brother is a paedophile. I know this and so do my siblings and parents. This year after keeping it to myself for 20 years I finally told my family that my older brother sexually abused me and tried to rape me multiple times between the age of 4 and 8. I had a mental breakdown which put me in therapy and it ended with me having to tell them because my therpist was so concerned that he told me he would tell the police. When it happend he was between the ages of 13 and 17. I later found out that he tried to do something to my older sister too when they were 9 and 10 but my sister thought it was just something kids do when they're curious. I don't know exactly what he did to her but she refuses to say any more and that is that. No one else seems to fussed about her story but totally lost it when I came out with mine because it was so serious. My mum told me that she kicked him out at 17 as she found child porn on the computer and was so scared and embarrassed that she didn't know what to do. The PC was destroyed and she bought us a new one. She was worried the rest of her kids would be taken away because of him and so it wasn't spoken about again. I forgive her for this though. She is a brilliant mum and so supporting.

I went to the police and it was investigated for 6 months. During this time my brother left the country and ran away to Morocco after telling his friends the accusations were false and he would kill himself. This lead to a police search and him being shared on social media and news stations as a vulnerable missing person. My mum was contacted by his friends as they found out her details and they said we were all sick for making it up and that my brother told them he has no family and was an orphan who lived on the streets from the age of 5. They soon accepted that he had made that story up but refused to believe he was a paedophile. After a month he returned to the UK and a wave of supporters and 'fans' after a TV show aired during his absence of which he was a part of the cast (I don't even know, it was filmed a while ago apparently). 

I mentioned to the police that I told a friend that I was abused by him when I was 8 and they contacted this girl. He had done it to her too, except he would pick her up from school when she was 13 and drive her to the woods for sex. He was 22 at this point. She was a witness in the case but decided she didn't want to give evidence and so her part was dismissed. 
My mum later was contacted by around 10 girls aged between 15 and 19 who sent her screenshots of abusive messages from my brother and told her stories of how he would touch them in public and threaten them with sexual violence. He even helped one girl who's car broke down and said he will help her if she gave him sex. 

My whole family gave statements, including all of the messages  above. I was incredibly honest in my interview and told them that I had told someone else about my abuse. This is where it gets tricky. 

When I was 19 I got into a friendship with my manager of a local video game store that I had been going to since I was 14. It was my first job. Long story short I opened up to him when I had a bad bout of depression and he used my bad past to get me wrapped around his finger. What started off as the odd coffee after work eventually turned into him buying me jewellery  and telling me that he wanted to teach me how to have sex and that not all men are abusers. As a stupid girl I believed this was nice and normal of him and I did it. I then found out he was married after finding an upturned photo in the house and that I was one of many younger girls age 18-25 he was doing this too. All with depression and confidence issues. I accepted I was stupid but eventually I told another staff member (manager was threatening suicide if anyone found out and I was terrified). I got encouraged to tell head office and ultimately I got sacked because in their words I am an adult and knew what I was doing and good.managers are hard to replace.

I told the police about this whole situation and they called him in to interview. They admit that what he did was wrong and that he apologised profusely. They also said he told them about my past abuse and it helps me greatly. I get thanked for being truthful and told that they will contact me in a few weeks after more investigations.

I get called back to the station with my whole family a few weeks later, sat down and told that they will not be going any further with the case. They know I am telling the truth but that there are no liable witnesses or evidence and because of my relationship with my manager years prior to this investigation, they believed I would be torn apart in court so it wasn't worth it.
Heartbroken is an understatement and my whole family are struggling with this outcome. Especially as according to a mutual friend, my brother has now sold all his belongings and is suddenly moving to Thailand. The police say if someone else comes forward they may look at the case again but he threatens everyone he does this to. I feel like an idiot and I am not sure what to do anymore. What if he hurts another child in Thailand?  Is there anything I can do? What if there are other victims who don't know that someone's come forward?

I just need advice on this whole situation. I am one of 5 children and I don't see my dad as he used to beat me and my mother (no one else). I also have aspergers syndrome and other physical health problems which have lead me to live an isolated life as I have grown into adulthood.

August 10th, 2018 he decided to drink and drive.

Miles, for as long as I’ve known him has had huge struggles with depression and anxiety. A few years ago he tried to kill himself a couple times. He hasn’t tried again since, but he has made one thing clear. He doesn’t want to exist. His one desire is to end his life. He describes himself as a leech. He truly believes that he is a terrible awful person who ruins everything and deserves death. This is not true, obviously. This has been particularly bad over the last couple of months. He’s been the worse that he’s ever been. He says the reason he hasn’t killed himself yet is because he knows how much it would upset me and our other friend (F17). Yesterday, while I was away from school in London, he messaged me and told me that he had used a pair of nail scissors to carve the words “liar,” “thief” and “scum.” Onto his arms. He has given me the scissors he used to try and stop himself from doing it again, because he knows he will otherwise. All the relevant school authorities know all this but I don’t think there’s anything they can do. At the same time, I’m trying to hold myself together and stay strong for him but it’s taking a serious toll on me. I hate this.

296,"Friday was my payday. I had a $1050 check to cash. I live pay check to paycheck most of the time as a single father of a 7 year old daughter. I have always been able to pay my bills in person, so I don't have a bank account or debit card myself. I went to Walmart this pay period to cash my check because I had just cleaned out my wallet the previous day and had just my ID and some receipts. The bank my payroll check is through requires 2 forms of ID, the 2nd being something like a debit card or old high school ID or cable bill. I usually kept my current cable bill but threw it out not even thinking about it.

I was on a limited time schedule Friday morning so instead of running home and back across town, I went to Walmart. While in line I decided to grab one of the prepaid walmart debit cards to do some Christmas shopping online. I had all my bills lined up, I had to pay out $650 dollars and I would have the remainded of my $1050 check as extra money to save or use for Christmas.

I cash my check, and load $500 onto the card, leaving my $1040 roughly after the fees. I can pay one bill online with the card as well. I am told to wait a few and then activate the card. I go to my daughters school award ceremony and go home and try to activate the card.  Not valid. I call, it is impossible to reach a real human on the phone, it just asks for my card number, which it then tells me is not activated, and then when we activate it gives me the error.

I go back to Walmart and spend 4 hours there on and off the phone with Green Dots bank retailer help division who is so unhelpful its amazing. Finally someone helps me on the phone. Standing in walmart on their phone line. I am told I have to send pictures of the card and my reciept to an email with nothing BUT the pics and my case number. Green Dot will review and if they deem me a verified purchaser in 1 to 6 days they will send a refund check in 14 days after. I asked if I should include my name and number and address and was told NOT to do that and only include the items asked for. I asked if they will email me back any kind of confirmation and was told no, and not to email more than once.

Walmart refuses to refund me, and the only way I can even get ahold of a real person at Green Dot is by calling the retailer number which I memorized while on hold at Walmart and pretend to be a walmart employee with the store number, which I memorized while the employee called multiple times. If I mention I am a customer I am hung up on.

I always see people take about things and get really into stuff and thats how I want to feel about things but when I think about it, I'm currently not like that for anything that I can think of. I'm not sure what to do.

I recently saw a video where people stopped using the internet for like a month or something and there were able to realize that they didn't really have any deep interests and then during that time off, they were able to actually realize some interests that they have an pursue them a little. They also didn't completely quit the internet for that time, they still used GPS, text and call, and basic things like that. I don't want to go that extreme but I definitely think that I spend way way  too much time on my phone just scrolling through social media because it is something to do.

I went through cancer treatment when I was only a kid, I tried to remain strong through it all but I got really close to my breaking point.

Last year my cancer returned, my leg was amputated and I was fired from my job as I couldn’t work anymore (completely legal as I wasn’t full time, I’d been working there for 3 years but it was always on-call and part time). 

That was my breaking point. I’ve spent the last year in a haze, riddled with alcohol and drugs. I feel like I’m losing myself more each day.

Everyone at my school is a douchebag. - So, around early 2018 (like in early Jan.) I had this friend. Lets call him ""Jordan"". He and I were good friends, we hung out sometimes, and we played to together on Xbox a lot. Which is where this problem begins to unfold. Now in mid 2017, (8th grade) is when I first met him. Now for like 3-4 Years, I had another friend who I just knew on Xbox as he lived in Canada. Let's call him ""Chris"" Chris and I were best friends. For a long time. So when I heard Jordan had an xbox, my dumbass thought ""I should introduce Jordan to Chris!"" So I did just that. And they hit it off. They were friends within a couple days. At first I didn't mind, it was cool to have another person to talk to and play video games with. So back to early 2018. I made more friends on Xbox and some in real life at school, but Jordan seemed to get annoyed with me a lot. I would often say ""get over it"" whenever we argued about something. And one day he just snapped and yelled at me and called me annoying. Myself now wouldn't care but I was a bigger bitch back then so I got upset. I didn't talk to Jordan for a week. Then I decided to try and apologize. Now this fucker never apologized for ANYTHING. I was ALWAYS the one apologizing even for stuff that I never started. Anyway, he didn't continue to talk to me and we drifted apart, but Chris didn't. He continued to talk to Jordan a lot and I guess I got jealous. I told Chris, (and yes I am aware of how selfish this sounds) ""Block/r1emove Jordan or we are done being friends"" now obviously he didn't like hearing that and we argued about this for the next couple weeks. Me and Chris would be in a xbox party together and Jordan would join, but just mute me. So I would have to communicate to Jordan through Chris (to ask Jordan a question, I would have to ask Chris to ask it for me). Eventually me and Chris came to an agreement. I told him ""If Jordan is in a party, game, whatever, I will leave it"" So then if me and Chris were talking together, he would join and I would be forced to leave. This continued for a while until Chris told me that Jordan wanted to talk to me. He basically wanted to be friends again but he didn't phrase it like that. I don't remember his words. Now flash foward to about 3 ish weeks ago. The same problem occurs, he found me annoying, and has decided to block me. So I was done with it. At this time I have two other good friends. Let's call them ""Alex"" and ""Eli"". I told Alex, Eli, and Chris that Jordan would backstab you guys just like he did to me twice. I continued this argument until two days ago. Now,  Alex has blocked me and won't talk to me. Chris although he hasn't blocked me isn't talking to me much. And Eli hasn't said a word, but he doesn't talk to me outside of xbox anyway. So what do I do? I know forcing my friends to not be friends with someone is selfish and stupid but I'm sick of fighting with people, and I'm sick of losing friends. Chris is like a brother to me and I literally love him as one. But Jordan has torn our friendship apart once before, he is doing it again now. I just want to stop fighting.

305,"So at the beginning of the year I got up, got ready, hopped on the bus, and went to my class. If I missed the bus or slept in which rarely happened my mom would just take me and drop me off. I always preferred the bus though.

But now I'm having real problems getting to school. I feel like I messed of my sleep cycle so much that I'm sleeping through alarms, turning them off without knowing, or turning them off knowing so  I can sleep in.

Whenever this happens my mom just gets in a fit of rage. She yells at me the whole time while I'm getting ready and screaming. Sometimes she will wake me up or I eventually wake up and get ready and ask her to take me to school she would say no.

I have missed way too many days of school and I have to keep making excuses to teachers why I missed your class the 13th time this month.

306,"I went over to ask my teacher a question today. After asking, he quickly turned his face and started listening to someone else's question, kind of like skipping my question ( you can tell he is doing it on purpose ). The question was related to me still being confused about something specific in a lesson. I am pretty sure the answer for my question isn't long and should only take maximum of 30 seconds. 

This is the second time he has done this. There is no reason for him to do this. Even if there is a reason, it's still extremely rude. I am always ending up asking the same questions to other teachers of the same subject, not the teacher who is actually teaching me. I haven't done anything rude to him before and I ask my questions in a polite manner.

The interviewer (owner) asked a lot of personal questions etc. though nothing to make me uncomfortable, just what my parents do, brother does, boyfriend does etc. 

So at the end he stated that he doesn't check references and if I want the job his only requirement is that he meets with one of my parents and he does this with everyone he employs. I honestly found this very very weird, because I'm a 20 year old university student and I can handle all these issues by myself, and I really don't like mixing personal and professional. However, I really need the money to pay for bills, especially when the semester starts again.

308,"Hi ! 

Longstory short ; I sacrificed most of my relations, study, work opportunities and savings into my dream of going pro in video games. The lifestyle got me addicted to multiple drugs. Brought an end to it because of depression a year ago.Since then, been trying to come back to life and start a potential future but cant get any momentum because of multiple badlucks ( lost 3 jobs in a row because of 3 restaurant bankruptcys back to back ) wich created a lot of problems. 

Now im at a point where my enthusiasm level is pretty low even tough i've always used to be the kind of guy with 10 000 thousands ideas and things to do. Going back to normal work just doesnt look like an option for me now, i need some kind of adventure. I've studied psychology a little in school and lot outside of it, and i had a sports psychologist for a while so im fairly aware of all the self-help stuff. I've taken antidepressant before but i dont want them again. I got a good diet, i exercise well and i got a pretty good work ethic.

&amp;#x200B;

Main problems :-

No Social Life ( 95% of friends are ex teammates, people ive known and seen only online ) 

low knowledge of possibilities outsides of specific spheres of work. 

Nothing exciting in any near future + exhaustion of getting a job and loosing it.

Financial situation is pretty dead

Im thinking of some ''Reset'' kind of a idea. Moving to the north to work in forests, becoming the apprentice of a craftsmen, work on a boat crew or something. Im 23 and live in Canada btw.  Im open to any ideas

310,"Hey guys, I’m currently so lost and sick of revision. My mocks are soon and I’m really worried that I won’t remember anything. The thing is that my grades aren’t bad but that’s because I cram and work my ass off to get that grade. But a few weeks later I feel like I can’t remember a single thing from that topic. 

As I am studying for my mocks I revise quite well and at the end of a revision session I feel confident that I know the content well. But when I go to answer a question or even try to write information I learnt from memory I draw a blank. It feels like I know the content and its on the tip of my tongue but I just seem to panic. For example, I have my psychology exam coming up and our teacher set us a test to revise old topics about a month ago. I’m struggling to remember anything from that topic. Surely it’s not right that I can’t remember most of what I learnt a month ago?!?

To be honest. It’s probably me overreacting but recently I feel like I can’t remember past memories too. Maybe they aren’t important memories to me so I don’t feel like I need to remember them but when my friends mention a sleepover we went to around a year ago I can’t remember anything from that day!

313,"We live in a duplex but share a laundry room with our neighbors. They have lived there a while before us (Has the laundry room to themselves for a while) and have a habit of not taking their laundry out of the washer/dryer. At first I would just shrug my shoulders and wait until the next day to do laundry, but the clothes would still be in the *washer* when I’d go to check back the next freakin’ day, still damp and smelling awful. Being nice I actually re-washed it for them, then had to put it in the dryer for them as well. *whaddya know, they never bothered to come down and check their laundry so I had to take their load out and put it on a pile on a shelf so I could finally do my fucking laundry*. 

This happened again about 10 more times, Maybe more, even last night while my boyfriend wanted to throw a load in the washer. Actually now that I think about it there has been maybe 2 or 3 times we’ve done the laundry without having to take their stuff out. (We have lived here since beginning of September). But I’m not nice anymore and wait, I just take their clothes out of the dryer and leave them in a pile on the shelf. I don’t have it in me to take their wet clothes out of the wash and pile those on the shelf, I will always throw them in the dryer even though it bugs the shit out of me, I’m not a trash human being. But still it’s really annoying and I’m over it!! 

I have mentioned it to them before and said “hey just wanted to let you know your clothes were in the wash for a while so I rewashed them in threw them in the dryer for you, cause I have to throw a few loads in” (passive aggressive I know, but I really see no reason to be rude, but saying this I hoped they would remember to actually grab the stuff out of the dryer, they didn’t) and they say “oh I’m so sorry were so forgetful just take them out of the dryer/washer if you have to!” And tbh it’s a little uncomfortable for me to be touching my neighbors underwear/clothing and I really just shouldn’t have to. My boyfriend refuses to touch their clothes and will not do his laundry for weeks, he has even taken his work clothes to the laundromat because so much has piled up he needs extra large washing machines. I remember to get my laundry out of the machines minutes after they’re ready, so why can’t they? Also it kills me because the one neighbor works from home but does laundry every Sunday. Sunday is the only day my bf and I can really do laundry because we both work 6 days a week. 

Despite this annoyance they are actually really nice people and we get along with them well. I really don’t want our relationship with them to go sour because of something as trivial as laundry. But I don’t know how else to approach them about this without coming off as rude. ",03Dec2018,1

316,"I'll start off with admitting I am lazy as all hell. Back in 2016 I had an idea to start a ""gaming"" social media profile, due to the fact I have loved and played them all throughout my life. 
I'm also a girl, and 2016 was a time where representation for female gamers wasn't as popular as it is now. 

Due to my own bad habits (laziness, lack of funds) and a couple of roadblocks (a break-up), I just never started the social media account. Which was intended fo be an instagram (at least to start off with). Since 2016, I've thought about creating a YouTube or a Twitch to stream, but again, just have never gotten around to it.
This year, I started a Business course, majoring in Marketing, alongside Event Management, and I volunteered at several different gaming and pop culture related conventions, as I would love to work in the industry. I spoke to my Marketing lecturer about my social media ideas and he said they would be great to pursue, especially if I am considering entering the industry.

This passing weekend I discovered after reading an old co-workers (from my first job in 2012) Facebook posts, that she has had the same idea as me, and currently runs an account with 12k followers on Instagram. Immediately, I am jealous because this is something I've wanted to do, but didn't because I was lazy. I'm alsp overjoyed for her because she is lovely and she is finding a lot of success from the account! 

So now, I'm stuck. 
I have a list of ideas, all which are very different from hers to begin with, but I can't shake this nagging feeling that it's going to be seen as copying or stealing from her. 
I suffer from an anxiety disorder so I can't tell if this is rational thinking or just my anxiety talking, or if any of that really matters at all, and if I should just start the accounts now and stop procrastinating. 

What should I do? Is it too late, or does it really not matter and creating my own account isn't copying at all?",03Dec2018,1

320,"So my mother is mentally ill, or st least I guess so because she was never diagnosed. Since when I was a kid the main situation in my house was my mother screaming at my father while he stays completely quiet watching tv. The situation stayed like that until 4 months ago, when my mother discovered that my father betrayed her for 3 years with a collegue of them (they do the same job). For the first week it was like hell, but it was the moment where my father understood that he had to take action to fix the family. We were hopeful for the first period, but then things seemed to become like in the past. The typical situation is me, my brother and my father yelling at my mother trying to make her understand the she needs to be cured by a professional. I know that screaming is not the solution, but with her there seems to be no other way. The thing that I don't understand is that she says that she love my father, and she said it only after she discovered the betrayal. I grew up with the convinction that my parents didn't love each other at all, since my mother treated my father like shit all the time, and now she says that she loves him, I really don't understand. Why do you keep treating him like shit if you say you love him? Her relationship with my father is really morbid. When we try to convince her to divorce she takes it as a personal attack and thinks that it is because my father doesn't love her. No it's not, it's because we can't stand to live in hell anymore, I don't know how she can't understand that. Now don't get me wrong, my mother is not always like that. When she is in her ""normal"" state she is really sweet and nice, but then something triggers her. It may be the weekend, when my father has to go away to work and she starts drinking and call random people on the phone. It may be something that my father does, that in the eyes of a normal person seems completely ordinary but in her eyes it's the proof that he doesn't love her and doesn't care about her. My mother is not mad, in most of the situations she is a perfectly normal human being, but that trigger arrives she becomes a monster, her eyes fill up with hate and she start saying horrible things, really horrible things. Not only to my father, if me and my brothers try to make her understand that she has a problem she start calling us ""bastards"" saying ""she doesn't deserve this"" and that ""we don't respect her"" and ""we don't love her"". It's like a cycle: she think that we don't love her, so she loses her mind and act like a monster, and when we attack her she takes it as a proof that we don't love her. Also right now if me and my brother attack her she think that we are defending our father after what he did. We are not defending him, what he did was terribly wrong, but after that he tried to rebuild this family, so we don't have reasons to attack him. The only one that is not willing to go on with life and stays morbidly attached to the past is her, so what we are trying to do is make her understand that she has a mental problem that has to be solved. But she doesn't listen to us and takes everything we say as a personal attack.
Right now I am 18 y.o., I am in last year of high school and willing to go to the university next year. I'm really trying to focus on school and personal growth, trying to get over my social anxiety (with big results btw) and trying not to worry about my family situation. I'm really proud of myself for being able to improve myself despite my familiar situation, but I'm scared that things may get worse and I will lose control of my life sooner or later. What should I do, should I just not give a shit about my mother and just care about myself? I really don't know what to do right now

325," 

There is an 8 month old male German Shepherd that is not fixed living in our apartment building. I have a six month old Australian Shepherd that is fixed. We live on the fifth floor and the GS lives about four doors down. We run into each other quite often since we live on the same floor and both use the elevator.

He has attacked my AS in the elevator twice, both times on the leash while the owner would unsuccessfully try to pull him away. He attacked him another time outdoors (the first time we discovered the GS was hostile. The worst occasion was when we went to a pet store about a block away. When we walked inside the GS was off his lease and immediately started attacking my AS. The owner did not immediately intervene. I got down to try to get between the GS and my dog and he bit my arm as well in the process. After about a twenty second struggle, the pet store owner was the one who ran over and pulled the GS off me while the owner stood there and looked confused. I took pictures after the event. I had a winter coat on so my arm just had red marks and scratches while my AS's paw was bleeding and he limped around for about thirty minutes.

I spoke with the owner of the GS after this and they agreed to get a muzzle for their GS just for on the grounds. The attacks have happened so often that I do not think they can easily control their dog. My AS is also now afraid to enter the elevator and pet store since he associates it with where hes been attacked prior, and also hides from GS's if he sees them in public.

After seeing the GS and the owner for about a week after these events, I kept noticing that they do not have any kind of muzzle still. I spoke with her today and she said that after thinking on the issue she has decided to not get the muzzle. She said that the 8 month old GS is an emotional support dog, and with a muzzle he would not be able to do his job. I suggested then maybe using a gentle leader leash, that way if he lunges the leash would close his mouth. She said she is not comfortable with that.

327,"(**TMI warning - imma go real in-depth with my life here**) I'm a 20 year old female and have been dating my current boyfriend for just over a year. I've always known that I was into women as well, and the past year has been an interesting developmental period, to say the least. Here's what's up:

1) I've never been in a committed long term relationship like this before. In all of my high school relationships, my boyfriends didn't care if I made out with girls at parties and whatnot. My current boyfriend, however, deeply cares. I would never want to cheat on him, and things like kissing girls at parties or just for fun has never been treated like cheating in any of my other relationships. I find it very difficult to deal with him not wanting me to do this, although I completely understand where he's coming from and it's totally fair. It's just... very new for me, still. I figured once we passed the one year mark I would get over it and get used to being completely monogamous. but it hasn't settled in yet (even though we live in our own apartment together with our cat).

2) I can only get off to lesbian porn. Sometimes my boyfriend and I watch porn together but I never really enjoy it unless it's girl on girl. I also have been having a VERY hard time getting turned on the whole time we've been together. I chalked it up to PTSD from a sexual assault a few weeks before we started dating, but now I just feel like I'm not super overly sexually attracted to him at all. He's a good looking guy and sure, the sex is good most of the time, but it's hard for me to get turned on. It's painful a lot of the time, actually, because I'm just not completely into it. I never seem to be in the mood for sex and it offends and hurts my boyfriend a lot. I've talked to him about how it's also upsetting for me - I want to be able to give this to him but I just can't. 

3) There's a girl. For the past few months I've been heavily questioning where my sexual orientation lies. I've seen girls that I've been attracted to, but nothing like this. I recently met a girl at my new job and I feel so infatuated with her. I get excited when I see her and when we talk I feel super nervous, and knowing that she's also into girls doesn't help my situation. But I'm also having trouble determining whether I feel this way because I just really, really want to be her friend or because I have a giant crush on her. 

I love my boyfriend with my whole heart, and I can't imagine a life that he's not a part of. We've had a small discussion about my feelings and he was open to talking about it, basically saying that ""as long as I'm still attracted to him"" there's no cause for concern. And I am attracted to him, but I feel like it's in more of a best friend sense???

I'm not entirely opposed to the idea of an open relationship or polyamoury, but he definitely is. He's very possessive and jealous, and has expressed how he wouldn't be able to have trust in an open/polyamourous relationship. 

Basically, I just need some ideas on where to go from here. I'm at a loss, and I don't know where to go from here without hurting somebody.

I am finally going to gain some independence away from my parents and I am happy about this, but also scared. I keep signing up for online dating sites, and just doing a lot of things where I give my self-respect away to get attention from guys. I feel awful about it. I've been in counseling for months now, and yet I keep doing these things. At least now they are online and I'm not in any abusive relationships in real life. I just have extremely low self esteem and have given men sooo much power, that this mindset is difficult to change. I do want to be Christian, but there's a lot of baggage surrounding that, and I've questioned that path for a long time. When I am Christian though, I am never in abusive relationships, and I always feel like God protects me from abusive men, as corny as that sounds. That being said, I haven't gone to church at all, but I do subscribe to many Christian ideals.

Ask him a clarifying question and he gets angry. Whatever, it’s construction, shit happens. But this morning my boss accused me for the second time (the first was maybe two months ago) of being gone in the bathroom for 30 minutes, when i know i wasn’t gone for more than 10. I told him i know i left to the bathroom at x time and now it’s x+10, and he just said no he’s been waiting for me at my work spot for longer. Funny thing is is he saw me like 15 minutes before this moment, 5 minutes before i went to the bathroom. I brushed it off and we discussed what i was working on. He was on his phone for a bit after typing a bunch and it almost made me think he was writing something down about me, but i’m probably just being paranoid. But it got me thinking if somewhere he mentioned this, Or it was on my file anywhere or something like that. 

I’m torn between wanting to just low key mention this to HR to avoid any retaliation in the future and bring it to their attention, and between not wanting to escalate it and make it a big deal. The jobsite is almost over in a couple weeks too. But that also means lay-off are happening and i don’t want to be on the list because of this.

My wife and I met in mid/late 2016. From the moment I saw her I knew she was the one. After a little over a year of dating we got married. Everyone said we were moving to fast. I didn't care, neither did she yada yada yada. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to September 2018. We've been in a rough patch for awhile. She wasn't happy, and I was doing my best to make her happy. However, she would never tell me what was making her happy. Finally, one day after we'd been lying in bed for a while, she told me she felt unloved and not attractive and other things. Primarily though, she wasn't happy about our sex life. Her sex drive is a lot higher than mine, so I get it. She wasn't getting what she wanted when she wanted it. Regardless, we still were sexually active with eachother 1-3 times a week. 

&amp;#x200B;

Come late October she is still feeling dissatisfied. I tried to do things more often, but with work, bills (I pay for 95% of the things between us), and trying to maintain my own happiness, I just always felt so drained. I was so tired and I just didn't have the energy to give her what she wanted. Then, she pitched the idea of going into porn. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was skeptical to say the least. Just a few months back she found porn repulsive. After a long discussion, and her agreeing to be anonymous as possible, I gave the okay. There was an understanding that I'd give the approval on what will be uploaded and shown and that I will not be forced to participate unless I wanted to. 

&amp;#x200B;

This turned out to be great for her. Her body confidence shot up, she was a lot happier, and I was able to participate in my wife's life more. Then late November came around. 

&amp;#x200B;

It turned out that she was still extremely unhappy and felt unwanted and just overall miserable. She said I couldn't give her what she wanted so maybe we should pursue other avenues. Specifically an open-relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

She brought the idea to me on November 27th, 2018. We talked for a while about it. She assured me that it was nothing right now and it would be something we could maybe look into to see if it would help us. We talked about how we'd both have to approve of the other person's choice of people. That we would have to get consent from eachother for anything that we would do with another person. Overall we put together a framework for something in the futurue that would allow us both to be satisfied without hurting eachother. 

&amp;#x200B;

December 1st, 2018. I woke up around 1pm after a nice night of drinking to my wife already getting dressed for the day. I was oggling her pretty hard consdering she decided to wear some of her nicest lingerie and what can only be described as a ""punk school girl"" outfit. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I was making myself breakfast I started talking about how we could go see the new Fantastic Beasts move that night and go to dinner. Ya know a date night? That is when she informed me ""Oh, actually I'm meeting a friend in xxxxxxxxx tonight."" I responded with something along the lines of ""Alright cool thats chill, I'll play some xbox and stuff.""

&amp;#x200B;

We left the house to play some Pokemon Go for a bit, but the entire time we were out she was hiding her phone from my view (this matters since we are very open to eachother, including phones), kept staring at the clock, and seeming to want to leave ASAP. When we got home, I was feeling a bit worried so I tried going on her phone and just seeing WHO she was talking to. Not reading any messages. I was worried, shoot me. However, she changed the password to her phone, and when I brought it up to her, she didn't want to tell me the new one.

&amp;#x200B;

So she leaves, and a few hours later as I'm taking some Beer Brats off the grill, she calls me and tells me: ""Nevermind, I don't want anyone else inside me. I just want you. I'm sorry.""

&amp;#x200B;

I talked to her for a little while on her drive home asking what happened, who was it, etc. until we lost connection. Thats when it hit me. There was no communciation. There was no inclusion of myself for this. She went behind my back. She lied to me. She hurt me. She cheated on me. That wasn't the open relationship we discussed on MAYBE having NOT in the near future. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been a wreck since. I can't eat or sleep. I can't look at her, talk to her, touch her, or be near her. I don't know what to do. No matter how much we discuss what happened, it doesn't make it better. She knows she cheated on me, she admitted that to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do? What do I do when the person I give everything to and provide for completely decides I'm not good enough?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Wife wanted open relationship. We set ground rules and safety nets and had no plans for this happening in the near future. Few days later she goes behind my back, lies to me and sleeps with another person.",03Dec2018,1

334,"Hello all,   


I'm a non-EU national studying Civil Engineering in Poland and will be graduating next March. I'm now at a crossroads in my life and would like some to hear your thoughts regarding my situation and how you think I should proceed.  


I was planning on going for masters at either Canada, Germany or Norway. I will first be going through the pros and cons and then ask my questions.  


1. Canada - I've always wanted to study and live in Canada, it was my dream ever since I was in secondary school when many of my classmates immigrated there with their families and all of them are saying good things about the country and it's people. I found the MEng program in Civil engineering with a focus on Transportation Engineering or Construction management offered by the university of Alberta appealing and decided to apply but that was when I started having second thoughts.   
I  read about the hurdles faced by many international graduates,permanent residents/naturalized citizens (including my former classmates from school) in Canada who are unemployed or are unable to secure a job in their field because of many factors but most of the time I see the term ""Canadian experience""  brought up in the comments. That was a shocker considering that I will only get a 9 months post graduate work permit in order to find an employer willing to hire me.   

2. Germany - What more do I need to say. The country is right next door, I have met many Germans here on exchange programs and they were all very intelligent and friendly people. The first hurdle for me was the language, I'm a slow learner when it comes to languages but I know I can learn the language with proper guidance in time (like English).   
   
The universities in mind are RWTH Aachen and the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in the field of Transportation systems engineering. I read so many stories about graduates going back home after studies but that was mostly because they didn't really learn the language.   

3. Norway, tbh it was love form the first sight. What I know about the country is mostly from reading about it's history online. Amazing landscape, reputable degrees, a very high standard of living and almost all Norwegians speak English fluently. They also care about work-life balance so I feel like studying there will be less stressful than in Germany or Canada. Not sure about the job prospects for international graduates though but for sure you need to learn Norwegian to improve your chances. I already submitted an application to Norwegian Unviersity of Science and Technology (NTNU) for Project Management, as I also like transportation related subjects I noticed that they do have some courses offered in that masters program.  


Questions time !   


Canada - Is it really so difficult to find a job in Canada as an international graduate with little to no experience?   
Germany - Would it be possible to find a job if I reach a level B1 or B2 in German (and no experience)?   
Would it be better to learn the language first then do my masters in German or attend the international/English programs offered by the university?  


Norway - Job prospects? 

With regards to Europe, my parents are worried about my safety because of the political and refugee problems in the continent and they want me to head to Canada (FYI Poland didn't take in any refugees so I can't relate to how things are in other EU/EEA countries)

  
Finally, I got a job offer as a in a major gas field expansion project (80mil USD) in Saudi Arabia with a well known contractor and the client is *Saudi Aramco*. I feel like this will boost my CV and I will learn a lot considering that I don't have that much experience (3months of site inspection but meh). The thing is I feel like if I go there I ruin my chances of doing masters abroad (I'm a citizen of a 3rd world country) because things can change very quickly like rising tuition fees, more restrictive immigration/visa rules and so on but if I don't take that offer I feel like I might regret it later in the future.  
What I really want is to be in a country where I can work in something I like and excel and if possible, call it home, where I can live a decent life and be given freedom (something we don't have the luxury of in many third world countries). My parents are financially and can afford sending me to these countries and live comfortably. I will definitely be trying to secure part time jobs  and go for internships to get the experience I need.  


I'm only 23 years old so I'd like to hear the thoughts of more experienced people so I can make the right decision in the. Both my parents are doctors so they can't really advise me when it comes to Engineering. 

  
I apologize for the long post and I really appreciate the time you're making for me :)!!

My brother lives around three-four hours away, my mother is morbidly obese/too sick to move around much, and my sister is in prison. I've got nieces and nephews from both my brother and sister. 

Anyways, I used to spend my holidays around my family. It wasn't perfect or anything but they are what I've got and I love them. I live apart from all of them now, with my girlfriend, and the holidays make me incredibly depressed. Angry, too, considering how my sister got herself to prison and the fact that none of us can see her children because of her decisions. My girlfriend's family are incredibly kind, generous, and caring toward me but during the holidays I just don't know how to act.

I’m currently in school for a health care related degree and normally I’m very dedicated to my studies, very proactive with assignments, etc. Lately, I’ve just been dropping the ball everywhere and I can’t seem to stop it. I’ve been late to class like almost every day, I skipped a whole day after dealing with some family stuff, I’ve been late to my clinical site two days in a row now, I missed a whole online final exam, I’m always doing things last minute and studying last minute. I know a lot of it is probably laziness, but it feels like so much more. 

I’ve struggled with depression pretty much my whole life from adolescence onward. Sometimes I go through funks where things are rough, and this feels kind of like that, but different. 

I can barely get myself out of bed, or to do basic things like shower and brush my teeth. I don’t ever want to do anything but sit in my room. It just feels like everything is a chore and now my studies are paying for it, and I’m paying so much money for them. 

I feel like I keep letting everyone down and no one is happy with me at the moment. I keep messing up, I keep missing things, I keep running late and part of me doesn’t even care. The other part is like “dude we need to figure this out”. I don’t know what to do.

So, I moved aboard away to study for about two/three years but that changed in the previous weeks. I moved aboard with a really good friend of mine. I dropped out of college because I didn't like the course or the college itself. Also, I had a job here as a waiter as I was left go because the owner had an agreement I couldn't go home for Christmas, I said fuck that and booked my flights home, who doesn't want to be home for Christmas?

So at the moment, I'm not in College, I don't have a job. Also, my friend might be leaving here as he was offered a job back home in his uncle's company (a well paid job). I'll be left here on my own. (I've branched at here, I have 'friends' but not as close as my mate who might be leaving me). I'll be left here in a country, in an apartment on my own. My question is to you guys, what should I do? Should I move back home, pursue a career that I have an interest in? Should I move again to somewhere for an internship and build my way up? I'm not saying my future depends on my friend, but being alone in a foreign country is scary and I'd rather be somewhere like home. Get a stable job, and also be at home with friends. What do I do?

345,"To start the story, I used to be super close with both of them and I used to consider my cousin as a sister. Until I found out what they were getting up to behind everyone's back. We all grew up together, so it makes this even more disgusting. 
I found out about this when my cousin gave me her phone to keep safe at a party and later on in the night she told me her password and told me to message her mum, when doing this I saw a flirty message from my brother on her phone, so out of curiosity I opened it and I almost vomited. It was all just messages about what they wanted to do each other and them organising places to meet up and there were tons of photos of each other. It was vile, the content and language was basically straight out of a porno.
I had no idea what to do and I gave her phone back and left the party. 
Now every time I see either of them I feel disgusted and emotions I can't put into words. 
Neither of them know that I know and they just carry on as normal. 
I have no idea what to do. Do I tell my family? Do I tell them that I know about them? I kinda want to confront them to find out how this whole repulsive relationship started.
Literally any advice would be helpful.

350,"I used to be a good student but abuse at home and several mental disorders struck during highschool and I practically didn't go my final two years. I barely scraped into University thanks to a summer course and one really good teacher. I'm studying film and audio, not because I'm good at it but I just wanted to tell stories, to create something and that seemed as good a path as any.

I just finished my fourth year at University and in that time Ive passed maybe 5 semesters of classes. Moving out of home was isolating and it worsened a lot of my issues. I've been living off student payments from the government this whole time - the times I was mentally stable enough to hold a job, I couldn't find one. My area has crazy high unemployment and I have zero in xperience.

I'm better than Ive ever been in my life but I got an email from my university today that shattered everything. I'd been on academic probation but was doing better and thought It'd be fine - It wasn't. They have given me three weeks to prove they should let me stay next year or I will be suspended for a year. Problem is I haven't had any doctors appointments since the start of this year so I can't back myself up. 

Even worse is I'm not sure if I want too. I don't know if I want to go back next year but I know my chances of ever finding a job will be way worse if I don't finish. I will be able to go on unemployment, which isn't fun but at least I won't have to move home. If I go on unemployment I might never find a job though.

I don't know what else I could do or what I would do if I finished my degree. I just want to ""tell stories"", I play tabletop games, write, paint do whatever I can to get creative. I've been doing some of this stuff for years and Io can't say I'm good at any of it, certainly not enough to make a living and I don't even know if I'd want too.

All of my friends have been through tough times in their lives but are still miles ahead of me, only one hasn't graduated yet but at this rate they'd still beat me.

A very good friend of mine raped two people. In no way do I condone this, and I agree there needs to be some sort of punishment. 

The thing is, the people he raped have gotten two more people to say the same thing. Both of these people were ex’s of my friend. I talked to one of them and she said it’s a lie, and the other one who’s saying she was raped, well I was there each time she said it happened and know for a fact nothing happened. 

In addition to adding people to the list of people he raped, they keep an adding details to the story. For example, one of them through a cigarette at him and slapped him last time they were in the same room. He pushed her away, as any person would do in self defense. Now they’re saying he punched her. That’s just one example of many.

So those 3 (the one I talked to about it isn’t really involved) are going around telling people all this. My friend is only in highschool, and knowing him he’d probably commit suicide if his entire school thought he was a rapist. Is there anything that can be done to prevent this from ruining the rest of his life.

And i work a 9-5) I want to be his friend, and I’ll admit this is in part due to the fact that I don’t have many friends in the area, but cutting ties completely seems harsh. I know I need to stick up for myself here but I also have doubts about if I’m actually being a good or bad friend to him here. Help on how to proceed? ",03Dec2018,1
360,"Ok so I used to work with this chap (let's call him Dave) in his mid 50s. (me early 30s) We got on pretty well, both somewhat outsiders in a really shitty toxic workplace. We would go for the odd drink in the pub after work. Sometimes a fair few on a Friday night. Not one on one, usually just chatting to drinking buddy's at his local. 

I got fired from the shitty job. (whole other story,) 

We have kept contact and would have the odd lunch. But really don't have much in common apart from a shared hatred of the shitty job. 

I introduced him to my sister and she would have the odd friendly drink with him. She's at the age where most contempories are coupled up. She stopped when he declared he was in love with her. This really creeped me out. She assumed that these were friendly drinks and I doubt ever gave any signals otherwise.

I'm now thinking that I need to cut ties. I have had a baby and I am constantly getting messages every day to meet for lunch. Which is neither easy nor fun with a young baby. When I say no I get sad messages that he misses me. I would not mind once a month but he wants to meet at least weekly. I have taken to making excuses. 

He also comments on everything I post on Facebook. Even when it's something nobody need comment on. He messages me about the things he's done that day. He messages me when I'm on holiday.

I think the crunch point was this weekend. I was going to my best friend's party in a private room at a pub this Dave frequents (I had not mentioned it to him) . She went in the night before to drop off decorations. She got talking to the landlord who said:
""Dave was in here earlier really excited his 'wife' was coming in tomorrow""
What's her name"" she said 
""oh something like doctorwhofan"" he said. 

Day of the party he comes in the private room to say hello and again to say he's leaving and try to tie me down to agreeing to lunch. I am polite and non committal.

I then get a number of messages about how nice it was to see me and am I free this week.

I am starting to feel a little stalked. Should I just ghost him? I don't want to be cruel. Should I say Dave if you want to be friends then calm it down. I am happily married with a baby and you are 25 years older than me. It would never happen. 

I don't want to lose a friend. I think he is probably a bit lonely and I do feel sorry for him but talking about me and referring to me as his wife is really freaking me out. 

And I also do not want to have lunch every week, although it is clearly the highlight of his week I hardly have time to see my close friends and family.

Any advice greatly received.

361,"I've been feeling like I don't really know what I want to do with my life, and I want to do *something* to help my family, but I'm not quite sure what. There's multiple things leading up my reluctance to do different things, but I'm willing to try. (This is going to be a long read, I'm sorry haha)

&amp;#x200B;

*High School*

I went to a public arts high school that advertised getting a great experience but I got none of it. It was just another urban school that had poor authority and low test averages. My music grades were always failing marks due to not being able to travel to performances due to not having a car, and the teacher refused me to make it up in any way, and it dragged down my overall GPA disastrously. During the last half of senior year, I actually barely showed up to school because of a mix of no interest at all in the curriculum and once again being ostracized, talked about, and disliked by not only friends but the younger teachers who wanted to relive their high school years and fit in with the teens. Despite being a bad student, I came just enough to do tests, standardized testing,and projects, and always had top marks in those regards. Since I was still in the music program, it still made my GPA plummet and I graduated with a 1.9GPA, instead of anything in the 2.0-2.5 range I would have earned if it were not an arts school. I still hold blame for my high school self for not just sucking it up and going to school anyway, even if I was going to be alone, just to bring up my scores in case I wanted to go to college right away.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** I graduated with a 1.9GPA in high school and I didn't know what college would even accept me with those marks.

&amp;#x200B;

*Golden Child*

My family treated me, the oldest of my siblings, as some sort of golden child. Because I liked books and was well behaved, they boasted about me and even said I was going to be the first to graduate college and in their actual words, ""save the family"". They assumed I was going to get the highest paying surgeon job and blow away all of my cousins in comparison, and just be an untouchable fountain of gold and pearls. They spend so much time praising me but never pushed me to go out of my comfort zone and do different things or build any skills for adulthood. Unfortunately, I'm 19 now and none of their dreams for me has come true, as that's why I'm typing this now. I was coddled and deemed a golden ticket out of being poor so much, that I can hear the disappointment in my family's voice when they call and I tell them ""I'm not doing anything yet"".

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** I was treated, coddled, and praised like a golden child who was going to save the family from poorness for all my life, and not I'm ""Disappointing"" everyone from still not doing anything and not knowing what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

*What to do?*

I want to do *something* to help out the family, but I just don't know what. I'm not looking to move out and start a new, I'd rather stay home for an extra year and help my mother pay bills and pay for my sibling's expenses if I can, while saving, but I don't know how.

I've considered college, which was heavily pressured on me by my family, but I don't have any passion in anything like being a doctor or surgeon like they thought, and I don't want to go to college just to be part of a professional job I'd dislike only for the money. My mother has a degree, however it's in a field that doesn't really offer job opportunities (and that she herself once deemed as ""useless""), so I already see the aftermath of going to school in just any field just to get grants and loan money and struggling to pay it back 4 years later from her. She said that after 2 years of not going to school, universities won't look at my GPA so harshly anymore, but I'm not sure. And I feel that I won't be able to help my family at all at away at a campus.

I've considered the joining the work force right away, but my city is wary of hiring younger people now because of the news stories of thefts and crimes happening from young employees robbing their own jobs. Also, many jobs such as temp agencies or warehouses are very far from the city, and we still don't have a car, and the only other transportation is the bus, which my overprotective mother refuses to let me get on because of, once again, news stories of young people fighting each other and the drivers.

I'm interested in art and have been drawing since preschool, and my family *has* praised me a lot for it (until I got too old to ""still be drawing"" and it seemed to not be a way to make money) but I don't know how to utilize it to turn it into a job. I'm not at all good at heavy lifting or math/calculations, so learning those things will be harder, especially in trades. I also cannot drive. I have no work experience, but I'm willing to try something for the first time to help out and not be doing just *nothing* but thinking about what I should do every day. Is there anything I can try or do?

There's no ambiguity in my mind about how to treat rape, physical coercion, or any type of violence. It's wrong. Should be reported and prosecuted. End of story.

The question that I have is about fake #MeToo Victims.

The archetypal story is that of young female (sometimes TOO young) that has sex with someone and then has regrets hours/weeks/months/years later. The details are usually murky, but partners are portrayed as monsters, and phrases are thrown around akin to ""I never consented, but I never said no"", ""It didn't feel right"", ""I was manipulated, confused, and I didn't know better"", ""I was drunk"", ""I don't really remember it well"", and more often than not: ""wasn't treated well afterwards"". 

Now the common response mantra goes exactly like this: ""I'm sorry this happenned to you, It is not your fault, this is sexual abuse, go to the police, get some therapy"". 

That response, while very kind and affirming, also seems insidious. In my worldview unpleasant and regretful sexual experiences do in fact amount to personal mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes, and if you keep making them over and over it does say something about your character. I feel if you don't take personal responsibility for your mistakes, you will be doomed to repeat them. This is a general idea, that applies to everything, but I notice some people carve out exception for sexual misdeeds. Some people can feel entitled to victimhood regardless of the facts, but based on how they feel.

What does /r/advice say? Is giving these ""victims"" a bitter taste of reality appropriate, or should we treat sexuality in a special way because of some potential damage such responses can do?",03Dec2018,1

366,"Tl;DR : My friend( friend 1) and I are the only friends of this one guy(friend 2) who is becoming a bitter manchild and were having a discussion on how to help him. He complains about everything, is a bone lazy individual and while we are taking steps to improve our lives he is refusing to make change. Should we cut him off as he is tiring to be around and hope he improves with the cutting off or continue to hang out with him.

&amp;#x200B;

Friend 1 and I have had our fair share of problems with adjusting to adulthood and are in general sympathetic to our friends plight of not doing much with himself. I am finishing college a little later than most due to mental health problems and my friend wasn't  socialised correctly and took a bit longer to become a decent aware person.  A few months ago Friend 1 and I decide that instead of going to friend 2's house to sit around and watch tv we would go for a walk. They have over the past 5 months become a weekly ritual of catching up, what books we reading and steps we were taking to improve  ourselves. This week we were talking about how friend 2 has missed out on all of this. He has refused every single call to come for a walk. Even in the last few months we have noticed a big change in our conversations and how they are much more upbeat and how our material experience has improved - ie we now are both improving on our hobbies, he drawing and I baking. I have made a conscious decision not to talk to friend 2 apart from nights out unless he goes for walks with us or at least offers some activity other than sitting around and doing nothing. On nights out he is increasingly bitter - complaining that he's still a virgin and being very rude to friends 1 girlfriend. his behaviour is bizarre when he drinks and I find myself less willing to bear the social costs of inviting him to parties and social events. i will line out examples so you can get an idea.

2 weeks ago we went out (the 3 of us) with one other mutual friend , friend 1's girlfriend and her friend. Friend 2 gets drunk and starts going up to random people shoving his hip into people. I tell him to stop and he continues this behaviour, cock blocking me once and annoying everyone else in the group. After we leave the club to head back to one  of the girls' houses where he declares in front of them that these are  not the type of girls we should associate with as they are working class. The girls themselves are incredibly nice and non judgemental people and hes in no place to point fingers.

I used to invite him to friend houses but due to his behaviour - personality of a stale cigarette  rude to girls, acts incredibly entitled to other peoples belongings and attention, I have been asked to not bring him around by people that were once close friends with him which initially shocked me. I have on multiple occasions had to apologize for inviting him out to the hosts.

When I stopped calling out to his house he got his mom to ask my mom why I dont hang out with him anymore instead of asking directly.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that he's not at the moment worth anyones time but I do believe he has it in him to be a good guy. I was wondering if it was worth it to keep on telling him what behaviours he needs to do or to cut him off. I have told him for years to get hobbies and focus on other things in life as have many others but since they have all left him I feel like I and friend 1 have a responsibility to help him as we both would have liked someone to be with us when we were down and struggling. None of the stuff we are recommending is especially breakthrough - therapy, gym, new experiences,  but he has so far refused. Any recommendations would be appreciated.

367,"Hello all! So as the title says, my ""mom"" ( long story. I don't have parents and she took me in for a bit)  desperately needs a new roof. I just found out that she has needed one for an undetermined amount of time but hasn't been able to save up enough to replace the roof for her mobile home. I don't know anything about home improvement stuff so I'm stumped as to what to do. She already tried calling 211, habitat for humanity etc. But she lives in a stupid poor county that doesn't have the resources to help her. I'm thinking about starting a gofundme page but I don't even know what a roof costs. She doesn't have good credit   so getting a loan is difficult. Honestly, this sweet woman has had an incredibly rough life and she deserves a lot of love. 

I have a couple questions:

1. Can you save a mold infested home? Will replacing the roof fix the mold issue?  She can't just get a new home because she has a 30 year mortgage on this one. :( 

2. Are there resources other than habitat for humanity that can help with the cost of a new roof for a mobile home?

3. How do I go about getting a new roof? Do I just call around? How do I know what kind of roof she needs?

My 22nd birthday is coming up on the 10th of this month and idk what I want to do. I kinda wanted to go out to a bar, kinda wanted to go out to an actual club. I’d much rather go to the club but the closest one to me is in downtown Houston and the Uber to get there costs $50 there and $50 back. So that’s $100 on Uber for one night already. Boyfriend can’t chip in on Uber because he doesn’t have a card that will work with Uber’s payment options. Then the drink bill for both me and my bf (we just share the bill bc it’s easier that way) is anywhere from $60-$90. Then food, if we have nothing at home, would be $20 minimum. That’s just a lot of out of pocket expenses on MY birthday just to go out. 

The bar would cost $20 max round trip there and back. Drinks about the same as the club. The bar is no fun though. I mean it’s fine for casual drinking and smoking, and conversation. But it’s boring and they don’t play my kind of music. It’s a dry town, and Texas. So, think rock (I like rock but not for a night out), country (loathe entirely), and oldies (just ew). Bar is normally packed full but still lame. We run into a few cool people sometimes but for my birthday I just wanted a little more than to go to a causal drinking spot. 

A trick we can do for alcohol to save money is just to buy a bottle before hand and use that. Pregame at home and on the way (we never drive bc drinking) and then sneak a flask in and order stupid shit like soda and spike it. My main concern is the Uber. It’s just so expensive... $100 is just too much for 2 rides and I only live 12 miles from the downtown area. I don’t know of any friends who would be willing to take me. Are their cheaper ride options besides Uber? I’ve never tried Lyft but I imagine it’s around the same price. Also other than the 2 options above, are there any activities you’d recommend?

369,"My friend is being held for observation for a few days. Hippa laws don’t allow me to know what her blood test results are but confirm it’s within normal range (I’m assuming they didn’t find drugs?) but after talking to several friends and putting all the stories together, I’m positive she’s on meth or some version of it. Her parents agreed her behavior is reminiscent of her previous meth addiction years ago.

Yesterday when we were trying to get a wellness check some other friends took her out drinking. I realize she was manipulating the enablers and refusing to talk to the friends that call her out on her shit.

At first her parents were angry because we moved so quickly to get her help (she brought up suicide) but now we all agree it’s probably meth again and she’s safer in the hospital.

370,"I (F,18) really like one of my friends, he reciprocated and we danced around each other for like two months before he asked out another friend of ours he was also catching feelings for apparently. It's been a month since then and I'm tired of this. It's hurting me to see them together, more so hearing it. (They both tell me about what they do sexually.) 

I want to move on, but it's hard. We're close, and in a way I feel like he's unintentionally doing things to continue these feelings I have, like mentioning that if he and his girlfriend don't work out we could maybe be together, (despite telling me five minutes before that his feelings for me faded after asking his girlfriend out,) messing around and teasing me with a kink of mine because ""he likes messing with people"" and he ""found my reaction interesting,"" and telling me in a way what he'd do to me if we were together, and going on a bit how he liked my breasts. (The last three while we were hanging out drunk this past weekend.) 

I don't know how he still feels for me, but I know he wouldn't cheat and there's no way I'd 1) get with someone in a relationship and 2) would do anything to hurt his girlfriend (who's also my friend - not a super close one but still cool).

One of my friends has always suffered from self-esteem issues. I can sympathize with him, but anyone who knows me can tell you that I'm on the complete opposite end of that spectrum, probably bordering on unhealthy overconfidence.

This friend (the green one spouting that he's an idiot) used to have these small bouts of post-Melee-tournament (r/SSBM for the unfamiliar) depression every Friday. Fair enough, he thinks he's not performing at his potential (even though he's awesome at the game - 14th overall in Flagstaff, got 3rd in Doubles this weekend and is a great commentator to boot). Recently, however, he's started saying nonsense about how he holds us in higher regard than himself, that he's an idiot, etc.

Any of these incidents are not too worrying on their own, but the sheer commonality of him inserting essentially ""I'm worthless"" into random conversations, along with the post-Friday depressive episodes, makes me concerned. Were I not hours away and at the start of finals week, I'd personally go up there, slap some sense into him, and give him a hug.

Tell me if I'm overreacting, please. In high school, a few years ago, I lost a friend. He came out as gay to his parents, who were evangelicals. A month later, he stole his dad's pistol at night and walked into the middle of the desert. I'd rather a similar situation not occur again. ",03Dec2018,1

373,"This is my first time posting in r/advice so please feel free to let me know if I’m not flairing or using this subreddit correctly and thank you in advance. 

Here’s some background:
So I currently live in an apartment in Queens, NY with my parents and siblings and have been for 25+ years. It’s a fairly old apartment probably one of those that were built in the 50’s. I graduated this year and now work full-time so I wanted to help my parents pay for rent and so I still live with them and will for probably a few more years to support them.

Recently what I’ve noticed is that there is another tenant on our floor that has been constantly smoking cigarettes. Whenever we leave our apartment and head to the elevators (since we do not live on the lower floors) we get a pungent waft of cigarettes. They are definitely smoking in their apartment and it’s very unlikely that the smell is just coming from them walking through and heading inside their apartment. I have nothing against people who smoke but I personally would never do it because of the health risks and horrible smell. There are designated areas outside of the apartment where people can smoke and I have nothing against anyone who uses those areas. 

It really frustrates me that they are smoking indoors because my mom recently had lung cancer and we all think it most likely happened because her shit boss would always smoke in her office (which is also his) and there is no ventilation in that office. My mom has never smoked in her life, never drinks alcohol, basically the healthiest person in our family and there is no history of lung cancer in our family. No one in our family smokes and I think other people on our floor don’t either. It’s really bothersome for my mom who has to take the elevators everyday because she is getting older and has weak knees from a car accident (which wasn’t even her fault). I think it’s really inconsiderate of them to do this because there are many other people who live on this floor and there are babies, kids, and pets on this floor too. 

How do I go about this issue? Are there any laws that restrict people from smoking indoors? Everyone in the apartment building rents their units if that helps. 

Unfortunately, the landlord is a shit person and never helps. He’s super intimidating and actually is the one who complains to us tenants about not doing the simplest things. In my defense a lot of the things that he complains about or makes us tenants do are what I expect him to do as the landlord but there’s no helping that (throwing all our garbage and boxes out in the basement and separating everything and that kind of stuff). Should I just suck it up and complain to our landlord about this issue? The owner of the building is also a real piece of work too. 

I want to confront the people who are smoking in person but it’s very difficult to do so because it’s coming from a small centralized area where there are three other apartment units so I cannot exactly pinpoint who the culprit is. I don’t want to mistakenly call out the wrong tenants because they probably are also bothered by this or don’t want to get involved. Everyone in our apartment tends to keep to themselves (no chitchat or anything). It’s definitely on the far end of our floor and not coming from any floor above or below us (checked multiple times up and down the stairs). Should I leave a note by the elevators? What should it say? I don’t want to come off as rude but this really hits home personally for me as a health issue. 

Thank you again for reading this really long post. I wanted to be as thorough as possible because I really want to resolve this asap. I also apologize if there are any grammatical mistakes for I’m on mobile. I’m also at work so I’ll try to periodically look for questions and comments if you guys have any. ",03Dec2018,1
374,"Late last night/early morning, I woke up to the sound of what I thought was water spilling. That was not the case, it was J, one of my housemates standing near my dresser pissing directly onto my floor.  I have another roommate, E, who was awake at the time who was in my room while I was passed out playing video games on his computer that sits next to mine. E works night shifts at work so is always up at that hour but luckily it was his night off. It has me a little creeped out that this has occurred because E said he just strolled in at 330 in the morning and just started pissing on my floor and didn't acknowledge him. E confronted him first because he was already awake and J tried to finish emptying his bladder. In that time I had woken up and was a little frustrated and freaked out that someone was just standing 5 feet from my bed in the pitch black pissing in my room.

I'm worried that on other occasions while I've been asleep he's come into my room when E has not been there.  He was obviously drunk because he smelled like liquor and couldn't even speak. Do I confront him on the situation? I'm glad E was there to stop him but I just have this concern that he's been in my room randomly super late at night before. The dynamic of the house we live in is strange too since J is much older than we are, by nearly 20 years. Is my fear irrational? ",03Dec2018,1
375,"Hey, 

So I'm 23 and female. I am a bit into BDSM humiliation which I've done online quite a few times, and I'm into giving and receiving it. My parents don't like this or think it's okay, and have caught me a few times which has led to a lot of sexual shame for me. I've also been humiliated by my family about my sexuality in a lot of ways and then been in emotional abusive relationships. I am now single and not in abusive relationship but I find myself being really bored and wanting to seek out humiliation online (both giving and receiving). I also find myself having moments of blaming myself for the abuse I have been through completely, and thinking I should go back to the last person who was abusive towards me emotionally, thinking he will somehow change and treat me better and that his actions that were abusive were all my fault. I have signed up for a kinky dating site only to be rejected once again and I am quite eager to invest in some guy I barely know. I am currently in counseling already, and have been for months, which is why I got out of the dysfunctional relationship in the first place, but it's so familiar to be abused and humiliated I honestly feel quite depressed almost, and quite bored, and like I almost \*want\* to sign up for a dating site online. My self esteem is quite low. I place my value on what men think of me, which I've talked about with my counselor and am working on, although it's not easy to change. I've posted on roastme which I honestly thought was really entertaining, but I always want more and more attention at the expense of my self respect. The sad thing is I've posted on roastme about 13 or more times over the past few years, and it does help to lighten things up, but then I end up posting on dirty penpals and wanting humiliation. I do like it, and in the past I have been drawn to assholes because they're dominant, but my counselor said that it is possible to have both someone respectful and someone who would be into having a kinky sex life. I am just so preoccupied with this that it is very distracting, and feels like it's an emergency, and I'm extremely impatient because I feel like I need a man in my life to be content. Do you have any advice for embracing this part of my sexuality while also respecting myself, and men too? :) I've already signed up for fetster and that has not worked because there is no one on there who is in my area, but I am also in a really desperate place and a needy place right now.

I feel like I cant be myself with her and always am trying to hide how i feel, I cant ever talk about how I feel about anything without being belittled. I know this sounds one sided but from my side, I'm always trying and getting fucked for it. Now this other girl we will call her red. Shes always so sweet to me, weve spent a lot of time togather as just friends for about 9 months and she always makes me happy. While we were at this event we were drinking alone on a patio and she asked me ""what is up with you and ms8bitsnowman."" It was a Long conversation about how I'm unhappy with her and I just dont know what to do. Anyway we stayed at her place and things got heavy. I feel so guilty but its the first time ive felt physical love in probably months maybe even since we got back togather in 2017. I feel horrible about it but I just feel so happy when I'm around red like we can have these conversations about anything and she actually listens to me.

377,"A few months ago, I (very briefly) dated a man. He gave me a horrible gut feeling, and a lot of what he said scared me. I realize now that a lot of it was verbal abuse, but at the time I just saw it as ""sketchy"". So, I.... ghosted him. Shitty, but I was afraid of doing anything in person.

He took it badly. He sent me a series of veiled threats to my phone, and drove to my home/campus to try to ""find"" me. I filed a report with my campus police, and he was banned (a no trespass order) from my campus. He had apparently already been banned from my workplace, and my asshole landlord wouldn't ban him from my complex (I have since moved). My town police said they recognized him, and he had been ""buddying up"" to them at bars and such (he lives in a different town). The campus police tried to charge him with harassment, but apparently since I never told him not to contact me, it didn't stick.

A few weeks ago, a friend told me he is still talking about me, incessantly. Obsessively. I believe he owns guns (he had photos online but deleted them before I reported him to the police), and there's plenty of news lately about men attacking their exes, so... I freaked. I freaked the fuck out. I was afraid of him coming to my campus, so I missed about a week of classes.

My professor is not happy with this. She's asking for documentation to prove I couldn't go to class. I can contact the police and ask for the report, and I have records from therapy appointments I had during the incident, but nothing recent. I have no idea what to tell her. Can I show her the police reports? The therapy records? The text messages? I don't have anything regarding the week I missed, and no idea how to explain it to her. 

tl;dr - got threatened by a guy a few months ago, found out he's still obsessed with me and freaked out, missed class. My professor wants an explanation.",03Dec2018,1
378,"I want to apologize at the start for this long post. I  need this sub’s help. I really am at a loss of what to do. 

I am the oldest of five. I have 4 little sisters that range from 18 to 5 years old. I myself am 20. I’m the only boy. All four of my sisters will now be “homeschooled” by our mother who did not teach me anything in the last four of the five years I was homeschooled. 

A little background on my family: 

My mother was verbally and emotionally abused by her step-dad, my dad was as well by his step-dad. My mom’s mother, always let it happen and told my mom to let it in one ear and out the other. Anytime my mom threatened to tell outside help how bad it was she was always accused of being the reason he was so bad. 

My dad’s mother was the opposite, she was very overbearing on my dad and decided every decision in every facet of his life. Thusly, my parents have both decided to be the exact opposite - my mom is now like my dad’s mom, my dad is like my mom’s mom. 

I was pulled out of school in the third grade for “bullying” - Something I wish never happened. I can’t explain how far this put me back. My now-18 year old sister was pulled out of school at the same time. 

My mom homeschooled us well for the first year, but after that, she always told us to wait for dad to get home. My mom is unemployed, a SAHM. My dad works an 8-5, comes home, fixes dinner, cleans the dishes, takes care of the kids and puts them to bed. Then he goes and works OT from home in his office until 2 or 3am every night. 

Obviously, my dad has no time to sit down and help us with school. He would yell at us for “not making mom help us.” And then my mom would yell at us for “not making dad do it.” This cycle continued to the point where my sister and I would hide our textbooks, lie to our parents about doing work (on the rare occasion my mom would ask) and generally feel pretty shitty about ourselves and what we were doing. I dealt strongly with depression &amp; suicidal thoughts during this time. (Beginning at 8-9 years old.)

Eventually, our mom finally stopped buying us textbooks and school just didn’t happen. Anytime family would ask, it would be lies detailing how good we were doing. What strikes me most as odd is she would always have us in a co-op or a homeschool group and we would always attend and be involved. We would work on school there, that one day a week, but never the rest of the week. 

(Side note - my mom is the kind of lady who posts everything about her life on Facebook. She’s also the kind of person who is ALWAYS sick.)

Fast forward a few years and non-stop begging of my parents to let me get back into public school, I’ve graduated high school early, moved out on my 18th birthday, worked 50-60+ hours/wk between multiple jobs for two years and I am a week away from moving into a university an hour away as a freshman. 

My 18 year old sister has had no desire to get back into public school. She had a brief moment where she wanted to, for her freshman year, and my mom told her in a fight that “people don’t like people like you.” (My sister listens to heavy metal, pop-punk genre of music and has bright red hair) This terrified my sister and destroyed any shred of self-esteem she held. She now keeps by herself in her room for 18-20 hours of the day and doesn’t talk to anyone in the family. My parents make stupid comments about it but don’t do a thing to help her. She held a couple jobs for a few months and seemed to be on the come-up, but quit them because “she was working too much.” And my parents aren’t pushing her to do a thing so she is currently unemployed with the education of a kindergartener at 18. She is well-written and well spoken but has not been educated in any subject. 

My ten year old sister was doing great, has been in private school/then public school for the last three years. As recently as today, I assumed she was loving her new intermediate school. She told me today she is dropping out of the public school at Christmas break to join her 8 year old and 5 year old sister at a local co-op where they meet once a week. This devastated me. I LOVE my sisters and I don’t believe they are getting any form of education through this. 

From what they tell me, they sing songs to learn each subject and they don’t have any textbooks/workbooks they go through at home. They are supposed to, but the 8 year-old tells me that “mom forgets to do school every day, and that’s ok with me because I don’t like school.”

Obviously my two youngest sisters are too young to understand the damage that this is causing to their lives. I need your help, reddit, because I am at a loss on what to do. I thought my ten year old sister was doing so well in school. She refused to sit down and talk to me about her decision on school, telling me it is “mine and mom’s decision only, not yours.” 

My 18 year old sister has depression, anxiety and little to no social skills. She has no education, and can’t hold down a job. This is the path my three other sisters are taking and my parents are OKAY with this. I just don’t understand. 

We have no other family near us, although it wouldn’t be much help if we did. All of our grandparents know our situation but my mom is so controlling that if they disagree with her on any decision they lose contact to their grandkids for months at a time. 
No one wants to do anything to rock the boat. Their hands are tied. 

I’m a week from moving away into university and my Mamaw told me the best thing I can do is to move, wash my hands of this and just pray for them. But they are my sisters, and I feel so much like I have raised them as much/more as my parents. I don’t want to ruin my future by staying behind, but I don’t want them to not even have a chance of a future. 

I’ve considered contacting authorities but I’m scared of what lies behind opening that can of worms - I couldn’t imagine them taking my sisters away. 
We also live in a state that has no requirements on homeschooling - they don’t have to update the state or take any sort of testing. 

Please help me. I don’t know what to do. 

TL;DR

I am the oldest of 5 and I am concerned about the future and welfare of 4 younger siblings that are being neglected educationally and also emotionally. ",03Dec2018,1
379,"I'm a 17 year old Male 

When I was in the 8th grade me and some friends, who all went to the same school at the time, made our group of friends. After middle school, I went to a different high school then most of them, most went to the same school, but we still kept in contact through, weirdly enough, a Playstation party. We got online a lot regardless of where we went to school, skip two years later to July of this year. They introduced this girl to the group and it was an instant connection with her, and soon enough she became one of my best friends, and she lives near me, we would talk everyday and tell each other everything (even about her love interest). Which turned out to be one of the guys from the group, and I would try to help her and give her advice with issues she'd have with him. Skip some time later and he was sort of playing her with some other girl and it would break my heart seeing her deal with this, around this time she had invited me to her homecoming dance along with him so it was a weird triangle between us because we all knew what he was doing and I spent the whole night trying to get her to talk to him about what was going on, but seeing as how it was the second time we'd seen each other in person I began to see her in a new way and start to feel strongly about her so pushing her to fix the issue with the guy was excruciatingly painful for me but it was necessary because she's my friend. The dance had ended and they had talked but it was rather inconclusive than helpful, but nonetheless he stopped having contact with the other girl and was all in for a relationship with her, and then we talked about it as we always do and I tried to help her, eventhough I liked her as well but she didn't know that. Skip again a few weeks to as of recently and they're dating, and they really like each other and don't want to mess it up, both their relationship and their friendship because they think it'll make a gap in the group. You see, their worries come from the fact that they aren't good at relationships and are very new to actually trying so they fear that it will push each other away, yet they still very much like each other. Then there's me, the guy who loves this girl very much and wants her to be happy, and as much as it hurts to help with her relationship problems, I still do my best to guide her in the right direction. So my question is should I try to get over her and move on? Because I think about her a lot and I think she is the greatest person I've ever met and one of my best friends, but I can't keep going on being hung up on her.

380,"I know this is long but I need to get this out.

So I’ve been struggling with this heavily for a while now. I’m 19M and have always been a really good kid my entire life out of compulsion. Home life was always unpredictable in the worst ways and I knew if I did bad in school or got in too much trouble I would become a target for my parents. I developed some OCD type symptoms over this, and anything I couldn’t 100% control/trust gave me massive anxiety so I’d just avoid it. 

This trickled down into relationships, I never dated all through grade school. It was just too scary and confusing to me, I didn’t understand how they worked and I didn’t find girls that great to be around to the point where I’d want to date them. This became an issue though because (not trying to seem egotistical) I’m kinda attractive according to other people so I get hit on with relative frequency. I’m introverted and don’t go out much but that doesn’t stop random girls from approaching me literally off the street. I’ve been catcalled, I’ve had my friend’s Mom drunkenly flirt and harass me, I’ve had a girl cry and get angry with me at a party because I wouldn’t hook up with her, and the list can go on.

I never asked for this attention and while it’s nice sometimes a lot of the experiences have been very negative and made very cautious of women. Again, my family life was also a little fucked and that didn’t help with my view of relationships at all and gave me even more problems when my parents divorced. I was never close with a girl until freshman year of college when a girl approached me after a lecture and asked me out. She was my first kiss and the first person I ever allowed to touch me, I don’t mean sexually I mean just hold me. I’ve always been extremely afraid of closeness and people physically touching me to the point that my friends started telling me it was weird. 

When she held me I didn’t know how to react and just laid still, she had to tell me what to do because I was so locked up. We ended up breaking up mainly because I did not want to have sex with her, I had this deep fear of it for some reason. Like it actually made me start freaking out one day and I knew I couldn’t go through with it so I just broke things off. 


It just seems that I can’t accept people’s affection for me. Recently another girl liked me and I just couldn’t handle it, the same nerves and anxiety came back really hard. Every time I just push these people away and feel scared and uncomfortable by their advances. I don’t know what is causing this, I want a relationship but seem incapable of letting anyone in. What should I do here, is it time for therapy?",03Dec2018,1
381,"Tl;dr at the bottom
I know the title may seem vague, but I'll elaborate shortly. For background: I am 21 years old and still live with my mother, but I am saving up to hopefully move out next year.

When I say I can't talk to my mom about anything I really mean it: for example I can't talk to her about any of my problems, she always just says that she can't help me and what do I even expect from her?

I've outright told her multiple times that I just need emotional support sometimes and for her to tell me that everything is gonna be okay. Apparently that's asking too much and she just says that she can't help.

She also doesn't take me seriously when I confide in her. When I was 13 I was suffering from depression and was suicidal (yes, I did eventually get a diagnosis that confirmed this). When I first told her about those feelings she just brushed me off and continued as if nothing had happened. I tried several more times, but always with the same result. Because I couldn't deal with the situation anymore and had no one else to talk to I went to the school therapist (I had no other options) in 'secret' for like 6 months. (I didn't hide it, she just never asked how I was doing and if I was getting help) 
After that I told my mom that I was seeing that therapist (the therapist suggested it) and she got pissed and sad because I didn't talk to her about my feelings and instead went to some stranger to help me... 

I also can't talk to her about mundane, everyday type of stuff. I'll tell her about my day, and she'll literally continue reading her book or playing a game on her computer without acknowledging me once. 
And it's not like I'm always interrupting her rare personal time, she does this all day long. 
She doesn't even respond when I ask her a direct question. It's like talking to a particularly unresponsive wall. 

This may sound weird, so here's an example to illustrate what I mean:
*I just finish telling her a story about something funny or frustrating that happend to me that day, she hasn't looked at me yet even once*
Me: soooo, that's crazy, right? 
Her: ... 
Me: I mean, why would anyone even do that? 
Her: ... 
Me: *getting frustrated* helloooo, are you listening? 
Her: ... 
Me: ?? 
Her: yeah, but what am I supposed to tell you? 

Oh, i don't know, literally ANYTHING??!?

This is not an exaggeration, this is a daily occurence (and has been one for literal years) and it's driving me insane.

It's like she doesn't know (or just isn't interested in) how to have a conversation with me.
I'm a big believer in talking about your problems and trying to overcome them, but every time I try, somehow a fight breaks out.

She doesn't seem to understand what my problem even is, although I've told her hundreds of times (again, no exaggeration)

She just says: oh, don't be like that, you always blow everything wayyy out of proportion.

I admit that I sometimes do get pretty frustrated with her, but I still feel like my criticism is valid? Or am I just insane?

I'm at the end of my rope and don't know how to deal with this anymore, everyday is more maddening than the other and I don't know why I even keep trying.

Is there anyone who was in a similar situation and might be able to help me? Or am I in the wrong and should change my outlook on the situation?

Of course, there's a lot more to the relationship between me and her (and not all of it is bad), but this is already too long and I feel like what I described is one of our core problems and affects every other probelm we have (because we can't efficiently talk about them) . However, if there are any questions I can clarify, I know the text is probably a bit confusing.

I’ve procrastinated even more than I normally do and forgotten way more assignments then I used to. In terms of seeking help, I think of been hiding it really well, (which I know isn’t a good thing) to the point where my parents, who are very depression aware only recently (to my knowledge) figures out I was depressed and it isn’t hormones. Maybe two months ago.
Side note: depression runs in both sides of family
Also I definitely have suicidal ideation to the point where it feels normal. I used to think about death a lot “philosophically” so the transition was seamless and unnoticed by me. I go to a small school and it’s not like I don’t have friends (though my best friend before fell out with me in eighth grade). In terms of counter depressants (which aren’t working) I bike 9 miles round trip to get to school (though less recently because rain and it gets dark quickly so my parents don’t like it) and live in a suburban area with a lot of trees and a common deer/rabbit. My mom is trying to get me to go to the gym for more exercise and to help with my abysmal posture, but now that I think about it it might be for depression.

397,"TL;DR If I get pregnant from the guy my boyfriend and I are having threesomes with, we decided we are not telling him so I can get an abortion without his knowledge, but that doesn't feel right, what should I do? 


So, backstory. 
On April of this year, my boyfriend got the vasectomy cause long ago we decided we don't want kids (this is regardless of if we stay together forever or not. I knew I didn't wanted kids way before meeting him, and he just hates kids so he is not having them with anyone). 
However, I got pregnant, discovered it on July 15th, and had an abortion. This made us decide that I had to start taking the pill so we wouldn't have to go through that ever again. 
Anyway, a couple months ago we started having threesomes with this guy, he is healthy and so are we, so we thought it was okay to not use condoms with him since I'm on the pill anyway. 
Now, the thing is, even if I'm taking the pill correctly, pregnancy is still possible cause no method is perfect. 
I talked to my boyfriend about that possibility, and after discussing it a little bit, we got to the conclusion that, if I get pregnant, we are not gonna tell the other guy about it, and I'm getting an abortion without his knowledge. 
This doesn't feel right for me, and I think he has the right to know if he knocks me up, but the possibility that he would want to keep the baby makes me want to not tell him. 
Maybe I could talk with him about this issue and ask him if he would want to know if I get pregnant at some point in the first place, but I don't want to freak him out or something. 
All of this dilemma has no point if I never get pregnant I guess, but it's a possibility, so I would like to have a sort of ""plan"" if it happens. ",03Dec2018,1

400,"Hi reddit, so I’m going to try to sum all of this up together as easy as I can, so basically I started working a 2nd job about 3-4 weeks ago, so of course, I handed availability to both. I thought things were going good, both were on the same page... but then the 2nd availability was, “lost” by my 1st job managers....??? They blamed me for it... even though I wrote it and put it in their manager notepad..?? So here’s where I’m being backed into a corner by 4-5 managers blaming me for it... but I gave them everything and I thought everything was going smoothly. 
But.. I found out that my 2nd job got their schedule done/posted a day right before my 1st job posts theirs(I was not aware of this until a coworker brought this to light) 

So it came to my attention about nearly.. 3 weeks ago, my name had been removed from the schedule at my 1st job :\ . I was worried and thought I did something wrong.. I had never called out, never called out sick, never late, never missed a shift ever, and I came in when called. I am pretty sad and nervous about this. 
3 weeks still going, my name has been removed from the schedule.... so I talked to 4 managers and none of them had any idea what I was talking about or what to do??? So pretty much I’m getting the run around... so last week I gave my availability to my 1st job once again, and the manager who does the schedule said, “okay, I’ll take a look at the schedule.” So.. feeling hopeful, I waited and the schedule was posted and I was still off....

404," I'm 25M, and my girlfriend is 23F. We got together a year ago and we have been tight on money. We've been able to live fine, but we have limited goods such as a ""great"" TV or computer. We live fine, with OK Internet/TV and we're happy. But my girlfriend really wanted a Nintendo Switch, but we didn't have the money. Well we DID, but we didn't want to spend it on a game console. I told her not to buy it. But my GF had a very good ""plan"" to get it for free AND not let me know about it.

&amp;#x200B;

She created a fake Amazon account in our neighbors name, using his credit card info. Our neighbor is 65, and she offered to clean/vacumm for him. While she was ""cleaning"" she stole his wallet, took a picture of the CC, then put it back. Then she ordered the Switch in his name, to his address. A few days later a package came addressed to him at his house that looked like a Switch box, and she stole it. The neighbor was in town when it came, so he couldn't take that package. I believe UPS or USPS delivered it. She brought it home and opened and hid it in the basement.

&amp;#x200B;

Then she complained to Amazon that the package never came to the neighbor's house, and they refunded her money, hardly no questions asked. She basically shoplifted. Amazon didn't say they would investigate, but I really don't believe them; this seems like a very rare thing to happen, to have a package not be delivered.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today, I found the Switch last night, asked my GF why she didn't listen to me, and she told me everything about what she did . She also stole a $60 SD card, meaning she stole over $300 in goods making it a felony. I've froze my CC, changed all my passwords, and I'm going to break up with a felon. Should I get a lawyer before telling my neighbor?",03Dec2018,1
405,"Using throwaway as some family knows my normal account.

TL;DR - I have no idea what to do. I've realized I have no hobbies (other than video games rarely), used to write but my brain just won't work anymore when I try. I'm the only one working due to recently having a daughter and childcare being too expensive for my wife to work. House is often a cluttered mess which adds to stress. Work 12/hrs a day and schedule that changes every week so a second job isn't in the cards. Left with maybe 50 dollars every 2 weeks that isn't budgeted for keeping our bills barely paid. Debt due to stupid money decisions (total of $76,000 in debt if you include the two vehicles. This doesn't include the mortgage). Mind won't stop with anxiety being in this situation and seemingly no way to leave it. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do, how do I stop my anxiety and stress? How do I pay back all of this debt with no money to make a dent into it other than minimum payments most of the time? How do I make more money, because seemingly that's my only option (wife has tried opening a dayhome to bring in extra income but she's had no bites)? How do I find a hobby between my long hours, helping with my daughter and keeping the house remotely clean?

407,"My girlfriend and I have been together 2 years now. We lived together from the start of dating up until a month ago, when we moved states and she moved back with her mom who’s an hour from me until she finds a job in our new town. 

Right before we moved, her guy best friend from high school got cheated on by his gf and was in a bad place. My gf started texting him to try and liven him up. 

I see my girlfriend every weekend now and they are constantly texting still. My girlfriend caught on to the fact that I was weirded out by it, because I kept looking at her phone when it buzzed and it was always him, so she stopped (just until she left I’m sure). She’s asked me if it bothers me before but that was at the start and I was like “No, help your friend out, that’s important.” 

Some of the messages I’ve seen are “what are you up to today, lady” and stuff like “considering going to a show tonight but not sure if I should.” Seems relatively harmless. 

They live in separate states, like 12 hours away so I know they’re not hanging out or doing anything weird but should I be concerned about the constant contact? I have a girl best friend too but I’d never keep a running month conversation with her out of fear it would bother my girlfriend.

408,"I'm an intellectual, information junkie who can't figure out what to do for money. Specifically, I'm an aspiring polymath (one who is knowledgeable in a great many areas). I feel my immediate passion is listening to people, and helping them organize and fix their life (give advice, basically).

I'm well versed in: logic (formal and otherwise), mathematics, English, the internet, philosophy, computer science (moderate), Python development, YouTube, science, explaining different subjects, and particularly, abstract reasoning/analogies/conceptual linking (linking different ideas conceptually, like explaining how they're related (and even more skills).

As someone who's currently broke and needs money within 2 weeks, I need some help.

My family and the norms of society have tried to push me into the ""regular"" job market. In the past, I have been very combative with that idea. Not because I couldn't, but because it doesn't seem fitting to me at all, so I've never worked a job like that. I'm particularly upset because I feel much of my potential has been squandered because no one around me had tried to help give me direction  beyond, ""Have you got a job yet? There's tons of jobs out there."" I know I shouldn't blame other people for my issues, but it's not my fault. I've had ideas I've been persuing ideas, I've been improving myself. Only recently so I have a better understanding of the true nature of my ideas, only to realize that I don't have all of the necessary skills or resources to execute them. I've come to find out that I'm a conceptual person -- I'm not the type that's very good at taking ideas and making them reality, particularly because I don't have connections, money, resources, or very good social skills. I've also only come to realize that I really should be in therapy, something that no one in my family had realized (somehow). Considering how fucked up my mom is, I don't see how it wasn't obvious to them.

It seems like the market for my skills is very niche and may not exist at all in my set of opportunities. I have applied for some local jobs, but nothing. I should've applied sooner, but could've, should've, would've, I can't change the past, so I have to deal with the situation as it exists now.

As it exists now, since my mom lost her paper route (I used to help her with it) because no one in the family could lend her a vehicle for a few days when hers broke down (they felt that she shouldn't be doing it anymore). They finally got the car fixed, but because they weren't too worried about it, the week or so of leniency given to her by the paper office gave her didn't matter (even though it turned out that the car could've been fixed in no time if it weren't for the lazy diagnosis of the problem in the first place. So now, my mom has no job because the family had other plans for her life, the family is trying to get her veterans disability, and I'm expected to get a job and make $250 in less than 2 weeks to pay the bills. Granted, I had a bit more time to begin with, but trying not to sqander that has been really difficult considering my problems, the stress, and no one in the family offering to help me that much. They expect me to just do everything myself, which is so obviously contrary to how humans to things in general.


My immediate ideas for income have been lackluster so far. I signed up on Fiverr and haven't gotten much. I have thought of going with an odd job/advice thing (like for family and friends and that type of thing), but everyone's like, ""That's not stable. You need a stable job."" It's like, no, what I need RIGHT NOW is $250 in less than 2 weeks to pay the bills, THEN I can try to worry about a stable paycheck. Being too conflicted between what the family wants me to do and what I think I should do has led me to get hardly anything done.

My REAL immediate idea for profit is diversification: seek MANY paths of profit, but I can hardly do that alone to do it well. Logically, realistically, and statistically, that seems to be the best route, but not for me alone, and I don't have funds to pay others to help, nor anyone willing to devote their time to help me.

(My Uncle set up a GoFundMe page, but I haven't heard anything more about it.)

So what do I do? Do I try to seek out odd jobs I can do for the family, do I try to do some kind of advice thing over the internet, do I try to apply for a credit card or loan or something? I have a large set of skills, only I'm not particularly an expert of any one thing: I'm more of an expert of the ""everything of things"". What should I do?",03Dec2018,1

412,"First of all sorry for any grammar errors i’m not particularly the greatest at writing.

Hey everyone, this is my first time on this sub and i’ve gotten myself stuck in a dilemma.
I have been up all night trying to decide whether or not i should change careers. I somewhat feel like i have somewhat made a decision but it keeps daunting on me that i might be making a mistake that i will be regretting in the future.

I am currently working as a 1st year apprentice tradie (blue collar job) in a field id rather not tell as im worried my boss and/or his relatives find this as it is quite obvious im talking about him.

I have been working with my boss for about a year now but i have been in the field for over 2 and a half years. I have only started studying in the field this year since july but can already do the job with my eyes closed. It is a physically daunting job, requiring me to carry machines and equipment up to 80kg without any lifting aids, and i usually dont get much help as it is only me and my boss.

 I am only in my early 20s and i already have a huge scar across my face from being given a faulty core hole driller to use on top of a ladder (no clutch causing it to lock and throw me off the ladder landing face first onto the ground). Also when the accident happened he wasnt insured so he dropped me off at the hospital and made me remove my company shirt and wear one of his spare singlets so he would not get investigated. He basically dropped me off a street before the hospital with blood pouring down my face before he drove back to continue the job (i had to get stitches across my face). When he picked me up he guilt tripped me into coming into work the next day by telling me how he really needed someone to help him and he couldnt afford to pay the $500/day to hire someone else (he pays me roughly $120 a day after tax) promising me i wouldn’t be doing anything but passing him tools (lie). Since working with him i have a bad right knee so it hurts to squat somedays and a torn shoulder muscle. When i injured my shoulder i was in a sling for 6 weeks and during those 6 weeks he would call me everyday (EVERY FUCKING DAY) to ask me if i could come in and help out (I WAS IN A SLING) and i could just help carry tools back and forth from the van with one arm. He’d constantly random facetime me to make sure i was actually in a sling too. He’d constantly tell me how he is dying without me and hes struggling so hard having to pay the other guy 500/day but he is always telling me about the large amounts of money he’d be making (boss is a big mouth) and how he managed to almost pay off his mortgage within the year i worked with him (started his company about 2 months before i was hired). 

Some days i get along fine with him but he’d constantly put the blame on me whenever he’d do something wrong. He’d tell the customer i was the reason why something bad happened and when i ask him why he says its because i’m the apprentice and that i’m allowed to make mistakes and the customer would not get as mad. He’d constantly make me the butt of the jokes and would always pronounce my last name incorrectly even though i’ve told him i find it disrespectful and very hurtful and i’ve grown up with kids doing that to me throughout school. He stopped doing it and made an announcement to the whole job site that i get “mad” when they say my last name wrong even though its just him. That lasted about 2 weeks before he started to say it again. 

When he first hired me ‘on the books’ he kept telling me how im so lucky to be getting paid as much as i am (17/hr) and not to tell the other students in my class as i would make them jealous.

I did it anyway. And i found out i was getting paid the second least out of everyone in my class (class of 18). I also found out that all the other students are merely standing back and watching their tradesmen work as their bosses do not allow them to go near the machines or use tools as they want them to observe and learn first. (I understand i have more experience but i dont find it fair that they get paid more)

Every morning i have to be at his house at 5:45am but i don’t get paid until 7am because “we dont start get to the job and start working til 7”. Even if i get to his house at 5:50 he considers me late and scolds me. I live about 30 minutes from his house so i usually have to wake up at around 4:30. We get back to his house at around 6pm roughly but i stop getting paid at 3:30 because “thats when we leave the job and im no longer working” (we travel in his work van) i usually get home at around 6:30 or later depending on peak hour traffic. I almost forgot to mention that he usually calls me at around 8-9pm to talk about the next day/weeks job on the phone for roughly 20-30 minutes while i am trying to train at the gym with what little time i have left.

I am exhausted almost everyday yet he still wants more and more. The only thing keeping me going is knowing that when i finish the course (3 more years) i will become qualified and then i will be making the big bucks. But i dont know if i can physically and mentally put up with it anymore. Also it is a job i can do quite easily.

I dont know whether or not i should just cop it on the chin and stick it out for another 3 more years or if i should try and find another job field thats less straining on my body. (Study something and probably get an office job)

I could ask for a payrise but i feel he will start treating me worse and work me harder so he can get “his moneys worth” out of me

I just need some advice as i dont want to make such a big decision as i feel i will regret whichever choice i make without being 100% on my decision

Body is slowly giving up on me

414,"About two months ago, I started a temp job at a company where I subbed for one of their associates. Out of nowhere, the person I was subbing for came back, hence I was no longer needed. The manager, however, said he really liked my work and asked me to stay for a week or two. Come to find out, the reason why he wanted me to stay is because the person I'm subbing might flake out again in a month or two. On top of that, he also claims that he MIGHT have a permanent job offer  for me around the time.

Now I can't decide if I want to stay based on his claims or go to find more opportunities (via the temp agency).

I want to leave because: a) I had no intention of staying at this company, I really just needed the money and the experience, b) I want to see what other companies are like, c) they have nothing for me to do so I just sit around killing time.

I'm tempted to stay because l: a) I COULD get a permanent job out of this, b) There's no guarantee that the temp agency could find me something new, and c) I could use the money.

I should also add that the manager said he doesn't mind me going to seek other temp opportunities. If anything, he asked for my contact info in case I need to sub for them again or if the job opens up.

418,"My first post here. Thank you for reading this.

  
So, my cousin lost her husband about a week ago, he died from some sort of alcohol related health problems(probably chronic pancreatitis,  also liver cirrhosis cannot be excluded from the list ). I learned it today from her brother. 

Both of them are in their mid 30s and coming from a poor background, we're talking the Eastern Europe here, so I really mean poor background. She's always been stay at home mom ever since they married while he had been the only breadwinner, periodically working abroad for several months.  Those temporary jobs, mostly in construction and logging, put heavy load on his body, and he was trying to cope with help of alcohol, and crossed the point of no return. It's needless to say they have been struggling to make ends meet. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, past the initial shock phase(nobody saw it coming, it came from a clear blue sky) the depression kicked in. The part of it is that her husband's family blames her for his death. Old typical ""if it wasn't for you..."". Almost forgot to mention... she lost her parents in her early teens and has no close relatives except her brother who is dirt poor. AFAIK no close friends as well. Means little to no support in the disastrous situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Why 10 kids? Probably it was their favorite number, solid,and round, and nice... I've no clue, there should've been many factors to contribute to this and I'm not here to conduct a debate/investigation. Laura(let's call her Laura) currently receives only about $600-700 from the state, it's barely enough to buy the basic food and pay bills(yes, life is cheap here in Eastern Europe. Yet not that cheap as one could imagine). I'm glad that they at least have roof over their heads, they live in small 2 bedroom house and don't have to pay rent, only utilities.  And I would love to read your thoughts on how I can alleviate the situation.  


We haven't talked for a year and we live about 500 miles apart. Soon I'll be travelling to Laura's region and I consider to meet her in person. Just I've no idea how to behave and what to say. On top of that I'm broke AF, recently decided to make a career change, left my job and still in the middle of ongoing attempt to shift. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hesitate to give her a call since I am not in the position to help financially. On the other hand, I understand that the power of kind and supportive words beats all the money on Earth. Just not sure how to wrap it up, never been in such circumstances. Other than that, I may try to start a crowdfunding campaign - in this case I will have to figure out how to avoid tons of people's judgments. It's certain to me that family planning should not be ignored/overlooked. At the same time,  nobody would dare to blame kids on this. 

&amp;#x200B;

What bothers me the most is the possibility of the worst. I've heard about a couple of stories when women took their lives in similar situation.

Then I went through a tough time mental health wise due to a combination of a terrible breakup, death in the family, and workaholic breakdown. Spend a couple of months mostly crying in my bed. I noticed at the time that my sense of humor and other exciting qualities about myself were pretty much gone but I figured I should not be too hard on myself. I was miserable so I would clearly not be funny. It would surely come back as I got better, right?

This was all two years ago. I now lead a normal life with work and friends again. My emotional state is as it was before all this. I am by all accounts fine and have been for a long time (a year at least). Yet, my sense of humor has not come back.

I am now just the dullest, most humorless person I know (and I say this not in a self-hating way, but completely matter-of-factly). I just can't seem to get myself back into that humorous state of mind and seem to take everything too seriously even when I try not to. I can't even handle the easy, obvious jokes that waiters or salespeople sometimes make. My timing is completely off as well. Any joke I try to make just comes off awkward and embarassing. 

Being quick and humorous was a big part of my identity I feel like myself now. I don't know how to teach myself to be funny again, as humor and wit is just something I used to take for granted and never thought about.

We would sometimes go out to buy stuff or to eat but it’s always the three of us: me, my mom, and my sister. At home we also never really interacted that much, my sister is not the most friendly of people to interact with and when my mom was out, she would lock us in our rooms so couldn’t sneak out or anything.

Last year, I realized that college was just right around the corner and know that this would really be my first time actually interacting with a lot of people freely. I need to start learning on actually interacting with people because based on what I know, college has a very interactive environment. I practiced on socializing with tips I got from the internet. I watched those tutorials you see on YouTube and read a lot from articles. I was confident. I was going to get a fresh start because everybody’s new here. Everybody would be looking for new friends. It was going to be great.

It’s dead week and I still haven’t made any friends yet. We had a student orientation but I didn’t really connected with anybody. Student orientations are usually a hit or miss and it was still very early on in the semester so I told myself, “College hasn’t even started yet. Don’t worry, you’ll have more opportunities throughout the semester.” I went to call-outs and joined clubs which I was genuinely interested in joining. I went to club meetings. But it feels as if people just don’t want to be near me. We have the same interests, otherwise we wouldn’t be joining this club and friendships are formed with people with similar interests. Whenever I talk to people, they would be friendly to me at first but then after that they would just not talk to me. I see a lot of people in class already having formed their own friend groups and such. I just sit in class alone. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I was thinking of joining a frat next semester at first as it really helps you out if you want to make friends but let’s be realistic, if I can’t socialize with anybody how is a frat going to help you. I just don’t know what to do.",03Dec2018,1
430,"I’ve been with my fiancé for 6 years. We got engaged earlier this year and have a child together. We went out to celebrate my sisters birthday and had a great time and got really drunk. My sister was the drunkest of us all and ended up staying with her friend and we were taking care of her personal items like her phone and purse. We went back home and i was in bed and my fiancé was in the living room. I called his name multiple times so he could come to bed and each time he just groaned like if he was asleep. I got up and saw him laying on the couch scrolling and then he saw me and immediately locked the phone and mumbled “I think I have your sisters phone.” I was like what? I unlocked her phone and the first thing that popped up was her pictures. I was livid. He swore up and down it wasn’t what it looked like. I was mad because it was an invasion of her privacy and it was my sister. 

We end up going to bed. For some reason, I can’t fall asleep. I’m tossing and turning. My fiancé woke up and wanted to have sex but I was still upset and didn’t want to do that. He kept asking and begging and kept kissing me but I just couldn’t. He ends up leaving me alone. I pretend to fall asleep and feel him reaching to grab something from the nightstand and I see the room illuminate from a phone. I turn around and the room goes black again. I lay there pretending to be asleep and he gets up and goes to the restroom. I look and see he grabbed my sisters phone AGAIN from the nightstand. I wait a while. I tip toe to the bathroom and fling the door open and saw him once again scrolling through my sisters pictures. He was on the toilet and about ready to stroke his dick. His pathetic lie was he was looking out for her because a guy messaged her which is not any of his business. I recorded the whole ordeal so he couldn’t lie and say that never happened. 

I am beyond heartbroken and saddened by this. More so because it’s my sister. He not only invaded my sisters privacy but I feel like he ruined our family. She comes over all the time and can’t help but feel he’s been into her or something. He and I talked about it the next morning and he is very regretful and embarrassed and is aware that he fucked up. 

I’m so confused and have no idea what to do anymore. I feel as if he had looked at other pics of girls it wouldn’t have been so bad but this was my sister and he did it not once but twice. I just don’t see how this situation could be remedied. 

TL;DR 
Caught my fiancé looking at my sisters pictures twice and lied about it. I feel as if he has been into her for a while and don’t know how to handle the situation.",03Dec2018,1
431,"Quick backstory: At the beginning of the year, my husband moved 1400 miles away to start a new career for a better life for us and our son. Everything was going great, so in August, we sold our home and moved away with him to be a more solid family again.

Now, three months after the move, I am still miserable living away from my family and want to move back to my home state. When I moved, I gave up my job of 11 years, my friends, all of my family, and the only life I’ve ever known. In our new town, it takes me two hours one way to get to any sort of civilization and there’s nothing in this town for my son and I to do.  The weather is a total flip from what we’re used to and spending time outdoors is rare, so my son is stuck inside playing with toys most of the time. 

After visiting my family for the holiday, I realized what I miss and want to go back. I have a chance to take my old job back and resume a somewhat normal life for my son and I. But now I’m torn. I don’t want to leave my husband alone, but he did the same thing to us when he up and moved for his new job. I don’t want to be miserable here anymore either. 

I go back and forth in my mind on what to do and even when I’m solid on my decision, I end up changing my mind.

So my boyfriend and i live in florida and have been looking for a home to rent for a while now. we finally found one with a good price and in our desired area after months of looking, so we jumped on it wanting to get it before anyone else did. 
i foolish did not read the reviews for this ‘business’ until after we submitted the 150 dollar application fee.
The man we spoke to said if you are approved, it will go toward your rent which made it sound really great. 
He has said it will 3 to 5 business days until they get back with me saying if i’m approved or not and it’s been about one day. 
the rent price for the house online also went up but he advised me that was the new price after the remodel they did, and our original price would be honored in the event that we are accepted. but i’ve now read the online reviews about how they taken many deposit fees, and either never get back with you or answer when you call them, or they say you’re not approved without every inquiry to your credit, rental history, etc, or just refuse to give you a reason.
money is tight right now but we hoped it would be worth it to rent this home.
everyone says it’s a scam, and i’m just trying to get behind this as soon as possible.
is there anything i can do if they don’t get back with me? or if i feel they’ve just denied me to continue taking people’s money??

440,"I will graduate in pharmaceutical science next year. I was not a top-student, but had next to no problems succeeding my exams. Which makes me a bit ashamed to admit I absolutely hated 70% of all classes. The internship I am completing right now is dreadful aswell. I have to drag myself to work every morning, where I literally have to wait and beg for work being handed to me, like, every single day. The lack of challenges has made me think about what I want for the future...
Right now, I don't feel ready to enter the job market yet. I would want to study for another couple of years, and that is where I struggle.
On one hand, I would like to perfectionate my scientific knowledge, learn about skin absorption mechanisms, the procedures and regulations to fabricate make-up and creams,..... But I do have a feeling a job in a pharmaceutical domain will leave me with a bore/burn-out within a year.
On the other hand... Costumes are my LIFE. I do reenactment, I only watch costume movies. I go to museums, trying to guess the period of the furnitures and portraits, I photograph people in edwardian/victorian setting, I wear early 20th century clothing, and I want to decorate my house as periodically accurate (1940s) as possible.

442,"First-time poster and not a native speaker here, please excuse any mistakes. Also posting from mobile.

Long story short, my little brother switched school and his new class does not accept him very well, mainly because he's new to an already existing class and kids in his age (~13 y) seem to judge people by the clothes they are wearing and the gadgets they own.
It's been a few months now and he only has some friends of his old class left but they are drifting apart.

He is sad and desperate to be accepted, also he's asking our parents to buy him stuff hoping he will get accepted and find new friends. Our family can't afford to just buy him a new pair of Nikes or a PS4. Also we agree that buying stuff would not solve the problem anyway.
I'm trying to explain and show him that it is not about the clothing and gadgets and that he should stop trying to impress his classmates and do his own thing, so the kids will hopefully accept him for who he is.

What can I as a big brother do to help him in this situation and support his confidence?",03Dec2018,1
443,"A little background on me: I started my career as an applied behavior analysis therapist (ABA) and independent contractor from ages 18-24. I got my bachelor's in psychology at 22 and like most psych majors ended up getting my alternative certification in special education. I worked in the school setting for 10 years and then got my M.Ed. and certificate as an educational diagnostician. I've worked as a diagnostician for almost 5 years, the last two years in the clinic setting at a well-known center for learning disorders. Commute &amp; stress landed me in the freelancing arena and I'm now planning my next move. 

 

I sent my info out for contract work to a few private practices and have met with a few who've expressed interest in my becoming a part of their practice... I'm torn between these two offers:

 

Offer 1 is a private practice with a well-rounded multidisciplinary team- psychologists, BCBAs, LPCs... they also have direct therapists and a solid front office. This practice has offered me a consultant position with as much flexibility as I want, a flat rate for established office hours with additional compensation for complex evaluations, and paid medical/other benefits. I'm already working with a non-profit to provide affordable academic evaluations to home school families, so this position would allow me to continue that without having to adjust or reduce my work with them (this is a heart project for me.. something I want to continue and grow). This practice has recently added a nurse practitioner and are talking with pediatricians. Most exciting of all, it would allow me to earn a board certification in behavior analysis (BCBA) and they are in the process of starting a school for students with learning differences which they would like me to head up. This office is 3 minutes from my house (not exaggerating. I could walk or bike to work).

 

Offer 1 TL;DR: flexibility, great compensation, benefits, freedom to pursue my pull to support an underserved community, paid for certification (BCBA), and the opportunity to have a hand in building a school. Plus, biking/walking to work and serving my immediate community.

 

Offer 2 is also a private practice with specialization in adult neuropsych. She wants to add educational services for children and is interested in expanding to the second floor of her current location. She wants me to head up that initiative and is willing to share ownership of the education wing with me (50/50). I would still perform evaluations and would get to design instructional/intervention offerings. She's very flexible and willing to pursue most of my recommendations and ideas. She wants me to sign on as an employee now and is waiting my confirmation to seal the deal on the office space above her to be finished by February 2019. At that point, after training in other areas, my role would shift to the education center as the director/co-owner and my compensation would increase. She is interested in collaborating with the non-profit I've been working with and possibly offering evaluations and support beyond the academic services I already offer (mental health, anxiety, adhd, etc..). Her office is 13 minutes from my house. 

 

Offer 2 TL;DR: Potential to have ownership in an educational services business, great benefits, exposure to adult evaluations, weekly neuropsych training, also flexible. I would be completely new to the ownership aspect of it and really need help figuring out what I need to be asking about how that will work.

   
 Work/life priorities:

\-Flexibility to be a human mother and wife- having worked in the school setting (12 hour and beyond work days) and clinic setting (40 + minute commute, pile-on work flow), this is key for me. I'm not idealizing some sort of slacker work week here, but anyone is going to have appointments, events, tasks that will pile up if not addressed. I refuse to believe I can't share my gifts and be present to my family- maybe someday I'll look back and roll my eyes at myself, but for now that's where I'm at. I will make this work :) 

\-Earn to continue our financial independence plan (O1 would create more assured income sooner; O2 would provide a solid salary at first and more once the education side gains momentum)

\-Work in an environment that allows me to pursue my creative interests, offers access to a variety of learning opportunities, encourages growth, and is open to new ideas. Both seem to be very excited about my initiatives.. but, in truth, I don't know these people well and reality could look a lot different in this arena. 

   
Looking forward to your responses! Thank you for taking the time to help us sort this out :) ",03Dec2018,1
444,"So a while ago I found out the day before the application was due that a place had an internship opportunity at a organization I’m really interested in. It’s a 4 week program over holiday break that would turn into a job after I graduated.

I know I was selfish in this move and going after this without thinking of us or our plans but now that I’ve accepted the position can I go back? Will I put a black mark on my name in the Nursing world? But I still have a semester left before I even graduate, will it really tarnish me that much?

447," 

For the past year I've been begging my mom to un-enroll me from this awful online school but she won't do it. For whatever reason she thinks it's a good idea to also continuously sign me up for extra work then not tell me until a day before, like for instance she just told me that last week she signed me up to take what's basically a beta test for the school to see how students do with this new ""curriculum"" (this is about the 4th one I've had to do this year because she keeps signing me up for it) and I have to do it tomorrow, then on Wednesday I have to go to a place 45 minutes away for standardized testing which I knew nothing about until today.  


She doesn't listen to anything I tell her about this school and then gets onto me when something goes wrong even when it's beyond my control. The whole site is just a huge buggy mess half the time and the teachers seem to be barely qualified for their job half the time. Don't they say you have to know the subject 3 times over to be able to teach it, or something like that? I'm pretty sure my anthropology teacher just gets half her ""knowledge"" off of Wikipedia. Actually, I could probably learn more from Wikipedia than I could from her. For an online school it surprises me that most of them barely even know how to work a computer. Their curriculum is also terrible. I'm failing to see what I learn from reading The Great Gatsby three years in a row. In the past three school years I've been using this online school, I've only had one teacher I can say was good and genuinely taught me something.

&amp;#x200B;

I also had to make an account for something on a website of theirs but the account had to be verified by them and after a week it still hadn't been verified, so I contacted the staff and they told me they were waiting on administration, so I was like whatever, I'll just wait. I email them again a week later to see what's up and they say the same thing again. This went on for two and a half months until they told me to stop emailing them about it. I still don't have the account verified by the way, so I physically cannot proceed with that curriculum. But back onto the buggy mess thing, apparently half my attendance for my English class hasn't been accounted for, for whatever reason. Turned in all the work and everything, but it doesn't matter. I now have a truancy flag and have to attend extra sessions, which is complete bullshit. This is my senior year and I feel like I'm just being completely screwed over. With how things are escalating day by day I doubt I'm going to be to get my diploma.

Ive flirted with the idea before, and have gotten a class 1 medical in the past just to see if im able, and i am.

&amp;#x200B;

Thats the meat and potatoes of things, let me explain the reasoning behind all of this. My lack of going to class or doing any of the work happened because of immense negativity and pressure from my wife. I got married before uni mostly due to pressure from family and people at my church (not the church itself, but the people) to marry young. My wife is too young and immature for this and has been taking it out on me. My first 3 semesters I was doing great, had a GPA of 3.5-ish. After that is when our savings became really low, we had to start taking out loans, and she really let financial pressure affect her. the following semester my grades were all low c's and this semester low F's. she has been such an incredibly negative influence in my life and really brought me down. I stopped going to class and I feel so dumb about it, but I just couldnt handle it. I have 2 jobs right now, might get a third,  take 5 classes a semester, and I do probably 80% of the chores. I can live in these conditions easily, its not at all what stressed me out. it's the negativity and abuse she has given me. I won't go into detail about my marriage but she made life unbearable. I just woke up one day and didnt go to class. havent been since and my grades this semster are down the gutter.

My university's class withdrawal period is over, so i cant withdraw.

My job is exhausting but I make plenty every week, but I have no interest in being at my job more than twice a week because of how hard it is. 

My main hobby is dance, and I recently switched genres and take up to 2 classes a week casually, and sometimes go out social dancing but social dancing is only at night and my nights are actually pretty filled. 

I also volunteer/tutor children once a week in the afternoon. I also have a dog that I hang out with. I cant tell if my mental health issues are keeping me from doing more in what I'm already doing, or if I'm just not doing enough Monday-Friday, but I am sooooooooo unmotivated and lazy outside of evenings and weekends when I'm actually busy. I dont know what to do with myself, I dont really want some boring retail job for extra cash or anything, but I genuinely dont know what I should do to be productive. 

I can't tell if it's a chicken or the egg thing, if I'm feeling lazy and unmotivated because I dont have enough to do, or if i do not have enough to do because i am lazy and unmotivated. Either way, it doesnt feel very good. Alternatively, I get really scared to commit to something that ties me down, like a heavier volunteer load or on site classes. I seem to have an issue with committing, I only pay for drop in dance classes, only signed up to volunteer once a week, I refuse to take college classes that arent mostly or fully online. I genuinely do not know what the hell I should be doing with myself. Most I commit to is therapy the same time every week and volunteering every week. Oh and work friday/saturday. I dont really cook either. I think I am just lazy.

Do I need to be developing more positive qualities or skills? Do I need to be figuring out where I'm lacking in stability or mental discipline? Why do I have such little motivation and discipline?

I know this post is a total mess because I dont even know what I am trying to ask. I also apologize if I come off spoiled, because I know I am lucky to have so much free time and yet I am throwing it all away. I just dont know how to live a healthy positive life or what that should look like. I think I'm too lazy. ",03Dec2018,1
457,So basically me and my boyfriend are going on a cruise to celebrate his birthday and our 1 year anniversary. I have this coworker that turned into one of my really good friend and as soon as I told her about it she jumped on the idea of for some reason going with us. I’ve tried to tell her nicely that I wouldn’t be okay with the idea only because for one her and my bf have never met and this was just supposed to be a little getaway from everyone it’s really our first trip together. Now mind you I’ve already gone on a cruise with her and promised that we’d go just us girls after. Yesterday she sent me a screenshot of the price of the cruise and said “so can I go it’s really cheap?” And I had to finally be a little meaner and say I’m sorry but no And now she’s not responding to my texts am I wrong for this? She’s been known to overstep her boundaries and me and my ex did get into some arguments over her in the past so I’m not sure how to feel ,03Dec2018,1
458,"I will really try to keep this from turning into a wall of text pity party and keeping from holding back tears at work but I think its also best I give as much background as possible for this situation.

Me, (38 Male) randomly got messaged out of the blue by a sweet gal in Japan ( 34 Female) this Feb. after posting last year on The Mixxer, a foreign language exchange website to practice some Japanese as I've always wanted to go there since I was a boy and also have more attracted to Asian women since I can remember.

We quickly went from basic language talking over chat and Skype to developing a relationship within a month and it quickly built it. She is extremely polite, funny, full of laughter, kinky, energetic, open-minded ect...ect.. I suffer from OCD so I was really worried about trying to do a long distance relationship once again after past failures. But this has also always been my dream to meet a lady oversea's and marry her and now it was actually happening! Especially after I had a very bad end of last year with getting laid off during Christmas and needing surgery for my bad carpal tunnel and then I got a new and better job, my surgery done and paid thanks to kindness of former coworkers and now meeting her! Wow! Life is turning around for me!

Fast forward and we both realize in order for us to really determine if this relationship is meant to be or not, we needed to meet and spend time face to face.  Despite my fears, worries and OCD doubts, and some kicking from my sister, I took my first international trip ever to Tokyo to meet her and see Tokyo. Wow! Lifelong dream come true!

She also utterly fell in love with my sisters 4 young daughters and has always asked how my family is doing and loves seeing pictures of my nieces.  She has sent them small gifts over the past several months along with sending me an ""anniversary"" cards and she’s never had a relationship so good and long lasting with other men in the past. At the time of this writing, were going into 10 months.

Except....I was a little... ""shocked"" at how she appeared in person when I first met her at he airport vs all the ""selfie"" shots she had sent me. She was a bit....larger then I imagine, even after all the video sessions we had. I did everything I could to hide my....disappointment and decided to give her a chance and also make the best of such a trip since she was letting me stay her her loft and I have to admit I am not great in the looks department either due to balding and fattening of my body, so my sister said grow the fuck up and giver her a chance.

We had an utterly amazing time together in Japan and I got my childhood dream come true of seeing Japan! The more time I spent with her, the more I really began to ""fall in love"" with her personality, heart and soul and tried to think less of her body and she is very much into healthy natural foods, does lots of Yoga and is into herbs and plants, so she does try to stay healthy and she wanted both of us to be ""healthy"" together.

After the amazing Japan trip, we had a few miscommunications back and forth namely due to language and culture differences which we worked out and kept in touch every day as best we could with texting and video chat when we could despite the 14 hour time difference.

We knew we need more time together, so we split the cost and I had her fly to Seattle just two weeks ago to experience Seattle as she’s only been to San Diego and Hawaii and has been excited to see Seattle and be with me and my cat as she understand I am very unsure about having kids and she understands that and has stated she respects my decision and just wants to be with me.

We had an utterly amazing time the week she was here. It was a dream come true showing her a whole new world and laughing and loving our exploring of Seattle together, she got to meet most of my family and she brought gifts for nearly everyone as in Japan, it’s a sign of wanting to show ""Good face"" and acceptance into a new family. Everyone utterly loved her including my nieces, she loved playing with them and they have loved the gifts she brings. She was definitely ""accepted"" by my family.  However, I still was ""struggling"" with her larger body size and I was doing the absolute best I could to overlook it as I do utterly love her heart and soul which I know is THE MOST important in a relationship vs just sexual attraction. But.....I was still fighting my heart with my mind and eyes...and I didn't know why it was so hard for me to just accept the whole wonderful package. Why am I still being so damn shallow or do I really know what I want and need for having chemistry with someone?

After that, and she went back to Tokyo, she began to ramp up the talk about ""marriage"" and wanted more of a plan of how to for us to live together. Namely, she really wanted to be in the USA and married to me around Christmas next year after only giving me until around ""March"" next year after I go back to Japan to decide fully on what we should do.

Because I have OCD, I have always moved slow with very big life decisions and relationships have been no exception. I was with an ex for 5 years but never got engaged which was very good as it was not a healthy relationship and we ended it over 8 years ago now.  I do totally understand that she is a women and she needs signs of ""commitment"" before she leaves her entire world and family for a man in another country which is something she also has dreamt about for a long time.

However, I got scared the other night talking to her about this and that I need more time for such a decision and she said something that upset me greatly and I hung up the phone in anger.   Now I got texts on Google Hangouts and Skype indicating she understands I’m not ready and does not want to push or hurt me, but she can't wait for me forever and we both desire different things and said goodbye and deleted all our text history. Just like that!???

Now I'm sitting here at work the next morning with tears in the back of my eyes, my heart and mind are utterly all over the place. I feel like a total asshole but I don't know what who is at fault or is it no ones fault and it just is what it is for relationships when people get to know eachother more, especially when they live so far apart?

What did I do horribly wrong and what can or cannot I not change about myself? I've been on medication and therapy for years for my OCD and its gotten better and my whole life I dreampt of this moment. So why the hell am I so damn scared and weak about this?

459,"hey guys and gals, thanks for looking and I'll apologize up front, i'm a bit all over the place. stress got me reeling and just wanna say some of my thoughts and we'll see where it goes from there. 

starting out, just the dynamic i'm married. 4kids wife just recently (5 weeks ago) finished up her last surgeries battling stage 3 breast cancer

obviously there's financial strain there, being down to 1 income these just 2years has been trying for sure. now that she's on the mend, we're all happy but not the best time of year. 

stress added in with Christmas around the corner, we applied for toys for tots but have yet to hear anything. my kids are 2teens, 2 pre teen.

wife did recently apply for a job but most everything is hired out this time of year and filled with holiday help. she does feel guilty for the financial burden as well as the delinquency of every possible bill now too.

add in my oldest is going away to college next year, she's applied for scholarships and such but there's still a financial burden attached there too that I worry about each day. 

our home internet has been disconnected and no means of getting that back soon either, with only 1 provider in the area we're kind of over a barrel there. so I carry larges amounts of guilt there that my children must hotspot any games they want to play, etc. 

I honestly joined a weight loss competition just to attempt to win some money to help ease a little burden. I guess if there's any positivity coming it's that I've been in the money bracket there last 6 weeks. not the most but it'll help something. 

my personal trade licenses, license plates, and other expenses staring me right in the face for renewal fees too. my birthday is near Christmas and others expire at end of year. so that's more allocated money that must be spent without going towards the holidays. adding in the wife's vehicle tire situation.

as a whole the 2year battle has wreaked havoc on my bank as well as wound up maxing every credit card I have. i'm pleased to say for the majority of it we are through the battle and healthy, it's just going to take a long time to get to where we were before it all. 

I could go on about things I carry guilt for, and what's challenging me each day but I think i'm throwing enough out there. with my daughter graduating we're hoping to throw a grad party at the house, however there's things I need to do around the house to make that possible. 

as a whole i'm always the guy telling everyone everything will be ok, and pointing out to them how. yet in my life I've no one to chat with in kind.  try as I might telling myself, it's just never the same",03Dec2018,1
460,"Hi, I'll try to summarize this stuff then ask my question. I realize this all sounds ridiculous, and it's because it sounds ridiculous that I'm confused and unsure at this point.

I met a girl earlier this year and started to find out about her life. She's been through a lot of trauma and horrible shit that I don't want to get into so it seemed she'd been dealt a very bad hand in life. The extent of this stuff was so ridiculous to me that I occasionally doubted whether it all really happened, sounded almost like a movie. At this point, we were fwb, she kind of wanted more I wasn't sure yet. Then she disappeared for a month September to October and I realized I cared more about her than I thought, regretted not realizing that earlier.

So I reached out to her and she responded, telling me she had been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and panicked and went back to family in another state. We texted for about a month and she was supposed to fly back to my state for treatment the day after Thanksgiving. She said she'd be flying back about once a month for treatment. She said she had the worst headache she's ever had Thanksgiving evening and was going to the hospital, and that she'd text me back the next morning.

She didn't respond to any texts after that. At this point I should mention she had multiple brothers, some much older than her so I suppose they weren't that close. I managed to find one of them on Facebook and ask if she's ok. Late Saturday night he tells me she's fine, she'll get into contact with me if she wants to. Monday morning I wake up to an email from her little brother saying she died Saturday morning and her phone was disconnected yesterday.

I tried calling her phone and it said ""forwarding to automated voice messaging system *beep"".

So at this point I feel like a huge cunt for doubting her at all at a time like this, but some shit just doesn't add up. How can one person's life actually be this unlucky, maybe I'm just in denial because I don't want to believe that this beautiful, optimistic person is dead so young. But at the same time why would I be forwarded to voice messaging system if her phone is disconnected? And even if her brother is older than her and didn't know about her cancer (I'm not sure if he knew, might've might not) wouldn't his family notify him of her death the same day? She seemed to have a fine relationship with him just not a close one because he was older. And the email from her little brother kind of has her writing style with run on sentencesl, maybe that's a reach.

So I'm not even sure what I'm asking for here. I feel like a piece of shit for even doubting any of this because if it is true then I'm the world's biggest asshole. I think I'll email back her little brother and ask if there's a funeral that I could go to, I could afford flying out to her state as long as it didn't land on the same day as my college finals. I'm feeling like shit and on top of that I'm feeling confused and angry at myself for even feeling confused. Any advice would be appreciated.",03Dec2018,1

462,"Hi reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

It's a throwaway for anonymity.

&amp;#x200B;

My post might appear a bit petty compared to others in this sub but I really need guidance, I'm really feeling lost and not in the right place in my life. I'll start with a bit of context.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 25, got a good family life (living with my parents to spare money for now) and a lot of good friends I love who are living close to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I've got some mild mental issues that are slowly fading. Social anxiety and very light depression. My social anxiety is named paruresis, causing me to not be able to urinate whenever I want. It has caused me to have depression and also permanently slightly damaged my bladder. It's now fading slowly, giving me more freedom in my social life. I have also difficulties for sticking up for myself and probably lack empathy.

Those mental problems have probably been created by a short period of mild bullying in middle school.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently an IT engineer in a well-known multinational compagny and even if I don't show it I hate that.

Things have been interesting in the beginning, I learned a lot of useful things that can be helpful for my career and all. But now the workload is just increasing and I have all those things to think about. Too much work and my motivation is decreasing as the workload increases. I've always been lazy and somewhat still succeeded despite of that, but my life and career are becoming boring and stressful in the same time.

Concerning my colleagues I get along with them but I don't like them. One of my colleagues work in my office and is playing the game of alternating being harsh teasing me and being nice. I clearly get that and can't do anything against it, and also feel like he is turning my other colleagues against me.

On top of that, work really messes up with my sleep schedule. Waking up early for school or work has always bothered me as long as I remember. It makes me nauseous on the morning and tired for the rest of the day. It's not the case when I can respect my sleep schedule and sleep two more hours. I think it's also a factor in my lack of motivation. And I can clearly feel my negative emotions rising up when I have to wake up early. And I'm not even  doing too much hours, about 40 by week. I'm just feeling like I'm wasting one third of my life doing a job I'm not bad at but don't like either, just to come home feeling nothing else than annoyance and angryness, even for the people I love.

&amp;#x200B;

I really feel like work is messing with me mentally and physically. I just want to quit and never work again. It's been years I'm fighting against my instincts, and I always comply with society and societal demand. People around me are so happy for me, having a contract with this big compagny. I am not, I just want to sleep and don't feel the need to contribute to the society which participated of fucking with my mental health, and even less in a compagny contributing to environment damage. I can't find any purpose in that. I like forests and mountains, and would love to maintain a work linked to that and which don't need much social interactions.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if that appears as whiny, I'm only identifying the bad aspects of my life because they are the ones I want to resolve. Also I'm conscious that my problems are probably due partially by me. But if somebody has any idea of how I can escape this reality I'd love to read that.",03Dec2018,1

I went to the doc and was told I couldn’t be examined because there was no paperwork entailing what to sign off on or what to examine; there were no questions my doctor could answer basically. Understandable. This was my first physical without having paperwork from whoever was requiring it. I thought it was odd too. 

I go to schedule an appointment after inquiring about the necessary paperwork with my employer. Shouldn’t be an issue to receive the paper my email. 

I then go to reschedule my physical literally 20 minutes after I was seen from the doctor and was told I couldn’t be seen until 2 weeks after I’m supposed to start trainings, which I can’t do if I don’t have my physical done, which would result in me not being hired.

469,"This is my throwaway account because I'm so embarrassed by my predicament.

So I'm 29 y/o guy working 3 jobs because I live in a very expensive city on the west coast. Since I'm not passionate about any of those jobs, I started taking classes in 2015 hoping to get into nursing. In college I coasted by without studying and graduated with a 3.3 gpa. Since returning back to school and taking pre-nursing classing, my gpa has plummeted to a 2.1 gpa. Why? Like an idiot I have taken both Calculus and Anatomy three times (WDF, WDD) . (I failed anatomy again this semester and will have to retake it eventually which means that I will have anatomy on my transcript 4 times when I finally apply for nursing school).

I'm writing this at my wits end. I feel stuck. I've finally realized that I need to quit 2 jobs and take the financial hit if I want to actually finish my pre-reqs and do well in them. The problem is that I have ~1500 in credit card debit. If I quit two jobs and just work one job I'll make ~1100 a month working weekends but that means that after paying all of my bills I will only have ~150 left a month. The only bills I can get rid of are my credit card payment and internet. I'm struggling to figure out how to fix my situation. Should I take two semesters off and work extra hours so that I can pay off my credit card debit before quitting those jobs? Would it make sense for me to get rid of my internet and just have bare necessity bills? 

Taking two semesters off (Spring and Summer) feels like the best decision, but i don't want to do that because I'm almost 30 with nothing to show for it. Most of my friends have already completed graduate school and have their careers in order while I work service industry jobs. I feel so small compared to others when people ask me what I do and I answer with a blue collar job while they say they are lawyers/therapists/teachers. I feel so behind. The thought of applying to nursing school as a 33 y/o feels shitty but I don't see any other way.

Any advice on how to handle this situation is much appreciated. (No, I can't move home with my parents. I have been financially independent from them since 18 and do not have a relationship with either of them. No I can't get a roommate. I have a rent controlled studio apartment and I would end up pay more if I left it.)

474,"I have choose the wrong career several times, and as of now I'm far from where I want to be. But I feel burnt out.

First I choose agricultural high school, because I didn't know what to pick so I just said what the guy before me said, when we were asked what we wanted to study. I went there for 1 year before I quit, and went to study electronics at another high school for three years, as suggested by my father. I choose the IT path- not the electrician or automatician path. I realize only later that my father kept hinting me to take the ""high voltage"" path. I finished it with a B in average.

I was happy and wanted to study programming, which I had been doing almost every day for the past two years. That, and gaming was about 90% of my free time, at the time.

But when I choose school, my father, who was an electrician, suggested studying to become and electrical engineer instead of a programmer, because they also get to learn some programming. I didn't see why not at the time.

I went to collage for 1 year before I dropped out before finals. The only grade I got was my grade in programming, a B I got half way though the year while having a lot of fun with my group. I programmed and they wrote the stuff we we're supposed to write. To this day I never knew what all those pages was about. 

When I dropped out of collage I was really burnt out because I really didn't like the other subjects at the school. It really drained me and I didn't really absorb any of it.

Instead of loafing around at home, as I lived my parents (And still do), my father wanted me to come and help him at his job, as an electrician. I worked there for a couple of months, got very good paid, as not only was it my first job, but I got paid as a temp and not an apprentice, which was almost full pay. I quickly realized I was not, at all, fit for this kind of job, but I learned a lot and I had some fun. 

Next I accepted an apprentice job, I can to this day not answer why I did that. I really can't.

I started at the bottom with apprentice paychecks and collages who bullied me. 2 years later and an agreement to never work with one of my collages again, here I am(m23). Take note that this company is really small, so I basically only worked with my father and 2 other people some times.

I'm really burnt out and loathe my job now. I don't like this kind of work at all. This is not my trade. But I still have about 8 months of school + apprenticeship examination left to complete.

I had 3 sick days over 3 years of high school, but I often call in sick to my work. I feel like it's calling in sick-or just giving up. I have also lost all energy i had at home.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know what I want to do though. I want to be a programmer. There's deal breaker though. To become a programmer, I have to study at a collage for 3 years. And I honestly don't think I can do it. I feel too burnt out, and it frustrates me beyond anything else. And maybe worst of all, if I am to complete my training in my trade and become an electrician, I would not be able to get into school before I am 25 years old(because it ends at an odd time, because I started at an odd time). And finish it when I am 28. While going to school, I would easily burn though all the money i've earned so far from costs of living and eating ect (collage in my country is payed by the taxpayer).

Which means I would be fresh out of school at 28, with no property, money or real work experience in my new field. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate the situation i've carelessly put myself into. Is it possible to turn this around? Can you convince me programming is not even that great? I don't even know what kind of programming I want. Well not mobile, at all. I havn't even programmed in 2 years because it just annoys me to know I could have been dong it as my profession by now if I played my cards right.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the rant, I barely worked at work today, all I could think about was my bad choices. I've been thinking about it for the past year. I need to get this out of my system somehow.

476,"I will try to make the story brief. I have listed a property for sale that has a neighbor from hell.

The owner of the property owned her house before this guy moved in, lived next to him for 5 years till it became unbearable. Moved out and had been renting it but she can't keep tenants because of him either. 

Things he does: 

Puts up gates/chains etc.. blocking access then hides to watch her get out and open/cut chains etc.. (she has an easement).

Pulls a gun on people coming in and out of the property.

Has set up a shooting range right at the entrance to her property.

Calls/texts/threatens Tenants

Rides motorcycles across her property to get to a part of his property he can easily access a different way (see below about the easement) throws beer bottles and trash etc.. at her house while doing this, the road he is driving on is directly next to the house. 

Etc.... the guy is a menace.

She HAS gone to court with him about the access. She won, he appealed, she won, he appealed again and was able to not stop her use of the easement but found a vague paragraph and twisted it to get use of the easement to go through her property.  It is obvious the intent for the easement was NOT for this but he won when the final appeal kicked it to a state level and the people looking at the case never saw the situation in person. 

When she reports his behavior to the sheriff (this is in the county) the sherriff just says it is a civil matter and she needs to take him back to court. 

The guy wants her property but he wants it cheap and is trying to make it impossible for her to sell it or rent it so she will be forced to sell it to him. He is part of the motorcycle riders association that has been known in our area for similar tactics. Harassing people  till they leave etc... 

What do you do with someone who seems to be willing to escalate indefinitely?? She is currently working on a restraining order.

477,Someone I know has an ex boyfriend who is stalking her. He has access to her email and text messages on her phone. I helped her change her email password and sign out of every existing account other than her laptop and phone so her email should be fine. But I couldn't find out how to prevent him from getting her text messages. We know he is getting her messages because she went to hang out with a guy she met on tinder and he texted her his address. The stalker saw the text and told her parents that she had sneaked off to his place. Her parents showed up at this guys apartment because they were concerned and her night was ruined. She has an android s8 and I looked at everything to see if there was some malware but i couldn't find anything.  She has changed her number multiple times but somehow he keeps getting her messages.

484,"Hi, I’m not sure if this is the right sub for this issue but I really need some advice for this. Heads up: it’s long, and slightly NSFW. 

TLDR at the bottom

I’m a student and I’m constantly looking for odd jobs to make money. I mostly work as a babysitter, and have been doing so for many years. I saw an ad on Facebook from a man in his early 30s, who was looking for a babysitter. The salary was €30 an hour. This is a huge amount of money for me.

But when I messaged him, there was of course a catch. The babysitter was for himself. Basically it’s a fetish, he wants to be a ‘baby’ once a week, where I take care of him as I would for a baby, feeding, toys, songs, diaper’s etc. At first I was uncomfortable, but he assured me it wasn’t sexual, and was happy to answer questions. It was easy money and I truly needed it. I was nervous but agreed to meet in public. He did actually seem nice. 

The first meeting I waited for an hour, he didn’t show and didn’t answer messages. I was bummed but at one point I just left. That evening he messaged me, apologizing profusely, he had accidentally broken his ankle (I suspect this is BS of course) and he would pay me for this day. I reluctantly agreed to meet again, because I was still willing to give this a chance. 

Well, second time, also a no-show, another basic excuse, now I was pissed. I had canceled another job to try this again and was now unable to pay a bill. I told him I would only meet again if he paid me for the missing hours. He agreed to this and we set a third date.

It pissed me off beyond belief that he didn’t show again the third time, but I will say it’s my own fault. He claimed his girlfriend found out and he could not leave etc., I was not buying it anymore. I told him to fuck off.

He messaged me about 5/6 times, sending me illicit pictures too which I hated, asking me to please meet again. I told him I’d only consider it again if he paid me the hours he didn’t show in advance. He refused, so I told him to stop messaging me.

To be honest, at this point I think he’s a rude asshole, and I don’t want anything to do with him. He treated me like shit, and even over text doesn’t respect my boundaries (I got dick pics and sexually suggestive messages). I didn’t mind that he refused my last offer, even though I still had money troubles.

This morning he wired me €450. He asked me to meet him on Friday and start over because he really wants me as his ‘mommy’. I’m contemplating not going because I already lost my patience with him, and don’t want to do it anymore, but I don’t want to get in legal trouble. Am I obliged to go because he paid me already? Can this get me in trouble? He knows my full name and telephone number, nothing else. Can I just block him? I feel a bit petty and evil for doing this, it’s not like me usually, but at this point I’m just not sure what else I can do. 

I really appreciate any advice on this matter. Not going and blocking him seems like the right thing but it also seems like a dick move, and I don’t want any severe consequences. I’m a bit scared too.

This guy isn’t a jerk, he’s just the kind of guy that jokes around like that. I obviously knew he was kidding, but the girl next to me who doesn’t know him as well didn’t see it the same way. I started chipping in, saying about how rape is a horrific thing and how Tyler doesn’t really know what he’s talking about. As we kept talking about the subject, she just kept staring at Tyler, and eventually she looked away. Tyler asked what Jane’s opinion was, but then we both noticed that she was crying. Tyler said “Oh sh*t, have you had an experience like that?” All Jane said was “My Dad.” Tyler and I went dead silent. What we thought was a joking conversation became a solemn moment. We didn’t know what to say. Tyler looked at me and said, “what do I do.” I said that we should just apologize. Tyler did, and went back to his chair. Jane looked at me quickly and said she was going to the bathroom, and left the room without letting the teacher know. I could work the rest of the class because of the thought on my mind. Jane had confessed to me that she was raped by her father. When she came back to the classroom about 15 minutes later, she asked if I wouldn’t tell anyone. Of course I said I wouldn’t.

There will be people there who hate my guts because I distanced myself from them, and I'm  worried about awkward confrontations and conversations.

499,"So I've been living with this guy for almost a year now. He's a good guy and all but damn he doesnt leave me alone. He spends all his time in my room although he has the bigger room. Even when he has to study or work he will get his shit in my room and do it here even if it gets too crowded or the vibe isnt right for that. He loves hanging out with my friends and I but he doesn't seem to understand that sometime we wouldnt want him around.

Hes kind of acts like a history professor or a fact machine and always has to give us information about shit we dont care about. Sometimes my friends and I would be watching something and he would start talking and would not stop even if we ignore him he'll go on for an hour during the movie. 

Whenever my friends are over he rushes into my room, so I never get to hangout with my friends alone and get comfortable with them. And like he has a lot of flaws that really get under our skin but that's not really relevant to this post. Mainly my girlfriend cant stand him cause of the shit he says or how comfortable he is with our space. However it's always easier to kick him out when its just my girlfriend and I because we ask for privacy  and make it seem like were about to frickfrack. But when when my friends are here I dunno how to get rid of him cause it's not like I'm gonna fuck my friends and ask for privacy. 

He doesn't have any friends except for my friends that I've had for years. Whenever we make plans he thinks he's automatically invited and we feel bad to uninvite him. And on top of all that my best friend and my brother are visiting this winter break and he's planning his winter vacation over everything that I'm gonna do and I dont think I can deal with that.

I dont wanna get rid of him, I just want him to give me space and not be super comfortable with me as he is now. Obviously the best way to do this is to talk to him but it's gonna be hard to do that because although he is my age (23), he acts like a 16 year old.

504,"This is a long story that I'm going to start from the beginning. So towards the end of October, my boyfriend at the time and I broke up. A week later I started dating someone else. (yes, fucked up i know. trust me i regret it) So my ex (J) and I quickly started to hate each other. Then we made up and did stupid shit and that ended with my heart getting broken a second time and we went back to hating each other. A few weeks later we once again made up. So we still have feelings for each other (at least I have feelings for him.) and last Monday my boyfriend (S) and I broke up. I asked him for time because I was still hooked on J and it was unfair to him. I regret that because now I lost him. So essentially last week J and I got pretty close again. Now, I've asked him about getting back together so many times. I never expressed that that's what I wanted but it is. I want so bad to give us a second chance. But I always just asked him what he thought and his answer has always been ""I don't know.""   So last night I gave him a list of people and asked if he would date them. This list included my ""best friend"" and he said he would date her. That fucking stung. And he didn't get it. He said he couldn't control who he liked. My response to that was married couples that are truly in love don't go ""oh hey yeah I'd date your best friend sorry can't control who I like"" If you truly love someone you don't think like that. Now, I know I seem hypocritical since I dated S  a week later but a lot of shit happened and truthfully I wasn't over J. I'm still not. So I was mad at him and a lot of shit happened. Then he just completely ignored me. I could not get ahold of him. He lied to me multiple times last night. He was on the phone with my ""best friend""   (I say it like this because she isn't really my best friend anymore) and he wouldn't tell me that. This morning she told me that she and J might date in the future. How utterly fucked up is that? Now here's the other half of the story. So last Monday, S and I broke up. That Friday we got back together. At the end of the day, he broke up with me again. He said, ""things aren't working out right now I need more time.""  He ignored me all weekend and today he tells me it's because he kissed another girl. He's confused about his feelings for her.   I wish I stayed with S because it was so easy with him. And I don't have to feel like this. I keep chasing after J but it goes nowhere. He always tells me he loves me but I truly doubt that. And now he's moving on and replacing me as a girlfriend and a best friend with my own best friend. This truly has been the worst week, no, month of my life. I don't know what the hell to do.  4...almost 5 heartbreaks all in a month. If J finally decided he wanted to get back together I would be so down. If S wanted to get back together I really don't know what I would do. I love him and all but I think I would need time from breaking up twice in 5 days. I really don't know what to do.

I feel like I'm old enough to be in a relationship, and part of me wants to talk to her about him so that I can actually meet him more often, and also not have to do it behind her back in fear. Maybe one day I could even go visit him in Denmark. I want her to know, and I don't want to lie about his age, because I'm hoping he'll be in my life for the long term, and she's bound to find out at some point.

&amp;#x200B;

Part of me feels like she'll look through all of my messages and things again if I tell her though. I'm honestly very afraid. I've considered maybe talking to her with my boyfriend on the phone to also talk to her but that's the only way I can think of that could possibly go well.

&amp;#x200B;

How should I go about telling her, if at all? Or should I wait until I'm older?",03Dec2018,1
509,"Over the past year I have been a victim of character assasination by a known individual from my past. I do not think I have a legal case for libel in the United States, maybe false light and if libel tourism was still possible I could probably win in England, they are using legitimate things I said, but they are quoting them out of context and relying on having very good SEO to overpower any opposing search results for my name. I am extremely afraid of the streisand effect occurring so I had previously taken no action at all against this, hoping it would go away on its own. It didn't go away and now it has had worse impact on me than ever. The biggest impact was probably on my self confidence, I am now afraid to even say my name for fear of someone finding one of the thousands of hate pages this person has put up about me. I think this has really harmed my ability to network. I am contemplating changing my name and then rapidly trying to build up SEO for my new name but I am afraid this person will just find me under my new name and do the same thing again. Trying to deal with this person is out of the question. I made some mistakes with them in the past, mostly from not realizing just how deranged this person really is. From my interaction with them in the past I conclude they almost certainly have some kind of mental disorder that makes them act like this, probably a Cluster A personality disorder, regardless of speculation they are the most unreasonable person I have ever encountered, and for reasons of entirely luck they have millions of dollars to throw around on private investigators and hate pages and legal fees.

510,"I work 8 hours a week at locations outside of the office, with GREAT pay for a college student, I could work more, but according to the contract I apparently am unable to.

511,"We've been together 12 years. It's been a crazy roller coaster ride. Overall we are happy and when things are good my wife is great. But when life gets stressful (she's an only child btw) she blames everyone else but herself for her problems and takes her anger out on me. 
The name calling, the put downs are just horrible. I was raised in a family where I rarely saw my parents fight and it certainly wasn't ugly language used. Whereas my wife's family are fiery and nuts and don't seem to have any boundaries. They don't recognize when what they say turns to verbal abuse. 

We have two kids at home and we are going through a stressful time with our finances amongst other things. I largely handle our finances as my wife doesn't have the best concept on money and saving. Our daughter has some serious health issues that are also causing stress. My wife doesn't know how to manage her emotions and when they bubble over she takes it out on me and also in front of the kids. Now I'm no pushover, so it nearly always turns into an argument but sometimes her words get through my tough exterior and they really hurt. I can never return serve on what she says as I won't stoop to that level. But she justifies what she says because she ""frustrated"" and because I didn't do something to stop the stress. She blames me for all the bad, but also holds me responsible for all the good. I can't take it anymore and I can't seem to get through to her without her hijacking my point and turning into an argument.

518,"Before I jump in to this, let me clarify that I'm not blaming my mother for her decision- I understand where she's coming from as a parent, I just want some additional viewpoints for both of our sides.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm (18F) currently attending college at a university that is 6 1/2 hours away from my house. My girlfriend(18F) lives in the opposite direction, about 5 1/2 hours away from my dorm.

She's honest to god the sweetest, most caring and incredible girl I've ever met. We've been friends for about 4 years, but we finally started officially dating in August this year. I can't believe I didn't ask her our sooner- she's completely turned my life around. I've struggled with anxiety and eating disorders in the past, but over the last 6 months or so my symptoms have almost completely disappeared thanks to her support, care, laughter, friendship, and love. I'm eating healthy again, been exercising, and been astronomically less socially anxious- this is the best I've felt in years. 

Living as far apart as we do, and with both of our wild schedules, our face-to-face meetups are short but incredibly special. However, we still text frequently throughout the day and do video calls every other night or so, so it never feels like we're missing out on each others lives.

&amp;#x200B;

She (with her parents acceptance and approval,) invited me to spend several days with her after Christmas. Because it would be an 11 hour drive straight there, I figured I'd leave my house on the 29th, sleep in my dorm room and arrive their on the 30th. I'd do the same sort of thing coming back, leaving their house on the 3rd and arriving home on the 4th. Originally, I think we had hoped to spend that whole week with each other, but I think her parents are being very gracious by letting me stay as long as I am and I don't want to outstay my welcome.

I told my mother what I was planning during Thanksgiving break. She didn't respond right away, but she finally sent me an email over the weekend that, in short, can be summed up as ""No way in hell.""

&amp;#x200B;

First off, one of her main concerns was the length of the drive. Although I've made the 6 hour drive from home to my university multiple times already, she still worries (in my opinion, unnecessarily) every time I set out on those long drives. And it being a total of about 11 hours, shes extremely against letting me drive all that way by myself.

Second, she doesn't want me to miss out on spending time with my family. I have 2 younger siblings (12 and 15), and one older brother (19) who's in the army and will be visiting home during this time. She says time's running out to spend with them, and she doesn't want me to lose any more sibling/grandparents/family bonding time than I already have.

Finally, she doesn't feel as if its polite to stay as long as I'm planning to- to quote my grandfather, ""Company and fish are similar in that they both start stinkin' after about 3 days."" Not to mention, because I'll be having to feed myself on my driving days and the cost of gas, frugality isn't exactly on my side.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not arguing with all her points here, I think what she's said is very valid. However, there's aspects that she's overlooked (deliberately or not) that I want to at least try to reason with her about.

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, long drives don't bother me. It's completely worth it in my mind, I have no qualms or issues with sitting in a car for as long as I will. And I won't be driving the 11 hours straight- I'll drive the first 6 1/2 hours on the first day, which I've already proven that I can do, sleep, and then drive the last 5 1/2 hours the second day, which again, I've already done before.

As for my family members, I will be missing time with them, there's no way for me to really get around that. But I go home for break on the 14th, and don't go back to school until the 14th of January. If I spent 6 days traveling, I'll still have more than 3 weeks with nothing to do BUT hang out with family. I do love them, and I'd promise to spend every available moment I had playing games with my younger siblings or helping out around the house.

As for the money- this is the part my mother doesn't know. I actually won about 250 dollars last month from winning a film competition, and I've been saving that money all this time specifically for this reason. I don't know if it'd change her mind by itself, but it'll cover those extra expenses.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been so excited about being able to see my girlfriend again, I love her to pieces and it breaks my heart to think about not being able to spend time with her. I don't know if I'm being childish, or if its selfish of me to want what I'm asking for- I'd love to be able to convince my mother that I'd be fine, she'd be fine, and it isn't nearly as big of a deal as she's making it out to be. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just like any 18 year old, I want to be treated like an adult and make my own choices. But I don't know if the adult thing to do here is to just listen to my mother.",03Dec2018,1
519,"Long story short: 

I’m (20F) from a very poor family and when I started dating my boyfriend his family asked me if I wanted to live with them as if I were there daughter - partially because my boyfriend’s father had just had brain surgery and needed a caregiver, and partially because they genuinely liked and probably felt bad for me. 

I have a room in their home that I do not pay rent for, and we eat together as a family, so I do not pay for food either. I do pay for my own auto insurance, gas and student loans. 

Since my boyfriend’s parents pay for over half of my expenses we decided it would be wise for them to claim me as their dependent. 

From the time I was born to the time I turn 21 (five weeks from now) I have been insured through my state’s local Medicare program, so I’ve never given health insurance much thought, until now.  For the past two weeks I have been getting quotes from a bunch of different health agencies. When they ask for my households annual income I have to put my tax family’s income (275,000) instead of my own (13,900), meaning I qualify for zero subsidies or discounts. Most of the premiums I qualify for are full price, which I just can’t afford. 

What should I do? Is there anything I can do to lower my premium? ",03Dec2018,1
521,"My dad is the most frugal, stubborn man I know.
He refuses to spend a single dollar on fixing our house because he 'knows' how to fix these things himself and doesn't need to call a professional. 

Well, the tap in our bathroom can only run hot water and the one in the kitchen is continuously leaking despite the numerous times my dad 'fixed' them. Our toilet can only do half flushes, our narrow driveway has cracks and slabs of concrete sticking up - making it a tripping hazard for my mum. Our fence fell over 2 years ago, so people just love to litter our front yard and use the tap outside our home now. Oh, and our main microwave broke at the beginning of the year and instead of fixing it, we use this cheap microwave dad brought from work and place it in the living room- and he complains about the noise it makes whenever I reheat some food while he watches TV.

It's really small things but whenever I invite my friends over, I have to explain to them these things and if they accidentally use the full flush on the toilet, I spend half an hour trying to fix 'cause the water would continue to run and you can hear it in the entire house. I end up stressed and frustrated, and my friends feel terrible (which they shouldn't because it's normal to have a functioning toilet in a house???)

I'm ranting now but hell, I'd use my own money but as a 17 y.o. working minimum wage, I don't have much and I don't know even know where to call or how much to pay for these things tbh.

524,"Hello everyone, I'm kind of new to this, but I'll have a go.

In short explanation, I'm a freshman in college, about to end my first semester. My grades are good, my classes are okay, and overall I'm liking the environment, aside from a bit of homesickness and missing having money at my old job. I'm roommates with my boyfriend, we enjoy our time together, and we study together. I made many friends besides being a bit of a sufferer from social anxiety. 

&amp;#x200B;

But one thing is wrong. My mom wants me to drop out. I expressed my homesickness to her before, I even went as far as saying maybe I will dropout the end of the semester to get back on my feet financially, and she was okay with that. In fact, she wanted me to, due to the fact that she misses me, and we don't really have much money. FAFSA kind of sucks in terms of looking at other factors of financial situations aside from income and all that, insurance takes a big chunk out of my dad's checks every two weeks. But she should've known that college would be hard in terms of finance, I believe? I've always talked about wanting to go to college in high school, and now I'm at my first choice college.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think financial situation is the only reason she wants me home. She herself is a very dependent person, whereas she has mental illness, which she doesn't want to get treatment for, and doesn't have much of a social life outside of work. I've always felt like I was her parent while she was the child, aside from cooking and cleaning, I mean this more in an emotional way. She's cried in front of me when I was at a young age, talked about how depressed she was, and talked about how much we're struggling with money. Keep in mind, I was very young when she would do this. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought that I owed it to her to drop out, that I'm just holding her back and being more of a burden than I've ever felt like. She's guilt tripped me many times before, I've called her out on it a few of those times even. I don't think she understands how important this is to me. She also knows that I'm confused about what I want to do in general for a career path, as many freshman are, and uses this against me as a reason why I shouldn't go. She thinks that the city is a dangerous place, which my hometown isn't much better. I don't even live far away, it's barely an hour drive.

530,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first post on Reddit and it is a long one despite editing multiple times. I need an impartial viewpoint to help me see whether I am being over dramatic or not.

&amp;#x200B;

The family dynamic is my father, mother, older brother and older sister. 

&amp;#x200B;

For as long as I can remember, I have felt ostracised from the rest of the family. They are all scientists and mathematicians and pursued paths within that area. I on the other hand have always gravitated towards English Literature, Art, History and Politics. This became an immediate problem when I started school as my mother would try and drill the importance of science and maths as art 'wasn't a real subject'. She would privately tutor me and whenever I got a question wrong, there was sure to be a whack around the head. At the time I rationalised this as being a part of Indian culture, but since working I can recognise that such behaviour is completely unacceptable and that it was never inflicted on my siblings. For you reading, it may seem strange, but I have reached a level of forgiveness with this issue - I emthasise that my mother merely wanted me to be clever in subjects that were important to her and in later life, I have since been able to cultivate greater intelligence in my own fields.   

&amp;#x200B;

This next paragraph is especially difficult for me as I have never spoken or written about it before, but I feel this post would be dishonest without its inclusion. I have a physical disability which affects my muscles, but not to the extent of preventing me from engaging in work, travel and social events. Whilst I have been able to work with the physical impacts of this disability, through my study of philosophy and psychology, I began to notice the emotional toll. I can distinctly remember as a child going to restaurants with my family and my mother would give my medicine under the table. Back then, even as a child, it felt as if she was embarrassed to have a child with a condition. Even to this present day, I have made a conscious effort to hide my condition, but it makes building relationships extremely difficult as you can never truly be yourself. Having said this, and conscious that I'm painting my mother as a villain, I would like to offer a counterpoint. As a child, she did take me to all of my hospital appointments. I am certain that she was trying her best to work within the circumstances she was given in the best way she knew how, given the cultural and family pressures she would have felt. For this reason, I have learnt to forgive her and am now trying to overcome my own sense of embarrassment when in social situations.

&amp;#x200B;

What I find most difficult in the household is the dynamic that has been built around my siblings. My brother is the eldest and my sister, being the only daughter, are both held in high regard, despite their actions towards others. I do not wish to speak for others and so I will relay two of the biggest recent incidents that have occured to me:

&amp;#x200B;

* I was foolish enough to lend my brother thousands as he promised to give this back when he could. This has not been the case. He could pay back the money within a week with his high paying job, but rather spend it on drinks, concerts and clothes. For me, this shows a great level of disrespect towards me who offered to help him in kindness. Having raised the issue for months, I went to my parents. My father who has worked his hardest to mend the situation has been counteracted by my mother, who has defended my brother, stating that money in the family is shared and that I will eventually get it back. A similar incident occurred only a few days ago, where having bought a new laptop for my creative projects, my brother took my iPad. Raising the issue, it was ultimately decided by my mother that possessions between siblings does not exist and we 'could share it'. Regretfully, after too many times of raising the issue only to be neutered, I admittedly became incredibly angry and acted far from the best version of myself. Since then, all but my father have accused me of being selfish and a 'weirdo', placing money/ things before family.

&amp;#x200B;

* A few days ago, I raised my unhappiness with my father. My rationale being that a great disrespect was being shown towards me by my siblings. Given that he and my mother would/ could not take action to resolve them, I felt that there was no other recourse left but to leave. I could see the pain in his face, but what was said was said. Unfortunately, that very day, he had a small car accident (thankfully he was not hurt) and I heard about this incident from my sister who texted me that I had 'spoiled the day' and that I was to blame for the issues in the family. Phoning my father, he did not blame me in the slightest as 'these things happen'. Nevertheless, I was subsequently removed from the family WhatsApp group and within the household feel like a persecuted villain. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because of this, I have not spoken a word to my brother or sister since. Being under the same household, I understand this cannot stand as a permanent solution as it is unhealthy for my parents. Because of this, I have given leaving the home more thought and have collected my documents/ packed my bag. My hesitations to leave are:

&amp;#x200B;

* This decision will more than likely be permanent. I have already been accused of trying to break up the family by my sister. I am concerned with the emotional wellbeing of my parents, especially because they have always believed a family unit should stick together. Leaving would crush them and doing so will only escalate the resentment towards me. This could cut me away from my parents who I would still like to build a relationship with.

&amp;#x200B;

* I have been saving money to buy a house in the next few years. If I leave, I will have to take a financial hit and could be waiting years longer. By sticking this out for a few more years, I could benefit in the long-term, even if in the short-term I have to lock myself in my room. 

&amp;#x200B;

* It is not cheap to rent and this would mean cutting out luxuries I have been able to enjoy through my parents' generosity. My friend stated I was in a 'gilded cage' as he felts all the benefits of staying at home were actually being used to keep me trapped. I certainly see his point, but it is a point to raise nonetheless. 

&amp;#x200B;

* I have been working on my creative projects and I would potentially have to delay them if I am going to uproot my life.

&amp;#x200B;

All stories have two sides. I have tried to relay my view as honest as possible, but am conscious that my siblings could easily craft a version of their own events to appeal to you. Everyone has said these issues are in my head and given that no one else seems to be able to see them, perhaps they are right. 

&amp;#x200B;

Given what I have written, I am unsure whether leaving home because of my siblings is too drastic an action, or whether I should remain calm and stay at home?

&amp;#x200B;

Sincerely yours,

&amp;#x200B;

534,"So I(21F) live with my mom, siblings, and grandfather. I don't pay too much in rent, like $200-$300 and I know that just screams privilege, but I feel like I'm going insane. I hate the smell of smoke and I've mention this countless times, but my mom and grandfather continue to smoke everywhere in the house, which I would be somewhat okay with if it wasn't in the places we all share (bathroom, kitchen, living room). My brother also smokes weed, which I hate more than cigarettes. I've beg my mom to tell him to smoke outside instead, but she just says that she doesn't think he has too.

I've struggle with serious mental health issues that caused me to drop out of college. I've quit multiple jobs because of it and I've just gotten back on track this summer. I still haven't gotten medical help because I don't have insurance, but I've been doing little things here and there to cope with it. Now I have a job that I've had since July this summer.

My worries are that my mental health may only get worse if I stay. However, I'm afraid it may be the same when I move out because of all the bills I would have to pay and the debts I'm already paying. I just really want to live somewhere where I don't have to constantly argue with people. I love my family, but it's becoming a lot.

Should I just suck it up and live at home ore should I push towards living on my own? Any suggestion would really help, I don't know was hat to do.

TLDR; I hate living at home, but my mental health has caused me to quit many jobs before, which can be of risk when moving on my own.

536,I’m a female and I’m going on a date with a girl for the first time. I’m 27 and have only dated men before. This is something I’ve always been curious about just too chicken to actually act on it. I met her on bumble and I haven’t told her she’s the first girl I’ve ever been out with. What should I expect?

539,"So I'm 22 male, my friend is 21 who I've known since 13 years old. We went through school together and all the rest of it. My problem is whenever I'm with him it doesn't feel like a normal friendship.

 For example normal friends might go to the movies together, go out to eat, camp out, fishing, sports, guitar etc. But we've never really done any of that. After school we would play football or xbox alot or just chill, but once he turned 16 or so, he just started smoking weed and from there it got worse. 

Whenever I'm with him now all he wants to do and all he talks about is smoking weed, doing other drugs (cocaine, mdma etc), drinking, drama and getting girls. That's it. I don't do drugs, I don't even really drink because of my horrendous hangovers... Not worth it. 

We were out the other night just me and him and then he wanted one of his friends to come along, so his friend turned up. His friend has always done drugs, and there's never been a time where I've been around him and he hasn't done them. Shortly they begin talking about drugs and getting some cocaine. So the night turns from a normal night to a night about drugs. Next thing we leave from the bar we're at, because they want to go pick up their drugs, then about half an hour later they're sniffing cocaine right next to me. I'm thinking why the fuck am I with these two people. Then they want to go to someone else's house (another druggie or low life) and I go home. Night over. 

I'm not gaining anything from this friendship and I don't even want to be around people like this anymore, where the only thing they care about is drinking, drugs, drama and girls. When we're out he will ring up his other friends (who do drugs and are going nowhere in life and invites them out with us). Then they all also just want to drink and do drugs and then I'm the odd one out. he started doing smoking weed at 16 and then other drugs at 17/18  now at nearly 22 he's still in the same position. He doesn't do them everyday but I feel he will always be like that.

That's just one side of it. I haven't even spoken about what he's like as a person that puts me off him. He'll put me down, wants me to pay for everything, borrow him money, quite bossy, but won't be told what to do, never thinks he's wrong, very over powering can't take criticism but cricises, starts fights when out drinking, feels the need to prove he can hold his own (especially in front on girls) etc. I won't see him for months and I never miss him. I just want a normal friend. One that I can chill with, play guitar, workout, drink now and then with, have meaningful conversations, similar goals and values etc. With him I just feels we're opposites. 

He has no goals and achievements, doesnt care about bettering himself, doesn't take care of his health, has no empathy for other people....we might have the same sense of humour and can have a laugh when we're together, but I just don't feel that we're aligned that much elsewhere, in what we both want and see as important in life. I've tried to end the friendship by just slowly fading, yet he always comes back after a few months and then I feel guilty and it all starts again. Any advice thanks ",03Dec2018,1

542,"I ordered an item through the US Postal Service. I received an immediate text when it was delivered yesterday, but when I stepped outside to get it there was nothing there.  


I reported this to the post office right away and they returned the call this afternoon, saying that the carrier had given the package to ""the next-door neighbor"" who had claimed that he was authorized by me to receive packages. I never said anything like this to him -- he's the last neighbor I would ever trust to take packages for me.  


I actually have the voice mail message from the post office rep which acknowledges that the carrier had given a neighbor the package without any sort of verification beyond the neighbor's word.  


When I went to ask the neighbor about everything (after getting off the phone with the Postal Service rep), the neighbor said that he had seen the postal worker toss the package over the fence onto the porch and that he had told her to be more careful with the package. He said that the package had landed on the porch. My friend and I looked on and around the porch and it was nowhere to be seen.  


I left home for a few hours, and when I got back about an hour ago he went downstairs to check again. Surprise, surprise, there was the package right where the neighbor had told me it had been. He brought it upstairs and opened the (exterior mailing) package. The item itself had been opened (the hard plastic packaging had been cut) although the contents were all there.  


It's not a particularly interesting or valuable item (probably $20 retail at the most) but the thing that makes me anxious is that the person who opened the package had no idea what was in there -- it could have been something much more important.  


Once I realized the mail had not only been taken &amp; returned but also tampered with, I decided to call the police. Because it had been actually opened, they referred me to the US Postal Inspection Service. They don't open until the morning, so I'm trying to figure out what to do.  


Option 1: Do nothing. I don't want to start a Big Thing over such a minor item, particularly as mail tampering could conceivably send someone to federal prison. And the postal worker could lose her job. Not to mention that this person IS my next-door neighbor and I am going to be living next to him for at least a while.  


Option 2: Talk to him directly. In an ideal world, he would admit that he took it, apologize and get the message not to be doing shady things like this. Yay neighborliness.  


Option 3: Call in the authorities and let the chips fall where they may. Like I said, I don't want this to be a bigger deal than it has to be, but I'm also aware that something more valuable could be taken in future (or may already have been from another neighbor).

547,"On mobile, so excuse the text wall.

Parents are divorced, and at my mom’s house, we originally had a dog and a cat. However, after she began dating a new guy, two other dogs were introduced to the house. I love them, but they are not scared of my cat, and actively chase her and try to play with her, and being that they’re big dogs, they obviously scare her. 

She used to hang out in the living room and visit out and about, but now she just hides under the table or stays in my room, where she can get away. On a side note, we don’t have litter boxes, as my mom didn’t want to deal with them, and my cat learned to just go to the bathroom outside. 

Since the dogs came into the household, she has started marking, mostly in a set of couches in the living room. They’re nice couches, so my mom is understandably pissed. But she’s said that she wants to put her down, even though she’s never taken any steps to try and fix the problem. My mom, my stepdad, and my sister (who’s cat it was originally until she stopped caring for it), all want to put her down. I objected to this, as I think it’s cruel and unfair, and their response was that it was my job to figure out a solution and completely take care of it if necessary.

I even bought my own house that's big enough for a family. I've always liked change.

I feel I missed out on a proper college experience. I was in a committed relationship where I couldn't do anything without her but she never wanted to do anything with me and I lived with my parents. So all I really did was wake up, go to class, come home, play video games, repeat. Only reason I talked to anyone or made friends was because we worked together on projects or to study, but we didn't hang out outside a class setting.

I always felt that I should only stay in a city for a couple years before moving. Kinda nomadic-like, ya know? I like change.

All it really did was make me feel trapped.

Along with this, I feel like everything happened too quickly. I tried to join the military, got kicked out, went to college immediately after, broke up with my gf senior year, took a semester off and realized I needed help to deal with my mental illnesses (something I'm still working on), went back as well as starting a job as a software engineer for a game company as a remote contractor, graduated, got a job at a big company and quit the previous one, bought a brand new car, bought a house.

557,"I'm a 28-year-old undergrad at my campus. During the fall semester of last year, I took a class taught by a female grad student. Her interactions with me seemed to be...more friendly than may have been appropriate. Prolonged staring, standing way too close, someone suggestive jokes. Anyway, I had been fairly isolated and developed feelings for her.

One day I left my laptop in her classroom and when I came back to get it I learned that she had put it in her locker and gone home for the night. I emailed her and she told me to pick her up at her place the next day to drive her to her workplace so she could get it for me. She gave me her phone number and home address.

I knew this wasn't exactly kosher but decided not to say anything. I waited outside in the car for her to get my laptop and when she brought it back down, I could tell she was uneasy. I suspect somebody in the department told her it could reflect poorly on her.

Anyway, she avoids me as much as possible in her class for the next several weeks. After Thanksgiving break rolls around, she evidently realized that I'm not going to say anything, and we got friendly again, but I think other classmates started noticing and she got embarrassed and distanced herself again.

January rolled around, she is no longer my teacher, and I didn't want to pass up an opportunity with somebody I had feelings for, so I texted her asking her to meet me for coffee and got no replay, and I texted an apology three days later and got no reply.

I work on campus next door and she starts avoiding me where I work and my spring semester grad student instructor has a bad attitude towards me at first, but her disposition towards me improves throughout the semester, until suddenly near the end it drops again. For one class session my fall instructor who I asked out subs and she seems ok and friendly to me, but later avoids me again.

Summer rolls around and I'm not taking classes but I still work on campus and live less than a mile away. I keep thinking I can go about my business on campus but whenever I run into members of my department, they act suspicious of me. I run into her a few times, not trying to, and I get the feeling she thinks I'm stalking her.

Fall rolls around, some of the students who were previously ok with me start behaving strangely and I decide to see my adviser. I tell her I asked this woman out, and just that I thought we had a connection. I don't mention the car ride because I don't want her to get reprimanded.

Things seem better for awhile but then my department still acts weird towards me. I hear secondhand that she has left the university. I don't know the true reason, but I feel guilt over it. People in the department I don't even know give me cold stares or smirks. My grades fail, and now I have announced that I am leaving to my adviser.

I know what I did was stupid. It was an act of desperation out of loneliness. But what I need to know is, since I am planning to relocate:

Should I clear the air with my adviser and show her the email where my instructor had me pick her up at her house and gave me her phone number? Would this just cause more problems? Would it seem petty to do so at this point? Could this follow me somehow? Should I just put it behind me?",03Dec2018,1

\-----

I've gone through a good few jobs these past couple of years, one of which I discovered a pretty severe allergy to a sanitation chemical that the company used to clean counters, bathrooms, seats, arm rests, (I worked at a theater), etc.

Unfortunately I found out the hard way by not wearing gloves when first introduced to it during my first day of on the floor training. No one else wore gloves and it wasn't addressed by my supervisor so I assumed it'd be okay, but by the middle of my session after I started feeling like my hands were on fire and going to the bathroom every five minutes to rinse them with no relief, I went to my supervisor with swollen red hands and was sent home with a ""we'll remember to let you wear gloves next time"" so I could keep working with the solution.

&amp;#x200B;

And that worked for a while. I was with them for a solid 10 months before I found a job more in my field of career choice and I had to leave, but throughout my time working for them I was allowed to wear a mask and wear gloves while using the chemical to clean seats in theaters- didn't have much of an issue, but my hands did still have severe reactions to the sanitizer since it was literally everywhere and I couldn't always avoid it, so blistered, sometimes bloody/scabbed over, hands were just something I lived with until I left.

At this new job I didn't work directly with chemicals for cleaning, but was indirectly exposed from the housekeeping and the cleaning I was asked to do at my station. Lysol wipes would destroy my hands when I used them, any kinds of sprays or extra heavy chemicals used for cleaning spills or sanitizing tables, etc. would irritate my sinuses to the point where I my sinuses were burning every time I went in for work. It was bad, but I never thought anything of it.

I'm just a little sensitive to certain smells, that's all.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, I left that job and picked up a part time gig at a coffee chain in my area while I tried going back to school. Maybe the first or second day I was there...I noticed the little red buckets and the testing strips on the counter. They were using a sanitizing solution, but I didn't think they'd use the same as my old theater, they're different industries why would they, so when someone handed me a towel soaked in the stuff and asked me to wipe the counter I did so, bare handed, and tried to ignore that familiar stinging sensation in my palm a few minutes after I'd tried to rinse my hands in the sink.

Turns out it **was** the same solution, or at least something that contained similar components, and I figured, if I explained my last encounter with it, management would at least allow me to wear PPE (personal protective equipment) while on shift so I wouldn't be over exposed to it and risk my hands becoming Freddy Kreuger's wet dream. I explained and they gave me what gloves they did have so I could finish out my shift and then said ""we'd discuss a solution for next time"".

Well, next time came and their solution was to let me go. 

According to their policy, baristas aren't allowed to wear gloves or masks or bandages of any sort while behind the counter because it gives the customers the impression that there is something ""wrong"" with said individual and it will deter the customer and others from ordering or returning to that establishment. They wouldn't accommodate me with gloves, wouldn't give me a different station to work, and it was all because of this sanitizing solution that they used absolutely everywhere. I left with no hard feelings, holding that in knowing I lost a job due to something I couldn't control was tough but I did my best until out of ear shot, and was told repeatedly that ***/I should have notified management immediately about this allergy/*** as it would have saved them time in the hiring process. 

To which I replied ""I would have told you if I knew you used the same product"", and then came the lecture that all beverage and food distribution establishments use the same sanitizing solution and that ***I should have known that***, but it's okay because ""now I do know"" and that should help me find a job that fits better.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I dropped out of school shortly after (because I didn't have income to help pay and our rent went up) and started looking for another job. I found one nearby and have been working there for a month and some change...with a sinus infection afflicting me every few weeks. 

Same story as before.

It's been torture and after the fourth time I was put on antibiotics by my family med. practitioner, she finally said ""let's send you to a specialist, this could be something else"". And that's where we are today. I saw my ENT, for a second time, the first time was in May of this year due to some complications with my tonsils that I don't know if they could be related to this problem, but I saw him and he put that damn camera tube up my nose and told me ***he saw no signs of a sinus infection.***

He thinks that these ""sinus infections"" my doctor has been diagnosing me with are just severe allergy flare ups caused by some sort of trigger- and then it all started to make sense. In just the past month I've been on antibiotics twice within the span of a week, for the same thing: bad sinus infection and minor ear infection. Both times I started feeling congested, having trouble breathing, etc. around the time the cleaning gals would come in and do their thing with their sprays and mops and general sanitizing equipment. My doctor agreed with me that this could very well be the source of my allergic reaction and suggested I wear a mask to work...where I work reception and am the face of the facility when you first come through the door.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I work in geriatric care. I'm merely a receptionist, but I'm front line security for patients with dementia/sundown syndrome etc. and in charge of general greetings when new families come in to find a place for mom or dad...but if either of these individuals saw me wearing a mask every time I was on shift, do you think that a) they'd feel safe around me and b) even want to let their parent live there? I can definitely understand where that coffee chain was coming from when they said it'd deter customers, but in this case I feel it'd just put the fear in my elderly residents and their families that I'm sick/contagious in a home where everyone is sensitive to the smallest of illnesses.

So I've this very strong feeling that wearing PPE at work just isn't going to fly...again.

Which means I might be out of a job...again.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to know if anyone out there has ever experienced the same issue with work and allergies and how you managed it, if you managed it, and whether or not you were able to find a job that you could work without fear of the irritant causing such a severe reaction, as it seems to be causing me a bit more than your average trouble.

My ENT has prescribed allergy medication (Nasacort and Allegra-D) to see if that helps, but he pretty much told me the best thing to do for an allergic reaction is to avoid the allergen all together- which I very well can't go and ask my job's management to change the chemicals they use to clean just for me...so that's where I'm at.

\-----

TL;DR: I'm allergic to cleaning products, wipes, aerosols, chemical solutions, really anything with a heavy/strong scent and it's starting to affect my ability to keep a job as I keep having severe reactions that are really starting to become detrimental to my health and ability to perform at work. Is there anything I can do outside of wearing PPE, which I'm sure won't be allowed in this situation anyways?",03Dec2018,1

570,"Hello r/Advice,

&amp;#x200B;

About two years ago I moved out west (From northeast) to pursue a dream opportunity in the only industry I've ever wanted to work in. The person who hired me talked about advancement opportunities and how the company was headed upward rapidly and they needed more skilled players at the table... Fast forward two years and the person who hired me was driven out and all of those opportunities are non-existent. 

Our company initially hired this individual to head up a new department they had no previous experience in. We were essentially the first team in. Later our team and upper management found out this person didn't actually have the skillset that they claimed and this person was driven out... Leaving a team of skilled people wondering what was next...

Our company then acquired another company with experience in this space and a proven track record. They are out of state and are essentially acting as our new leadership/consultants for our remaining team members. 

During this acquisition my role was essentially put to the back burner and I have been waiting for instructions and more information for almost a year. Which limits me on being able to show results for a raise or promotion. Any ""status"" i thought i had went out the door with the person who hired me. Our higher ups don't know anything about our skillset and are basically handing the keys to this new company... I feel like I am starting at square one.

The only thing keeping me optimistic is the fact that this industry is all located in the area. 5+ companies I aspire to work for are all based in the same city...I saw this opportunity as a stepping stone to pick up more skills and network in the space. None of that has happened. I have applied to these other companies and interviewed at a few. I was overqualified for the few positions I interviewed for. A lot of the mid-level opportunities are acquired from within or by referral.

My girlfriend and I are just making rent and barely able to live out here with all the other expenses. It has turned into a paycheck to paycheck scenario and were both in our late 20's. We don't really have a crew of friends and no family out where we are either.... We want to get married and have kids in the next few years. I just cant fathom doing that in a 500 sq. ft apartment living paycheck to paycheck.

&amp;#x200B;

Where I come from back east the cost of living is half of what it is out here... We have family and friends obviously and would be able to buy our own place in a few years.  The obvious downside is the job opportunities in my space. I would need to find another path...and most likely live at home for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I move back east and start over completely? Shift my focus on home ownership and personal/relationship goals?

&amp;#x200B;

Do I continue to grind out here and hope I land my dream gig, while acquiring more debt to chase this dream?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate all feedback. Thank you for your time.

Hi everyone. I’ve been going to the gym and working out this summer and the past couple of months. I don’t usually go with specific plans in mind, I typically do some cardio and use some of the machines I have at my gym. I mostly just go to get in shape.

However, I’ve been out of commission for a while due to illness and time constraints, but I’m back now. I thought now might be a good time to try my hand at the part of the gym that has always made me nervous, the weights and lifting areas. At my local gym and now at university especially, it has always intimidated me. I don’t really know a ton of good techniques or what is good for me to do, and everyone there is always jacked, while I am definitely not. My biggest fear is always going over there and making a fool of myself and/or hurting myself.

573,"I was raised in a Christian household where my family would pretty well shelter me from the “bad things of the world” but I feel that hurt the transparency with my parents and I as the years grew on. I always felt like a nuisance to them may it be that I screwed up or done something wrong so I decided to never involve myself with much of what they did because I didn’t want to screw up anything. Conversationally, it is never too deep unless it’s philosophy of life itself (which we had once) other than that it’s pretty much “how was your day?” “Good”, and we went on. I feel there is nothing I can relate about them to me because they both talk very little of their early life. My sister is twenty-one and I don’t think even she knows the two have been in a previous marriage.  I feel I am ranting now so back to the main point where I don’t feel my family shares a connection beyond formal and unconditional. When I was at a camp my dad literally just shook my hand and said “hi” and I saw nothing beyond that, it shook me though, as if I were just another guy he knows pretty well. That though, can be translated from his father which the two have an almost similar relationship. My mother is a bit more gentle but a lot more sheltering. When I was fifteen she apologized to me that I had to hear someone say “damn” at a luncheon. I’m seventeen now and still haven’t said the word sex to me yet. Recently I said the word gay and she asked how did I learn that term. This really spoke to me that they really don’t know who I am and when I tried to go and be social with them in the living room it was just dead silence with them on their devices right after they switch the channel from some msnbc drama they think is too violent for me to see. I don’t have any qualms against my religion as I believe it’s the only think that keeps me on track morally.

575,"My dad has had a serious alcohol problem for about 7 years now. It all started I believe when my sister had a serious operation and it all became too stressful for him and he turned to drink. His problem escalated from there, he went from drinking strong lager like 2 cans a day to 4 cans a day then to a hip flask bottle of whiskey a day. On a really bad day had have a bottle of whiskey and some strong beers. 
He has had many serious incident involving falling down the stairs breaking numerous ribs and cuts and bruises to the rest of his body. More recently he had his most serious accident where he smashed his face in to the wooden box in our bathroom, he broke bones in his face and was centimetres from potentially losing his eye. From there he didn't drink for about a month but and me and my mum both really tried to get behind him and support him to stop drinking. Today he drank a whole bottle of whiskey that he had been hiding from us, he fell off his feet and face planted in to the ground, bloodying his nose couldn't speak or move without falling over. I went crazy at him, because I felt so cheated, for the first time i believed that he would stop drinking and he went back to it within a month of almost losing vision in one if his eyes. Me and my sister said some pretty awful things to him to try and get him to stop but it always feel like it never gets through.
He has previously been to AA and had been to the local GP for health, however he never stuck to either. He basically said that AA told him he didn't need to go anymore because they gave him this plan that he needed to stick to, obviously we didn't believe this but we couldnt force him to go and similarly we can't force him to stop drinking. 
I know it's a disease and that he needs to want to stop but is there anyone on here who has been in a similar situation and has any idea what we can do because me and my mum are running out of ideas and don't want to keep putting this faith in him to stop for him to blow it back in our faces.

576,"Sorry in advance for mobile format, but I need to get this out now.

I work at a nice little ice cream parlor which is privately owned and operated. The owner is a wonderful person, very kind caring and understanding. Because our shop is close to the local high school we normally hire students to work since it's a pretty easy and convenient first job. I'm a manager so I've had to train several of our new employees on more than one occasion. We stay open during the winter and since we have a drive through and it's the perfect time to train new workers since business is significantly slower. 

Some pick it up quicker than others but it's not a hard job to do. Knowing what flavors we have and where they are is usually the most difficult part, and its really just a memory game. The thing is, there's a kid who's been working there for over a month, and every day he comes in it's as if he's never worked there a day in his life. He also has an extremely difficult time with situational awareness, like knowing when a customer pulls up, or when to close ice cream cabinets hes opened. Even simple things like covering his mouth when he coughs is escapes him. When asked this week, via text, if he ""could please text us what day [he's] available to work 3-6"" he responded with ""Ok"" when asked again he gave the day and then asked ""What time?""

At times he can be quiet to the point where it almost seems rude at times, but other times he laughs extremely loud and just acts silly all around, doing voices and singing jingles from the Pull-Ups commercials. I'm not sure if he has ADHD or something more severe but I'm almost completely certain his parents aren't doing anything to get him any help.

The first night we worked together we managed to close the store fairly early and got out around 10:30. This kid (K) called his mother to see if she could pick him up since she dropped him off. His mother responded by saying:

""K...every body is already in bed.""

I was pretty shocked. It wasn't like he was out partying, or doing anything stupid, HE WAS WORKING. YOU KNEW HE WAS WORKING. I wasn't going let him walk, he's 16 and it was past curfew for kids under 18. The most insulting part was that the drive to his house was less than 5 minutes away, but it easily would have been a 25+ min walk, plus it was cold out. This was pretty bad but the next time we worked together it was even worse.

I was in for my afternoon shift and K comes in shivering, covered in snow. 

""Holy crap K! Did you walk here?""

""No my dad drove me.""

""Why are you wet and freezing then?""

""He made me ride in the bed of his truck.""

""WTF? WHY??""

""He had work stuff in the passenger seat.""

This was really bad. It's not like the family is poor. Our shop is located in a middle class town. He has several gaming consoles and college aspirations. They have more than one vehicle. I don't think you can justify this personally. 

When his family came by to get ice cream he treated them EXACTLY like he would other customers, not even acknowledging them in a friendly manner, nor them to him. On top of that they had a younger kid with them who they were all smiles with. 

I really think he needs help and I don't think his parents are going to get it for him, on top of treating him like shit.  I'd just like some advice on what I should do.

TL;DR 

A kid I work with was left at work after we closed because his mom couldn't be bothered to pick him up. The next time I saw him his dad made him ride in the bed of his truck to take him to work while it was snowing. On top of all of that I think he might have a mental illness.

I tried to park, there was none, chick who was left cars in and out just shrugged when I asked if there was any other parking around, and if there was someone I should call because I’m running late because of all of this. She said I only know what they tell me. I snapped back at her that it seems like something she should know and drove off. I found public parking a couple of blocks away for 5$. Great.



I wore boots cause I didn’t think I’d be walking much, I have arthritis in both knees and have already had surgery for it this year even though I just turned 30.

They call me and I go upstairs, I’m tense from all of the waiting, annoyed buy the judge’s assistant’s lame jokes and everyone wouldn’t stop talking. 



They called me out and gave me my form back and said because my boyfriend is still unemployed and I’m still in a bad situation that I’m getting deferred again. Fine, I just want to leave. I went downstairs and the clerk asked me when I want to come back. I said I don’t know when my boyfriend will have a job and no week is really good for me.

592,"Ok, so basically I got the Spider-Man PS4 Slim deal at GameStop because I wanted to play some of the PS4 exclusive games and I thought a decent number of my friends played on their PS4’s. Well turns out my friends have PS4’s but don’t play on them anymore. Now I already have an Xbox One so I’d only be missing out on a few games that I want to play and I was also thinking that the PS5 is about to come out in a year or two so by then the PS4 will be kind of outdated. So, I was wondering if first it would be worth it to trade in my PS4 and second if it is worth it, how to convince my parents to let me do it. A thought that I had was that I could use the money from the traded in PlayStation to buy a Switch which in my opinion had more and better exclusives and has a longer lifetime. ",03Dec2018,1

So we all have very different backgrounds in regards to race/ethnicity and religion. M is jewish and is the only jewish suite mate. She also has ADHD which makes her talk a lot without realizing. So D, B, N, and L are all ridiculously mean to M. We put up a Christmas tree in our living room, despite having only 1 christian suite mate, and we all made ornaments to put on the tree. M made an ornament with the star of david in it and put it on the tree and then put a menorah on the window sill so she can do prayers throughout the season (idk what exactly what for but ik she has prayers to do throughout the next few months). D, B, N, and L decided to throw away her ornament and her menorah a few nights ago and then D made a swastika ornament and put it on the tree. They made a group chat called “hitlers seance” to make fun of her and stuff. I have already taken the menorah out of the trash and put M’s ornament back on the tree after trashing the swastika one and I have tried to talk to them about it but they all said that I’m too sensitive and that she deserves it for putting a jewish ornament on the Christmas tree ( even though we have pagan and hindu ornaments on the tree from B and D). I talked to our RA and she just said that its a conflict I need to work through myself and blah blah. H and G also have said things to try and stop the rest but to no avail.

599,"This is just a throw away account because I don't want people I know seeing me post for help lol. It's a long read sorry guys trying to include the details.

Anyway I was in a relationship for a few years and recently got out of one so I'm a little rusty. Im fairly attractive dude with a good physique, I'm funny and i use to know my  way  with talking  to girls  lol . Anyway at the gym there's a girl that I've started to talk to for about month. I've always caught her looking at me and what not and a month ago decided to say hey. After that every time we see each other the conversation gets better. 

Last  few times, we joke and seem to flirt a bit at. She laughs at everything even when I say stupid stuff. Asked her for Instagram she gave it to me, I say little dumb flirty things and she giggles. And she's trying to be cute and I can see her eyes trace my body multiple times when we talk. Last time she actually came to say bye and pretended as if she was going to hit me and teased I'll probably be sad I won't see her for a bit. 

Seen someone else to up to her to try to help her and she ignored him after that. Mean while I go up to her and she's all laughs.

I'm gonna break down today 

Saw her again today and we actually talked a bit, I tease her when she comes because she says she's lazy and doesn't always so I just high fived her and congratulated her she's here. She was adding weight to her squat bar and ended up hitting her nail, and I teased her about her nails being long and she said they can be used to hurt me and proceeded to act cute and act like she was going to scratch me. So I just told her oh so you want to scratch me? But the way I said it was intended to mean something else. and she just giggled and laughed. 

Again later I come back up to her and almost tripped on my way and she started to giggle and say I saw that. So I just told her wow you'd laugh because I almost fell and she just started saying she's clumsy and falls alot and it's okay for her to laugh because she would laugh at her self. So I wanted to test the physical barrier, so I told her if I push you and slightly pushed her shoulder would you find that funny? And she giggled and said no because you pushed me. Proceed to talk a bit more and I ended up telling her oh am I distracting you? And she jokingly says yes and pushed my arm while laughing. So I told her kidding around if I'm bothering you can just tell me but since you don't say anything I guess you don't mind me distracting you and she just blushed a little and started to giggle and laugh some more. And quietly said I'm lucky, and when I asked her to repeat it she did and I said am I lucky though? And she was like are you? And I said idk I'm starting to think I'm getting a bit lucky. And she blushed and giggled.

Fast forward again i start laughing at her because the gym is small so we end up near each other frequently and I just told her you're following me and she laughs and tells me she's hot and I said well I'm cold and I'm blaming you. And she said that doesn't make sense and I told her I know it doesn't I tend not to make sense. And she says I'll keep that in mind, and I said oh so that means you're going to think about me a little and she started to giggle. And I just told her think about what you're going to say, watch what you're going to say now. And she just giggled and said I'm going to say nothing and not answer that. 

Started talking about how long she's been at the gym and she bends down in a way her butt was basically on me and my lower area if I were to have stepped one more step closer. Continues to talk and tell her come see me before you leave and she giggled and agrees 

She does come up and pretends she's going to kick me and I asked how long in total how she's been in here she says 2 hours and again wanted to see if she would allow me to touch her so I gave her a slight Pat on the back and said good for you Pat on the back and she just giggled. Anyway we  talk more and she tells me about her schedule how she's busy with school stuff this and next week. And when she doesn't come here she goes to the gym in her building.

Multiple times beside bending down with her butt towards me and almost on me she had grabbed her breast a few times when talking to me and her butt 

Now I'm pretty sure I got this and that shes into me. But it's either Its going well how I think it is or the opposite. But she goes back and forth with me, allowed my physical interaction and also did it back. Like I said I been out of it for a while haha.

600," I'm 18 and I'm from France. Last year I hated my life and had pretty bad mental issues, so a couple months before my final exams, I dropped out of high-school, so I didn't get my baccalaureate(diploma, like british A-levels). My mom thought it would be a good idea this year to move to Montréal(since I have Canadian citizenship) and continue school there instead of re-taking the year knowing that it's a real possibility that the same problems that made me want to drop out would happen again this year(some include my abusive father and shitty classes). Fast forward to today, we moved and I applied to get into an English ""CEGEP"", a two year pre-university program in Quebec and they accepted me into a springboard program, which apparently means I have to do a long time of chosen courses before I enter into a normal program. From what I understand, it could take me a long time before(at the longest 4 years) I finish the CEGEP and enter university. I don't know if I should move back to France and suck it up and get through the year to get my diploma, which would only ideally take 1 year instead of 3 or 4. What would you do ? Something to consider is that I was doing pretty well in school two years ago, at my *international* high-school(70% of the classes were in English) and we moved last year to a normal french school and I started getting really bad grades because i'm nowhere near as proficient in French than in English, and I don't even think I would have succeeded my final exams, whereas if I stayed in my international program, most of the final exam would be in English. I asked my former teachers at the international school if they would accept me into the program again, but it doesn't work like that, once you leave the program you can't go back, at least not as a senior student.",03Dec2018,1
601,"So the context is a bit of a long story, but here it is as compact as I can make it. Sorry this is long. 

In my senior year of high school I had a best friend. She and I were /so/ close. She was my everything. The thing is we were basically in a relationship just without the title or the kissing. Ive always had a hard time identifying my emotions, and at the time i was going though some stuff so i didn’t realize it. We held hands, we made grand gestures of affection, we made plans for our future. She was my first love. Everything was very emotionally charged and it all crashed down when we planned to go to prom together. 

She called me saying she couldn’t be around me anymore because she was in love with me and that was against her culture. (Being both girls) we lost contact and I moved away for college. A year after the blow up I was still not over her, and I was kinda stalking her blog. I found her suicide note, which discussed me being a factor. I called her family and friends in a panic and she ended up ok, but she didn’t want to see me. Understandable. 

Three years later I was fresh out of an abusive relationship with a total jerk and I moved back home to recover. I decided to try and reach out and apologize for never giving her the reaction to her love confession that she deserved, for causing her pain. And it turns out she was receptive to it and we started talking again. I had my best friend back. And it was better than ever because we were older and wiser. I moved and returned to college and we were solid. 

Until I met my (now) husband. I started seeing him and hers and my contact started to dwindle. I drove across states to introduce him to her and she could barely find time to see me. I spent our only ten minutes introducing them, the two most important people to me, and it was... awkward. 

She stopped replying to my texts as much. She gave me one word replies. Eventually it hurt so much to be the only one initiating conversation that I let it be how it was going to be... so of course we just stopped talking without my constant effort. 

Two years later (six months ago) I got married. I felt it would be weird and rude and... strange to invite her. So I didn’t mention it to her. 

And now I find that she’s blocked me everywhere. Snapchat, blogs, insta, Facebook. Where before she just didn’t really talk to me. She’s listed about wanting her past to take a hint and stay in the past. It hurts so much because I don’t know why. 

I miss her. I really do. I’ve loved her for ten years now. But I don’t know if I should just let her move on and keep that suffering to myself... since I’ve been a villain in her life long enough. Or if I should reach out somehow and find out why she hates me again? I still love her, to some extent, so is it wrong to pursue our friendship now that I’m married?

603,"Hi, I was originally going to post this in Casual Conversation because of the positive experiences I've had on my main account there, but as it turns out a large number of the issues I'm facing are banned for discussion there. I hope this is the correct place to make a post. This ended up being kinda rant-y, but I honestly need to get these words out of my system somehow. If the mods want to delete this because it's too much or not relevant than that's fine.  


I've watched myself and my mental state rot away over the course of about two years. I've never really been stable mentally, as I've suffered through some pretty serious depression since I was as young as twelve. However, my issues magnified after three concurrent deaths of family members. This happened two years ago, during the winter of my junior year of high school. It became much, much harder for me do push myself to do the things I would normally do easily, such as study or participate in my clubs.   


The year after that, through, my senior year of high school, was absolutely painful. By about November of  that school year, I no longer could find the energy to leave my house in the morning. I'd spend entire days and weeks sleeping and crying. There were weeks where I wouldn't be out of my bed for more than an hour total. Before this year, I would cry maybe twice a week, usually before I went to bed. That year, however, it was almost nonstop. There wouldn't be a day that I didn't cry.  


I was lucky to surround myself with the smartest and most hardworking classmates my school had. Being around them pushed my standards for myself much higher than if I was to surround myself with those who didn't. For example, I pushed myself to take six AP classes my senior year, despite my parent's insistence on me not taking those hard classes. I pushed myself to study hard for SATs and such, earning a really high score on it.   


However, hanging out with them senior year felt much more painful than it needed to. I knew I was watching myself crash and burn throughout that year, and it hurt even more when the comparisons I set for myself were super successful students. Every day, I felt more and more inferior to my group of friends. Even if they still included me into activities, I didn't feel as if I was worthy to participate in things with them.  


My inferiority issues began to spiral during the college application period. I felt like trash compared to my friends, thus I prevented myself from applying to the schools I wanted to. I ended up with four applications, two to safe schools, one to an out-of-state technology school I liked and had a high chance of getting into, and one to an in-state technology school that, according to all of the data I could look at, I would get into. My top choice was the in-state tech school, so of course, that's the only school that I didn't get into. Despite my AP scores, my SAT scores, my number and quality of clubs, and my GPA all being much, much higher than both the average and the few friends I knew who got in, I was left with a rejection letter.  


I kinda broke down at this point. I felt worthless and stupid and didn't want to do anything but hole myself into bed. I missed weeks upon weeks of school from just staying at home and sleeping. I regretted not applying to more places. I regretted not trying harder. I regretted just being alive. Hearing that my friends all made it into amazing schools while I was stuck with what I had felt like shit.   


I was originally going to just go to one of my safe schools, since the cost of the out-of-state school was extreme, even with the 10k the school offered me per year. However, during this period of time my parents decided that after 18 years of bitter marriage, they were finally going to divorce. I ended up with not only the stress of feeling like shit at school, but the stress of constant yelling in the house and seeing my parents cry. It soon became my responsibility, as the oldest daughter, to over watch my two younger sisters, one of which was in preschool at the time.  


Amidst all of this, my parents divorcing left me without the information to fill out a FASFA or anything for college loans. I no longer saw my father, and chasing down my parent's tax reports was a wild goose chase. (It turns out they never completed them or something like that, which I only learned about a month ago). I felt too scared to go to a four-year without anything like this filled out, so I decided to just attend community college. I went from being one of the 'overachievers' in high school to some lazy, worthless piece of garbage at community college.   


My grades that year went to shit. I ended up graduating (despite my mother constantly telling me how I was too lazy to graduate), but I honestly didn't feel like I had achieved the sort of happy future that my friends did.   


And now we're at where I am now. Community college. My grandmother has offered to take care of expenses for me. And, honestly, I feel like an absolute waste of those costs. I started off strong, doing well, but about a month or so ago I just kinda broke down. I stopped going to class. I can no longer keep myself awake for more than five hours a day. I feel like absolute shit and end up crying for most of those hours that I am awake. My GPA at fucking community college is about to go to shit. The only reason I didn't end up breaking down earlier was because I convinced myself that my 40-so AP credits will mean that I get to graduate and transfer in a year rather than two, something that I told my friends and family to stop myself seeming like a complete disaster. Of course, the fact that I have barely gone recently means that I'm about to do poorly in all of my classes. Worst thing on top of that is that each and every one of these classes I've already taken in high school, it's just that these didn't transfer.   


I have finals next week. I already know the content for each of the classes, it's just that I'm afraid that I won't do well due to, well, not showing up and doing the work assigned in class. I feel like absolute shit every day and I've attempted to end it all multiple times this year alone. I don't know what to do. I don't have any friends I see at the college. I don't have twenty-so clubs keeping me busy. All I do is sleep and cry.   


I don't know what to do. On top of all of this is telenovela-level drama in my semi-online group of friends that I honestly don't feel like going into, other than that it's a shit load of additional stress. I'm scared to go to class. I don't have the courage to look my professors in the eye after not coming to class for a month. I think some of that is related to recent surfacing of anxiety and PTSD due to fear of authority figures. (Probably has something to do with abuse when I was a kid). I'm scared. I'm completely scared and shaking and crying and I don't know what to do other than to end it all. I'm sure that's not the right answer, but as of right now it's the only escape from the hell hole I've dug myself.  


What do I do about my college situation? Is it even worth going and trying? How in the hell do I talk to my professors about my missed exams? Or my missed assignments? Do I email them? Do I talk to them during office hours? I don't know what to do.

People mind their own business, but they aren’t safe from his shit talking.
