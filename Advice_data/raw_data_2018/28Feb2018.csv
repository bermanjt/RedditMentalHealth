0,"My spouse is passionate about writing. He even got a BA in creative writing. He spends all his free time writing. He has spent the past 5 years writing a novel and is trying to get it published, and he has begun writing short stories.

I spend a lot of my time editing his work -- it sometimes feels like a second job -- and give honest criticism of his work, even though it often ends with a lot of arguing because I hurt his feelings. But when he asks if I believe he is good enough to make it as a successful writer, I lie and say yes.

The fact is, I don't think he is very good. While he is better than he was years ago and better than a lot of people out there who want to be writers, I personally think some of his writing is downright bad.

It is his dream and passion. He hungrily reads everything he can get his hands on. He eats, sleeps, and dreams about writing.

Am I right in unconditionally supporting him in his efforts to become a published author even if I think his writing isn't good and he won't succeed as a bestselling author? Does a good spouse do this for their spouse? Am I being a good spouse?

3,"Title says it all, I had a fucking great start in life, it felt like I had it made at 14-18 I had a girlfriend who was perfect for me at the time. But at 18-19-20 my entire life just kind of went to shit. In every way. 
When I was 15-16 I lost 2 uncles and gran to cancer. 
When I was 18 my dad was 78 I think, and before I know it my entire life is in crisis. 
My ex is leaving me, I am burning bridges with friends, I'm acting out. It just felt like I was going the wrong way with everything. At 20 - my dad was bleeding out his dick and mum had other health trouble. At 21 or 22 my other uncle died of cancer. I kept feeling like I need a change, I need to break free of my small town, my friends, everything. But here I am at 26 - I held myself back because dad was in his 80's and it felt like each year could be the last with him. 
I feel like instead of becoming the man I should be, and getting the life I could of had. I have, If anything reverted, back to square one. 
My ex Is now a professional tattoo artist - (Something we once dreamt of doing together). My friends are all grown men with their shit together. I am unemployed living at home, depressed as hell feeling like I didn't make it. 
I used to be so strong in character, integrity, humor, and it feels like I have just gone to shit. I feel like everyone hates me for acting out and not being myself, but I don't think anyone really knows the inner turmoil I have been going through. 
I knew I should of moved out at 19-20 but I didn't do it. I feel like I have become a shell of myself. I don't know who I am, what I want, where I stand with anything. I just feel like I have completely gone backwards with life. - Like I said there were plenty of things I wanted to do, but didn't, - for example I used to talk to this girl on Skype for a few years, she lived in America - I lived in England - I should of gone over, she said she could have got me work there, we were both into each other etc, but I just held myself back because I didn't want to leave my old parents. The same with another American girl. 
I didn't get a motorbike. I didn't move out. I don't know what has got into me, I used to have the most confidence out of everyone I know. Now I feel like a broken man. 
I hate all of this. I wish I had someone to tell me your going through changes etc and gave me solid advice because it feels like I have just shat all over my life.
I feel like 18-25 should of been the time to grow in confidence, but instead I lost it and now I will have to live with that every day of my life for the next 50 years.

6,"Not sure if this is the right place for this post but I'm stumped. This happened 10 minutes ago. I was sitting down watching tv, when I saw phone call from my friend. I thought nothing of it as he normally calls without warning to go out. When I picked up though, I was greeted by a man yelling at me about fucking around with his girlfriend. After two minutes of this and trying to get my friend to stop joking, it became clear that it was not him and this person was genuinely furious. I hung up and called back to the number, but my friend picked up and had absolutely no clue what was going on. He even sent me his call log for proof. 

I only have the one number on his contact so it wasn't from a number someone else reactivated. I also haven't really talked to any girls lately so I can't imagine the call was meant for me. Now I'm just confused why the call showed up with my friend's contact and shows itself as such in my call log. 

My first thought was spoofing, but that seems to be used by scammers and would be directed at me, but I've no clue about the situation. My second thought is mixed calls but I'm not sure that's even possible. Has anybody had this happen before or have any clue what this was? Also, could it happen again? If so, how could I prevent it?",28Feb2018,1

8,"I’ve been shy and socially anxious my whole life. Making friends has never come naturally to me even though I’m told I look friendly and am very nice. My social skills aren’t really the best at all.

I have a boyfriend of 10 months who’s pretty social and confident. He just moved to my city in August and lately he’s made a lot of friends at his school and work and has been hanging out with them when I’m working. I imagine them having a great time and him maybe flirting though he probably doesn’t but I don’t know. It makes me feel kinda insecure and jealous and resentful of his social ease which I don’t want to feel this way. 

He works part time in the evenings and goes to school part time during the weekdays and lives with his parents. I work Monday-Friday 8-5 on top of part time online classes and a workout schedule, and live alone so have to manage a household. I don’t really have friends at work and have like one other friend who has much better friends than me, plus she’s a little sketchy in character and I’m not sure if I should really be friends with her but I also think she’s awesome in other ways...

I’m so awkward and feel like I need to learn basic social skills as my approach and mindset is all wrong. I don’t know much or care too much about movies and tv and pop culture which I may mistakenly view as a bit of a waste of time. My interests are in personal development, meditation, health and fitness, and optimizing my career and overall life and health. Maybe I need more social interests?

13,"So basically to give you a bit of insight, there is three of them going. One who i've been friends with for 5 years and the other whom I've known all my life but we've always had a weird relationship. 

I am a female, but so is this girl. Our parents are both friends but ever since we where little they have put us in an awkward situation of putting us in competitions with everything. If one child was goo at something apparently the other was way better and it seemed to go on and on. Any way we grew up and I rarely seen her. She's a nice girl don't get me wrong but we've only become friends again really due to my friend of 5 years bumping into her and making really good friends with her and now he is constantly with her. 

That doesn't make me jealous because I find with my friend of 5 years he becomes a bit too much as he is very camp and his way of going about things is different to mine but thats what makes us work and we like that we are able to go with long periods of times without seeing each other as we meet and its only like we met yesterday. So if anything I'm happy they're friend as it means he's happy and got someone there for him 24/7. 

Now the other friend its wayyy more different. This guy became friends with us last year in the end of July. He's one of those who don't make good life decisions and he gets drunk all the time and he just lives for the moment but thats what makes him special. This guy... well me and him have a weird relationship where we only seem to get with each other when we're drunk. It was only kissing for ages and then this weekend it was a bit more but not the full thing. 

He is a charmer and a handsome person and it seems the girl that i've known forever also thinks he's alright looking as they've kissed before when drunk and she's mentioned him to me a few times but then she also likes any guy that is attractive that she see's. Again i'm not sure if something in my head has triggered me off where It's a competition again but my friend of 5 years and the guy had planned a trip to London. 

We live not that far away and live on a little island under England, I got asked to come along and I denied seeing as it will be my 18th birthday the day before they go and it will be my other friends birthday on that day and i don't want to miss that. 

I only though tonight found out they invited the girl to come along and she's now going with them. I need advise because I don't know what this looks like in other peoples eyes. Do I sound jealous because Im worried this girl and the guy I have a drunk relationship with are going to get together? Do I just sound like the competitiveness is kicking in.. Or do I sound like i may have feelings for this guy. my other friends always suggest that we'd be the perfect match and that we should always get together... Yes i have considered it but this guy is a player and I must admit I am too when I'm drunk.. I go for anyone I have an interest in... Im stuck... Why am I feeling Jealous....",28Feb2018,1
15,"Hey all. I’m 17 years old, and possibly made the worst mistake of my life this weekend. I am a senior in highschool, and ever since freshman year, i have been dating one of the most amazing girls i have ever known. She is a very strict Pentecostal, while i myself am not very religious. Her parents found out about this (by going through her phone.) and completely despise me. That’s not even the worst part. This weekend, we were texting like usual, and she says “I’m really horny, can i come over?” This really blew me back, because of her overbearing parents, the most we have ever done is making-out. Since she usually doesn’t make comments like that, i was a little skeptical. I say something along the lines of “Sure, but only to watch a movie.” She comes over to my house, wearing a pair of jeans ( which is almost out of the question for Pentecostal females.) and says she is ready to lose her virginity. I was very happy, as i had wanted to do this for a long time as well, but was scared to press her about it. We go up to my bedroom, start making out, and then it happened. In the middle of the act, she starts crying and gets off of me. Assuming it hurt, i ask her if everything is okay. She says to me, sobbing: “ this was a mistake, oh god i should not have done this.” And quickly got dressed and left. This worried me very much, so i called her multiple times. ( straight to voicemail everytime.) 
     It gets worse though, a few hours after this whole ordeal, i hear a knock at the door. Thinking nothing of it i let my mother answer it. It is my girlfriends father, fuming. He is demanding to speak with me because I “ took his daughters innocence away”. My mother, obviously concerned, let’s me talk to him. He told me that she has no desire to speak to me anymore, and if i ever contacted her again, there would be “ problems”. I am at my wits end, i miss her so much. She was my first love and it completely breaks my heart she does not want to speak with me anymore. I really need some advice.",28Feb2018,73

I never had sex with him, nor did I ever send him nudes but it doesn’t take away from the fact that I did talk to him. On multiple occasions he did beg for sexual favors, to which I denied. Except we did sext a few times. I’ve never done this before him, and I never will do it again. I was looking for love in the wrong place. His girlfriend, who knows and is still with him, found out around November of last year. I never had any malicious intent in mind, and yet I still made the stupid decision of talking to him. How can I cope with this? I see them literally every day. Does it make me a terrible person for doing this? I’d greatly appreciate any opinion/advice on the matter, I’m desperate. ",28Feb2018,1

I know a bunch about star wars and I'm relatively bad at other subjects but he keeps calling me smart and himself dumb cause I know more star wars.

19,"So I live with 3 of my friends. 2 of which I am very close to and get along very well with. We all have the same ideals about contributing to the house and respecting each other's space and rights in the household.

However the fourth housemate is from our social circle but we're not too close to him. He has people over all the time going on 2+ day drug binges. Leaves the house an absolute tip, breaks stuff and just doesn't respect that 3 other people who have jobs live in the house and want to be able to use the space without there being a bunch of people round off their heads.

We've had countless argument but to no avail. So we've decided to tell him that when the lease ends we want him out, or we're all leaving. I would preferably love to tell him to leave now but I was outvoted by the other two.

My question is how do we bring it up In a way that A. Doesn't just get us into an argument and B. Cause him to just be like ""fuck it"" and act out more.

23,"Hello everyone! Just thought I’d see what advice you guys had for me. In late December, my now ex dumped me, so she could go back to the guy she dated before me. Main problem at the moment is that she’s in my major and I have to see her daily in classes (small major (physics) at a big college, about 140 kids in the major out of a  20,000 student population), which is the same thing that caused the stress last month that lead me to attempt to take my own life. 

Doing a lot better with self esteem and value though, learning to love myself! Just not sure what I want to do with my life anymore. I was set on going to grad school and following the academia route to becoming a professor, but not sure if that’s what I want anymore. I know I want to finish my bachelors, but not sure what I should plan to do after that. 

Part of me just wants to travel and adventure across the US, taking odd jobs and just living for a while. But also if I eventually decide I want to get back into academia, I’m guessing it will be difficult because research and scientific discoveries could make my knowledge fairly useless.

28,"I am pretty desperate. I have no one besides my therapist to talk to about this.

Some background. I married into a family with a lot of problems. The kid in question is my nephew. His mother died. His father has been in and out of jail (this is at least what I am told). The family I married into are not trustworthy. They lie and are seriously dramatic. I don’t know if I can trust what information I have.

Okay so the kid. Moms dead and I am married to her brother. Nephew lives with my in laws who are not the nicest or most honest people. I won’t get into the details but they suck and I am grossly understating here. 

Okay so this kid’s dad. I was told he was abusive to Mom, a druggie, in trouble with the law. I don’t know the story but from what I’ve been told he is the scum of the hearth. my In laws don’t have exceptional ethics so if they say he is awful he must be pretty bad right?

So my question is this... do I reach out to Dad or his family? I have never met these people and have been around a few years. Kiddo needs a dad and isn’t doing so hot. It is worth adding that there are abuse and neglect allegations pending against the in laws. Nephew could get taken away. My husband and I are the only family my in laws talk to.

We were playing soccer and he broke my foot because he was losing. He was in denial and I never got to prove it because all of the teachers thought he was a perfect angel. C and I are now no longer friends but I wouldn't really hate him. 

That all changed in 5th grade. C was again, quite the sycophant and sucked up to all the teachers. He was being a jerk, not sharing a magazine, excluding me from everything, pushing me, hurting me even. One day we were reading time for kids, and he held my book down so I couldn't turn the page. He ripped the page and I let go of trying to remove his hand. It looked like a punched him in the jaw, and he made it seem much bigger than it was, even though it was an accident. I almost got kicked out of that school because of him. 

I think this, as well as a growing rivalry in tennis started all this.

Once I entered middle school, I thought this would be over. I remember he asked me which middle school I was going to, I said it and didn't think much of it. Turns out he applied for that school too. We both entered and I was pissed. I told a couple of my friends ""oh he's a jerk."" etc. He punched me in the stomach so hard I had to go home. He, again, never took the blame. This went on, him hurting me, and even saying, ""The reason I do this is because I enjoy watching you cry!"" He would say, You do nothing on the projects! You will never be a part of anything! Why do I always have to deal with you?!

Fast forward a year of emotional and verbal harassment, I'm on the same tennis team. I tell my coach, C and I don't always get along. She then pulls him out to lecture him on being nice to people. I didn't ask for that! All I said was, ""C and I don't always get along"" He tells his mom a ton of bull about how I was in the wrong, etc. etc. His Mom then tells him not to talk to me. He doesn't, except for a few curses. 

Today he calls me a dumbass. It might seem, oh yeah he's just saying that, but I'm the only one that he cusses out. The only reason I even see him is because we share a friend group.

40,"I've been putting off having an uncomfortable conversation with someone I work with, but things came to a head today and I realize I'm going to have to say something. I'm looking for a way to say what I need while remaining professional and understanding. The coworker has the best intentions, but I really need some space to do my job effectively. 

I just started as a carpenter and the old carpenter has stayed on in a different position. I'm not as experienced as he is, but I've worked in a wood shop for several years and have personal preferences for how to operate efficiently; however, every time he sees me doing something differently from how he would do things, he'll stop me, even go so far as to grab a tool out of my hands and tell me how he would complete a project in excruciating detail. Or he will ask me what I'm doing and I have to stop everything to explain every step of my thought process. It is a fast-paced job, and I have a lot of work orders to complete, but every time he comes into the shop, I end up losing half an hour.

I reached my tipping point twice today. Once when he was gossiping in the staff room about how I wasn't doing so great, but he went out of his way to see how I was doing and steered me straight (He interrupted me and told me to fasten something that I was already planning on fastening). The second came when he grabbed a drill out of my hand and used my good chisel to pry a plug out of the hole saw. My heart nearly gave out. And then I was so flustered that I kept making mistakes while he looked on hawkishly and micromanaged my every move.

In the trades, you learn that there's more than one way to skin a cat. The same cut can be made with a table saw, a band saw, a jig saw, a circular saw, a hand saw, or a router if you're so inclined. Speed is more about the operator's skill and comfort level. I feel confident and competent enough to prioritize my projects efficiently without outside help. Don't get me wrong, if I am genuinely stuck on a project, I really appreciate his advice, but it's the unsolicited, unhelpful and premature advice that rubs me the wrong way.

Well, I guess the card company doesn't like to see responsibility and hopes I devolve into further financial carelessness. So they immediately responded by raising my credit line to a mind-boggling $14,000.

I just paid off my car loan, and my plan is to attack this credit card mercilessly. The only reason it got to $8,600 was the ebb and flow of life happening... a $3,000 medical bill, an unexpected repair, etc. Once I pay off this card, I could see myself using a couple thousand in emergencies, with the ultimate goal always to pay it off instead of max it out.

The problem is, using it at all tends to open Pandora's box. It's waaaay too easy for me to say ""well there's a balance on it anyway, what's a tiny bit more"" and then it's out of control.

I suppose it would be good to have the option to have a card with $14K of credit in case something extremely disastrous happens to my family, but I'm tempted to call them and say that's too high to protect me from myself a bit. Is that a stupid idea?",28Feb2018,7

44,"I’m 21 and I want to go back to college, most likely in the fall, and I only managed to complete a year at my local state university. I stopped going so that I could get myself a car as not having one was a huge pain in the ass. I finished paying off my car and quit my second job. At the moment I work a full time job in which I get paid 9.25$ an hour. I live with my parents and pay 650$ a month in bills. Starting in April I should be able to start saving money as I have some unfinished expenses I need to pay off first. I would like to move out soon in June/July, and at this point I might have to hold off until August.  I was thinking of going back to a community college for the first two years to minimize the cost, but I am not sure how I am going to pay for schooling. I want to major in Computer Science. Living with my parents, FAFSA will PROBABLY give me around 4,500$ per year or 2,250$ per semester. But how might this change with me now having a full time job and what will happen if I move out? When I first went to college I didn’t want to take out any loans for college and so my parents struggled but managed to help me pay for the year. I don’t want to impose that on them again and I am considering just taking out loans. If I complete the degree and get a job as a programmer I should be able to pay for my student debt, which I believe should be less than 20,000. One of the last things I want to do is go to college on loans and be thousands of dollars in debt. A semester at my local college is around 2,500$. And at my local university it’s around 5,000$. I’ve been looking at scholarships but haven’t applied to any yet. Last time around I didn’t manage to get a single scholarship. 

TL;DR: I want to move out and go to college at the same time. I can afford to move out since I have friends to roommate with but I am not sure how I will pay for college or if the loans are worth it. ",28Feb2018,1
45,"I've never been one to think dreams mean anything but after the last few nights, I've been losing my mind. I'll spare you the details of everything that happened but long story short, I cut off my best friend in high school because I was in love with her, she didn't feel the same, and I needed to separate myself from her to get over her. That was over 4 years ago. I got over everything a long time ago and we haven't talked at all in probably a couple years. 

Last week, I had a dream I was back home from college and we hung out like it was completely normal. Woke up, thought that was odd, and didn't think much more of it. The next night, same kinda dream, home from school and we were just hanging out together. Again, odd. A few nights ago, I had a dream that she flew out to see me at my university. In the dream, I was shocked to see her but not in a ""we haven't talked in 4 years way, why are you here?"" type of way but just not expecting to see her, like she just surprised me with a visit...if that makes any sense. Then, and this is the one that drove all this home, last night I had a dream she was going to the same college as me now, we were in a fully committed relationship, and I can't figure out where any of this is coming from. I woke up at like 2 am from this one and was more or less having a panic attack and I think I dreamed after I fell asleep again that I texted her about it because I thought I actually did last night but I checked my phone this morning and there wasn't anything there.

And it was kinda weird bc 1) he just randomly approached me in a small ish alley and 2) I know some men, not most, but I’m guessing the type who hit on teenagers, can do out of pocket stuff if you reject them.

47,"I hope this is the right place to post this. 
Last year, I met a guy briefly. We had a blast and he was very sweet. He was passing by, on his way to seethe rest of the world, so I totally got that it would be a two time thing. 

But he kept texting. He asked me to be his LDR girlfriend, he promised he would get back and he would fight until I was in love with him, he said he'd come back for me. He even said I love you.

Silly me believed every word. 

I left my country for a couple of months, but I still tried to keep in touch. During the first two stages of his trip (US, mostly) we were talking regularly. Then, when he started with Asia, he texted less and less. 

He barely texts now. About a month ago he said he missed me a lot. Whenever I text, he replies with one word mostly. 

I decided to delete him from Facebook, to try and move on, but leave his Whatsapp number on my phone. 

Yesterday I was casually browsing reddit and saw a funny comment. The username rang a bell and I clicked it, saw one or two posts and realized this was the same guy. I decided to see a comment or two, out of curiosity. I wanted to see if he ever mentioned me. 

Now I come to find that He has a girlfriend, a local girl in the country he is in. He seems enamored now too. 

I don't know if my heart is broken or if it's just my pride that's been hurt. I can't seem to get over this guy. 

I've come to terms that he won't come back and I need to move on. But there's so much more I want to say, so much angered that's bottled up there, that wants to come out. 

I wanna tell him he shouldn't have played with my feelings. I know that when you travel you forget whatever you leave behind, but there was no need to play me, to make me come out of my shell, to build so many illusions. 

I want to tell him so bad, but I don't know if I should. I don't know what to do. I'm so angry and sad and I can't focus on the good things in my life.

50,"Hi! So my adorable, low miles for the age, great condition Toyota pickup got hit while parked. The front left side is all kinds of smushed. I don’t have insurance because I wasn’t driving it right now (I’ve since learned of parked vehicle insurance but, well, alas). I don’t actually know from a professional that it’s totaled, but the hood is buckled, the bumper area is all up in the wheel well/tire, and the driver’s side door won’t open more than an inch. It does turn over still. 

So, I was never really taught anything about cars growing up. I don’t know how to be a car owner. It was a struggle to even figure out buying this thing! But I did, a few years ago, clean title in my name. I really love this truck, so I don’t want to just dump it somewhere. 

What next steps does one take when their car is trashed? Especially with no insurance involved? Can I sell her probably still very good original parts? Like I said, she was in fairly remarkable condition. If I can sell those... to who? How? I feel very inept at this stuff.

51,"I've been living in my current home for about 6 months now. I live in a carriage house (a smaller house located on a property, similar to a guest house.) 

The carriage house is quite large, and has been redesigned for rental purposes. My landlord has converted the garage into a separate bachelor suite with it's own private entrance. The bachelor suite has been occupied since I moved in. 

Up until recently, everything had been peachy keen. My neighbor didn't cause me much trouble, my utility bills were manageable and I was completely content with my new living space.

A few months ago the tenant living in the bachelor suite moved his girlfriend in. This of course was done against rental rules, as he's paying for a single bachelor suite and only one occupant is allowed. 

Ever since his girlfriend has moved in, living in the carriage house has been hellish. Loud arguments in the middle of the night accompanied by blaring music. We share garbage/recycling, and if there isn't any room for his garage/recycling before the trucks pick up for the week he'll take mine out and throw it in front of my door. His girlfriend and him also always blow the breaker, and will incessantly knock, ring the doorbell and call my cell phone simultaneously until I drop what I'm doing and flick the breaker back on. 

It didn't click in my mind that us sharing the same breaker seemed odd, until I received my latest utility bill last week. It was 8 times what it usually is. I understand that utilities are more expensive in the winter time, but never should my bill be 8 times higher than it was in the fall.

Naturally, I rang up the electricity company and inquired as to why my bill was so high. The CSR went over my usage, noting that there was a massive spike in my electricity use during the week of Christmas. This was strange, as I was away during the holiday's, and all of my lights were turned off and my heat was set low.

I then inquired as to how many meters my house had. Much to my surprise, the CSR confirmed it only had 1. I've been paying for my shitty neighbors irresponsible use of electricity. In fact, I also paid for his overdue bill the first month that I had lived in the carriage house. 

My landlord is frequently out of the country, and is on vacation at the moment so I'm unable to reach her to sort things out. 

Seeing as with only one meter I'm unable to see how much electricity they've been using vs how much I've been using, I'm unsure as to how to approach this situation with my landlord and what to ask for her in compensation, as I've already paid all of the bills in full.

How would you handle this situation/conversation with my landlord? I'm unsure as to how to approach this conversation.

I was a stupid kid and I felt like I had to lie about a lot to seem ""impressive"" or whatever. I realize now how ridiculous that is. In any case I was really broken up about it for a while and we essentially went no contact.

He mentions that he often finds himself wondering about ""who I really am"" since he felt like he was lied to throughout a lot of the relationship. I suggest that we should get coffee someday if he's ever up for it and maybe talk it through. He says that he wants to make plans for this Friday if I'm free and I agree.

Is it a good idea to get coffee with my ex? I hurt him really badly and I'm sure in some ways he's seeking closure but I feel like perhaps seeing him might reopen some old wounds on my part. What do you guys think? Will seeing him just get my hopes up?

56,"I've been feeling down for three years now. There's two things I really crave. Those being sleep and a conversation. I say conversation because back in 8th grade I had legitimate friends. We could joke around, but we could also have real conversations about real events and get really deep sometimes. Now, in highschool, the only thing anyone does is talk at me and throw a handful of jokes around. That's not substantive. Part of the problem, I believe, is my lack of friends. All my friends are guys, but only one spends the majority of the day with me. The rest are kind of socially awkward(so am i though) and so our talks are extremely short and all over the place. The only two girls that talk with me do nothing but talk at me. By that, I mean they don't really want to here my opinion on what they have to say or even expect a response.They only talk to me to vent about random crap because they know I'll at least listen. Besides those two, there are 3 girls that are constantly listening into my conversations(i know this because I've literally seen them stop talking and stare at me when I'm talking to other people). And even though I'll notice and invite them into my talks, they'd rather listen in and interject randomly calling what i and my buddies have to say as ""stupid"" or ""dumb"" or ""that doesnt make sense"" when they aren't in the conversation and if they were, we're clearly just joking around and having fun. I guess my point is that I'm really tired of being talked at, having talks that never get serious, and having people who are constantly interjecting in my talks but never actually want to join in. I feel like I'm only wanted for meaningless conversations and a handful of jokes. I want to know how to find a quality friend that will have real conversation with me. I've already tried reaching out to people. I try that everyday and get nowhere. I've tried going whole days trying to steer conversations towards the serious side, but it only makes people not want to talk to me. Basically, I want to be able to talk about life, the world, problems, ""what's going on with you"", ""what's it like at home"", ""what are your thoughts on xyz"". You know?

The way I see friends; they're an investment. If you want them to be in your life long term, you both have to invest in each other with time, money, and whatever else that brings trust and respect.

These days people have.. well, ""so little free time"" because they fill their time up with many other things. People eat, sleep, poop, shower and clean, work, go to school, spend time with their family, do their hobbies, and hang out with closest friends.

I am someone who moves a lot and know family/friends in different regions/countries. So family and a lot of my current.. ""friends"" that have grown extremely distant these recent times. Now at most all that happens is maybe a few messages to each other through social media, which I really don't frequent social media. 

I'm not purposely being distant, I'm literally long distance. It's hard to manage, and I wonder what is the point anymore of talking to anyone except my bros who I know will be buddies for life kind of bros.

I've made software for rendering fractals, games for my calculator (programmed in C: pacman, 3d raycasting maze game, connect4 engine, etc), neural networks (I made a genetic algorithm which produced a neural network which scored 4000 in flappybird), websites (I programmed one for my school's NHS program from scratch), CPUs in minecraft and logisim, an assembler for a SUBLEQ OISC, my own programming languages, etc.

That said, I can't seem to find the recognition I wish I had for what I've been doing. I've applied for some scholarships and never advanced in any of them (I guess they don't really value the dream of being a theoretical computer science researcher). The only scholarships I could find pertaining to computer science were for minorities and the poor (and unfortunately my situation does not permit me to utilize the latter). 

The best recognition I feel like I have received for something was an internship as a data scientist for http://thetileapp.com/, but after returning I felt a hole in me. Apart from that, nobody besides the people at which I shoved my work in their face has given me any recognition. And I understand why -- it's hard for someone to understand how much work I put into a finished product. That's where it would help to have someone who I could collaborate with, but the only other person who seems to program at this school doesn't seem to be interested in collaborating.

This is coming after my girlfriend received a major scholarship, one which I had applied to and never passed the first stage. I feel happy for her, and it makes me feel like a terrible person to think the way I am after she has just achieved something so significant.

I'm getting tired of high school and just want to see my work pay off.

I don't have friends in the class, so got placed in a group with 3 other loners. I started communicating early, asking to meet up, share their ideas, etc. No responses, so I do the background write up myself (the bulk of the actual work). I catch up with them and say I'm happy to have done the whole write up, as long as they can put together the powerpoint. They agree. Weeks go by, I send a reminder email, I hear nothing. This is maybe a month til its due, and knowing that leaving it til last minute will be a train wreck, I make the powerpoint myself. I manage to meet with them again, tell them I finished the video, and that all I need from them is to send me some files to supplement the video. Again, enthusiastic agreement. It is now due in one week. I received a file from two members; one of which is half marginal, half garbage, and the other of which is complete garbage. The other member has sent me nothing. So I will end up doing that part myself too. It is clear that they do not give a single fuck about this grade. My dilemma is now should I go to the professor or not. I know it isn't fair to blindside these people with a zero, and I wouldn't look forwards to sitting in class with them after they get their rude awakening. However, I would also feel dishonest putting their names on a project that they literally contributed nothing to. The prof has clearly stated that she doesn't want slackers to get a free ride, but I was trying to be charitable and give them as long as possible to get their work to me, which is why I waited this close to the due date.

My wife drives 60 mile round trip daily full time awesome health benefits for our family makes about 13.50 has worked there 10 years.

Jobs are few and far between in our area great paying jobs even rarer.   I stumbled into my current job a few years ago and I'm perfectly happy.

I just feel like both of us combined should be making much more than what we are.  We're both gaining in age I'm 42 she's 39.  We have a 3 year old daughter.   We live in her parents old house which we pay no rent or utilities.  If we had to I have no idea how we would make it.  

I used to farm but a back injury changed that.  I can't stand for long periods hour or more.

But I feel I need to take on an extra job in the evenings. But I love the time in the evenings and weekends I get to spend with them.     I feel like I'm failing as a provider to my family.

79,"So my dad and his girlfriend have been dating since may and are moving fast, which is fine, but both they and her freshman in high school son have been making jokes about getting married and moving into her house. Me being a junior and living at my dad’s, which helped as a constant through my parents’ divorce and life in general, I naturally want to stay at my home for my last year of high school before I leave to go to college. It’s nothing against the girlfriend and her son, I like them both, but I just want to hang on to my house before I leave for college and then I’m ok with the merge and having that be my dad’s (and new family’s) home but I seem to be the only one who shares that sentiment. My older brother who is a senior in high school doesn’t care much and the son and the girlfriend are both excited. I’ve tried to talk to my dad about it but he took a “passive” stance and just told me that his girlfriend would love us to move in sooner rather than later. I told him my thoughts and he said “we’ll see, it’s not definite”. It may seem selfish but in a year of big changes coming up with my brother and my senior friends that I’m closest out of all of my friends with leaving I want to stay in my house. Am I wrong in thinking this way? If so, how do I accept it as there aren’t many negatives besides loss of sentimental value and threat of change yet I still hesitate.

81,"It is currently 4 O'clock and I have been searching for a place where I can ask a question that kept me searching. How can I become cute? A bit of Context. I am a 188 cm (around 6'2) 16 y/o bisexual male who is a bit chubby. And I was always interested in being cute. So for around an hour, I have been searching on the Internet how I can ask my question. I didn't find anything. So my first question would be: Where can I find such a place. This can be anywhere on the Internet and not just Reddit.



I now noticed that some people on this sub may also be able to solve this problem of mine. So for them, I give extra context. I have recently been finding this game called Danganronpa. Maybe someone knows that game. I instantly fell in love with the character Chihiro. I read more about her and found out that she isn't a she but a he. I read more about him and this reignited my interest in being cute. And this time stronger than ever before. Now the problem is with my male 188cm I won't get very far in the cute game. But I am open to everything. I don't care if that is finding a gay boyfriend or cross-dressing or something(Though I would be very interested in Cross-dressing/Genderfluidity). My biggest problem is my height. Unless there is a quick way of losing a quick 30 cm, I won't achieve my dream height. But I think I have the acting cute thing prepared and sometimes ready for emergencies prepared. So my second question is how can I get cute.



Yeah, that was it. I am really glad I got this off my chest. Please do not spoil anything in Danganronpa beyond the first chapter. I only bought this game yesterday and the only thing I know is that A character that i really like dies in the second chapter. Because fuck me, am I right?

82,"TL;DR I don't want to be a farmer, but my college degree probably wasn't the greatest choice for me.


I'll try to keep this short if I can.

I grew up on a small family farm in the Midwest. I did not like it one bit.  I have heard the story a hundred times: When I was 6, I came in the house from helping my dad with chores.  My grandpa was there and asked, ""How were chores?"" My response was something along the lines of ""At least I know I'm not doing this shit when I grow up"".  So it was known that I would not be taking over the family farm.

I decided instead to be an architect.

Fast forward through graduating high school, I moved to Home State University (with relatively good architecture program). I  ended up in Industrial Design (designing consumer products) instead honestly because I felt like I fit in better with that program and other prospective students.  Met a girl (E) sophomore year and dated until we graduated because I fell in love with (C).  Clearly I am no longer talking to E but as things go, C is no longer speaking to me either. That situation still really hurts and I would love to tell you all about it, but for brevity's sake, I won't.

When I graduated, I was kind of looking for jobs, but that last semester was incredibly difficult. With projects piling up, I put my portfolio (even though it was a class project in and of itself) on the backburner.  April 2017 was when I learned that my dad was having surgery on his ankle and would not be allowed to walk for 6 months.  It's kind of hard to farm when you're 60 and can't walk. But this is almost good news for me as now I have an excuse to move back home and not worry about getting a job right away.

My dad has been in good health now for some time, but here I am still at home.  The thing is though that I don't hate farming as much as I used to.  Sure there are things that suck, but when I was younger, that's all I could see. Now I know that everything has it's downsides.  Industrial Design was extremely stressful.  My Junior year I slept under my desk for three nights to finish a project in time. Back at home there is stress of course, but it's nothing in comparison.

I could look for a minimum wage job somewhere, but I feel like that would almost be a step backward.  Sure I'd be in a new environment, but it seems that I would be even more exhausted at the end of the day than I am now. Plus, I would have bills to worry about.

And frankly, I wasn't that great at industrial design.  I could do the work, but I'm not great at sketching (an essential skill) or using adobe programs.  I'm alright at 3D modeling, but not on a technical level.  I can work a 3D printer, but it seems like all CAD jobs want engineers with 3-5 years of experience, not designers somewhat fresh out of college. I did like it though. Designing. It's very rewarding work, and there are aspects of design that I love (human factors and bicycles), but I still wish I had gotten a degree in a more technical field. Which might be possible? I'm told that getting a master's degree is an option. And since I don't have any student loans (THANK GOD), I could take out some.

I know I'm not doing myself any favors and the longer I put off working on my portfolio, the less employable I become. But I feel stuck and don't know what to do. ",28Feb2018,2

84,"Just a warning, this is going to be kinda graphic because of it’s nature. Apologies. 

Hi. I’m 16. I need some advice to either ease my mind or prepare me for something really bad. About two weeks ago, me and my girlfriend had *sex*, which was basically me teasing her without penetrating inside,
We wore no condom, and I didn’t climax. Ever since then, I’ve had horrible anxiety about it all day every day, because she’s had some weird symptoms which may or may not be related.

I need someone to tell me the likelihood of pregnancy with the following facts.

I did not penetrate all the way
I did not climax
It was not for long, a minute or two maximum. This happened on Thursday the 15’th I believe. 

On Wednesday the 21’st she said that she had white discharge.
On Thursday of last week she fainted in school and said she was twitchy, and was taken home before seeing a doctor. She had low blood pressure which the doctor believes to be a result of POTS syndrome, but is unsure. 

She has been moderately sick since, and reports that she hears things differently now, this is likely an unrelated but unconfirmed ear infection.

85,"Hey everyone. I'm feeling really overwhelmed and lonely lately. I need to vent somewhere. This is going to sound like a lot of pathetic complaining, but I'm really not one to talk about my problems often. I just feel weak right now.


I guess I'll just start with the biggest thing. 


In November my girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me. I had never been in a serious relationship before her. I loved her so much, and she helped me become a better person than I could ever become without her. Ironically, I think all the things she helped me become ended up hurting us both. 

I'm in college now and I've been getting a lot of attention from women, the kind I've never gotten before. One girl in particular continued to pursue me, and I won't lie, I did flirt with her a bit too. And I enjoyed it, but didn't want to.

I was open with my ex about it. It was really hard but we sorted through it all and we stayed together about one more month before she told me she couldn't handle it and it was best if we broke up.


Around New Years I was feeling really lonely and went to a party with a friend. We ended up sleeping together and I regretted it and haven't really spoken to her much since.

In late January I texted my ex. I did it because I had gotten feelings for her again. She told me she still wanted me to. After a few days of talking and sorting through things I think we both got cold feet about it all and decided it would probably be best if we both took time to ourselves a bit longer. 

It's been over a month since that. She's ready for me if and when I want to go back to her. She's wonderful, the kind of girl guys spend their whole lives looking for. She's perfect but I keep feeling like I'll just want something else eventually and end up hurting her.

I really want to want her but I worry that I don't. Some days it seems so positively clear to me that I don't want anything else, and other days I'm not so sure.

I know she'd be okay without me, but I'm thinking of what's best for me. I know the best version of my life is the one where I can be with her. But I don't think I'm mature and smart enough to see the value in what I have with her. 

I want to be with her. But some part of me I hate, no matter how reasonable or realistic, is wanting ""new"" and ""exciting"".

I'm a 20 year old guy. I'm supposed to feel all hormonal like this. I've chocked it up to porn and I'm 40 days into NoFap but I'm like 98% sure not jerking off, reading Vonnegut, eating lettuce and lifting weights won't change shit. Especially not in a short month. 

To add on top of all that there's this really nice girl in one of my classes and she's been laying the flirtation on thick. She's gorgeous and really cool too. I just wanted to be her friend since we were the only people sitting next to each other, but she seems like she's interested. Now it seems like I either reject her and ruin any chance of being friends or lead it on and never act on it and have her lose interest in me as a person all together. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


My best friend tried to kill himself last week. Or he wanted to. 

I've known this guy since high school, we weren't very close back then but this entire last year I've spent so much time with him I feel like I've known him forever. 

We write music together. I always admired and looked up to this dude so much you wouldn't believe it. It makes me feel like a better person to know he thinks of me as his best friend. He's never let anyone as in as he's let me.

Mostly because he can't talk to his girlfriend/family about the shit he's told me.

I'm the only one who knows some things about him. He drank an entire bottle of Jameson one night last week to work up the courage to do it.

In the middle of the night he started texting me and I decided to call him. We talked for around an hour, he was a complete mess but I convinced him to call 911.

I stayed up until hours later when his dad called me and told me he as alright.

The next day he sent his one and only text to me telling me he appreciated me and he was going to be kept at an inpatient care facility. We haven't spoken since.

I love the dude. Spending time with him kept me from feeling lonely while I was alone. I miss him and just want him to be okay.


What's weird though is how I've been feeling about our friendship. I'm feeling similar to my ex, like I don't want it.

I've began to notice this repeating pattern. I push people away whenever they get close and I don't know why. Whether it's being recognized at Subway or my father and I having a deep talk. Whenever someone seems to really care for me I feel like I don't want them. I've blocked out so many people because of this and I just don't know why.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I can't see a version of my life that isn't living out a ridiculous dream where I'm happy. 

I've spent the last two semesters ""exploring"". From business, to screenwriting, to coding I just can't find anything I could see myself doing and enjoying outside of music. 

I sing for 2 bands. The experimental stuff with my best friend and this garage rock band I started with some guys from school. 

The thing is, I'm just not that good of a singer. I know it and everyone I play with knows it and it's not like we don't talk about it.

I know the only way to get better is by doing it, and I am. And I know I can't know I'll fail unless I try, and I will. 

I guess that one just gets heavy sometimes. 

I work at Walmart and have for almost 2 years. I've been ""trying to leave"" ever since I got the job. There's so many stories of people like me who end up in the same spot for the next 40 years. 

I don't need all the success in the world I just need to not feel like a failure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I really want more friends. Outside of my band friends and my buddy who's getting care I don't really have anyone else. 

I don't know how to find a crowd that works with me. I see people around campus I'd like to be friends with but I'm terrible at approaching people and just don't know how. 

Specifically I just want to go to parties. Almost every day I'm going to malls and grocery stores because I'm just comfortable around large groups of people. I see groups of friends on instagram and stuff and just wish I could be one of them.

87,"My boyfriend and I have been together about a year and live together. We live about half an hour away from his mother and are struggling financially so try to cut costs as much as possible - meaning groceries and more specifically, gas. 

I have owned my 4 pound, toothless, 13 year old chihuahua for eight years since I rescued him. We are both very attached to each other. He used to wet the bed and his hair was all fallen out before me. He was also once my emotional support animal and I used to be very dependent on him, but as I've progressed mentally, I consider him ""retired"" and don't take him out everywhere with me as much as I used to. He has also since gotten very old and frail and does not like to move around as much anymore.
He is a VERY good dog. He doesn't bark at much at all and is perfectly content sitting in your lap for hours and hours. Even if you piss him off (VERY rare, but sometimes moving him when he's comfortable does it) he has no teeth so he can only gum you angrily for one second. Everyone loves and fusses over him when I bring him out on walks or to parties.

Ever since my boyfriend's mom got back from her month-long trip back home to the Philippines, she is very persistent on asking to babysit my dog. He doesn't need babysitting, he's home alone 2 hours tops at a time with my boyfriend and my schedules. She also doesn't drive, so she depends on us to bring him down to her (a 1 hour total drive to &amp; from). We used to live with her and it was fine when she would take him from our bedroom then because he would always just come right back to bed when he wanted me again. Typically it'd take him about an hour. This is the first dog she's ever not been afraid of.

Now, the problem here is, my boyfriend's mom and I don't connect on anything except for my dog. She will ask me how my dog is doing before she asks how I'm doing. He's 90% of all conversations I have with her. I cannot exaggerate this. I would hate to take away the only thing she seems to care about me for, but as my dog gets older and weaker, I can't help but feel the days I spend with him are getting more and more precious. Especially when I feel I only get him on weekends. I also worry if this is something that he is okay with, as he is very attached to me and gets super jealous of my cats for even jumping on the same bed as me.
I worry that he is also something that my boyfriend's mom uses to connect with her husband on, as they both love him very much and have had a lot of problems between each other.
When I express this to my boyfriend, he explains it's hard to talk to his mom because she takes everything personally. These are his words, not mine. Like, if I were to ask her not to ask for him so much, she would have her feelings hurt.

Do I just endure this? What could I possibly do that doesn't complicate this situation to hell? I will take any and all comments, advice, and perceptions. This is hard. Thank you!

*TLDR:* Boyfriend's mom wants to babysit my very old, tiny dog for a big part of the week, every week. He is the only thing she talks to me about and I'm afraid of taking that away from us because I am eager to have a relationship with her as she is my boyfriend's mother. As he gets old and weak - I feel I am missing out on very valuable, possible last moments with him. My dog and I are both very attached to each other and I worry about him being uncomfortable/missing me as well. No idea how to go about the situation.",28Feb2018,32
88,"So, I'm a junior in high school right now, and I'm starting to plan for the future. I currently live in Arkansas, and I hate it. I was raised in a quasi-cultish church, that was exetremely Evangelical for a good chunk of my childhood, until my parents finally switched to a much more relaxed church. From about the ages of 10-16, I my life was full of guilt, anger, confusion, and lots of sleepless nights. I'm an agnostic now, and I've mostly finished the process of growing up and sorting out all of my personal beliefs.

The problem is that now, I feel like my world view is mostly incompatible with living in the Bible belt. I've developed a huge interest and love for things like philosophy over the years, but I have absolutely nobody to talk to about any of it. It seems that everybody just lets the Bible answer all of the big questions about life for them, and they don't ever think about them.  It's just so hard for me to find any like-minded friends, and I've become exetremely lonely. I also have had a lot of trouble with girls. Any girl I'm interested in always turns out to be exetremely religious. While I have a girlfriend currently, we've both agreed that we're going to have to part ways when she goes to college in August, and even she is a Christian, but a very, very liberal one. I was also super lucky to meet her on a Reddit thread, where we were both complaining about living here in this state.

I'm just very scared what my future holds for me. I'm afraid if I stay here in Arkansas, I'm never going to find any close friends or get another girlfriend. I just don't feel like I belong here, and I desperately want to leave, and I want to leave as soon as possible, which is why I'm really hoping to go out of state for college. The problem with that of course, is that going out of state is going to cost me a shit ton of money. The only way I can get out of here without drowning in debt is if my exetremely rich uncle helps me pay for college.

My uncle is a millionaire, maybe a multimillionaire, and he has offered to pay for me to go to college in Chicago, where he lives. I've always been almost like a son to him. He isn't married and he has no kids, and his social skills are really bad, so I'm like the closest relationship that he has. My parents however, have been warning me not to take him up on his offer. Keep in mind though, that I have not yet told them I'm agnostic or why I want to leave the state. My uncle has occasionally said he would give my parents money in the past, and then changed his mind, although it's never been for anything exetremely expensive. I think once he said he would help pay for a vacation,  and then he decided not to. My parents have also told me that it isn't a good idea to give anybody that much control over me. My parents have an pretty negative view of my uncle though, because he isn't a Christian, and he's gay. I suspect that the only reasons that they have much of a relationship with him is because he can help them when they need money, and because he's formed a close bond with me and my siblings, although I'm definitely his favorite.

Currently, I'm very torn about what path I should take. I really want to leave Arkansas, but I know I won't be able to unless my uncle helps me. I'm not really afraid of him changing his mind. I know he cares more about me than probably anybody, and I don't think he would do that, but the chance that he'd do that is still there, and if he does, I'm pretty much fucked. What I'm mostly worried about is that I'm not sure if I want to give my uncle that much power over me. If he pays for my college, I'm going to owe him a lot, and I'm not sure if he'd abuse that power. Since he's such a wealthy, intelligent guy, he can sometimes try to get me interested in lots of carriers that may be considered prestigious, or just things that make lots of money. When I was young, he would often try to do things and get me presents that might make me want to become a doctor or a something else that he thought was important. I remember that when I was ten, he bought me a computer on the condition that I would promise to use it to try and learn python, which a dabbled in just a little, but never really got into.  Currently, my plan is to major in philosophy as an undergrad, and then go to law school, or get a PhD in philosophy if I turn out to be really good at it. I'm not sure if he'd like that plan.

Once I was talking to him about maybe taking a gap year in Chicago, just so tuition would be cheaper, and then he told my parents about this plan he had for me, where I'd be an intern at his work during the day, and a waiter at night. My parents didn't like this idea, and they thought it was quite manipulative and scary that he has a whole plan like that, without even asking me. I told him I didn't like this idea either though, and he hasn't talked about it since.

I'm just not sure what I should do. I want to leave this place so bad. I'm so lonely and depressed here, and I think if I leave, I'll finally be happy, but I'm afraid that maybe it just doesn't matter where I go, and I'm just going to be like this no matter what. Maybe I'm just weird and unlikable.

Should I trust my uncle to get me out of here? I'm just really not sure.

I'm planning to tell him everything about why I want to get out of here next time I see him, which should be in a few weeks, and I'm hoping he'll agree to help me make up for all the money I'd be losing from leaving the state, but I'm not sure exactly how to ask him for so much money. I also want to make it clear that I don't want him to control me, but I'm not sure how to without seeming greedy and suspicious.  If anybody could help me that would be great.

I'm really scared. I don't want to be sad and lonely forever.

96,I’m 20 and I don’t have any friends anymore because I just lost touch and now they moved on .I don’t know where to go to meet girls and people without ending up with some freaks. I thought about it yesterday since my work season is starting I have a  landscaping business and cut over 120 peoples yards and work 6-7 days a week all day long so I’m too busy in the summer to “search” for people but in the winter I live like a damn shut in and get really lonely. Is there a way that I can get back to the social circle and meet cool people again or am I screwed. ,28Feb2018,2
97,"After 7 years of dragging out my university degree (27/32 courses completed), I have been kicked out recently with my application for re-enrollment being denied today. I am devastated that I will not be able to pursue a career in the field I wanted to (engineering) and have wasted 7 years of my life with $70k of debt and absolutely nothing to show for it. 

I am honestly at a total loss on where to go from here and what to tell my friends/family that have been expecting my graduation for years now. In particular my parents and grandparents who have been eagerly awaiting me to complete my course. I feel terrible because im a shitty son and have been sponging off my parents for most of my studies.

98,"TL;DR - I may have prevented someone with an infant, girlfriend, and various debts from receiving workers comp by telling the truth about an incident. I did was I believed was best. What is your take on this?

I recently quit my job as a roofer to pursue some bigger and better things in life. All in all, it was a short career (roughly 4 months). This was my first trade job and it exposed me to things I wouldn't have normally experienced, both good and bad.

Long story short, most everyone in the company drank and smoked weed on the job. They also had a general disregard for safety, such as not bothering to properly secure fall protection equipment. I'm sober, and ignored people who drank and smoked on the job as long as they could handle it, as many of these young guys had debts, child support, rent, families, and other expenses to take care of early in life. I didn't want to screw someone out of a good paying job for that, especially since I knew I wasn't going be working there forever/make a career out of roofing.

In my last month as a roofer, a guy on our job fell off of a one story roof and ended up in the hospital with some serious head and neck injuries. He, like everyone else at lunch (minus myself), had been smoking and drinking on the job. I felt bad for him and his family, but felt that it was his own fault for putting himself in danger by getting high at work and not following safety procedures. I told the crew manager about the general situation, as I felt I couldn't keep quiet any longer. About 10-14 days later, I quit to pursue other career opportunities.

Today I get a call from a workers comp insurance company asking me to do a phone interview about what happened to the guy who fell off the roof. I told them exactly what I told the crew manager the day after the incident; most of the guys are using at work, as was the guy who fell off the roof shortly before he fell.

On the one hand, I'm insulated from all of this; I have an education and a potential career forming. I'll never have to work with that company again and face the injured guy or any of his friends. I have no children or dependents, and I'm debt free and in good health. He is the one who is responsible for his own safety on the job, and cannot hold others hostage by expecting them to lie for him when asked what happened.

 On the other hand, by telling the truth, I may have prevented him from collecting insurance money that would have kept him (and by extension his family, who are innocent of his actions) out of life crushing debt. 

It seems to me there were no good ways out of this situation. Either sacrifice my integrity and potentially have another employee at that company get hurt because the company culture did not change, or potentially crush one guy and his family with healthcare debt.

99,"Hello everyone,

I graduated school in 2016 and immediately moved 1000 miles away from my hometown for a job. My hometown is Indianapolis which I understand the job market is not as great a where I moved to in Texas. Anyway the career path Im on has some major road blocks. I want to be in outside sales, I'm currently doing inside sales and have been promoted a few times. The problem is that my company actively believes that when an inside seller is good they are only good at inside sales and would not be a good fit for the outside customers. They believe this so much that they created a team (after I took my job) to nurture people into the field and leave the inside people inside. My goal was to spend some time here and then try to find a role in my company somewhere back in the midwest for family reasons. The longer I work here the more I realize that I was started on the wrong track and there really is no switching at this point. I have recently started looking for jobs in the midwest but I feel like I am giving up to early.

105,"Excuse any formatting issues due to mobile. In the summer 2017 I graduated from University. I didn’t really comprehend what life would become. I started applying for jobs hoping for some experience in my field and ended up being offered the first job I applied for. I was unsure about it but due to advice from my partner and parents I took it because who gets that lucky? Even though it’s not technically in my field it’s full time with benefits and I was picked.

I took the job and several months later it was realized that I’d need a reliable car to do some travelling required a few times a year. I ended up buying new, partially because my parents advised it and partly because my partner did. 

I have now been at this position for 8 months, and I am miserable. The job is more management then mental health (my field) and it has to do with a lot of money. There are a lot of policy decisions to be made. The counselling I do is extremely minimal and more geared towards referrals/suggestions for help elsewhere. The workplace environment isn’t the best (a lot of lateral violence) although it’s also not the worst.

The past few months I find myself stressed more and more, and I’m starting to see where I went wrong. I think I jumped into things faster than I could handle them. I am inexperienced and have some issues that I’ve buried and have happened to come out with the stress and changes. I don’t feel comfortable with the types of decisions I have to make (regarding $$) and management.

However, I feel like there’s no way back to ease into things. I have a car loan I need to keep on top of and there’s no promise of any kind of employment if I leave this position. And I don’t want to fail at the job (even though I might already be, who knows), disappoint my parents, cause a stint in me and my partners future financial plans (finding a place together) or let down my superior by quitting when they took a chance on me. Also since it’s a small community, quitting might have a negative impact on future job prospects/community “reputation”.

But I’m so damn miserable. I’m not happy and it’s getting harder and harder each day. I’m having a hard time just getting up in the morning. And it only gets worse because I feel so damn disrespectful and ungrateful for not appreciating the amazing position some people would kill to be in after graduating. 

I’m not sure what I’m looking for. Perhaps advice on what to do. Or possible ways I might be able to change my situation or at least the way I’m feeling about it. I just need to make some kind of change because I’m really struggling. 

Thank you in advance.

106,"Hi I feel like I’ve posted something like this before. I would by no means consider myself old, but I’m terrified of the concept of aging. It’s like there’s a timer that’s just slowly counting down. I’m 17, but soon I’ll be 18, then I’ll be 20 or 30 or 45 or 50 and then what?

I cant quite pinpoint what about it scared me. I don’t like the idea of forgetting things I currently remember or losing photos or experiences. I guess I’m also scared from a vanity point of view because I take very good care of my skin and I feel like as I age it’s only going to get worse and there’s nothing I can do to stop it.

How do I stop this fear of what I guess I would call slowly dying? There’s times when I can’t sleep at night thinking about these heavier thoughts of what I’m going to do or the futility of aging and not being able to stop it

107,"Hey all. So here's my situation.

A few months ago, me and a few friends from my college planned a cool cross country road trip for spring break. Now that it's coming up, I'm having some reservations. 

One of them being, the car we are intending to take is currently having some problems with the EVAP. Something about a leak. I'm honestly unsure of the details which is making me even more uneasy.

The second issue is, the trip would total to about 4,000 miles. We have safe places to stay every night, but it's still a ton of time in the car. I'm a worry wart who's worried about breakdowns or accidents. I've had an engine overheat before, and especially as a female, it's scary to have a car breakdown on the road. 

The thing is, I feel like I'm locked in, because we are relying on each other to split up gas costs and parking fees. My parents are uneasy too. I've talked to the 3 other girls planning on going, and they all assure me not to worry lol it'll be fine and fun. 

I dunno. If you were me, what would you do? Is there a proper way for me to bail without losing the friendships lol? It would make my parents happy, but I'm very certain it would disappoint my friends. 

Anyway I know it's my fault for getting roped into something I'm uncertain on so no need for a reminder. But I'm wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation, and how they handled it.

But to me, I'm a realist. The bad has usually happened to me, and I don't know how to be positive about things. My life has been pretty shitty, not horrible you know. There's always someone who's had it worse. But if me right now could choose whether I was going to be born, I probably wouldn't bother. It hasn't been great. 

How do I see the positive? How do I not be such a dick? I don't want other people to think I'm an asshole, or negative. I have friends, and I get along with most people I work with. But I realize that I'm not coming across in a positive way all the time.

My father has been paying for all my studies (which is way less than it would cost in the US but still a considerable amount) and I don't think he would approve of me changing programs at this point and if I did I would have to work to pay for everything myself without taking into account the problems it would bring to my relationship with my father.

112,"Backstory - Sister is 21, 1.5 years out of treatment for opiates, all the way to heroin.  During the time she spent in treatment, halfway houses,  she realized she had never really had healthy relationships with men, they were always co-dependant in some form.

For the last year or so my parents, other brother and sister have been helping her.  Occasional money for rent, helping buy used car(s), groceries, etc.  She had been working a few part time jobs and worked up to manager in one.

Now about 6 months ago or so she got more serious with a guy, who was also in recovery.   He doesn't have a job, car, or real place to stay that we know of, what she sees there?  I don't know.  That's not the battle I see worth fighting.  Yes she's an adult, and can make adult decisions.

She's been super stressed at work, and just in general the last month or two.  We find out from her roommate that he's been a bit controlling, reading all her texts, listening to phone calls.  Even accusing her of not being with her mom and I  (Out with someone else) when we were helping her buy a car recently.  Then right before they left he / they set a SIM PIN on the phone she has.  Form what  I understand that blocks all use of the phone's texting and phone calling abilities by a PIN.  Seems odd she'd do that now.

About two weeks ago now, she quits her job, then after she got her last check her and her boy friend just left.  Found out they were going across country almost.  She's been calling our parents begging for money, in tears, for food.  Begging them to cover her rent for her roommate so she won't get evicted.  Parents said no, because they didn't know what was going on, it just didn't seem right.

Well this evening we figured out (video evidence) that she's back into drug use with her BF.  

I mean on the one hand, she's an adult and if she wants to quit her job and join the circus or go with her boyfriend and  get high all day for the rest of her life I guess that's ok... that's a think you can do.  

On the other hand, we know where this road leads, we went down it before and we almost lost her ... She's my little sister and I don't know what to do.  Right now I / We (Family) are trying to be hands off and letting her do her thing and if she needs help / wants help we're here.   It's just hard to watch it.

117,"Let me just sum it up. I’m 20 years old, I’ve been home schooled my ENTIRE life, I am the only sibling out of 4 who has not gone to public school, and also going to be the only sibling out of 4 attending any sort of college.

My older sibling told me they honestly hated school and hated the idea of college and got married and ran off when they were 18; One of my younger siblings isn’t going to college and instead working and living with my parents; My youngest sibling is not going to college for specific reasons. 

After I graduated from high school I had no clue what I wanted to do so I traveled a little bit, I don’t live in the States so I stayed there for a few years, traveling some, meeting people, experiencing a new culture. I came back home to my parents and started working when I decided that I want to be able to do what I love, which is taking care of children. Whether it’s daycare, preschool, nannying, babysitting... I love it all. So I told my parents I want to go to school, I bought all these new textbooks to relearn what I’ve forgotten from high school in the past 2 years of doing nothing, took some free online courses to prepare myself, etc. Then I realized, I’ve never gone to school, I’ve never studied with other people, I’ve never even been in a classroom. 

This is the reason why in the past week I’ve canceled my application to this community college over 12 times. Why? Because I don’t think I will do well. I grew up with two languages being constantly used around me, one being English. So I technically ‘know’ English, but my English skills are not as good as other people etc, the worries are endless. I’m going to be moving back to the States, probably live alone, and figure everything out on my own. 

Yes, I know, most kids experience this when they start college, some even in high school. But I think what worries me the most is, I was homeschooled so am I good enough? Is my knowledge gap going to make everything worse for me?

Luckily I have very supporting parents who are more than overjoyed that I will be the one and only child in our family to go to any sort of further education after high school, considering they are both graduates of a decent college, my father even has a Master’s degree. BUT no matter how much my parents tell me I will be fine, I can’t help thinking that I’m going to fail, or give up, or just become a puddle in a corner of a dark alley. 

I’m basically wondering if anyone has any advice, or a similar situation, etc... Where I live I am surrounded by elderly people and literally no one my age or even close to ask.

I finally finished my application for a college and am waiting for a reply, but I can’t even sleep at night and have nightmares whenever I close my eyes, and I just needed to let this all out somewhere. 

Sorry for being a wimp guys.

118,"So this is a bit of a weird one and I'm sure it'll come across a little humble-braggy but I don't mean it to.

So I'm 23, pretty normal guy. I live with my parents and while I'm not super romantically fucked I've never had a real relationship and I'm essentially still a virgin (essentially). This is due to a bunch of things including pickiness, romantic shyness and hesitance, but also just not having anywhere to bring a girl/my own space. My parents are cool enough, but they're always around and they're pretty awkward and kind of nosey.

Money wise I'm well set up - ridiculously well for my age actually - with around $100k of my own money in the bank from a combination of work etc, plus a full time job where I make $60k a year before tax.

So the problem in my mind is, while this is a big nest egg, housing in my city is VERY expensive (~500k+ starting essentially), so if I put a down payment on a place I would have to sink ALL my income into a mortgage for quite a while... 

The way I see it my options are 1. Buy a place now/soon with a 250k-300k mortgage to drown in for years, 2. Rent and pay around 1k+ a month anyway or 3. Stay at home a few more years and have a massive down payment nest egg.

I don't love the idea of drowning in a huge mortgage, especially since I might want to travel eventually, and I'd be buying a condo which has a lower resell. Renting feels like a waste. Staying at home for a few years would leave me with moving out at 25/26 or later... And I feel like my life wouldn't fully start till then. I don't know what to do. Like I said, life is fine, but the thought of living at home until 26+ gives me fucking anxiety, and I feel like I'm ripping myself off since friends with no savings are moving out and renting while I'm sitting at home with a decent nest egg firmly in my asshole.

I mean I guess if I'm 30 with a place fully paid off I'd be happy I stayed at home to save but... 30 and really starting my life sounds fucked.",28Feb2018,2

120,"Okay, so basically, I kinda hit a crisis mode yesterday and basically did nothing for hours, for a couple reasons. The one good thing to come is that I finally decided to get my shit together. So anyway, I got a couple of things I’m here to ask about:

1) So I’ve had this one friend for a while now, call her Sierra. Sierra actually doesn’t go to school with me, rather about two miles away in a different part of the city. I met her early my freshman year (last year) and we hit it off FAST. Then, as I was gonna ask her out, she got a boyfriend. But, even though I had a crush, she was still definitely an awesome friend, so we’ve stayed in touch. Fast forward to now, and we’ve hung out a fair bit more. I never saw her too much last year due to schedules, but we texted/snapped CONSTANTLY. About two weeks ago, she’d mentioned she was single, and had been for a bit. So I decided to make a move. So this past Saturday, she comes over, and due to the conversation, I was more or less cornered into admitting I wanted to ask her out. Credit where it’s due, she let me down VERY well and it didn’t hurt as badly as it easily could’ve. Long story short of it was that (as I remember, we were a bit drunk) she wanted to stay single this semester, and in general, wasn’t really interested. But she said she’d let me know if that ever changed, and that she does like me a lot as a friend, so she wanted to continue like it never happened. Now, this ain’t my first time in this EXACT scenario. So I agreed, and I’m dealing just fine. Regarding her however, I’m thoroughly embarrassed about what happened (mostly social anxiety. It’s a bit of a theme) but I’m also disappointed, but not completely destroyed. Since then, things seem fine but I can’t help but worry about it. Almost feel like I need to apologize and bring it up, but I don’t want to if she’s over that hump. Secondly, regarding her, it’s a terrible motive I know, but I also kinda want to get more attractive (personality and appearance wise) in a somewhat dual sided “here’s what your missing” type of way.

2) I don’t have all that many friends. Thanks to social anxiety. I’m too scared to talk to anyone in my classes, and the friends I’m rooming with this year and next basically adopted me when I met them last year. I’ve attempted to join two separate clubs, each time got scared away by anxiety (in one instance I nearly started throwing up) so I’m not sure how to force myself to find a different club, or go back to one of those. How else do people friends, too?

3) I want to get in shape. This is the second part of wanting to be more attractive. Ever since I stopped playing baseball something in me just died. I stopped because I was cut, not by choice. Problem is, our team never did too much weight training or anything like that. How does one actually learn how to lift, and how to train to get into good shape? 

4) This is probably the big one. I’m quitting nicotine. Now my friend peer pressured me into vaping about a year and a half ago. Don’t get me wrong, we’re not quite friends anymore due to some fundamental differences. But I really want to quit. One of my roommates is hiding all my vape stuff from me, until I show him proof I have a sale. Except the Juul, since I’m using that to wean myself off. Any advice for dropping it? I’m trying to combat the need for the MOTION of hitting a vape by flipping my balisong, but it’s really really difficult.

5) How do I build self confidence? It’s honestly something I’ve never had. Ever. I don’t trust myself, I’m too scared to fully trust but like, 5 people in the world because I’ve been backstabbed by two of my closest friends in the past. I honestly don’t know what, if anything I’m good for, and it really affects my ability to function. I have few to no talents, and the ones I have really feel useless, like knowing a bunch about cars, and intricate details of their inner workings, or being a huge baseball fan. I’ve been playing guitar for five years, but I’ve seen little to no improvement, and I can’t even play simple stuff like I used to though I’ve been practicing. It’s really bringing the morale down to not want to practice anymore and sell the instruments. How does one learn to give a shit about themselves? Develop any kind of confidence in themselves? I really need it.

An agent said in view of how frustrating this was for me and for the nice way I dealt with their employees, she would give me a $50 credit off my bill for one full year. I took her at her word. I. Am. An. Idiot.
In Dec 2017, from the 3rd to the 12th, these outages began anew. No TV, Internet, Phone, again for 10 days. I was again, nice. I was promised ANOTHER $90 credit.
For whatever reason, when I got this month's bill for $275 I was shocked to learn that not only did I NOT get the promised $50 credit, but my bill went up over $50, instead.
So I called and dang it, nothing in my file about the promised $50 credit per month. I have a great many scraps of paper stapled together that I miraculously held onto, even after I saw the first $90 credit. Each has the day, date, time and name of agent. But the one scrap of paper w the promised $50/mo credit is gone.
I think I'm out of luck. But my Reddit community has the combined wisdom of the ages. Can anyone propose a solution or a strategy to get the cable company to honor their word? I suspect the missing scrap is missing because the agent was SO SINCERE, I believed her. In my dated notes, there should be a gap in dates-I'm thinking the gap might be the day I spoke to this lady who made the promise-I may be able to narrow down the window within which I spoke to her and hopefully someone over there would be honest.
Does anyone have helpful advice for me to get them to honor their promise to me? Thank you for considering my plight!

123,"Yesterday I had my passport in my small handbag (long story). I went to my community college, went home, to my therapist's office with my dad, realized we were too early, then went to an Italian restaurant with my dad, had an argument with him, went back to the office and had my therapy appointment, then went home. Today, I realized my passport is missing from my handbag. 

I have no idea where it could be. I've never had anything fall out of my handbag before. I've already looked everywhere in my bedroom and it's not there.

I don't think it was stolen, because I never took it out and never showed it to anyone. I never leave my handbag alone in a public place, ever. It's always on my shoulder.

What should I start doing to look for it elsewhere? (The 3 other possible places are my community college, the therapy office and the Italian restaurant.) I can't tell my mom or ask her for help, because if I tell her I lost my passport, she'll go ballistic.",28Feb2018,2

125,"I poorly made the decisions to be roommates with one of my close friends thinking, “Nothing can go wrong!” It’s been 6 months and I’ve realized how big of a mistake this was. Her negativity used to not bother that much, in fact it encouraged me to be more optimistic and positive, to try to balance it out. 

Now I’m at the point where the moment I walk through the door and hear her complain I actually want to scream. She’s constantly complaining about school work or other people and it’s driving me insane. I only have 3 more months of being her roommate, but I feel like it’s ruining our friendship and my happiness at home. What should I do to keep my sanity these next few months?

127,"I have spent the past 2 months of my life putting the pieces in place and working up the guts to ask this girl out in my intro chem class (doing things like working out, getting a job, working up the guts to actually ask her out, trying to think up the right time, etc.), and after having all my life’s events of these past 2 months revolve around this girl, I found out she already had a boyfriend. Now this has happened to me before, but this one hurt, primarily because I really liked her and that this is the last semester of college before summer break, and theres no one else mildly attractive in any of my other classes, so I went into a depressive state for about a week. when I saw her next week (which was the first time I had seen her since i found out), 2 things became instantly realized to me: 
1: they had slightly different outcomes (not gonna go into THOSE long stories) but I have basically done this same process about 3 times last college year and 2 times already this year,
And 2: I lose almost all sense of self purpose and meaning if im not spending about 60% of my waking hours not scheming towards getting in an &gt;8/10 girl’s pants.
Am I becoming a toxic human being or does anyone else regularly feel this?
Id like to add a note that this is not affecting my career in any way, im actually on a free ride to college besides cost of textbooks and have a 3.25 GPA.

TL;DR: found out the girl I was plotting on asking out for about 2 months was already taken. Suddenly realized I lose all sense of purpose as a human being if im not using a lot of my time trying to get laid. Am I toxic or is this normal?",28Feb2018,2

134,"Around a month ago, a girl started talking to me via Instagram about one of my posts. She ended up saying that she wanted to get to know me deeper. Since then, we have been talking on WhatsApp about each one likings and opinions, but the conversation is now rather mundane, which I consider normal. I told her about meeting in real life, and she seemed quite excited by the idea, so we have met this very weekend. I would say I am really confused, as I don't know if she would like to start a relationship with me or just friendship. She's been sending me kiss/heart emojis (I loathe this century lol) as well as talking me in a rather affectionate way, but given how extroverted she is, I don't really know if that means something. Also, she's been talking to me about a couple of men trying to seduce her, one of them being her ex boyfriend. I would definitely never do that if I were to flirt with somebody. Shakespeare must be turning in his grave about this emoji-based pseudo love. What could she be up to? What should I do? How should I face this weekend's meeting?",28Feb2018,2
135,"My and my ex-gf have been separated for about a month now. I wanted to get back together but she just wants a FWB relationship. So that's where we are right now. I still love her her and she says she still loves me, but I just feel like I'm at her beck and call. I can only see her when she wants and it's only like once or twice a week. 

To add on, while we were dating, i caught her texting and flirting with another guy. She said things like ""I'm still a virgin"" and ""l'll drag you into my bed."" When I confronted her, she broke down crying, said she never met him, swore she only wanted me. I believed her. Most guys would've left but I stayed. Well, fast forward to yesterday, I saw her trying to hide texts from me. She'd lower the screen brightness so I couldn't see. And today, she didn't text me until 4 PM. Said she was in and out of sleep. Plausible but unlikely for her. She's never slept that late. I mean, yes we're not together technically, but she has told me she's not interested in dating anyone else. So I kind of assumed it was exclusive.

Anyway, despite all that, I still talk to her. I still want her attention. I still want to see her. I still love her. But at the same time, I feel like I deserve more. I just don't have the guts to drop her. I've talked to her everyday for over year now. I'm attached. I'm afraid of losing her. I know she still genuinely cares for me. She buys me food, asks how I'm doing, and she always says she loves me. So I hold on to that as hope that we will get together. Buy why do I feel like this despite her talking to other men? How can I gain some more respect and confidence for myself to drop her and not want her and miss her?

One thing to add, we live in the same town, and we also go to the same out of state college, same major, same buildings, same everything. So even if I did drop her, I feel like I would relapse and give in if she texted me one night to come over or something. That's what she does when she's sad and lonely. Should I move back home? Switch to one of the other campuses my school has, which are located in different states? Is it ridiculous to move because of one girl?",28Feb2018,2
136,"I [19M] and my girlfriend[20F] have been dating for almost 1 year now. I used to love her(but now don’t), but she is still madly in love with me. She still shows me the same affection and care, but I clearly have been showing less interest in her. As our relationship has progressed I have realized she just isn’t good for me. 
I’m more of an introverted person but would like to be a little more extroverted, but she is more introverted and awkward than I am so I have been the one trying to pull her out more. 
Ex:I am in a fraternity in college and bring her to parties and date nights but she is too nervous to engage in conversations more than 10 seconds with my friends or other girls so it ends up me and her awkwardly socializing off to the side. 
She also isn’t as ambitious as I’d like. I’m working toward multiple degrees and she has yet to declare any sort of major and doesn’t have a clue what to do with her life. I want someone that will motivate me to be a driven person, not just lay in bed and hang out all day.

Where it gets complicated is that I am her first true love, and she is mine. We have both taken our virginities from each other. I do not value the whole virginity thing too much, but she does and it took a very long time for us to have sex because she was nervous. 

I want to break up with her within the next few days, but I do not know how to approach it at all. She is the nicest girl in the world and will do anything for me so I want her to know I no longer want to date her, but I do not want to be harsh. She will want to know why I want to break up, but I feel telling her that she is too introverted/awkward and not driven will tear her to pieces.

139,"I’m at a small liberal arts school in the Midwest. Since I got to this school I’ve planned to do a 3-2 program for engineering, which is that I study physics for three years at my small school then go the to big school for an engineering degree in two years. The end of year three is coming up and I can’t make up my mind on whether or not I want to leave. 

If I stay I have to pay an extra year of tuition, but I recently joined a fraternity and it’s been a really wholesome experience. I don’t want to leave that group because I think I could get some serious emotional development out of it. On the other hand though, if I go to engineering school, I’ll be living with a friend who has gone through the entire program with me and a friend who went in a year ahead of us. Those guys are going to go on to do something cool in life and I don’t want to miss out on that party.

I know that both of these options are good options and either way I’ll be happy, but I’ve been stressing myself out over this for a couple of weeks now. This shit is exhausting and I need to make up my mind for my own sanity at this point. I’ve worked this decision up in my mind so much that it feels like a major turning point in my life and that scares me. I’m the youngest in my family and I see what’s coming. It’s going to be great, but I just don’t know if I’m ready for it all yet. 

What my gut says to do is to stay at the small school and go for the emotional stuff because I’ve always felt that money is only important in that it is a means of being happy, but it doesn’t actually make you happy. So fuck the money and stay another year at my small school. 

If you’ve made it this far, thanks for listening. I’d be happy to hear what you think and I apologize in advance if I seem flip flop on this, it’s all I feel like I’ve been doing these past few weeks.

141,"I am currently in my last semester of college and I am going to graduate in a couple months. I live in Ohio and I go to a big university, and the rest of my childhood family and friends are just an hour away from my college (both are big cities). 

I received a job offer from a huge company, and it's really the best offer you could get coming out of college - amazing pay and benefits, tons of vacation, lots of advancement opportunities...

The thing is, the job is in a fly over state about 10 hours away from everybody I care about. family and friends are extremely important to me... I am not the person to have 20 decent friends but instead 1 or 2 close friends. 

At this point in time, I absolutely do not want to take the job. The job itself is in an industry related to my major but not exactly what I want to do for the rest of my life, and I am certain I would be looking for new employment opportunities once I completed the 2 year training program for the company (amazing experience)

I just can't find peace in deciding on what I should do. It feels like my heart wants me to stay back home and decline the job offer because I lay awake 3-4 hours every single night with panic attacks at he thought of living totally alone in a city I don't exactly want to be in in the first place

But then this is such a good job offer right out of college, it seems foolish to turn it down as many people would give an arm and a leg for this job. 

I also do not want to disappoint my family. they are very happy for me to move out of the house and get a very well paying job and start my career, it is hard to tell them i want to stay in the comfort of my city. 

I am so torn about this issue right now. Like I said, it feels like my heart is saying to reject the offer and find something else in the city that i love.  But this is certainly not the best move for my career. 

I am seeing a counselor to talk about this thursday but I just want to know if my fellow redditors have any experience with a similar issue or can weigh any advice on my situation.

Thanks guys",28Feb2018,2
142,"So I just had a baby, my first, and I am staying with my in-laws for the first few months to have some help and so I'm not alone since my husband is basically working two jobs at the moment. I'm American living overseas and my husband's family is Arab. That means his parents, particularly his mom are super helpful. Actually in this case I feel too helpful because she will insist on taking my son from me so I can rest or insist on doing something like soothing him to sleep when I am already in the middle of doing it. Sometimes I really appreciate because I may have hard a hard night and need to eat or sleep a few hours. But other times I want to continue because this is my son and I want to bond with him even if it is the 11th time I had to help him fall asleep in one hour, since it's important for me to learn how to cope and deal with any difficulties. I feel like I have limited control and even when I politely say no she will insist, even saying she misses him to encourage me to give him to her. I know she is coming from a helpful place and I appreciate it, but I don't know how to really deal. It's a problem because I'm starting to feel jealous if she has him because I feel like she is taking my place as his mother and will see all his firsts (smile, laugh, playing). I'm not sure how to approach the situation  in a graceful way because of several reasons,I'm afraid of sounding rude, she doesn't have a great command of English, and I don't want this jealousy to continue and make me snap at her.

143,"I'll try to keep this short. A couple years back some neighbors moved in nearby, we live in a semi-rural part of Utah. These neighbors are total jack asses and are loud, drunkards, and abusive to their pets. They have teenage kids who are also spawns of satan. 

On one occasion about 3 years back we asked them to not use chainsaws in their yard late at night. The father was a total dick and threatened us not so subtley; we've kept our distance ever since. Most people in that family are totally unhinged.

Recently, my brother heard a single loud bang in the middle of the night from the direction of their house. He figured it was nothing and went back to bed. The next day we find our cow bleeding the yard, a vet came over and pulled out a bullet. Our cow passed away shortly thereafter. We know beyond any reasonable doubt that it was those neighbors.

We called the cops and filled a report. They talked with the suspect neighbors but to my knowledge nothing came of it. They didn't have any evidence to press charges. They basically said ""call us if anything else happens.""

What should we do? I've personally been moved out for a year and am very concerned for my family's safety. Seems like the type of people that you get far far away from, but my family is not in a position to move.

144,"I'm 19 and my bf just turned 21. We've been dating for six months, but we have a ridiculously strong connection. I honestly feel like I've known him for years and about a month ago we started having conversations of marriage (he kinda even proposed but we don't have a ring so it's not really official). 

Anyways we just had a pregnancy ""scare"" but my problem is I don't actually think it's over. Over the past week and a half (about) I've been having a lot of headaches and nausea, really bizarre and sudden mood swings, and dizziness. I also got the first uti of my life (which i did not know was a potential side effect of pregnancy.) As of the past week I have a solid half of the signs of pregnancy. Today I started spotting a little bit with the cramping here and there (im not a light bleeder when it comes to my period, I'm not super heavy but I'm also not light. And this is very light) this would be the week I should start my period based on when I got it last. I went to the doctor today for my UTI. Told her it was my first ever so she asked about possible pregnancy and I said that it was possible. She said she'd look at the urine sample I have but since I'd been taking OTC AZO for my infection she may not be able to tell. Came back and said it was negative. 

My fear is that what if that is wrong. Everything I've read said the accuracy is several days after your missed period for a urine test and I technically havent missed yet. And I've also read that some people do get light bleeding or spotting, which is kind of what I have. It's just so many coincidences happening at once I find it really hard to believe. I will admit headaches and nausea are not altogether uncommon for me. I get nauseous with headaches sometimes and get headaches fairly often. You could explain the mood swings with PMS. It can all be explained away I know but I can't shake this feeling that I have. I was scared once before but I also knew I wasn't pregnant that I was just anxious because I had just started to be active again after several months and I was a few days off. This time feels different though. (I would also like to add my bf and I have never done it without a condom and I was on birth control except there was a week I didn't have it because I couldn't get to a pharmacy to get it)

It also doesn't help I have a cousin telling me that test cannot possibly be accurate at this moment. I'm scared. I don't want to disappoint my family. I'm going back to college in the fall. My bf and I would be happy but we arent financially ready for a baby. I want to marry him and I want to have a family with him, as he does with me too. But I could tell how relieved he was when the doctor said no. Honestly I was too, I was a twinge disappointed but i know now is not the time that I'm not ready.

154,"Background: I’d like to start off by saying that I’m 18 years old and I understand that this seems like a stupid idea to a huge majority of people. If you’re here to tell me about how I shouldn’t, please save both of our time and keep it to yourself. I was emancipated and moved in with a family (Colorado) that turned into the closest thing to a real family that I’ve ever had. They helped me get rid of a LOT of bad habits which has saved me thousands of dollars. I’ve been putting money aside for a few months and just recently purchased plane tickets, booked a hotel, and paid a deposit for the hooker (legal). 

So I have nearly everything figured out except for this one problem. There’s no way I’m telling the people that I live with that I’m going to Nevada, and I’m sure as fuck not telling them about the hooker. They know I have a few grand saved up for a vacation and they know I’m going this spring break (same time as my flights). I told them I wasn’t going to plan out the vacation and that I would just find stuff to do as I go along to make things fun. I thought that was enough to keep them out of my business but now they’re trying to get me to go to New Mexico (don’t get me wrong, it’s great that they want to help and it’s much appreciated, I just have different plans....). They’re saying,
 “Oh don’t go north or west, it’s so boring and the snow will be terrible! New Mexico is so much fun and you could send us pictures. Oh, and since you don’t want to plan it out, just send me your location every now and then and I’ll find nearby places for you but won’t tell you what they are!”
Again, they’re fucking awesome and normally, their plan would be too. But I don’t want to go on vacation, I  want to fuck a girl... My trip is only two days long, then I plan on spending a few days on vacation as well but I need to make it look like I started driving two days earlier than I actually did. 

I’m at a complete loss. I could send fake pictures and act like I’m going to New Mexico but that’s risky since they know the area so well.I could tell them I’m going somewhere else around Nevada but I can’t think of anywhere and I already said I didn’t want to plan it out. I could also say I don’t want to talk to anyone until I get back so I can just enjoy the trip, but they already know how much I depend on my phone and that I’ll be looking up stuff to do anyways. I know this is a long shot but I’ve been thinking about for awhile now and I can’t think of any good ideas. Any suggestions/tips would be amazing! Thanks for your time!",28Feb2018,0

What can I do to earn more money? I know finishing school is what I need to do. What should I go to school for that would have the best return?  How long will it take? Can I do it while working full time?
I just don’t know what to do...

Also person involved doesn’t use reddit so I’m not to concerned with using a throwaway. 

 Some background information on us. So my boyfriend’s friend, who became a good friend of mine, has been irritating me. We (as in my bf, she, and I) have been living together about a year now. We’re all on the lease. We all will be moving soon-ish. 

Initially, we were getting on her nerves because we weren’t keeping the common area super clean, like leaving our sweaters on the couch, maybe some empty boxes from amazon somewhere on the floor, or books left out on the dining table, etc. So we changed it. We started keeping the general room super clean. She didn’t like how we didn’t mop every week, so she bought a calendar and wrote down that she mopped, in large ass letters. I have split days off so I’m not going to fucking mop every week. I do it every two weeks. I mentioned the little stuff she’s been doing to my boyfriend but he decided to just ignore it because in his words “if she has a problem she can talk to us.” I would do some changes, but he wouldn’t. 


She’s super passive aggressive, and won’t initiate a conversation if something is bothering her. Whatever we did to offend her, she will do back to a moronic degree. In this case, I was playing music in the middle of the afternoon around 12PM while cooking, and woke her up (I didn’t know she was home, she usually works until 2.) She came out to get a glass of water, and started slamming the cabinet doors, and the fridge door. I didn’t apologize with something like “oh sorry I didn’t know you were home” but I should have. I don’t speak much to her because of the way she acts. She has a habit of slamming cabinets when she’s upset and she was upset. She went back to her room and didn’t come back out. After I wash dishes and clean the kitchen, I go back to my room and about an hour later she starts playing rap really loud. Honestly, I like metal, rap, country, lots of music, but I knew why she playing it obnoxiously loud so I closed my door and I couldn’t hear the music anymore. 

My bf comes home from work and hears the music before he even comes in the house since her room is by the front of the house. He asks what happened, I tell him and he tells me I should apologize to her. I tell him no, since I didn’t know she was home, my music wasn’t on blast, and her response is childish. I also elaborated that ever since she’s been acting like this, I don’t consider her a friend. She’s been hostile and I’m not going to talk to her about how she should change her behavior. I’m not her mom. She’s a grown woman who doesn’t know how to communicate. She continues to play her music obnoxiously loud until she stops to eavesdrop on our conversation about her. She probably heard most of it, and then I heard her leave the house. My boyfriend said that he’s her friend, she’s not a bad person and her work is super fucking shitty, which is true. But I don’t think that excuses her to be a fucking moron at home. She was cool before we moved in, now she’s just shitty. At least she doesn’t steal from us, or break our stuff. It just sucks losing a friend. I’m non confrontational. I don’t want to talk to her about her being shitty, about her not being my friend. 


This all started when she brought her dog to the house, and it says specifically in our contract you can’t have dogs or we have to pay $500. The dog started barking loudly and whining because it wanted to pee. Our landlord is our neighbor. I told her we can’t have a dog in the house because we would have to pay extra. She left. She was super butthurt about it. 

Months later she got an aquarium, which is stated that we can’t have in our lease as well. A few weeks later she tells us she’s getting a fish. We can’t have fish either. I didn’t say anything because my bf said we should let her have it because she feels bad. I can’t recall other stuff because I try not to harp on it. But it’s been adding up and I’m tired of it. I mentioned all this to my bf but he’s like it won’t matter in the future, that I shouldn’t end our friendship just because we irritate each other a bit. He said that we can either choose to push against her, which will escalate stuff and make a mountain out of a mole hill, or absorb some of what she’s doing because she’s probably just lashing out out of frustration from work, and her life.

Honestly, I don’t know how to tell her she’s being a fucking asshole to me, and she needs to stop. Should I write a letter? Should I try to talk to her? Should we just move out and never speak? My boyfriend has made it clear she’s his friend and he’s not going to stop talking to her. 

When it comes to the relationship I have with my boyfriend I’ve fought with a previous friend of his. I told him I didn’t want that friend over at our house because I don’t like her since she got black out drunk, choked some random guy, and just acted like an asshole. So him saying “she’s my friend” in reference to our current roommate seems like he’s saying is not being friends with her isn’t an option, which I think is fucking duuuuuumb. 

Then again, I don’t have friends, so maybe I’m the asshole?

159,"Hello,
in my school career I was always a fairly decent student. I had some As and Bs on my testimony and when I moved up to 5th grade a was able to keep this level till... let me guess 7th grade? But in recent years I‘ve subsided. My grades are becoming average as fuck. I didn‘t had an A in any test or exam for about 2-3 years... 

I am in the 11th grade now and on my last testimony the best grade I had was 9/15 points which is a 3+ here in germany or about a B- or C+ in america. 
It‘s getting frustrating. I see other students who seem to just get As because they have a good reputation and wear a pullover and shirt under it. You know that typical nerd look. I am not trying to hate on others but I don‘t know how I could reach their niveau or how they can achieve insane oral participation.

I am not dumb or anything but I don‘t know how to get back on my old level. I just wanna get an A in my exams again... or on a test.

FYI I am a german student.

I'm a mess right now. I was told we can't make rent (again) and I have no fucking clue what to do right now. Apparently the land lord wants us taken out and simply, ""feels obliged"" to keep us here.

161,"My parents always seem to be stuck paying for every restaurant bill whenever we go out to eat with my grandparents, aunts, uncles and other relatives. Every time (over 15 years (as far as my memory goes)).

I am not too familiar with the faux pas of Chinese Culture or Asian values in general, but I do know respect for the elderly and filial piety are very important. I know that my grandparents are not expected to pay for the bill cause they are retired, old, have no income, and are generally at the top of the family (it might be seen as disrespectful). This I can understand. However, this does not explain why my aunts and uncles have never paid a single bill despite being financially well off, and probably better off than we are. My parents have tried splitting the bill a couple times, but the aunt and/or uncle conviently forgets their wallet, and just doesn't come for the next family outing or finds an excuse not to pay. They might agree to it only to find a reason to make my parents pay. 

I used to love family outings, but as I grew older it became clear my parents always got the short end of the stick when it comes to every interaction and are at my relatives beck and call. When I tried talking to my parents about why they always end up paying, they say they don't want to be disrespectful to elders and put up a fuss for looking cheap amongst other things. Maybe it is just me feeling salty, but I think my relatives have start putting an expectation on my parents to pay for every family outing and only invite my parents just to cover the bill. 

But I wouldn't be asking for help if that was only problem. Nope. My grandparents always decided on the location we are going to eat at and all the dishes we eat. For some reason they keep choosing the most expensive dishes in the Chinese restaurant, and order more than they can possibly eat. 

Just recently some relatives from the Taiwan visited, so my parents and I went to see her. My grandparents, my aunt, my parents and I, and the visiting relatives all go to a chinese restauarnt my grandma's choice, and sat in a cold room because my grandpa insisted on sitting there despite there being other open areas (10 people total). My grandma then proceeds to order over 10 dishes, (2 dishes are vegetarian for my 3 relatives who can't eat meat). Amongst these dishes are 2 whole lobsters, 1 whole crab cooked with salted duck egg, 1 whole chicken, shrimp and scallops, other meat and seafood dishes, 2 types of dessert for the whole table etc... My grandparents probably ate about 1 or 2 little soup bowls worth of food and wasted what they couldn't finish. The rest ended up in doggy bags and multiple take out containers. My parents ended up paying about $200-300 that night. 

Events like this are not a one time thing. They happen at least 3 or 4 times a year. They decide the date, location, order the most expensive dishes and more than they can possibly eat, waste food and then expect my parents to pay for the huge bill. My parents don't say anything, but seeing the unfairness of the situation makes my blood boil. 

It's easy to just say we don't want to go, but my father wants to keep a good relationship with our family so we end up going anyway.

How should we approach this?

A year or two ago I decided to finally see a school counsellor after doing some pretty bad things to myself. Details here aren't important, but I ended up telling the counsellor everything and she said she'd have to call my parents and tell them. I was in no way made aware that this would happen. I probably should've assumed that she'd call my parents, but at that moment I just wanted someone who I could trust and who would help me. 
I felt terrified, angry, betrayed, and mortified. After she practically ripped my phone number from my lips by somewhat threatening me, she called my parents while I sat there sobbing. Screaming even. It was awful. After a while, one of my parents showed up. At this point, I was completely broken and empty. I had been crying almost non-stop for at least 20 minutes. At that point, I think I'd just gone numb. I felt so utterly helpless. My parent sat down and we all began talking.

Now here's where my question comes in. I could tell you the exact colour and pattern of my parent's shirt, but to this day I couldn't tell you a word of the conversation that followed. Actually, I remember one sentence at the very beginning. ""That must've hurt."" Apart from that, everything else is completely gone. I don't even have a blurry idea of what followed. It's just a gap in my memory. It's almost like that conversation didn't even happen. 
The next thing I remember was looking at myself in the office mirror while I washed the tears off my face. 

What would cause this gap in my memory? I remember all the events leading up to it in exact detail, but then there's just nothing. Why? Is it something to do with trauma, or could it be something else? ",28Feb2018,3
165,"Not sure how to put this, I’m 16, in the US, Indian family 


Past that , I guess discipline through physical hitting has always been a thing for my dad, and I’m guessing it’s more prevalent in India and his dad probably did it to him considering he closet hates his own father. 

So through my life, usually fuck ups on my part end in that, slaps usually were it up til after middle school. Verbal abuse constantly “This kid is a loser, a drug addict (Caught smoking 6 months ago, was dropped but always brings it up when he’s angry and when he’s annoyed at all so almost always , and more I don’t really wanna get into). Lately his name calling as led to me responding back with something like if I’m a jerk (illogical arguments but does he listen, fuck no), what does that make you -&gt; turns to hitting, no not spanking but taking objects and slamming them down on me basically beating the fuck out of me (no blood, or bruises just hurts like a bitch), fists balled up swinging at my body seems like it’s as hard as he can do it. Like it’s crazy bc it’s getting to the fucking point where it’s hurting him to hurt me. Haha... so to prevent that pain, why not use objects to beat the fuck out of him? Clothes hangers etc. Idk guys, I don’t think it’s normal for me to be at the point where 10 min after the beat down I am getting more and more resistant to the pain and instead of me getting more and more depressed, I’ve noticed today that I’ve started getting angry. I don’t know, comparing myself to him is a joke, I’m taller than him but he’s much bigger and stronger and has like 30 years on me.

My mum is a functioning alcoholic, uses alcohol to deal with any amount of stress or unhappiness, and has been this way for as long as I can remember. She's aware there's a problem there but won't get help because she's ""seen people about it before so she already knows what they'll say"".

 These are the only friends I know and have. It's mainly my fault for always being sort of scared to find other friends due to the comfort of knowing I could always jump online and they were just...there.

At first she didn't talk to me much and have short responses. But she always responded quickly, like a friend would. We started bonding over some music we were listening to and accidentally discovered an artist which we both happened to end up really liking. 

One day, Cara invites me into a group chat with some of the friends she hung out with. I knew those friends a little but not really. Eventually she makes a new group with her and two other guys. This new group is originally for her to plan a ball dance thing with them for her youth group or something. Then later, close to after the ball actually happened, she invited me into the group! Ins right? I'm in a group with only 2 other people and her now. Getting close. 

Now, one of the other people in the group, we'll call him Kenneth, has a crush on Cara. So he's venting to me about her all the time and I don't mind because it's good info for me. But out of mercy I decide to pause my mission and wait for him to ask her out. I'm pretty sure he's gonna get rejected. 

Another mutual friend who knows about my thing for her one day informs me of some stuff she told him. She said she didn't think Kenneth was very attractive and wished more attractive guys would like her. She then went on to say I was ""cute"". But she also said she wouldn't date me. She just liked me physically. This is easily changeable tho right? I just have to be around her more and she might come around to liking me. 

We hang out in the city and she rests her head on my shoulder. It felt fucking great. I hadn't gotten this from any other girl ever. The closest I got was having a line drawn on my jaw, very romantic. So I'm like yeah I can ask her out now. 

A few weeks later we hang out again and it just kind of sucks. At this point everyone's found out about Kenneth and that's over. So I decide okay, next week I'll ask her out.

The next day, she goes on a fuckin date with some other random dude I'd never heard about before. She never talked about other guys with me which was definitely a good sign, she still doesn't to this day really. Recently she has started a little more though. So she goes on this date, but then she tries to keep it real secretive. I don't really know why. Everyone found out though. 

So now she has a boyfriend, after just the one date. Awesome. She still tells me nothing of him and I'm okay with that. I feel pretty down but I'm not full on obsessed with her so it's fine.

A couple weeks later, we hang out for the day. Just me Cara and Kenneth, the 4th member of the group is not there :(. We decide we're gonna go watch a movie, but Kenneth is not old enough to get in, so it's just Cara and me. I was kinda awkward about it and though hey why don't we go another time, even though another time would be no different to this time and Kenneth still wouldn't get in. cool. Just Cara and myself. Ins. 

We're watching the movie, ""IT"". She goes all damsel in distress or something and asks for my arm. I oblige and its really nice. She's just resting her head on my shoulder and hugging my arm. At one point it gets ""too scary"" and she nuzzles her face between my shoulder and the seat. She has a boyfriend so I'm not going to push this any further. I don't even know if what's happening is just friendly or not, it definitely feels more than friendly but I like her so it could just be me you know? 

That's over, she gives me a tight hug and he head our separate ways home. None of this is ever talked about again. Similar things occur with the whole hugging arm thing and its just sorta fine. I'm not gonna stop it even though I feel like she's kinda cheating on her bf. 

Now we're at Kenneth's place watching stranger things. We binge watch both seasons. Season 2 just came out on that day. Cara gets up close to me again and does the whole cuddle thingaroo. She sleeps on my shoulder that night. It's cute and whatever.

I go home and none of this is talked about ever again. A couple days later me and Kenneth go to watch another movie and he tells me how Cara thinks I'm ""really hot"". But I already know / assume she wouldn't date me, plus she has a bf still so like... Yeah. Nothing happens. 

Her behaviour continues. One time she pushes herself up again me while we're all five of us sitting on a 4 person couch. There's plenty of room for us all tho, she doesn't need to be this close. Who am I to complain tho? I dont. She still has a bf so I make no moves. 

One day, someone puts this list of things like ""movie night"", ""drinks"", and ""a kiss"" and a bunch of other things on their Snapchat story. She starts repeating the numbers for movie and a kiss to me, over group chat, over direct Snapchat. She even tells the mutual friend who told me she thinks I'm cute about it. I'm very confused at what her goal is here. Is she just joking? If so why did she go and tell muttual friendo? 

Now over the last couple months she's retracted and basically doesn't do this shit anymore. I manage to convince myself I'm over her and genuinely believe myself when I say she's not the type of person I'd want to date. 

Then idk, the cycle loops again, as it has 10 or more times and I like her again now I think. I guess I liked her all along. 

Now I actively try to reduce physical contact but I'm also trying to be a little more flirty verbally with her, idk why. Just because I can I guess. 

I'm playing the waiting game now right? Is that ok? Is it a terrible idea? She's been with her bf for almost 6 months now. I don't really talk to other girls I'm interested in so I'm basically forced to play the waiting game. 

Ahh what do I do?",28Feb2018,2
191,"I've always tried to be as kind as I can be. I was the outcast when I was younger because I had a temper. Now I still seem to be the outcast. I'm in my second last year of school and it seems like everyone has made deep relationships with each other bar me. People who I think I'm good friends with would prefer to spend time with another person. It's hard to be included in conversations because I don't seem to share interests with anyone else except for one person who isn't healthy for me (her personality stresses me out and she seems to enjoy it). One person will be my 'friend' one minute and then be rolling their eyes/scoffing at me/telling me 'yes **** we get it/basically telling me to shut up and no one seems to care. I feel alone although I am surrounded by people. There was an incident a few years ago where someone who I was really close friends with turned their back on me and told me over text everything they hated about me. No. One. Cared. They were all buddy buddy with this person. I guess that was the point when any chance of me feeling my friendships were real fragmented and eventually completely abolished. I don't understand why people seem to prefer others over me when I try so so hard to talk and make conversation even though I practically have nothing in common with these people.
This person who I mentioned before who is nasty to me, I hate to say it but they have one of those 'nasty' faces and dispositions. I look at them and think 'you can tell this is a nasty person'. I try try try to be kind and talk to this person but as I said, they'll basically tell me to shut up and that no one cares. They can't take what they deal either. Just today, they repeated a story to me that I'd heard fifty million times before but had kept quiet, this time I told them 'yes I know, you've told me', they proceeded to get defensive and not appreciate that I'd said this even though they have basically done the same to me more times than I can count. Yet still I persist to talk to this person, to try and be their friend. 

Sometimes I can't help but hate the people I call 'friends' and I don't want to but I don't really feel that my relationships with any of them are deep or real. Even if I wanted to talk to different people, I just couldn't because I've known their opinions of me for years and can't be bothered to deal with their fakeness. 
Sorry for the rant. Any ideas of how I can deal with this besides totally ostracizing myself?",28Feb2018,4

199,"I am so despondent about absolutely everything in terms of my college career. I am miserable and hate it. It's weird because you'd think I'd be like severely depressed or something but I'm generally normal/happy when I'm not at college or thinking about it. It's like a thorn in my side. I do not fit in at all. I don't get along with other people at all (I never have but I honestly like being alone so it's not a problem). I just don't care anymore. I'm wasting my parents money and don't have the heart to tell them that I'm miserable and just wasted a couple thousand dollars of their money. I never wake up in time for class. I can't fall asleep before 7 AM. I skip class constantly and just go for walks since that's a healthy thing to do and sing along to songs on the radio to try and keep my spirits up when I get back to my car. I think about my childhood and all the fun I had a lot. I also like thinking about high school, those were the finest years of my life, despite freshman year being where all my
problems began. The one class I'm taking involves working in a group and presenting in front of the class and I've done literally nothing in the six weeks, I skipped the first big presentation today and I ate candy and chugged monster while sobbing my my car in an empty parking lot. I cannot bring myself to try and contribute, the other members probably just think I'm so lazy asshole trying to ride their coat tails but I'm not, I never take credit for what I don't do and they've basically realized I won't do anything and no longer try texting me which is good I guess. I just can't do it, I'm not meant for group work. I also keep sleeping through my algebra class and its infuriating, I try so hard to make it but never do, it's my fault. I like my coding class a lot and am doing good in it, it's just the other classes I hate. To be honest, I don't think I even want to be a programmer anymore, it'd be best left as a hobby. My English professor got insanely close to getting me to finally break down and admit everything isn't okay (Im really good at acting and snaking my way out of bad situations/manipulating people) because I've had her two semesters in a row. The first one I wasn't doing too bad, I thought I'd just give college a shot and see how it goes, maybe it'd get better. This semester, it got worse and I've really went downhill. She noticed I've been ""distracted"" and my work rapidly deteriorated in quality (honors student to stuff I just shit out).  I don't pay attention anymore and just browse the internet and look at funny pictures. I just shrugged it off and said I was fine and smiled, apologizing for goofing off and the reason was because I got a job and have been busy so I have less time to perfect my work (I have no job and it only took me about a half hour to write the essays that got me honors). I was a hair away from crying and telling the truth and I'm fairly certain she could tell but didn't say anything. The only thing I truly enjoy doing that could make me money is computer, phone, and gaming console repair and restoration. It's extremely satisfying taking a broken and dirty console and making it work once again and look it just came out of the factory. Perhaps I could try something with that, I don't really know anymore. To be perfectly honest, I seriously can't see myself as a functioning adult. I am beyond lazy and want to fix it but can't bring myself to do so. Sorry this is an incoherent wall of text but I don't care anymore, just wanted to share this with someone. I'm only like that at college, if it's the weekend and I'm at home not thinking about class, I'm perfectly happy. Everyone thinks I'm happy and doing good in school even though I'm usually one step from crying and am failing everything. I guess they'll find out when the semester ends and ask about my grades.

209,"**Context**

After moving away, 2 years later, a lot has changed.

During my absence, one of the biggest changes is that I've sobered up considerably. It was hard but I managed to quit marijuana which used to centre my life around. I'm not much of a drinker either.

I learned that I find pleasure when I experience ""human connections"" and ""love"". I mean, mutual feelings of being seen, heard, valued and mutual shows of affection.

It was hard, moving back. On top of leaving a lot of good friends behind, I had to disconnect with a lot of my old ""friends"" (over-indulgent crowds). I have one friend left, which I'm not always convinced he's good for me or not.

I tried joining social groups in my hobby (board games) but so far, several months later, I haven't found what I'm looking for in terms of friends. I always feel like I don't belong, like my values and boundaries too often clash with others. My therapist says it might be due to cultural differences. I'm not originally from this place and my cultural background is kind of a minority here.

Logically, if I persevere, I should find authentic connections right?  Groups and individuals that I feel connected with just by being myself, must exist!

**Problem**

I often find it difficult to take the initiative.  I come up with excuses all the time when I have an opportunity.
- I wouldn't like them. OR They wouldn't like me.
- I'm probably too dumb.  OR They are probably too dumb.
- I'm not skilled enough.
- We probably don't have much in common.
- I'm not dressed correctly.
- I'm just too tired...
- I'm too fat...
- I didn't have time to wash my hair...

Deep down, it's probably because I'm afraid to get hurt.  A therapist once told me I probably get aggressive to prepare myself, instinctively expecting to get hurt.  I was bullied and ostracized in my youth and the trauma... I didn't develop the skills/tools to handle it properly yet.

I know I can't help experiencing those emotions but is there anything that I can do/practice that, in the long run, could help me act in the moment, despite the adversity?

I have never felt any sort of positive emotion towards her for the 11 years she as existed. She will cry over the stupidest things, such as you offering her a glass of water she didn't want. We do this because she doesn't drink enough water and refuses when we give her so we put it in front of her hoping she will drink the water. Or she will cry if there is food that isn't hers near her. Like come on the table is crowded with so many plates on it! Just ignore the goddamned plate! She also has to throw a screaming and crying fit every damn time she has to go to bed or eat dinner. Even more annoying is no matter what I do, every time I try something, she screams even louder and I swear every time I feel like grabbing a sledgehammer and smashing her brains out. She is loud as fuck and will fake run-away every time you correct her behavior. Like start sniffling and running to the other side of the house. Just the other day she wanted to go play outside at night in her pjs and when I kept saying no she literally THREW HERSELF ON THE GROUND, SMASHED HER HEAD ON THE EDGE OF A TABLE, THEN SCREAMED BLOODY MURDEROUS HELL BECAUSE OF IT!!!!! Here is a situation that happens at least once a day with her:
Sis has to do something she doesn't want to (like eat food) We make her stay at the table until she eats the food. Sis is angry. Sis pulls hair of my other sis or hits her super hard. Other sis is sad. Other sis calls me. I go and hit the disabled sister for hitting my other sister for no reason. And something like this happens at least once a day. Many times I week I will say the worst things about myself for saving her life 3 times when she tried jumping out of the window, because to her, 439281620 feet high is the same thing as 1 foot high. And even at the time I was debating wether or not I should save her (I was 9-10 y/o) Religion was the only reason I saved her, because I don't want to go to hell. I sometimes lose my shit at her and beat her because having an idiot misbehaving and screaming all the damn time really gets on your nerves. I'm just waiting till I graduate from hs then college and get my own place so I can be rid of her. I talked to mom about wether or not I would have to care for her as an adult, and mom said ""oh its ok you and your 2 other siblings will take turns"" mom doesn't get it. I DON'T WANT TO EVEN SEE HER FACE AGAIN!!!!! I DON'T WANT TO SPEND MY ENTIRE LIFE HERE!!!! I LOVE MY COUNTRY AND ALL BUT I WANT TO TRAVEL!!!!!! I WANT TO EXPLORE THE WORLD!!!!! I don't want to have to take care of her! It's not my fault she was disabled! Why should I have to care for her!? And we can't just take her to a nursing home cause religion says that you can't do that unless you are unable to care for her. She ALWAYS screams even when she's happy. And her happy scream is even worse than her sad scream it's so high pitched. She also constantly grinds her teeth which makes this annoying, horrible grinding scraping scratching sound. I hate everything about her. And I know the first thing everyone here is gonna do is get all pissed at me and say ""you are a selfish bitch you should be kind it's not her fault blah blah blah"" Well I don't want to hear that because that's what everyone else I have talked to told me. (minus calling me a bitch) I don't think it's selfish for me to be annoyed at her or hate her, and trust me you would hate her too if you were stuck with an eternal toddler who will get set off by anything. She is also the reason I might not have kids as an adult, because I'm worried they will turn out disabled like her. It helps getting this off my chest but man am I excited to move out and not have to deal with her screaming and being annoying all the damn time. Does anyone have any advice because no matter how much I lock myself in my room, the poor maid will have to come knocking on my door every 20 minutes or so because my sis is screaming just because she wasn't allowed to hit my other sis who did nothing to her.

I keep having dreams about him, maybe once every couple of weeks or so.

Last night was the worst. We were together again and I was so happy. I woke up in a cold sweat feeling afraid, disappointed in myself, heartbroken, and confused. I was so happy we were together again. I'm horrified at myself, and ashamed.

When I caught him, he immediately asked me if I was going to tell Mom and Dad. I told him ""No, you are"". I've always wanted my little brother to be more open to me, since our older brother lives in another state. He's a gamer like me, the only difference is, he shuts everyone out.

I've been sitting on it this morning and considered calling my Mom, and asking her to not say anything, but that would break my little brothers trust.

I guess I'm just not sure what to do. I'm not mad at him, but I am disappointed (which is usually much worse). He's just a freshman, I didn't smoke until after high school. Which, he said to me ""You, Mom and Dad just don't understand what I go through at high school."" Which baffles me completely, because I loved high school. Granted this is 5 years after I graduated, things could be different nowadays.

Should I tell Mom and Dad? Should I let him tell them? Should I leave it alone?

A few years back I started posting naked pictures of my junk and face online. I am a male by the way. I was not getting the attention I wanted from women sexually, and I had been curious about guys (I identify as straight, with curious tendencies) and decided to start posting nude selfies and sexual things on reddit. I deleted them after a bit but a few got on to tumblr. I have been able to have tumblr delete most of the pictures of myself on tumblr and hope to get the rest deleted ASAP, since I have found a few more. But when I search my old usernames other pictures show up. Now my full name is not attached to any of these, but someone posted my first name on some pictures and state I am from on tumblr (I got these deleted) so I know no one can search for my pics by name, but I hate myself for what I did and worry every day they could ruin my career. They are hard to find unless you know the usernames I posted under and I am going to try and get them removed from as many of the sites as I can. Should I worry that these could end me? I know one acquaintance knows but she doesn’t have any links of anything I’ve posted since I deleted it all, but I can’t get over this stupid, stupid decision I’ve made in the past. I get that we all make mistakes, but I can’t forgive or forget this one of mine since others have reposted these images(mostly on random sites that no one probably goes on, but still). 

I am sorry for the wall of text but I need help here on what to do. I am going to reach out to google to help me make the pics harder to find(they remove them from their search engine, but any other advice will help too.

243,"Hello,

I am new to Reddit, so I apologize if my formatting, titling, or general use of subReddits is not appropriate. 

With that out of the way I would like to ask a question to engineers or technical professionals in the renewable energy sector: I am currently an oil and gas engineer (drilling with some production and intervention), however, I am interested in broadening my technical understanding in renewable energy to the point where I could be employable in the future.  Is there any advice you would give to someone in my situation - be it textbooks to read, short courses to attend, or accredited renewable energy post-Bachelor education institutions to research?

I support both my wife and I by working in my current role, so I cannot terminate my current employment while pursuing education in renewables.

While it may not be of principle interest in your counseling response, it may be worth noting that I very much enjoy the challenges I am faced with in my current role within the oil and gas industry, and I very much enjoy finding ways to engineer around Mother Nature while not being able to see exactly what may be occurring 1-3 miles beneath the Earth.  I also enjoy the fast-paced nature of the oil and gas industry and the various geographic locations to which it relegates you.  It is also very pleasing to know that my work contributes to answering a global demand for a commodity which improves people’s lives.  

Thank you for any and all feedback.  It is very much appreciated. ",28Feb2018,1

246,"I'm not sure how to begin, I'm a newbie to reddit and really just browse around most of the time. I apologize in advance for the long post.

So I'm turning 24 in a few months and I feel like my life is just a fail and I'm not making anything of myself. I graduated school almost 2 years ago with an engineering degree and I got a great job afterwards, both things which I'm very grateful for but ever since graduation, I've been feeling so unhappy with anything in life and I'm just not sure where I'm going. The work that I'm doing is unfulfilling and I'm really not taking away anything from it at the end of the day. I decided to apply to graduate school so I can go back for a masters in analytics but I don't know if that is going to fix anything.

I know this is an issue but I always compare myself to other people. I see folks with better jobs, going to top graduate schools, and having the time of their lives. I'm just wondering where I went wrong and if I'll be miserable for the rest of my life. On top of this, I made a few mistakes and broke up with one of the greatest girls I knew during college (2 years back for gods sake and I'm still not over it). She's doing amazing in life and I'm so happy for her but I always feel so terrible when I realize I lost something so good. I haven't been with another woman in 2 years and I feel like I'm wasting so much of my life just moping around.

I have so many emotions built up about where I'm going next, if I'll ever have a great job, go to a good grad school, and most of all - find someone out there for me.

I know most of you are think this is just a dumb millennial going through the emotions of adulthood but I honestly don't know what to do. ",28Feb2018,1

My problem is as the title states, I'm a guy living at home with my parents and both my sister and brother, the conditions I find myself aren't that bad but I feel suffocated. I am 23 soon to be 24, working full time as a graphics designer and I share a room with my brother whos 21 which we've been sharing a room since birth so we've never been separated or had our own space. My parents just want to make sure we succeed in life and are willing to put themselves at risk to make sure we get ahead.

Lately I've been feeling trapped and prone to anger but I don't act on it or even show that I'm angry at all, I have good self-control but the trapped feeling is always there whenever I'm with my family or at home. The best moments of the day are when I drive to work, being at work, and whenever I go out by myself or with friends.

Another issue is everyone expects to me have a girlfriend but I have no ""urge"" to ask a girl out and if I do I dismiss it. I might be controlling my emotions too much. But like I explained it to my friend it's like telling some to not push a button, it makes them wanna push it and in my case its the opposite they told me to go press the button. Since I was young my father and mother always pushed to ask a girl out or ""go get that"", even finding girls on facebook for me when I had no intentions of a relationship, so that might be the reason I just don't care enough to find a girl friend like most guys my age.

This process took a long time and I am still haven’t got a job. Mostly because I was depressed and didn’t have the motivation or energy to find a job. I have been depressed for a long time but lately I am getting better with meditation/exercise etc. 

I live in an apartment alone for the last 2 months as my roommate moved out. The apartments here are constructed so closely that the sound travels very easily from one house to the other. You can hear the neighbours and vice versa. There is a lady next door who is very loud, dominating and annoying as hell. She fights with her husband and shouts at the kid all the time. She doesn’t work and is there all the time. So far this doesn’t bother me. Ever since I started to live alone in the house (without job) she is not happy that I am there. There are couple of ways she expresses her displeasure. She talks in a loud voice to her husband, says something like this guy is jobless, loser, I don’t know what he does there, he is weird etc. Her kitchen window is very close to my stairs. Every time I walk up and down, she sighs, or say something like ‘oh my god’ and other silly things. 

My self esteem is really low and I am trying my best to bring it up. I have chronic shame in me and I am bothered about what people think about me. I have improved a lot in this regard but parts of it are still left. So her remarks really bothers me sometime and shakes up my confidence a bit. I try to mask her voice by playing tv or music all the time, but I feel like its an escape.

What do you guys think? Should I find a new place or take this as a challenge and improve myself.

258,"Hi, fellow Redditors, I need some advice because my friend (let's call him Matthew) got beat up by this guy who went to our school (we'll call him John), and this is going to sound pretty bad but I honestly think he deserved it and he fell out with me because I didn't defend him. Here's a backstory;

Ok, so when we were around fourteen (we're now nineteen) there was alot of beef in school between alot of people, and there was alot of fights that year (to be honest, we were all a little immature).

There was alot of problems between Matthew and John back in the day. Matthew went around behind John's back saying he's tougher than him etc, he's a fat bastard (even though Matthew's was a little bit on the chubby side also). This went on for months and John finally confronted him about it. Matthew didn't want to fight but John beat him up pretty badly anyway and it was declared that Matthew was not tougher at all. Even after, Matt was still claiming he would win.

So, a few months goes by and Matthew starts shit with John's friends when we were out one day. So his friends called John on his mobile to come and sort out Matthew. We left because honestly, my friend tried to hide the fact that he was scared and me and Matthew split ways when we walked home.

I then heard that John came out looking for him and eventually found him and beat him again for messing with his friends. The problems with them two were getting ridiculous at this point.

So, currently, four years later, me, Matthew and a few others decided to go to the cinema last night and see a new film. It was pretty busy and we couldn't get any seats and Matthew was getting a little pissed off (because he had a drink before). He ended up causing a scene and everyone started to stare at him, which was extremely embarrasing for us considering we were with him. So he starts mouthing off at random people (for example, ""What the fuck are you staring at?"" etc...) We were telling him to shut up.

We finally managed to get a seat and a guy who sat in front of us looked like John from the back. Matthew noticed this and said, ""He looks like that cocksucker John.""

Guy in front turned around and it was him. At first, he was glad to see us (because really, we sorta respect each other. I never had problems with John) and then he said that he was gonna beat Matthew after the film. Matt tried to leave and started making excuses like wanting to go to the toilet, wanted fresh air etc. I knew he was going to leave and not come back. I didn't really let him and it was his own fault for getting himself in this situation.

So, after the film, John beat him again outside. It sort of ruined our night but Matthew is extremely pissed off at me because I never defended him, and before you ask why I'm friends with him, is because I've known him for years and he's one of my oldest friends.

For context, i didn't have any friends during middle school. I managed to integrate a group at the end of high school, but I went to university and never heard from them again.

I'm currently in 3rd year. The 1rst year, i made only one friend who I share a hobby with, N. The 2nd year, we were in different class and i was alone again. I made another friend at the end,M. We don't share the hobby so i never really knew what to talk about, except boring school stuff. Now i'm seperated again and i know that i'm gonna be alone for most, if not for the whole year.
When i see M or N we have a little chat, but that's all.

It's not like i don't do anything. I tell people to invite me, but they never do. I ask them if they want to sit next to me, but they choose someone they already know. When i try to have a conversation with someone new, they usually leave with an akward smile

I recently asked my crush on a date, and she refused. I quickly got over it. I've read and heard often that it's not a big deal, and I agree.

I told her to message me when she's was finished but she just forgot about me and left. It hurted so much that now i can't even face her.

267,"This might seem hella incoherent and disorganized but here goes -

I feel fucking lost. I'm a student whose currently taking about a year off doing internships and getting experience in the ""real world"". This has been challenging obviously, being completely responsible for myself and my successes and failures - but its a fun kind of challenge and I enjoy it for the most part. But I feel like I've had some realizations about life that have been uncomfortable for me to accept.

First of all, ""adults"" (I dont really consider myself an adult yet) are much more egotistical, emotional, and insecure than I realized. It's like highschool just spilled out into real life, there's cliques and drama and like this really weird social power struggle. Nobody knows what the fuck they're doing it seems - and they will fuck you over if it means making their life easier. And there's like tribalism and weird shit all the time, its like people need to feel included and powerful and on the right team. 

Speaking of tribalism there's some shit on the website that's got me reeling. How do subreddits like the_donald, redpill, latestagecapitalism, ect. ect. even exist? There's so much echo chamber and tribalism in those places its fucking depressing, like theres no way you can have an un-biased discussion there. Why would anyone want to be apart of that?? Are people just drawn to the extremes of ideologies sometimes because it makes them feel more in control? Or are they just weak so they need to bias and echo chamber to feel that ""power"" that comes with being right and apart of the right team? Or am I the one thats weak? I feel like I see so many comments that just serve to boost their own ego, like trying to be right and gain other's respect, then to provide a discussion. 

Speaking of extreme subreddits, I visited many of them looking for answers to my lost feeling, and a most of them have at least a few points. For example - the red pill ideology. Many of the ideas are plain disrespectful and seem to stem from resentment towards women - but I feel like they have some points. I feel like women prefer strong willed, capable, rock solid men, competent men – which is something that is preached at redpill. Which is perfectly fine and understandable. But then you have these ""shit tests"" that the red pill talks about that I've definitely noticed in my relationship. These shit tests are served to kind of fuck with you or rattle you to see what you're made of. And in my experience women (to much generalization here?) definitely do this to measure you up, maybe see if you’re “made of the right stuff”. Maybe this is biological, it seems to make sense from like an evolutionary perspective. Or maybe I'm an idiot I don't know. But I feel like women expect this super-capable, emotional rock of a man, and when a man cracks a little bit or shows any insecurity there is a loss of respect. But I consider my S/O so be a great friend as a well as a lover, but I know from experience that when I start to show some cracks I can see the flame damper just a bit. Maybe she isn't even aware of it. So I feel like I can't open up about any insecurities and complaints to her, and as a man i feel like I can't open up to my male friends either about things like this, so who the fuck do I talk to?

In the world it seems like things are pretty fucked up - Trump is an incompetent, narcissistic pussy, and there is so much bipartisanship its depressing. Politicians take bribe money and take part in corruption, knowing that their actions have terrible effects on the common people. Or do they know? But it's like we can't even trust our leaders or believe in them as people. What kind of example does that set? Who can I look up to anymore? It's like everyone is flawed as fuck and only stands for personal gain. And everyone just wants to feel safe and secure, or have that perfect mate, or perfect job, or have some power to feel like they're worth something. 

And there’s so much disagreement on how society should operate - climate change, feminism, mens rights, gun control, mental health, Hollywood, capitalism, wars – who the fuck is right?? It’s like people just latch on to a camp of thinking and just stubbornly never move away from it. And they will terribly mistreat people to support their cause. And there’s so many fucking idiots who buy in into anything they see without any semblance of critical thinking or discussion, and they’re so fucking loud and obnoxious and egotistical.

And I’m starting to see that my parents are flawed people as well, that have mis-judgments, and ignorance, and prejudices (along with their great traits of course). I guess everyone eventually realizes that but its tough. 

Basically, I don’t know who I am really, or what principles I should upkeep, or where the world is going, it seems like there is little genuine compassion out there, I don’t know what it means to be a man, or how an ideal relationship should look like, or how society should operate and who is wrong and who is right and who I can trust even sometimes. 

And I feel like it’s dangerous for a young man to be in this situation, with little direction, and I want to steer the ship in the right direction amidst all the storm.

My friend however, I fantasize about all the time. Especially at night before I go to bed. I don’t understand this - I don’t have feelings for him. But for some reason whenever I begin to think about sex or fantasize he is the first person I think about! 
The thing is that I have had sex with him (a couple times last year) - and it was not very good at all. So why do I always fantasize about my close guy friend instead of any of the dudes I’ve been talking to/sleeping with? It seems very strange to me and I’d like some insight on this. ",28Feb2018,0

275,"I'm still in High School, and since I will be voting very soon I like to educate myself on the current political issues. My parents are very, very strong liberals, however, I have not chosen a party yet. I agree with the left/Democrats on the majority of things, however on some choice issues (such as the Second Amendment) I support the Republican Party/the right. Due to recent events I started to some research on statistics of death due to guns, most guns bought, and how easy it would be to modify a semi-automatic (a single bullet firing when the trigger is pulled) to become a full-automatic (stream of bullets when the trigger is pulled). After looking at some stats, and no opinion articles or ""propaganda"" from social media or controversial news sites (CNN, FOX, etc.) I came to the conclusion that banning rifles such as the AR-15 would be ineffective and could actually do more harm than good, as it would force the fuckers who commit these hideous crimes to use deadlier weapons that could take more lives or be more effective. I tried to discuss this with my parents, however they wouldn't even take my opinion into account and instead just wrote it off as ""brainwashing from the alt-right extremists"". And yes, that is an actual quote. How can I get them to listen to me, or anyone for that matter? There is a big debate going on right now over whether listening to students and minors is a good idea or not (due to the developing state of our brain) and I'm a bit worried that anybody I go to with controversial views may just write me off as stupid or irrelevant - which can lead to other people like me not expressing their views due to social pressure.

Before anyone goes digging through my post history:
I am a minor, if you really want my age just PM me as I would rather keep the exact number out of it (15&lt;x&lt;18). I am **not** a Trump supporter, I disagree with him on almost everything, but I am also not a liberal or Democrat. I have not decided which party if any, I will side with in future elections. Please do not make this into a big political thread full of witchhunts and insults, I would greatly appreciate it if y'all could not be dicks to opposing views and help out fellows like myself. I also am not looking for people trying to convince me to change my mind. I support the 2nd Amendment, and although I shall listen to you (because you have the right to Freedom of Speech, and I will **always** listen to other/opposing views) it will be unlikely that my mind will change on this particular issue.",28Feb2018,2
276,"I need advice.

My boyfriend (28M) and I (24F) have been living together for about 1.5 years. He’s been a cigarette smoker since I met him (4 years ago) and I’ve accepted this even though I’m not a smoker and don’t like it.

In the last few months, I’ve started to suspect that he’s been smoking in the house (something he knows I’m not okay with). I can smell it some mornings when I wake up and I’ve found cigarette butts and ashes on his desk.

I’ve talked to him about it a few times and each time it ends up in an argument and we get nowhere.

The first time I brought it up, he admitted to smoking in the house but said it was only every once in a while. I made it clear that I didn’t want it to continue, but he refused to promise he wouldn’t do it again.

The second time we talked about it (about a week ago), he denied that he was still smoking in the house, even though I pointed out the butts and ashes. He swore that he wasn’t smoking in the house and that he had taken the butts out of his pocket from when he smokes outside. I took his word for it.

Last night, I fell asleep early but woke up around 11:00pm to hear him talking to his friends on his computer. I heard him say something like “Just gonna light up a smoke, I’ve been doing it the last few nights but you can’t smell it.” Then I listened closely and could hear him exhaling.

I don’t know what to do. Smoking outside is fine, but when it’s in the house, I worry about the smell and the obvious health risks presented to me. I’m also upset that he was dishonest with me. Any advice from smokers and non-smokers would be appreciated.",28Feb2018,12
277,"I’m a 24 year old female who moved into my first apartment in November. Since then, I’d say about 80% of my nights have been disrupted by my upstairs neighbor. I try to be a rational and understanding person, but with her actions I just want to know if there is anything at all I can even do so I can get a full night’s sleep more than two nights a week. She is your typical upstairs neighbor from hell- wearing heeled shoes around and seemingly dropping concrete blocks on the floor at random times. Based on my observations, I think there are drugs and/ or alcohol involved. Frequently she blasts her music and sings along very loudly, sometimes to the point where the music rattles my shelves and sounds like it is in my own living room. During regular hours, I try to go for a walk or do something else, but there have been several times where it has been around 2 in the morning on a week night. I’ve texted my landlord who also lives on the property, and she’s gone over and gotten her to turn it off after several minutes of banging on the door. The thing that disrupts me most which leads me to believe she is on drugs- is that she will pace for hours in the middle of the night, almost nightly. The building is old and floors are extremely squeaky, so I’ll wake up sometimes at 3AM to her, just walking, back and forth, for HOURS. She seems to fill up her bathtub at least twice a night and then immediately drain it. It really seems like she never sleeps and just does questionable things throughout the night. I have a normal 9-5 job, and when I leave in the morning and come home, she is always there. I’ve run into her several times when she has been outside smoking, and she seems to be slightly off and very standoffish. You know when you can just tell about a person? I do not feel very comfortable talking to her because she does not seem like a very understanding person. Also, I know that I cannot complain about a person for just simply walking or filling up her bathtub. But, it is really harming my sleep schedule/ peace of mind.

280,"I used to be the top of my class, how am I possibly still this foolish? 


As a teenager I was taken in by a large and wonderful family. A year later I was having a physical relationship with one of them (48/M) -even though we never fully had sex because i was underage. I was absolutely shocked when he picked me up one day and started kissing me passionately. He didnt ask and I didnt resist. I knew it was wrong. He was seperated. When we were together it was wonderful. 


I think the word ""assault"" gets bandied around so much. I am young and beautiful and literally cannot count all the times young and older men have grabbed me and kissed me and pushed for more. Not only ""lowlifes"" but my teacher, a doctor, and my friend's dad could be counted among them. I could rant on for some time about various situations like this that I have personally experienced but what would be the point? Who would that help? I think those kinds of stories become unbelievable really fast. 


One day his seperated wife shows up unexpectedly in the middle of the night and finds us fully undressed and in bed together. An ugly scene ensued. She immediately moved back in despite his protestations. I was never alone with him again. 


I left to go to university some time after that. I heard from mutual friends that the wife is trying to get back together and make their relationship work. As far as I know, we three are the only ones who know about what happened between me and him. I never told anybody and the secret weighed on me.


Almost four years have passed without any contact from either of them. But plenty of contact with the rest of the family. His daughter has become a beloved friend of mine. 


A few weeks ago when I was visiting that town, we ran into each other, he asked me to call him, I did and we met. He seemed scared to see me after all this time. I dont bear him any ill will, and hate the idea of being perceived like some kind of threat. After we caught up for some time he started kissing me, again unexpectedly. I froze as he kept kissing and touching me and asked if we could finally have sex then and there now that I was of age. I found my voice and declined. He didnt push for anymore just kept stroking my body. He told me many things that you might find in a silly romance novel. Then he said he was going to leave his wife (again) and show up at my doorstep in a year or so. I really think he might do it.  


That was a couple of weeks ago. I cant stop thinking about it. I feel like I have to tell somebody about it, but who, his daughter? I dont want anyone else to get hurt. Now I feel like I have to tell, at least, her. 

I think if we are alone together again then I will sleep with him. I want to. And for some reason I know that I wont be able to keep resisting. He has reawoken deep feelings that I have for him. Its like so much has been leading up to this. What is wrong with me? This can only end in disaster...I know I need help. I know I shouldnt ever be alone with him again. Right now I am struggling and failing to understand my own feelings. Where to go from here? ",28Feb2018,1
281,"I have a software development internship offer from company A. The job is 8 months, and would probably give me a lot of valuable experience in development before graduating. I got the phone call yesterday and they said to call back today to discuss terms.  

However, I have an interview tomorrow with a MUCH more renowned company tomorrow for a 4 month internship in more of an administration role. I think it would be a lot more exciting to work at this company (and I'd have to move), but the experience wouldn't be as valuable.

So I can either:

1) Reject Company A in hopes that I get the job at Company B, which I guess I have maybe a 20% chance of getting
2) Accept Company B's offer, because it's still great experience and I don't have to move
3) Ask for a week to decide on Company A's offer while I wait to see if anything comes from Company B.

Even trying when we got to college, I got so far as being his roommate yet still he completely respects my privacy, has not seen me naked once, doesn't mind me in a towel... and the reason I didn't try is because of the fact that he has had a crush on our friend.

She and him has wanted to go out since high school and it's almost as if they were trying to date for so long. So she was telling me about how she wanted so much to get with him so I gave her advice then I hooked them up. Next thing I know he came home so happy so I assumed they were officially dating.

That was probably a bad feeling for me but it got worse, there was many nights she came over to fuck him. And it would give me so much pain in my chest to hear it. I had to literally put headphones or earplugs in so I could even force myself asleep.

And what really killed me is yesterday when I walked into his room to tell him to get up for school. He was sleeping naked with her on top sleeping on him, both on top of the covers... they weren't exactly sleep since he looked right at me and I couldn't help but blurt out, I don't know if I should be happy or disturbed to walk in on this. Although her eyes were closed she seemed to say a bit. But I told them I was glad I could help them get together and left.

Now, here I am sad and depressed about this. And since they are my friends I have no one to really talk to about it. The worser thing is that the girl actually confronted me later that day saying that she can see that I have a crush on him. But I would never admit to it.

288,"Throwaway for this.

For years, my father has been emotionally abusive to both my mother, my older brother (the physical abuse was limited to him) and me. He will tear down anyone, refuses to accept fault and will often bring all three of us to tears. My brother even attempted suicide because of him and thanks to the Baker Act was in a Psych ward for a couple weeks. My father intentionally kept him there longer to “punish him” even when he begged and pleaded to come home. I remember my mom going to visit him (I wasn’t allowed in, 18+ only). This is where it began. She started telling me what he was going through there, how they took away his shoelaces, pocket knife, anything he could have possibly used to hurt himself with. I was around 13 at this point and unaware to her, my father had pushed me to the edge of suicide as well. 

When she started to confide in me I started to notice better how she acted around my dad. When they “debriefed” us (me and my younger sisters) in what had happened, they both had a unified story about how my brother had done it purely to hurt them. They said he didn’t want to die he was just punishing them. My mother looked me in the eye and said this. 

Fast forward to last year, when after getting suspended from boarding school and again on the verge of suicide, I was staying in a hotel with both my parents, my little brother and my newborn sister. I would sleep an hour or two at night, giving me plenty of time to do nothing but think. They had taken away my devices, and my suspension came with so much drama (about me) and I was completely isolated from everything. I had no idea what was going on. Then I did something extremely unethical and wrong, something I regret. I went on my mom’s iPad one night and searched for my name within the messages and emails. I found out the extent to my trouble with my boarding school. But I also found some other stuff. I found an email where my dad mentioned how much he regretted having children, how we essentially ruined his life. Even worse, I found out my mom cheated on my dad a couple years earlier and they began filing for divorce, but canceled it at the last minute. They then had my little brother in an attempt to save their marriage. That day I truly learned the meaning of “ignorance is bliss”. 

Now, my dad has been gone on a “business trip” (its been three weeks though and he apparently just extended his stay by another two...) and my mom is extremely stressed out by him. He gives her impossible tasks that he know she cannot complete and yells at her over the phone when something goes wrong. She has begun to confide in me again, and me just being an awkward teenager do not know how to respond when she tells me in detail everything that my father is doing to her. Any advice on how to proceed? I have kept my knowledge from all of my siblings, my mom and Dad are also both unaware of what I know. Sometimes I just want to tell my mom to divorce him. He is treating her and is terribly. Just because you are the sole provider to your family doesn’t mean you can manipulate and torment them however you like. For the sake of time, I will not go in detail on the post but if you need more info to accurately give me some advice just comment, I’ll answer. So, what should I do if anything? Thanks in advance for all your help, this is the first time I’ve opened up about my dad.

Im an 18 yo, and have never had a solid group of friends in my life. But once I entered college, I finally found a group of friends who actually cared about me. I recently got with my current girlfriend around this time, and as we're all in the same group, it made seeing everyone a lot easier and a lot more enjoyable. Until about 2 weeks ago when I got a call from my drunk friend, who we'll call Caitlin whilst i was with my girlfriend. She proceeded to tell me how I'm not a good person and that everyone in the group of 5 has a problem with me. I agreed to meeting her the next day so we could speak this out in person. It's also at this point that I should mention 2 things; 1) My girlfriend is best friends with Caitlin 2) They've been friends since before I knew my current girlfriend. 
So we met up the next day, and she proceeded to tell me how I'm manipulative, that I don't show any interest in anyone else apart from me and how I am as a person, isn't good enough. I was then told to change the way I am as a person. 
I felt this was unfair, but nevertheless, I personally apologised to everyone in the group for the way I've acted, and also apologised if I'd ever done anything to make them feel bad about themselves. Thankfully, they took it well. Slowly I tried speaking to people individually to try and build up friendship again. Since then I have made continuous efforts to try and be a better person, and also go out of my way to support them. 
 I thought it was working until the 3 days ago when I was told by my best friend, that they'd all (my girlfriend included) to go to Amsterdam on holiday. I asked my gf about this and she told me that they'd considered it, but not directly booked anything. She then showed me the conversation on fb between her and Caitlin. In the conversation, Caitlin directly told my gf how she didn't want me to come, and that I wasn't invited. To this my gf replied ""That's fine, I didn't say he was coming"". This obviously worried me. Not because I expected to be invited (because I wasn't) but because when my gf was told that I wasn't invited, it was shrugged off. Since then me and my gf have spoken about it and resolved it. But I'm at the point where people are making plans without me, and also saying that I'm not invited. I'm not the type of person to make my gf choose between me and her friends, because I'm not going to put her in that position. But I also don't want all this to cause arguments between me and my gf, because that's not fair on either of us.

while i wouldn’t consider myself smart, i did fairly well in taking several ap classes before mental illnesses and pressure to perform well took over and eventually sunk my grades. eventually, i simply stopped going to classes at all out of shame of being the “smart” kid who failed everything.

i am aware that i will need a GED to try and apply to a local community college, and hopefully transfer to a 4 year university after that. i’m not set on a career choice but i am interested in psychiatry and dentistry, two careers that need further medical degrees after getting a bachelor’s. 

i am asking for in depth help in transitioning to getting a GED and the further steps to return to my education, i live in california if that helps! i know it’s a lot to ask but i love learning and want to be able to succeed in this journey. i’ve done some research on my own but i’d like to know as much as possible. 


TL;DR: dropped out of high school at 16 ( beginning of junior year ) after mental health issues and family problems, now 19 seeking advice on how to go to college/uni for potential medical career. 

any advice and/or similar experiences would be appreciated! thank you in advance.

300,"So basically to give you a bit of insight, there is three of them going. One who i've been friends with for 5 years and the other whom I've known all my life but we've always had a weird relationship.

I am a female, but so is this girl. Our parents are both friends but ever since we where little they have put us in an awkward situation of putting us in competitions with everything. If one child was goo at something apparently the other was way better and it seemed to go on and on. Any way we grew up and I rarely seen her. She's a nice girl don't get me wrong but we've only become friends again really due to my friend of 5 years bumping into her and making really good friends with her and now he is constantly with her.

That doesn't make me jealous because I find with my friend of 5 years he becomes a bit too much as he is very camp and his way of going about things is different to mine but thats what makes us work and we like that we are able to go with long periods of times without seeing each other as we meet and its only like we met yesterday. So if anything I'm happy they're friend as it means he's happy and got someone there for him 24/7.

Now the other friend its wayyy more different. This guy became friends with us last year in the end of July. He's one of those who don't make good life decisions and he gets drunk all the time and he just lives for the moment but thats what makes him special. This guy... well me and him have a weird relationship where we only seem to get with each other when we're drunk. It was only kissing for ages and then this weekend it was a bit more but not the full thing.

He is a charmer and a handsome person and it seems the girl that i've known forever also thinks he's alright looking as they've kissed before when drunk and she's mentioned him to me a few times but then she also likes any guy that is attractive that she see's. Again i'm not sure if something in my head has triggered me off where It's a competition again but my friend of 5 years and the guy had planned a trip to London.

We live not that far away and live on a little island under England, I got asked to come along and I denied seeing as it will be my 18th birthday the day before they go and it will be my other friends birthday on that day and i don't want to miss that.

I only though tonight found out they invited the girl to come along and she's now going with them. I need advise because I don't know what this looks like in other peoples eyes. Do I sound jealous because Im worried this girl and the guy I have a drunk relationship with are going to get together? Do I just sound like the competitiveness is kicking in.. Or do I sound like i may have feelings for this guy. 

my other friends always suggest that we'd be the perfect match and that we should always get together... Yes i have considered it but this guy is a player and I must admit I am too when I'm drunk.. I go for anyone I have an interest in... Im stuck... Why am I feeling Jealous....",28Feb2018,1
302,"Hi everyone. Never really posted on reddit before so I feel super awkward but I need help and I don’t know where to find it

I have been with my boyfriend for just under a year and a half. He is my first boyfriend (I’m 21) ,but I am not his. I can be quite insecure and this has been a source of anxiety for me in very, very minute amounts over the course of our relationship (I’m talking like, a handful of times it had bothered me). I have been rather depressed over the past month or two, however, and it has consumed me.

He was my first sexual partner and the main issue I have is that he has had others before me (not many, but that’s not the point). I cannot understand why it is that this bothers me so so deeply. Even the mention of any of his previous relationships has sent me into such an awful sadness in recent weeks. One of the girls is a very very good friend of mine, and they had a one night stand a year before he and I got together - she is in a relationship now too and both of them claim they were never really into each other. But sometimes just the thought that he was interested in her enough to do it really hurts me.

Please bear in mind when I write this that I am fully aware that I have absolutely no right to feel any kind of way towards anyone he has been with before me. It shouldn’t bother me and it is frankly none of my business and I know that, which makes me feel all the worse. He tells me every day that he loves me more than he has or could have loved anyone before me and I truly believe him; I just cannot shake the insecurity, and I feel guilty and upset every time. I love him so much and he is incredibly patient and understanding but I am terrified of losing him. 

I have signed up to my college councillor to talk about my low self esteem in this situation among others, but I am told that the wait may be a few months. He tells me that I am “self-destructively insecure” and he is right. Is there anything I can do to love myself more? Am open to any suggestions at this point because I cannot lose him or lose any more of myself. Thanks",28Feb2018,1
303,"I just went through a breakup from someone who I still loved and who I believe still loved me about a month ago. There was a lot of outside stress that caused us to break up and we’ve been completely no contact for about two weeks. Anyway, a lot of weird things have happened. My friends and I believe they might be signs from the universe but not sure, tell me what you all think:

So initially I asked the universe to give me signs on say, a Tuesday. Nothing happened that day and I had generally forgotten that I had even asked but then the following happened over a week:

I was listening to David Dobrik and Jason Nash’s podcast from around Christmas time. In the podcast they started talking about how they were happy to be you tubers and how they could look back on any day in their lives and see what was up. The day that they said happened to be the day my ex and I started dating, about 5 months before that podcast was recorded. 

The next day I was helping guests at my work and I went to help this one lady. She said she was from out of town and just killing time. Trying to strike up friendly conversation and she just so happen to  be from my exes hometown. Which is over an hour and a half away, and we aren’t the first bigger town or city between there and here.

After that, I had purchased an iPad for school. I set the iPad up as new and then signed into my iCloud. I had deleted all of the pictures of him off my phone and cloud well before getting the iPad, but there they were in my photos.

Finally I pieced it together like wow ok this is a lot of coincidences. No big deal. I said to myself, if these are truly signs I need one more, big sign. I said that if it rains or snows tomorrow, then I’ll know that I shouldn’t let go yet. Shit you not, I woke up the next morning to the heaviest snow fall I’ve seen in awhile. The thing is I had checked the forecast and up until then, there was nothing in the forecast. No one expected snow. They hadn’t salted the roads or anything. It came out of nowhere. 

After this started happening I started seeing 111 and 1111 a lot. Didn’t think much of it but read a little about it and how it’s supposed to be like a sign from your guardian angel or the universe or whatever that you’re in the right direction. There’s lady who I work with who I was talking to about this who freaked out and said that she had seen the numbers in November and knew she needed to help a close friend. After she did she stopped seeing it but had recently started seeing it again about a month ago but didn’t know what was the cause and then she told me that it was me, I was why she was seeing it. She told me I didn’t need to worry and that we’d be okay. 

The next night my friend (who only knows limited details of the breakup) had a dream about him and I (she hadn’t ever met him) where he told me he “just wasn’t ready yet”. The weird part about this is I had texted her at 2am just saying dude after we had both been asleep. I have no memory of doing it. She wasn’t the last person I talked to either. I had 4 or 5 other active convos going but none of them were even opened. We think this is about the time she was having the dream as well. 

Another small weird thing was I had a dream that I talked to him and he told me that I’ll have my answer by this upcoming Friday. A couple days later I went to see what bills I had to pay out of this check (Friday) and saw a holiday set for that day which is Holi. Never heard of it in my life but when I googled it I saw that holi is a Hindu holiday and the wiki page said that it’s a day to repair broken relationships. Crazy. 

I know I sound nuts but I feel like a lot of little things have happened. I am not the only one noticing them either so maybe they are signs. I am not really religious or spiritual but this is all a lot. 

I guess I just want to see what others think about all of this? Am I going crazy?",28Feb2018,3

310,"I am in college, I have a wonderful and beautiful girlfriend, and a great group of friends here in my college town. But that is all about to come crashing down. My college fund has run out, and I’m gonna have to take out loans to attend school after this semester. Only problem is, I am an out of state student and the government will not give me enough to cover my expenses, meaning I will have to take out more money. But I can’t take out more money because I do not have someone who will co-sign for my loans and if I work full time to meet the income requirements I will not be able to make the grades I need to get into PT school. An option for me is to go back home and attend school (maybe the federal loans will cover in-state expenses) or work for some time, but that would mean leaving behind all of the relationships I made at my college town, including losing the love of my life. I’m so depressed and I can’t even think about anything else other than the inevitable ending of my time here and having to break up with my girlfriend. It just seems like my life is falling apart.

311,"Ok so i recently broke up with my bestfriend due to it being a really toxic relationship. I was so happy at first that i guess i didnt really focus on all his negatives at first. One thing happened a couple months ago when we were still friends that i cant stop thinking a about. Were both sober but used to do drugs in highschool so we occasionally will have some fun with them. (We just have this in common, we didnt know each other in high school) He was more of a drug user than me though, he used to pop MDMA and do coke everyday for months. The farthest i ever did was weed and thats it. Anyways we did MDMA one night and i was really nervous but excited, i had trust in him since he knew what he was doing so i just trusted him completly to take care of me. Fast foward a couple hours in and we went to our homes still trippy balls. I decided to go hiking in the local moutain by out nighborhoof cause he said he did that back in highschool on MDMA and it was amazing. I texted him to come if he wanted but he said he was just gonna stay home and masterbate cause its amazing on MDMA. So i went by myself, at 2 am, in flip flops, with my phone at 3%, and just a bottle of water. It was so fun at first but once i reached the peak which was far, far into the mountain, i started coming down. I then realized i was literally SURROUNDED by rattlesnakes. I realized i was right on top of there den or something. I honestly was like 99% sure i was going to die. I was EXPLODING WITH FEAR!! I knew i had like 2% on my phone and decided to call that same friend to come help me. He then told me he was busy masterbating and wasnt leaving his bed. After that i tried just going back down but the fear kept exploding in me like a fucking bomb. LITERALLY SNAKES EVERYWEAR!!!  And at the time i didnt know anything about snakes. All i saw were snakes and all i heard were rattles. Still in my flip flops when they both broke and i was holding on to them my squeezing onto the flaps with my toes. I called him again and was literally crying and he still said no. Then....my phone died. I just remember thinking if i got bit.... I would literally die. Im 2 miles into the mountain with no phone and its 3 am. After just maning up, i took baby steps down and recited so much prayers that i think God got annoyed by me. I successfully made it down and went home. Everytime i think about that night i get incredible axiety and i honestly want to go to therapy because of it. Everytime i call him out on how much of a dick move it was to not help me he just says that when he went there were no snakes and i was just tripping. He always says it nervously like he knows im not bullshitting but doesnt want to admit that he was a dick.

By the way i achknowledge what i did was extermly fucking stupid. It was my first time doing MDMA so my head wasnt really at its 100%",28Feb2018,1
313,"I'm a recent college graduate with a degree in film and media arts and I aspire to be a video editor. I was on Indeed searching/applying for as many jobs as I could and I applied to one without researching it well enough first (which I now know was a mistake lol). It's for a video editor position at a digital media company. 

I got an immediate email from the director of culture there asking for a phone interview the next day. Today, before I had the interview, I started looking deeper into their website to develop some questions to ask the interviewer. I then noticed that the majority of their clientele is right-wing politicians and organizations like the NRA. In a nutshell they produce politically conservative propaganda videos against democrats running for office. The issue? I'm a huge democrat and my beliefs don't line up at all with the content I would be producing. 

I went through with the interview thinking, ""Oh, now I don't have to be nervous because there's no way I would ever take this job, I'll just do it for practice"" but as I was talking with the woman it didn't sound so bad. Basically it's $40-45k a year, flexible hours, and in the area I've always wanted to live. Sounds great, especially for someone fresh out of school. And it's my field of work, too. But it's just not the kind of work I would feel comfortable with... I mean, I could probably do it, but I would feel pretty guilty about it. 

It sounds like I basically have the position if I want it. But I don't know if I want it or not. Please give any advice!!

Other factors: I am not pressed for a job, I have a place to live (my parents house) while I job search. 
Would this hurt my resume in the future if future employers saw I worked for a company like them?

She has been pretty obviously upset with me for a while because she believes that I outperform her at work (even though I don't she just doesn't know that). I also got a boyfriend recently and she has been single for quite a while, and I think she also resents that because when we started dating she had nothing nice to say about him. It was personal things not the way he treats me or anything like that.


Now, we'd never been assigned to a project together before just work friends. It is me her and this other guy. She did speak negatively about the guy to me but seems to target me specifically.


What she's done:


-I did a part of the project and gave up a weekend to do it. She decided that she wanted to do that part so basically said f-it to mine and redid that part while I was on vacation making it all for naught.


-She intentionally doesn't tell me about goings on. Yesterday, we were finished for the day and I was off doing something. He told me that we were dismissed she was just going to leave and not say anything to me.


-There was a meeting this morning that the other guy and I got pulled into. She got indignant and yells that we didn't tell her and targeted me specifically. I told her she needs to get her act together and its not my responsibility. Also, she doesn't communicate about things with me either so how can she expect me to give her that courtesy she told me I was just trying to get even with her.



-She will also figure out information on our portions of the project and withhold it until our boss is around so she can tell him.

She didn't even address our other partner, just raged at me.


It is starting to make me really uncomfortable at work and I need help.

320,"Context:
Person [25M] sees my [17F] prom picture (Instagram), finds me cute and contacts me through friends. I straight up say that I do not want a relationship with them, saying I am unwilling to date due to hurting a previous partner.

We end up talking on voice call regardless and they try to act as a therapist to help me with some stuff (probably a bad decision). The guy becomes infatuated due to looks + the fact that I asked about their mental state (few people they know would do such a thing). After 2 days of talking they are crying that they just want to be used as a rebound or in any way to make me happy.

I didn't give them a chance at all, always being perfectly clear that I did not want a relationship, something which they refused to accept, asking for ""a chance"" and to be treated neutrally, but then flirting and otherwise trying to escalate to a relationship.

Due to this, I opted for going no contact simply because.. it's unfair to play with someone's feelings. They have since said that they would give up romantic feelings for me, but acted otherwise (writing my name in some pen to ""make me happy"").

To be perfectly honest the guy is interesting (when not crying), and someone I would very much like as a friend, but I am also fairly clear that I would not want to date them.

Possibly significant:

 * Took place over 4 days

 * Guy lives in a separate country with no way to travel to mine.

 * Am indifferent to age difference/distance

Anyways I started a new employment at a new company a month ago, planned as personal developement and a step on the career ladder, it kind of turned into of burden.
Workload is way higher then expected/dicussed, pay/salary therefore doesnt seem appropriate anymore, I am still studying, evening-based university, and the time I need to invest into learning get quite rare/non-existent.
 
I started consuming speed and/or coaine if the workload starts to overload.

The friend who was ill, we will call her Sarah, is one I used to know well a few years back but we haven’t kept in touch with much since as our lives have gone in different directions (besides liking some of her posts on Facebook during her journey).  We live further away now, so we don’t have much opportunity to see one another.  This aquaitance sees her a lot and wanted to invite me to the dinner.  I agreed to come.  I’m very happy for Sarah. 

But today, I got an invite from a close current friend, we will call her Allison, to see my favorite band in concert the same day as Sarah’s dinner.  Allison has been a huge part of my life this past year, and I really want to go.  It’s a friendship I have invested in and so has she, but I already RSVPed yes to sarah’s dinner.  And since we are celebrating overcoming surgery/cancer I feel really bad backing out.  

It feels like a moral decision.... personally it would make the most sense to have more fun and see my all time favorite band play and invest in a friendship that is an active part of my life.  I have very little free time these days with 3 kids.  

But... backing out of something I committed to, especially given the circumstance seems wrong.  I probably won’t see Sarah after this, but it still feels wrong.  

... what would you do?",28Feb2018,1
335,"I bought a new Galaxy S5 on Amazon. I had one for years before my current phone and bought it to use as back up phone and phone for my daughter when she is out with friends and as a waterproof camera. When putting the battery and SIM card in, a couple of the tabs broke off that hold the back on. I didn't think much of it, but when I took it to the pool and put it 3 inches underwater, it immediately filled with water. I took the battery out and let it sit for a few days and it powers on now, but it was a salt water pool and I know from experience that it will eventually just crap out on me. 

My credit card has a 120 day purchase protection and I filed a claim, but they want ""an authorized repair facility or manufacturer"" to deem it destroyed. There are only 2 authorized repair facilities in the US so I would have to mail it in. Would they just say it was ok because it still powers on? Or would they deem it a loss since it was inundated with water?

My next option is to contact the seller and tell them that their phone was faulty and not waterproof as claimed. I'm afraid that the water damage would void any kind of warranty claim though and they would just deny the claim. I also don't want to screw the poor seller on this. I would rather have my evil credit card company pay.

346,"Hey guys,

I have had a problem for a while now with my mother. I am 25 now, but I remember that I complained about this behaviour when I was about 10, so that might have been happening much earlier still.

I love my mother very much, but the thing about her is that she *does not say what she wants*, but says *what she think the other person might want*. Which more often than not is absolutely not at all what the other person wants. *This makes it impossible to read her intent and communicate effectively,* leading to strange exchanges when I visit. In effect, she never voices her own wants, but tries to offer and comfort me with things I have absolutely no interest in. This leads to me feeling irritated/smothered and retreating, which she interprets as me being angry with her *in spite of her ""wanting only the best for me""*. Communicating this to her is of no use.

This happens *all the time*. My brother just ignores it, but it irritates the hell out of me. I suspect I have acquired this behaviour myelf and treat others this way.",28Feb2018,1
347,"I took a job about a year ago in a warehouse doing order picking as an in between job for a major distributor of goods in Southern Ontario, Canada. After a few short months of working there, I was approached by the general manager of the branch, and told that they were interested in my extensive experience (for my age) in sales and business. (I have an unfinished degree in business as well. University level.)

He said they were looking to increase their sales team to distribute the work load of all of our current clients (B2B). He said, that, after a few more months of working in the warehouse and learning more about the products and the facilities, I'd be promoted to a customer service role, where I could learn more about this facet of the industry as well, growing in experience. I accepted the position with promise of a raise, and to eventually transition out.

I've been in this position since the new year. They have me entering orders for customers, answering phone inquiries, monitoring e-mails etc... Along with two other individuals who have plenty of experience in this department. The thing is, they don't need me here. At least not right now. It's currently the slow season for construction (working in the door industry) and there frankly, isn't enough work to go around for all of us. Because I'm new, I spend most of the day answering the phone. We probably get between 15-40 calls a day, and they take me (usually) a couple minutes to handle. The rest of the time I literally sit here, browsing reddit, and watching videos.

I'm really self conscious about my inactivity at work (obviously). My busiest days are when one of my co-workers is away or sick, where I enjoy myself. To be clear, I don't hate my job right now. I like the work that I do and I'm looking forward to the future, but frankly, I feel like I'm kind of cheating the company in this position... I've never had a cushy job where I don't really have to do any work before. All of my jobs since I was 19 have been commission/performance based. 

Is there a way I can ask for more work to do/speed up my transition into a sales role as originally promised by my manager without putting my current situation at risk? I feel like if I just come out and say I don't have enough work to do, I'll be sabotaging myself. I'm pretty sure everyone here is oblivious to how much work I actually do. I seem busy enough because I answer the phone before everyone else, and have gotten pretty accommodated with most of our major clients in the past couple months.

Do I just wait it out for a while? Please any advice would be helpful.

Also, I'm 24/M, so my experience is limited.


TL;DR - Took a job, got a quick promotion moving me to a transitional role from the job I'm really going for and the transitional position really doesn't need me here. Not enough work to do. Don't know if I should push for next promotion sooner or just sit tight.

Thanks in advance! Will post any more information needed.",28Feb2018,1

Instead I offered to work on a friendship and move back into a relationship if things get better. She agreed. Then two days later she takes her words back and we are officially over. No relationship no friendship.

Since then she's done all of this against me:

-Telling everyone she ended things and I asked for her back

- Says I'm crazy and manipulative

- She fell out of love with me weeks before we broke up

- Made out with another guy

- Dissed my career claiming because she's a dentist she's superior

- Claims I was super lazy and had no work ethic

In response I sent her two long messages showing love and ignoring her anger. I told her we can have a mature civil breakup and all this name calling is unnecessary. I apologized for all my mistakes and wished her anger would subside. I reminded her she has a place in my heart even though I have moved on.

381,"So, I have a pretty assertive personality. Not in the sense that I'm rude or aggressive, but in that I am very, very big on communication and honesty and have no issue expressing how I feel about things. Unfortunately this has caused issues in some personal relationships relating to a specific pattern.

If someone comes to me because they have an issue with something and are too scared/anxious/shy to speak up, oftentimes they'll ask me to express it for them. A lot of times these issues seem like NBD to me, why wouldn't they be able to express it, of course I can help with that. The most frequent example of this is in living situations. So like for example, when one of my roommates wanted to implement a chore chart but didn't wanna see like a bitch for suggesting it, she asked if I would. Sent a basic ""Hey guys do you all think a chore chart would be beneficial to the apartment? Just an idea!"" and everyone says they think it's great. Not an issue, not a big deal. Totally reasonable. When it becomes a problem for someone b/c their lazy or whatever, I'm the one that gets blamed. Or, for example, a roommate has an issue with other roommates being super crazy loud all the time at night. It doesn't bother me, but since she asked, I sent something like ""Hey since we're all super stressed this semester, do you guys think we could come up with a plan for when it's okay to be loud outside of our private spaces, or what we should do if we have an issue where we need more silence than usual and can't get to a library?"" and everyone is agreeable once again, until someone gets personally offended in a specific situation and I get blamed.

The issue is no one ever actively blames me when the things go wrong, but I can sense tension. And then I talk to a roommate about it, they express that there's frustration that I would suggest XYZ, I tell them it was so-and-so's idea but they were too shy to bring it up, and I swear to God in almost EVERY situation the response is ""Really? They're the one who originally complained to me about it.""

Usually it ends up working out because, like I said, most people know that I am honest to a fault, so they believe me when I say that I was only trying to help out someone else because they seemed unable to speak up themselves. But almost this exact situation has happened quite a few times, with different roommates or living situations. I think I have a tendency to want to help other people and don't consider how it could go wrong for myself, and I'm finding myself to be a target for my roommates' anger when they find something wrong with whatever it is that someone asked me to communicate for them. My mom was actually the one that noticed the pattern so shoutout to her. I'm just upset because I'm realizing I could have had really great relationships with a lot of these roommates had I not tried to baby someone else who couldn't speak for themselves. But I also don't want to cut myself off to helping people who might have trouble speaking up for genuine concerns. What do I do? Has anyone else ever been in this situation?

TL;DR: I am a very honest and communicative person, and sometimes less-than-honest people pick up on that and manipulate me into speaking up about their concerns for them, then lie about ever having asked me to do that. I end up being the one who gets hated. How do I manage this without cutting myself off from helping people? Thank you!",28Feb2018,2

However, I'm horrible at math. But I thought if I only took this one class, I would be able to focus enough on it to keep my GPA at it's current 4.0. 

What I didn't expect was that right before the semester started, my already difficult family life would take a turn for the worse, causing me to first struggle more in the class then I already would have (my last test I got a 54, and my average is now a 70 in the class...) And then at some point things got so bad at my family home, I realized I needed to figure out a plan to get out of there just to keep myself okay.
So I've been working on that. I work as a babysitter and nanny making 10-15 an hour depending on the job, but the hours that I'm in class/doing homework/studying have kept me from being able to accept a full time position, which is what I would need to be able to support myself on my own right now. 
I thought about getting a loan to support me moving out, but with all this crazyness I'm already struggling with + the crazyness of doing that, can I really keep my grade up? 

I just really don't think I can do this class right now, as sad is it makes me. I didn't mention I spend a lot of time taking care on my younger sister as well. I've been trying so hard to keep her okay, keep my grade okay, earn enough money to move out, keep my mental health okay, and keep my relationship okay (with my boyfriend only, no time for friendships sadly..) and I just don't have time to do them all. I really don't. 
It was really hard for me and my dad to get the almost $2,000 for this semester though, and I'm probably going to cry if I have to withdraw and waste it... I really wanted to be able to just power through all of this.

TL:DR- Withdraw date for my college class coming up in 2 days. I don't have time to get the grade I need, but I don't want the $2000 spent on this semester to have been wasted...

*edit- forgot to mention that I already have on ""W"" on my transcript, so this won't be the only one colleges will see when I'm trying to transfer",28Feb2018,5

389,"Ever since the semester started, I've been struggling with and failing at my Japanese class. I finally decided to contact a tutor and we had agreed to meet at the university library today. The entire time I waited for her I just felt really nervous.

I still hadn't gathered my nerve by the time we were sitting across from each other.  In fact, there was silence from both of us. I couldn't even look her in the eye. I started to pull out my textbook and something to write with while I waited for her to speak up.

The only other tutor I've ever had was a lot more outgoing and it was easy to let him take charge in the conversation. I really  didn't feel up for taking charge of our conversation.

After the uncomfortable silence, she asked me what I needed help with. ""Well, I'm struggling with everything to be honest,"" was my response. After another long silence she asked me if there was anything specific. I said the first thing that came to my mind, ""verbs."" ""Is there anything specific that you didn't understand about the lesson?""
It was at that point that I got out of my chair. ""Sorry, I shouldn't have asked,"" was the only thing I could say as I packed up my things. As I turned to leave I could hear her say, "" Ok . . .?""

This was probably my most awkward moment in a long time. I really didn't know what else to say. I wish I was more of an outgoing person, but I'm just not. I know she really didn't need to be treated like that. Should I apologize to her or just drop the issue and just not bring it up again?  ",28Feb2018,2
390,"Hello, I am currently working in a County Jail as a Control Room Operator. Tomorrow I am having my psych evaluation, because they would like me to promote to Corrections Officer. I have no experience in law enforcement, or corrections, besides the 9 months I have been working in the Control room. I have 3 years of experience working in a psychiatric ward, and I know there are many similarities, like fights and restraints, but also many differences. I learned from working psych that acting like a hard ass can do more damage than good, but to still stand my ground. Give respect and get respect, but don’t be a pushover.  I am a 5’2”, 120lb female, which I know will give me some challenges, but I would like any advice I can get. What was your biggest challenge when starting off as a C.O.? What do you wish you knew before you started? Any advice helps! Thank you! ",28Feb2018,2
391,"Hello all,

So I’m 23, currently at a Community College finishing my associates before I transfer to finish out a bachelors in anthropology. 

Obviously, considering I’m 23, I took off some time after high school before starting up college which was honestly pretty awesome and I think helped me mature a lot before I went back. 

Unfortunately I have always been terrible at math and haven’t had to take any math classes yet and being away from math for so long has definitely screwed me a bit.

Well next semester I’m going to be taking a basic algebra class, it’s legitimately the ONLY math class I need for my degree since it’s an AA. 

I’m about 95% sure I will fail if I don’t do some tutoring or something but I work as a full time nanny and do online classes so I don’t really have time to head on campus. So my question is does anyone know of some good online stuff I could use to help me regain some confidence in math? 

Anything free or slightly cheap would be awesome too

Appreciate the help friends. ",28Feb2018,2
392,"Hi, I'm a 17/m from Canada. Over the years, I've been thinking a lot about what I should be doing after high school. Seeing how unsure I was, my parents took me to a psychologist to pass a test that'd determine what careers would be best suited for me. It has 3 main components: A test to determine my personality, a test to determine my I.Q. and a test to determine my interest.

The results says that I'm a social, sensible person and that my I.Q is 116. With these results, the best careers suited for me are 
the ones where I could help people in a not-too-stressful environment. The test recommend working in the health field or in education. Being a doctor does not interest me at the moment, but being a teacher could be nice some day.

My problem is that my dream career would be to be an infantry soldier in the Canadian army and eventually joining the specials forces. That's not what my parents want and that's not what the psychologist recommend so they say I should avoid that. I always dreamt of being a soldier, helping those in need and protecting my country but after being told that I should not be doing that, I'm kind of lost. Thoughts?",28Feb2018,2
393,"I'm a student living with 3 other girls in a shared house. one of my flatmates has had this boyfriend for 3/4 of a year now who has completely swamped her life. everything she does is about him and she can't go anywhere without him. even when we go on nights out or to the cinema he has to come. Since september he has been staying a lot and since december he has stayed every single night at out house. she lives in the room above me so i can constantly heat them talking and having sex. he has a fulltime job so leaves for work fairly early in the morning every day. she skips all of univeristy and stays in bed pretty much all day everyday until he comes and she has a shower and they order takeaway 75% of the time. I'm tired of him living in our house. I've tried talking to said flatmate multiple times about him staying less but then she looks at me as if I'm being totally rude and asking the impossible and says how she can't sleep without him as she gets nightmares. I don't know what to do. I've tried ear plugs and I've tried talking to her but nothing works. if I ask for him to stay less I feel guilty for thinking she can't sleep without him. fyi I'm 20yrs and she is 22. I don't know what to do and it's all building up and I feel like the tension will get too much.

would really appreciate any advice .

Thanks in advance ",28Feb2018,2
394,"I’m in high school, and I’ve had a girlfriend for a little over a year. I’ll be a senior next year and I realized it’s time to face the music and talk to my girlfriend about breaking up. My feelings for her prior to this have been increasingly dulling out, and I was losing interest. I told her it’s time to be realistic and it’s just not possible for us to date, since I want go to college out of state. Once she agreed with me I instantly felt a wave of regret, and feelings come flooding back. I can see how this is sort of a “grass is always greener” situation because since I’m losing her, I instantly want her back. but is this normal? Or should I ride my feelings of regret and clear things up?",28Feb2018,2

For a while I thought it was tinnitus. It’s just a low constant droning hum. A couple of days ago however my mom asked me if I could hear it, so it’s definitely something that’s in my head. I can’t even get a good recording of it because the static is just a bit louder than it. It’s only at night and is not scary it’s just we can’t figure out what’s making it. Idk what the best subreddit to ask because it’s so odd. ",28Feb2018,4
