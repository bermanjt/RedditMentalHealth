2,"Okay so, here it is. Slightly complicated situation here. Actually… I’d define it as very complicated. Hence why I’ve resorted to asking the internet for advice. Here goes. LONG POST AHEAD!

My SO/Fiancée received a friend request on Facebook several days ago from a guy who lives somewhat in our area (like 20 miles south of us). They begin chatting through messenger, normal stuff, finding that they have a lot of common interests such as anime and video games. Somehow it comes up in conversation that he has Asperger’s Syndrome (also known as High Functioning Autism or Autism Spectrum Disorder). WELL FANCY THAT! So does my SO! (and so do I, for the record) Turns out, he wants to go on a date with her. She respectfully informs him that she is taken and not available to date, nor will she be at any point in the future. That aside, she’s doubly not interested because she’s only interested in me, her future wife. Cue self-hating, exasperated complaint session from Mr. Nice Guy. “Why didn’t you tell me before we started talking?” “That’s not fair, how was I supposed to know you’re engaged?” (&lt;- for the record, I do not have a Facebook account, and as such my SO is unable to post that she’s in a relationship with me. Also…hesitant because she has her homophobic distant relatives on FB) 

And then…it gets worse. He asks if it’s a monogamous relationship. “YES, IT IS”. Cue SO with a bit of an insert-foot-in-mouth moment (it happens a lot to us Aspies) saying that she’s tried a non-monogamous (open/poly) relationship before and it didn’t work out. She said nothing other than that, and he goes on to imply that it wouldn’t have failed if HE had been the guy instead of said guy that was actually involved. Blah blah blah, they both explode at each other, shit happens, she unfriends him, I’m taking way too long on this.

ANYWAY, she decides to answer him the next morning, start fresh since he apologized. Blah blah. (insert more story here that’s not really too relevant) I end up talking to him and informing him to the best of my abilities that the way he’s trying to rush into relationships is the reason women stop talking to him after only several hours of interacting. That you have to learn to reflect inwards on yourself, and recognize that you yourself are a whole person who doesn’t need some mythical “destined other half/soulmate” in order to live. And even if said person was out there, it may take YEARS (yes years, gasp!) for it to culminate into anything. And that if it did that it’d be rare. He seemed more receptive to my logic, and has said now that he realizes he can pursue a friendship with intelligible people like me/us that is just that: a platonic friendship that goes nowhere but friendship, like the kind you’d have with another guy. 

My question for advice is this: My SO is easy to rage-quit when it comes to social things. She’s thinking of just being another “bitch” that blocks him and never talks to him again. Because he’s a little annoying. I think that under certain rules the both of us can still handle talking to him, because I believe that some of what I have to say may be able to better inform him into possibly changing his ways. Should I/we continue onwards in hopes of helping better educate him on how to respectfully interact with women? Or should we just block him after all?",31Jan2018,1
3,"TL;DR: Decided to live with my best friend at college and turns out he is a horrible roommate. Is it worth it to leave him out of my apartment group plans for next semester and run the risk of losing his friendship if it means having a MUCH better living condition?
As a backstory, I began my freshman year of college last year, during which time I met one of my best friends. The two of us decided to be roommates, grouped up with some of our mutual friends, and decided to move into an on-campus apartment together.
Everything started out great until we realized that my roommate is a complete slob, doesn't do anything to contribute to make this space a better living situation, and stays up until 3am yelling at his PS4 keeping all of us awake.
Last week we were having friends over, so I asked him to clean our toilet and sink before they got here. (I am normally the one who cleans it but I had a busy weekend and wasn't in the apartment at all before our guests got here) Of course, he didn't do it. When I confronted him about it, all he said was ""If I thought it needed to be clean then I would've cleaned it."" The point wasn't how dirty it was, the point was that I asked him to do something so small and effortless that I do every week WITHOUT having to be asked. Sure it may be too small of a thing to get upset over, but I have had enough of it because this is how he reacts to everything we confront him with.
As we approach our second half of college (and are able to move into nicer apartments next year), I am seriously contemplating whether or not to leave him out of our plans and let him fend for himself when it comes to his living situation. Although, he is one of my best friends and I know he has always here for me when I have gone through rough times.
So I'm asking you reddit, what should I do?",31Jan2018,2

6,"So I am a big nerd and have been planning with my friends and girlfriend to go to an anime convention to celebrate my graduation the week after.

However my parents are coming to visit from overseas and my siblings want to make plans for that specific weekend to spend time with our parents since we haven't seen them in so long. I told my brother about this and he told me I should spend time with our parents and should just skip that weekend even though it has been planned since last December. My friends are upset and my girlfriend is especially pissed because our badges for the convention are non-refundable. My family is now upset at me too as they see this as me prioritizing the convention over spending time with family.

I'm upset because I will literally take a month off of work to spend time with my parents and whatever weekend they want to hang out. I just want this one weekend to celebrate my achievement after many years grinding my ass off to get a diploma. Is that so wrong of me?

7,"To start with, I was not raised with a healthy attitude to food. My parents fed me unhealthily and both hated cooking which meant lots of fast food. I'm not blaming them at all I just want to give context. As an adult I have fast food (McDonalds, KFC) probably around three times a week on average. When I'm not eating that, I'm eating other convenience food - prepackaged sandwiches, microwave meals, etc. When I wake up in the morning I grab things like a bag of crisps or a yoghurt rather than take the time to pour myself a bowl of cereal or something. I'm a really busy, stressed out college student so I find the idea of preparing a meal and spending time and energy into thinking up ideas of what to eat and subsequently cooking it exhausting and ""not worth it"" (I know how ridiculous that is). 

The thing is, I'm doing a Biology degree. I have taken nutrition classes, I sit in lectures which talk about the link between diet and heart disease, strokes, cancer, arthritis, etc. 

I don't exercise. I'm a student so most of my time is spent sitting in lectures or sitting at my desk working. My designated carpark on campus is close to my building so I don't do much walking. I don't go to the gym or do any workouts at all. I'm embarrassed at how out of breath I get walking up three flights of stairs and I have to suppress the fact that I'm exhausted.

I realise how much I'm at rock bottom in this aspect of my life tonight. I left the hospital after visiting my grandparent who has had a stroke and then went and got myself burger and fries for dinner on the way home. 

Does anyone have any advice? 

Thank you.",31Jan2018,4
8,"I'm an 18 year old female. I'm currently in college studying something I like. I have a few friends in class and some high school friends that I still talk to, and sometimes I just feel so boring to others. I'm a really neutral person, I have my personal opinions, but I'm not the type of person who's extremely passionated about something. I have hobbies and a few movies/series I like, I guess I'm too mature for my age or intimidating like someone in high school told me. I began to think about all this because my friend was going to introduce me to a friend of hers because he was single and pretty cute/kind. I wasn't high on expectations about it, but I was happy. It turns out he's actually taken. I don't know how this relates to my current thoughts, I just feel like my days are the same and nothing new and beautiful like loves happens to me.

First off I’m a second semester freshman majoring in engineering and I’m lost. This past semester has been one of the worst months of my life thru illness and loneliness. I go to a private school 3 hours away from home and I still miss my parents and girlfriend back home. The school I attend is aight but I just don’t feel happy here. My school is expensive af and I’m riding on scholarship or I wouldn’t be able to attend. However, I don’t know if it’s worth it anymore. I don’t recall the last time I was “happy” and school stresses me out constantly. Often I get very depressed because of being away from home, despite being in college for months now. My question is if it is worth attending a less prestigious state school which is 5 grand a year cheaper (still nice just not as nice) in order to be 30 mins away from home, or is my misery purely self made?",31Jan2018,1
11,"31, male, Indian. Living in East Tennessee, USA. I have a background in Digital Media and hold a Bachelor's.

I got laid off well over a year ago doing tech-related publishing work. I've been doing freelance work since and have been trying to get a good paying full-time job back due to piled up expenses.

First, I rarely receive a rejection letter. Usually its dark silence. Okay, I can live with that.

But the ones that do get a response from, always almost end up the same way.

""We reviewed your resume and determined you're not a good fit for our company.""

I have gone to temp agencies; all I'm told is that ""there's nothing here in this part of the state for your qualifications; you can have a factory job as a welder, though.""

I've gone lots of places. Where I live, there are only a few tech companies so you can only knock on someone's door so many times. I've applied to people in a 75-mile radius where I live. While I've been applying for web development jobs, graphic design jobs and IT jobs, I've tried things a bit off the beaten path as factory project managers, office workers, data entry and almost anything clerical. 

I can't help but to think I'm either being biased against or something is not letting me get an interview. I'm trying to redo my resume and I don't have anything online except some information about some books, art and a game I'm making. Social media is either clean or private.

I also wonder if it had to do something with my last job. Said company was in financial trouble and was being dragged into a lawsuit, so I don't know if people are maybe searching the company, seeing that then deciding not to hire me. I unfortunately don't have any other work experience related to my degree or field except for this position.

And with that, I worked almost 3 years there. I got laid off and did not quit.

I've never landed a proper interview since I've gotten laid off, and it's bothering me that something is wrong with me somehow that I'm not being accepted into anything tech, web or graphic design related. 

Any advice or insight is appreciated.",31Jan2018,1

Ive been in a relationship with my girlfriend for almost 5 years and we have a 7 month old boy. Shes at the point where she wants to leave the state and take the baby. Long story short ive worked part time for a year and a half thinking this job was going to go full time, it got slow and I got less hours. She wanted me to get a 2nd job, but I procrastinated and procrastinated and when my son was born I wanted to spend that time with him. Selfish of me I know.

Money started to become an issue and she almost left me, but gave me another chance to find something. Unfortunatly I didnt do everything I could have to find one, I should have been applying to anything even if I knew it wasnt going to work out or it was too far. But I got picky and didnt want to just do anything, I made a list of them and shortly after getting that together I saw my family was hiring for their business, I just hadnt spoken to the owner in a long time and we hadnt been on good terms so I didnt ask them immediately. I procrastinated and then she just blew up at me on sunday threw it at my face that I didnt fill out every application I could have. 

Nows she wants to get a lawyer and file for custody so she can leave the state but she cant do that til she gets taxes and I just so desperately want to save our relationship. Im not a bad person I never hit her, call her names or abuse her in anyway. Im a great dad, shes said it herself, everyone sees and knows that. I just thought that if I can do something for valentines maybe she will see that im serious about us and not going to procrastinate anymore. I have less then a month to show her.

14,"Hey everyone,
I'm the oldest of my siblings and cousins and this year, my mom, brother, cousins and aunt and uncle are all going to Florida for spring break, but since they're all in high school their spring break is a month after mine. I'm trying to figure out a way that I can go with them on their spring break.
I'm taking 16 credits and I've talked to all my professors about missing that week. All but 1 of them have said that we can definitely work something out so I can go that week and make up my class work.
I'm in a science residential college and since I'm a first year and this is just a basic class, all the freshman are taking it so there are 4 different lectures, each with like 150 students in them. My professor is being really rude about the situation even though I approached her very politely and professionally and 3.5 months in advance. We have an exam that week and she basically told me that there was no way that she was going to allow me to take the exam early because she simply won't have the content ready. She's not offering me any help at all. It is also this professors first year here after leaving another large University in my state and after reading her RateMyProfessor reviews, I'm not sure that she left on good terms. They all say that she was extremely condescending and constantly talked down to students, which I have experienced more than once.
I understand that this is college and I'm an adult now and I'm not going to get to do everything that I want to do, but she's being very unreasonable. Do you think it's worth a shot to go to one of the other professors that teaches the same class just to see what they would say about the situation and see if they can offer me any advice or do you think that it would be a waste of my time?",31Jan2018,1

18,"This is with Holiday Inn Club Vacations. They've already charged his credit card, and we get cash and a ""rebate"" of the total after we sit through their 2-hour presentation on time shares. The cost is otherwise non-refundable and the reservation is non-transferable.

After checking out Trip Advisor, the place we're supposed to stay is dirty, thin-walled, and staffed with unfriendly people. The reviews of the time share presentation mention that they went far over the 2-hour limit and were rude and insulting. 

I might be able to tolerate a few hours of nastiness, but not if the room we're staying in is a shithole. We're not scheduled to go until summer, so I'm really hoping to get out of this.

Does anyone have any advice for convincing them to refund us? I've considered telling my husband to tell the rep that he caught me cheating and we're divorcing (couples are required to attend together), that he had to institutionalize me for drug use or insanity, or that I've developed a terminal disease.

The latter won't work for me, because I feel like I'm tempting fate - getting out of something by pretending to be sick means karma will make you sick. (I know, I know. It's a silly superstition.)

20,"I (15M) am in a relationship (15F) and there are some things I just don't understand. First of all I don't know if I have to tag this post relationship or if it's done automatically. I have so many things to say so it might be all over the place so apologies Reddit, and it might not that be that big of a deal but this is my first (serious?) relationship. 

So, first and foremost, my main concern is that my girlfriend is very jealous. For the first time, I decided I wanted to hang out with a female friend about a month ago (she did not have feelings for me and I did not have feelings for her) and beforehand I told girlfriend that I had planned to go to female friends house and that I had wanted to hear her thoughts. She ended up saying something along the lines of it making her feel sick and that she actually wanted to vomit and cry. This, to me, kinda seems like a red flag.. idk what to do about that. My reasoning was that I'm allowed to hang out with female friends and that if she trusts me it shouldn't be a problem. Without going into specifics, my girlfriend has certain family issues and she doesn't have many friends, which I feel like make her very.. emotionally dependent. I can't handle the emotional dependence most of the time. I have anxiety that I take medication for and PTSD, and I just don't know what to do. Also, recently I have been noticing  other girls, and I don't know if that's normal but I feel like a bad person. I ended up admitting to her and explaining that I felt like it was normal for boys my age to do that, and that I wanted her to consider accepting that fact. I stated I still wanted to be with her and I wanted her to view it as like.. a test of loyalty or whatever. Our relationship is important to me but as I type this I feel more and more like I sound like a freshman in a shitty relationship that has no real meaning. I don't know if I can say I know what Love is and I know there is like a 2% chance of actually marrying this girl. But she feels like an obligation and we've been close to breaking it off before due to myself telling her that I felt like we were too serious and I wanted something more laid back. She stated she felt like it was hardly serious, which was odd because I felt like we were acting like we were married. If I end up wanting to break it off after all, I just want it to hurt the least for everyone. I've recommended for her to get a counselor and she agreed, but she said she didn't like it. She isn't close with her parents so I feel like I'm her only sense of worth and it's tearing me apart. I explain to her that I feel as if when you support someone, you give some of your emotional stability to them and you can only give so much. She just says what's wrong with going to your s/o?

21,"I'm 18 in my second semester of college but I am just coming to terms to the fact that I've been ignoring my source of self-inadequacy that have been with me since I was a child--a lot of it has to do with interactions with guys.

For most of my life, I've been going to all-girls schools, so I never really had so much exposure to boys. Whenever I did, they would always tease and mock me--as most boys as children do. 

Throughout middle school (and arguably still present now), it became my goal to make a guy like me or at least find me attractive. I was never ""like the other girls"". I was somehow programmed into thinking that I needed a guy's approval to be content with myself. Now whenever I'm around guys from my childhood or from a similar background of mine, I get insecure, because in the back of my head, I feel like they're going to talk about how dorky I look or how awkward I am behind my back. 

Another part of this insecurity stems from that every guy I was ever interested in found a different girl to be with who I considered more pretty and more social. Of course I wish these guys to be happy and I would never want to say anything bad about those girls, but I always felt like I was never enough. They all wore amazing make-up and had tons of guy friends and they were funny and ""one of those girls""--this idea I created as a child. Every time I see a guy I'm attractive to, something is telling me ""he's probably interested in a more attractive type of girl. who am I to approach him?""

I was never a hard working student, my plan was to finish high school and start working with that degree ( engineering related, programming big machines ).

25,"Hi everyone,


As you can see in the title, I was told some hours ago that my father was a 'pedophile'.
Never in my life I've thought I would post such a thing, I'm totally shocked and seeking for advices.

&amp;nbsp;

I have another sister and never he did such a thing to her, neither to me.
Lately, my half-brother revealed to the family that my father abused him when he was a child.
My father died two years ago and I was really depressed at that time.

&amp;nbsp;

Now I know that I'm totally disgusted by him and I don't feel anymore sad for him.
I don't know all the details, how far he went but we all know that's the truth, proofs were given (I skip all the details).

&amp;nbsp;

My mother now understands many things which were odd at that time (this happened something like 15 years before). 
When she learnt about that, she crumbled, shaking and weeping like I did...
Unfortunately the harm is done for my half-brother, and never we will forget...
Now I know about that, I'm very anxious because I have two little boys.
On my side, I live abroad and I used to visit my father with my elder son once a year when he was still alive.

&amp;nbsp;

The fear I have is that he could have done so such a thing to my elder boy, which is 6 years old by now.
The last time we visited him, my little boy was 4 and was hardly ever with him all alone.
But it did happen, maybe two or three time for some hours... (between the age of 2 to 4 years old).
Most of the time, we let our son during his nap and when we were back he was still lying in his bed, waiting for us with a good mood, nothing looked wrong.

&amp;nbsp;

Nevertheless, I cannot stop myself from thinking that he could have done do something sexual with my son as well.
This doubt is eating me from inside, I can't sleep anymore.
Once again, my son just looks fine now and he looked fine at that time as well, but he was max 4 years old when we went there for the last time, how could he now know if his grandpa was doing bad things with him, how could he express that  nowadays ?

&amp;nbsp;

We asked him indirect questions to see if something could possibly indicates an abuse, but nothings seems to indicate such a thing fortunately.
My mother doesn't stop telling me I shouldn't not think about such a thing because he was really proud of his little son, he wanted to live for my sisters me and him but now I know about that creepy story I have the feeling I have never known my own father...

&amp;nbsp;

Would you have any advice please ?
I would like to be sure that my son wasn't abused...
Maybe I should check a child psychiatrist ?
On my side, I'm going to consult a psy...

29,"Hi all, I'll get right into it. I am not sure if i should be truthful with student evaluations. We are doing group projects in the class, and whatever we rate our team members is factored into the overall grade. So its entirely possible that a low score could make someone fail a project. A project is around ~30% of the entire course grade. 

My dilemma has multiple points in dealing with those that did not contribute: 

* I feel like maybe they were just super busy and unable to come, or they could have blown it off, I really have no way of knowing if their contribution, or lackthereof, is legitimate. 

* If I were to receive a failing grade on this, it would be devastating, as the class is not the easiest material. Add in that if someone would have to retake this it could play into a larger financial burden, or have larger future repercussions.

* I feel like it might be against the ""Teacher vs student"" mentality. We are all trying to pass, we all just want to get out of college. 

So I'm pretty conflicted if I should just be honest with my group rating and give the non-participants a really low score, which could end up failing them. Or just tell a white lie because thats was college bros do.

Anyway, I've been feeling burnt out lately and not sure what I want to do. I really kind of want to switch my major to psychology. I want to become a therapist/counselor.

It's a fictional character, but that man is my greatest role model and a father figure to me. I needed someone like that in real life, and I never got it. I want to be that person for others then.

This guy has been such a great friend to me. I really care about him, and see him as family. Any advice I can get on how to reconnect with him and not lose him again, I'm willing to take.

His uncle has a broken 40 gallon fish tank that he doesn't have the money to maintain. He wants $50 in hopes of buying a new 40 gallon tank. The fish will die if he doesn't get a new tank.

34,"i’m 17 and I just lost one of my best friends to suicide, she was really heavy into drugs but it seems i will never really understand why she did it. She left a note and she said goodbye to everyone she knew but not much else. 

I just can’t understand why she’d do this ,and i spoke to her all the time. Its obvious that the drugs got to her and we tried to help but she couldn’t stop smoking weed all the time. She was 16 and had become disconnected and lethargic sometimes towards the end. 

She threw herself under a train and i just hurt so much. just with all my friends now it feels wrong because there is a gap where she used to be and my friends feel it too.

35,"I am posting this for a friend who needs some advice on where to go next.
Here's the deal:

- purchased used Ford Explorer in spring 2017. Warranty expired Dec 31 2017. 

- Warranty issue acknowledged by dealer in Sept 2017. Dealer could not solve the issue, issue continued into the early winter.

- Dealer says issue is cold weather related. Wants customer to wait until weather gets cold again, but we had a relatively warm fall/early winter. Finally gets cold at christmas, dealer is closed until new year.

- New year arrives, dealer takes explorer in and figures out the problem, but says sorry your warranty is expired and this will cost ~$1500 to repair.
How is this possible? Dealer advised to wait, warranty claim had been opened long before warranty expired. My friend has asked the service dept of the dealer to talk to ford canada, and the best they have come back with is a 30% cost share. This should have been covered since the issue came up while the warranty was valid.

What are the next steps? Need some advice, anything helps at this point. Thanks in advance.",31Jan2018,2

39,"Hi everyone. I'm a college student right now and am working about 20 hours a week. This is strictly on the weekdays and it's ten hours per job. They are both internships of sorts. The first one is lovely. I've been working it for over a semester and really enjoy the work although sometimes I am asked to do ""intern"" like work.

The other job is something else though. The internship is at a very good company in the field that I would like to go into. I was promised to be given technical tasks that would sharpen my skills when I was interviewed and extended the offer. I've been working there about a month now and I hate it so much. I did the math and about 15% of my time spent there was doing technical tasks. I look back and most of my time spent was done doing manual labor. 

Today, I was working again and I generally try to keep a positive outlook. I had a task assigned last week that had to do with coding and was excited to get to it. It was just after I finished moving some more boxes that I would get to start it. I finished that last week and came in today excited. I got maybe 10 minutes into the problem and my boss pulled me aside and showed me another week or two of manual labor that he said needed to get done immediately. 

Quite honestly, I almost lost my shit right there. Instead, I just closed up and silently went to work. 

I've been thinking how dissatisfied I am whenever I have these days at work. I truly despise many aspects of it but the thing that kept me going through it was the fact that it's a well established niche company in my city and how good it would look on my resume. 

Today, out of anger I felt that it wasn't worth it in the slightest and how my time spent there would be better doing anything else.

Now that I've calmed down a little, I'm on here to ask what everyone else thinks of this.

Thanks for any replies.",31Jan2018,2

52,"Let me start off by saying that no one in my family has graduated college. A few have taken some classes but no graduation, no diplomas. Most two full-blood siblings did not even attend college and both dropped out of high school. I graduated high school with decent grades and have always been regarded as the ""golden child."" I'm obviously the favorite and the most likely to success since I've always stayed out of trouble for the most part and just did what I needed to do without giving any trouble. 

My dad has always been a strong advocate for going through school and getting a degree to be successful. He is so set in the believe that that is the best path for me.

I started college full-time in 2016 but withdrew that semester because I ended up skipping too many classes to pass. Since then I've passed three college courses over the course of two semesters and am taking two currently while working full-time (still living at parents house).

Over the course of me taking these college courses and discoving my wants/desires in life. College does not seem right for me. I know I can be successful without a degree and most of what I learn in college to get that piece of paper will not be applicable in real life. 

So, with all that being said, I have a good bit of pressure on me to finish college. My dad thinks I'm going to and it's what right for me. He thinks I'll be the first person to graduate from college in the family but that's really just not me. 

I'm not sure how he might react to me telling him all this or even how/if I should tell him all this. Should I? If so, how?

It's also worth noting that I'm very happy at my job that I have now and probably make just enough to live in a decent little apartment on my own. There is also a lot of room for me to move up at my job and I have aspirations to start my own company some day.

54,"I'm in my second year in college where I'm studying photography. This is where part of my anxiety is coming from, as I'm learning that I love photography/video as a hobby and not as something I'm willing to work endlessly at just to pay the bills. Maybe that'll change, but I've had that feeling since the start and I dont think its going to change any time soon.

With that said, I have poor work ethic. It's extremely easy for me to start day dreaming and drift away from whatever it is thats in front of me. I'm working to fix this, since I understand that that's a large part of what makes work harder than it needs to be. I know this because when I can get myself to engage I can actually find some enjoyment in work, no matter what it is.

The thing I've found the most purpose in during my time in college has been music. I love digging for new music, whether its at a record store, the internet, or through listening to the radio. I love spending hours searching and then coming across a new band/genre that blows me away. What I love even more is sharing these discoveries with other people and seeing that same reaction in them, though this doesn't happen often since the music culture/taste where I'm at now is very very different than mine (I live in a small area where everyone essentially listens to pop/edm/folk). I also find a lot of enjoyment in playing music/making beats out of the music I listen to (sampling) for my own enjoyment. I actually consider myself to be studying this sort of thing more so than what I'm currently in school for since I'm usually rushing to finish school assignments in order to get back to music. This, however, is another area of interest that many others share and is an incredibly difficult area to ""make it"" in. 


My ideal place of happiness would be if I could still afford to spend a good chunk of my day involved in music. I dont necessarily have to have a career based around it, I just need it to be there always. If its not, I'm almost positive I'll go crazy.


Does anyone have any advice for me based on these few things? Sorry it's kind of a rambly post, this is just whats been on my mind lately and I could use some input. 

What did you do after college?
What was the moving out process like?
Do you have passions that you're happy with keeping as a hobby? 
ill someone pay me to find music for them??? (joking)

57,"**Dislaimers:** 

Sorry for the throwaway. I'm pretty sure some of my coworkers know my usual username and I don't want anyone other than my boss and a couple higher ups to know about this until a decision is made. 

I am doing my own research on the logistics of each option, and my decision will be based on that and chats with my boss and my SO. I'm stressing about this decision though and want some input from people that are not affected by my decision. 

My prior career involved business advisory and working with executives, so I'm not a fresh out of school developer without business experience. 

---

**The situation:** 

I've been working for a while now as a software developer for a company with clients all over the world. My SO also works in technology and will be getting severance soon due to his department being outsourced. We realized a bit ago that we've been dragging our feet on getting a place together because we don't know if we really want to stay here. And maybe this severance is a good opportunity to try something new. 

I approached my boss to see if I could work remotely. The plan at the time was to try living in another country temporarily. But it turns out my company has been considering opening another office in Europe to have someone there to handle their EU clients. And apparently they'd be willing to look in to me ""opening"" this office. I use quotes because I would have a lot to learn, and it would be a graduated process. 

So now I'm not sure what I want to do. 

---

**The options:** 

Stay in my country: I could move to where I come from, a place that I miss a lot. I would keep my job as is, which is nice, because I love programming. There's also a coworker there and he knows more about the things I'd have to learn to be able to do to properly keep a remote office going. Essentially he'd do what I would do if I went to Europe, but quicker, and I'd keep my existing role while learning more about the client management aspect. But this isn't useful for career advancement and doesn't give us the experience of living in a different country that we want. 

Go to EU on a temporary basis: I would also keep my existing role in this case. I'd be limited to 6-12 months, and would get switched to a contracting position instead of a salaried employee. So still programming, low commitment, get the new country experience, but also not as useful for career advancement and not as easy to transition to a longer term visa. 

Go to EU as the employee getting a remote office going: I would have very increased responsibilities. Much less focus on programming and a lot to learn in the months leading up to the move, and also after. It would be a slow build up and certainly not easy. It would also be a much longer commitment. So more difficult, less programming, longer commitment, the new country experience we want, and the best for the advancement of my career. Also easier to get a longer visa since my company is onboard and the countries in consideration have already been asking our company to start an office there. And also easier to extend that visa if we like it, and my SO could get a family visa that is dependent on mine so our visas would be a joint situation instead of trying for our own. 

---

**Short of it:** 

I'm leaning to the office in EU, but have concerns about commitment and the change in responsibilities. Contracting in another country is my second best choice but I have concerns about transitioning that visa and that time without training that I'd need if I decide to go for long term. Staying in my country is easiest but doesn't provide the things we're after in making this change in our life.

60,"Throwaway acct to hide from SO.

I am so sad with where I am in my life. I'm recovering from a week of spiraling depression and suicidal thoughts. Maybe I need a therapist but I don't think I can afford one. I don't want to be stagnant in life forever.. working shitty, stressful jobs after shitty, stressful jobs JUST to survive. I'd be happy to abandon my college ""career"" to take a job to make actual money. I hate stressing about making enough money just to make rent. I want to be at peace in my house and not have to deal with drama. I want to have a healthy relationship. I want to retire before 98 yrs old! 

I'm not sure how all my choices ended up leading me where I am... but I need guidance.

**My SO**: 

The good: He's a sweet guy, genuinely nice person, thinks of his friends and others before himself for the most part. He's fun, nerdy, cute/adorable. He does occasionally take me out (like twice a year....).

The bad: He's lazy, doesn't contribute to household tasks or important paperwork (taxes/insurance) without having to be asked/reminded 1-50 times, and just a general manchild. We've never been in sync with money or saving for goals. It barely feels like a relationship. He doesn't offer to help me financially (like my car repairs, even though he albeit rarely uses the car), and when he does, he seems to be regretting it the moment he asks. On top of me having to be a mommy, I also never feel like #1 in his life. He JUMPS at the chance to hang out with friends and talk about or play games, but whenever I ask if he'd like to go out with me - ""It depends"". 

He's not a terrible person AT ALL. There have been moments and memories we've shared that prove to me that he does love me through and through. If he would just grow the fuck up, it would be so much easier to live with him. Sometimes I wonder if being with him is holding me back from going forward with my life.

**Financial**: 

Aside from SO, I live with another couple near Seattle, WA and we share a ~$2000 2-bedroom in a safe area. These are my monthly financials:

* Food: $150-200
* Rent(and various utilities): $500-530
* Car Insurance: $60 (couldn't find it cheaper)
* Car Savings (for annual repairs): $100
* Cell phone: $22
* Shopping (for non-foods, work related stuff, or other things to just enjoy): $50-100
* Gas: $50
* Student Loan: $0(currently because lender put it on forbearance during investigation of school. Normally $20-50 IBR, or $500/mo standard)

I want to be able to live on my own, but I can't afford it (also still working out the emotions with the SO). I want to go back to school for computer science because I want a salary I can actually do more than survive on. More debt sounds very stupid, and working FT/PT and paying off school+rent sound impossible!

I can only think of a few options:

***Option #1***: Save up with my current shitty (stressful) job, till I can afford 1 or 2 classes then take those classes slowly throughout the years and graduate with an AS in maybe 4 years... Stay with the SO until I can afford to leave (unless he matures by then...)
**

*Option #2***: Move back in with my sick mother (fighting cancer), live rent free and go to school full time. I'd work with any free time, but I'd also have to break up with my SO and I don't know how I feel about that right now. I'd also be extremely stressed out because while my mother would be kind enough to allow me to live with her again, she is also a narcissist, pathological liar, expert gaslighter, manipulative, and mentally a child. My father, who lives far far away, is a deadbeat who would rather never be reminded that I exist.

***Option #3***: And this option is hard for me to say because it is cold. My mother told me today that her doctors have ""one more trick up their sleeve"" to help defeat this ever-growing cancer. But in the case it doesn't work, and she does pass on in a year or less, I know there's probably a good $150-200k inheritance I may receive. I don't know what would remain after tax and I also don't know what to do with it. I don't know if it would help me get out of such a messed up situation I'm stuck in.

She has been staying elsewhere on the days I have my boys (I share 50% parenting time with their mother) and has asked me not to be at the home when I do not have my kids. Seemingly for no reason she has turned very hostile towards me and completely cut my kids out of her life (3 weeks ago she was telling them she was their mom too and we were a family).

Today when I got home from work she had changed the password for the internet and demanded I agree not to come to the house when I don't have my kids in exchange for getting internet access, which I need to find new housing for us. 

I just turned my phone into a wifi hotspot for now, and have emergency options available if needed, but I really need some time to pack up my things and prepare to move. I also am completely astounded that things turned ugly so quickly.

I have been really trying hard to make the transition as easy as possible for her because I still love her, but she's being vicious and actively trying to make the situation more difficult for everyone involved.

I need your candid opinions. My options at this point seem to be to either bite the bullet and leave my own home (making it more difficult to prepare for the upcoming move) or to start what will likely become a war by standing up for my right to be in my house. I have never asked her to stay elsewhere, in fact quite the opposite.

I'm so confused and sad and frustrated and upset, but I also care about her and all of the children, and I am at a complete loss of what to do.

No skeletons in my closet, I've always been faithful and devoted and worshiped the ground she walked on.

He plays various roles in my dreams. Sometimes I’m angry and screaming at him, other times he’s helping care for our child and we are in our future. 

Things didn’t work out so to stressful and conflicting schedules. I’ve taken the advice “it’s called a break up because it’s broken”. I do not deny our relationship was broken. He told me many times that he wants this relationship to work and he still wants to have kids together, he sees himself growing old with me, etc. 

We broke up with the premise of working on our selves and maybe trying again in June when I graduate from university. 

I have not had any real contact with him (I called him once while I was hospitalized and he texted to say he was sorry to hear I was I’ll). We haven’t physically seen each other since August. 

I want to see him. At least to have my “final talk” and we can clear the air about some things. At maximum I would love to start communication again and work towards a relationship. 

The issue is we never run into each other and he is very good at not responding. I emailed him about a meet up in November but he never responded. I really believe he has an avoidant attachment style due to his emotionally and verbally abusive mother who uses him like her servant. 

How do I illicit some sort of meeting from him? I truly believe we can have a life together and a new start could lead to amazing things. ",31Jan2018,5

He is trying to instill in me the attitude of critical thinking or as he calls it Trust Nothing Verify Everything.

68,"Hello, I desperately need some tips on how to keep my boyfriend and his family in their apartment in New York City. About two days ago, after returning from being at my family's apartment, my boyfriend found out that his mom had been hospitalized for around two days. When she returned home, she told him that the doctors said that she was dying and that she can no longer stand for long periods. Since she works in a salon, this completely puts her out of work. Now my boyfriend and his brother will be solely responsible for the rent. 

My boyfriend's brother is unemployed at the moment and I'm not sure if he is looking for work as of now. My boyfriend wants to pay the rent, but won't be able to do it by himself. As of now, I'm waiting to hear back on a job interview for a decent paying job, but there is no guarantee that I will get it. If all things go well, I plan to help my boyfriend with the rent. His family currently lives in low-income housing, but my boyfriend makes minimum wage.

Are there any programs in NYC that can help until he gets on his feet? This has all happened so suddenly and it would be devastating, if him and his family end up on the street. ",31Jan2018,1

We text every day, she’s ridiculously smart (Ivy League acceptance), and my best conversations are with her.

75,"One of my favorite things to do around the city is going to warehouse raves. I really enjoy the music / vibes / and the people that I've met in this scene. Typically, I tend to go to 2 per month.

I used to take my roommate to music events I'd attend, but slowly started to realize he was there to constantly take snaps, pictures, and then brag to other people. A few of these events are on the downlow so there's reason why the promoter and people who attend like to keep word of mouth to a minimum.

Once he started dating this current girl in July, he never asked hang out much again so I figured he was fine doing his own thing. Even before he was dating this current girl, I would have to invite him everywhere before, until I got tired and told him that if he wanted to do stuff too, he should be more proactive rather than just waiting for people to invite him all the time. He would constantly ask what plans where every weekend that he was around, or would wait for me to suggest activities.


Earlier today we were in the kitchen and he asked why I hadn't told him about the next warehouse event coming up, and I bluntly told him that I didn't think it was the right scene for him since in the past, it looked as if he was more interested in taking pictures and updating his social media so everyone knew where he was, rather than being there for the music and the event itself.

He said it was fine, and I told him I didn't mean it in a mean spirited way, it's just the way I felt after observing his actions at past events. 

I just feel I could have handled that better and that I was too blunt and harsh. Any advice on how I could have handled this better?

76,"So, my friend's got a boyfriend. They're in the ""lovey dovey"" phase right now, and they really want to consummate their relationship, i think they should wait until they're 18, but it's their choice to make.

Anyway, my conflict is this. They want to have sex, but they have nowhere to do it at. They're too poor for a hotel, and both their parents watch them like hawks whenever they're together. Plus, she gets taken too and from school, and her parents chaperone her everywhere else, since she doesn't have a car yet (they are making her work for her vehicle). As for him, his dad never leaves the house, and he has an ""open door"" rule, meaning they have to be where they can be seen and all doors open at all times at his house.

The only time her parents aren't watching her is when she's with me, we hang out a lot on the weekend, so they let her spend the night at my house often, because of my situation on the weekends.

On the weekends, my mother works late evening/nights, and she's gone until almost 6 in the morning. My father is sometimes their on the weekend, but he's often away, for months at a time (he's a trucker), he's gone right now actually. (THey let her stay with me so i can have company at home, when my parents are gone)

So, i'll be alone this weekend. Earlier today, her boyfriend came up to me and asked if they could ""do the deed"" in my house this weekend while my parents are out, he knows of my situation as well. They both want this, they practically begged me. I told them i would think about it.

So basically, my friend wants to use my house as a secret ""Pied-à-terre""

So, should i allow this?",31Jan2018,2

Let me start off by saying this has only happened in the last few months, and we have been together 3 years, i loved this girl, i planned everything with her, changed careers, lifestyle, etc for the sake of the relationship, not to say i do not love her anymore, but i just do not know.

The issue is that recently she's starting to become your typical tumblr feminist (ironically she uses tumblr and posts on it regularly), she starts arguments on the most basic human shit ever, literally two minutes before i came here to post this she started an argument about my chest hair, that i need to ""get with the times"" and stop feeding into ""toxic masculinity"", no idea what that means but i love my chest hair, and yes, i do feel a little masculine sporting it, and i do not see how that is an issue (the fact that i just said this is heartbreaking, you just can't have an opinion anymore), she says i need to shave it or wax it, she had no problem with it these past three years. recently she started watching this buzzfeed channel or whatever on youtube, she once sat me down to watch some videos with her (me thinking it's something informative or something at least interesting) but it was a video of some dudes being dressed up by highschool girls, and another one of them getting make up, and some other more watchable stuff. i asked her why she's showing me this, and she says that she wants me to take care of myself and embrace my feminine side...okaay. no biggie, but these are just few examples, lately when we go for dinners she refuses to have me pick her up, offers to pay for dinner despite working part-time and making significantly less, because she apparently doesn't want me to be one of those dark age ""providers"", my mind is blown, i cannot handle this anymore, every time i try to avoid these arguments or every time i try to convince her to not make a big deal out of things she says i'm ""mansplaining"", i'm guessing that's a combination of man and explaining. she cut her hair and gained a lot of weight, which i mentioned but did not try to force her to do otherwise.

I still love this girl and i know this isn't what she used to be, how can we recover from this? are we not compatible? is our relationship already lost? I would appreciate any and all help

One is my university email, another is for job applications and job apps or websites to update me of new jobs, and the third is my main email. I've had it since 2014 or so.

91,"I just recently had my first child 8 months ago. I'm engaged to my fiance who is 21. I myself am only 22.
The first pregnancy was an accident, but we did what we needed to, and even though things have been hard, we've made it work and wouldn't change a thing. Our child is a blessing. 

Recently, for about a week I've felt very tired, moody, I've had a mild headache and felt constantly nauseous along with some cramping . To be on the safe side, I took a pregnancy test. It came out negative. I let it go. 

Tonight however I had the same cramping. I didn't pay much mind to it thinking aunt flo was coming to visit soon. Well, I noticed that instead of a period I had some spotting. Only a little bit and it was a dark brown. Clearly indicating it's not fresh, making it very obvious to me it's implantation bleeding. Fool me once sort of thing. I know, I just know in my heart it's a pregnancy. 
I'll have to wait about another week around the time after I usually get my period to get a positive. So I guess there's still that chance, but I'm almost 99% sure I've conceived. 

So if I'm right on this, I'm coming on here for advice before my life turns upside down. 
I'll start by saying, we were careful. I wasn't on birth control ( I was however on it when I conceived my first) due to breastfeeding, but we were using condoms every single time. 
I wanted the non-hormonal iud, but my medicaid insurance wouldn't cover it.  
The condoms never broke, and were used appropriately, or so I thought, everytime. 
Also, my fiance is dead set against another pregnancy anytime soon. Of course, As am I. The only difference between him and I is he has stated he would want to terminate the pregnancy. 
As I completely understand his reasonings , I couldn't go through with an abortion.

Speaking of reasons, there are so many for not needing another baby right now. We're so young, we're barely getting by as it is, I just recently had a c-section, we have one that needs all the attention he can get. Etc..
All the reasons aside, I can't abort my baby. I don't want to be selfish. Not in my relationship, not for my child, or for the one not born yet..but I just couldn't bring myself to do that. So what do I do?

He's going to flip when I tell him. Our family is not going to support this.. I feel really alone. I'm only 22 and looking at a possible 2nd child. 
If he doesnt want it, but I do, what do we do from there? What does that mean for our relationship? Then what about my child, how will it effect him?
How am I going to support myself and 2 kids?

I can't believe I've gotten myself in this situation. I feel like another statistic.  I also feel guilty for saying it, but I feel like any chance of a life I had is essentially gone. One is hard enough, but I might have just opened a whole other can of worms.
I was just getting back on my feet after having my son. He's almost a year old, almost done with breastfeeding. I just got a new car and was looking forward to some part time work and some possible college courses.Now, I don't even know what I need to do first if I'm possibly pregnant again.

113,"Okay so here's the story:

This girl and I have been talking for months now, and it was just starting to escalate to an actual relationship, but she said that she didn't want to officially start a relationship with me. She said this because along with me, she was thinking about dating this other guy and didn't want to enter a relationship until she had decided on who she wanted to date. 

That made sense to me, up until Friday when we kissed for the first time, which I thought would mean that she had decided and wanted to date me. I was super happy, until she texted me saying that her and the other guy were starting to date. 

I'm really conflicted about this whole thing. I'm really upset that we kissed and then she turned around and starting dating the other guy, but since she hadn't said officially that we were dating, am I in the wrong here?

Thanks for listening to the petty relationship issues of a 16 year old. Any advice is appreciated.",31Jan2018,2

115,"I(21/f) was raped when I was 16 by my then boyfriend, and continued to be raped, in addition to physically and emotionally abused, for the remainder of our five year relationship(we broke up two years ago this past September). Just around 10-11 months ago, I started casually seeing, and eventually falling in love with, my best friend, and he and I have been together since. We've faced some rough times and this is one of the hardest. Today I found out that my ex boyfriend is not only engaged to another girl, but he's also gotten her pregnant. I don't know if my response was natural, but I was mad. I was angry because when he and I were together, he treated me so badly, and when he thought I was pregnant, he drove me to a clinic and dropped me off there alone and said only to call him if I ""got it taken care of."" But now all of a sudden he's welcoming a baby with this young, only-been-dating-her-for-10-months girl? What did I do to deserve such awful treatment? He hit me beat me raped me yelled at me all on a daily basis for leaving a damn dish in the sink! I want to know why, and I demand answers. 
Back to the point, though: I expressed these thoughts to my boyfriend now and he's convinced I'm still in love with my ex and that I'm obsessed with him. I told him that's not true and that I'm really afraid of my ex which is the only reason why I periodically check his instagram. Is that so bad? To ensure that he's away from me and that if he is in the area, that I know so I can keep myself safe? He almost killed me, I don't know how to not be afraid of him. At this point, I feel like I'm being given an ultimatum by my boyfriend- either forget about him (my ex) entirely, or he (my boyfriend) will break up with me. Of course I don't want the nightmares and PTSD to follow me everywhere, but it does. How can I at least begin to get past this and work on improving my self image? I'm a senior under grad student and I go to counseling every other week, which is all that's offered at school.

You’re probably thinking “You can’t just say she doesn’t like you because of that...” well good point but I don’t need to state the obvious why she won’t like me, I am a very hideous shy guy with another sense of humor than most people.

So I'm having trouble making friends at CC. I'm a full-time student but half my classes are online.  I only attend classes on campus from 8am - 11 am twice 2 days a week. I missed out on club rush last week because I was dumb and didn't read the posters.

I attempted to hang out at the VA but turns out I have nothing in common with the vets there (I'm a reservist).

I also feel like if I ask her in that way it will annoy her also. Can anyone give me advice on how to get talking again and/or word the question? I know this may be a stretch for most people to believe but she is the only girl I’ve ever REALLY liked. She is just very important to me and I would like to do anything I can.

123,"I was hired in November 2016 as a Network Engineer. I was very under qualified for the job but the company took a chance on me and offered me 65k. I live in the Midwest so this is pretty good money for a 24 year old at the time. Now getting experience on the latest tech to beef up my resume and there’s a lot of upward mobility I can achieve in the company.

Fast forward to September 2017. I’m working my way up in the company and I’m one of the few go-to guys. I finish my CCNP, update my resume and make it visible on monster just to see what I’m worth now. My boss pulls me aside a week later. Says that the company’s recruiter seen my resume on Monster and was offered a raise to 72k and I remove my resume from Monster. 

Fast forward to January 2018. Listening over my cubicle to a coworker discussing salary with another company I assume he is going to leave for. Employee has a lower title than mine and less experience but I hear him say 80k is too low. So I float my resume back out on Monster.

Fast forward to today. I have an interview and get an offer for 100k. This job is a Network Administrator with no upward mobility. Taking the job will look like a step in the wrong direction on my resume and is basically a career killer. 

I’m torn. Should I take the new job and the raise? Leave the company who took a chance on me and made me worth this much money? Should I stay if my company makes a counter offer but only meets me half way at 80-85? I truly enjoy what I’m doing now but I’m extremely overworked and the new job would no stress. ",31Jan2018,2

Is this something I can call the county to handle, and who would I reach out to?

To the actual advice part though.

132,"I'm currently 2 and a half years into a Computer Science degree. Ever since I started taking upper-division courses last quarter things have taken a downturn. All my courses are fairly challenging and I can barely find the motivation to focus in class and keep up with the homework. last quarter I just stopped going to one of my classes halfway through the quarter and failed it. I used to find programming enjoyable, I liked encountering a problem and getting a feeling of satisfaction from solving it. Now, coding just seems like a chore and whenever I encounter some kind of tough problem I just want to cry and when I'm done with a project I never feel satisfaction just relief. Even though I don't study nearly as much as I should, I feel constant anxiety and stress about courses. Overall I'd say I just feel burnt out with school. I also feel like my abilities are lesser than my peers and that I can't keep up with them.

I practically have no friends at college. I go to class and then go home straight after and don't talk to anyone. The only social contact I have is with my roommates who I chat with if they're around our apartment at the same time as me. I want to make an effort to join a club or a sport but I can't bring myself to because I'm rather shy and I feel like I can't afford to invest time into anything because of the stress I feel from classes. I don't really want to say I'm ""depressed"" but I don't remember ever being happy here.

I often think back to this summer when I worked at my local CVS almost full time. The job could be annoying sometimes but I enjoyed socializing with both coworkers and customers and I liked being able to relax and put my feet up at the end of the day. It seemed like I was happier back then.

I can't stop thinking that maybe this isn't where I am supposed to be going with my life. Part of me feels like just throwing in the towel, moving back in with my parents and getting some entry level job that doesn't require much mental ability and isn't stressful so that I can try enjoying life a bit. On the other hand I feel incredibly guilty because my parents have payed for all my tuition, housing, and other fees and even though I've talked to them about it and they say they just want me to be happy I feel like they would be disappointed with me if I dropped out.

I've been needing to get all of this off my chest for a while now so I apologize if my post comes off as a bit of a rant/vent. I would greatly appreciate any insights or advice.

I already asked her what year/month/day she got married and she answered correctly based on the online records...

She points out the banquet hall she got married in when we drive by usually. It's in California, close to where we live. Could she have gotten married in Nevada, then gone to a banquet hall in a different state? Seems impossible...

A new year of school just started for me and I had gotten REALLY bad classes, like REALLY bad. I usually get decent classes that I have good teachers and likeable peers, but now I just hate like half of the class. 

I was never an ace student. I despise math and its the subject I have trouble with most. All the other subjects are fine and easy to me, but Maths drives me insane. I can never understand the content and when I do I forget the moment I walk out of the door. My inability to do simple mathematics makes me panic and really puts me down.

What really annoyed me though, is when I overheard my Mum in a conversation calling me a disappointment. I got really ticked off but I couldn't disagree, but now I'm very determined to get smart, but it's hard when my teacher is going to be settling the class as opposed of teaching it.

I have considered outside tutoring, but it seems so expensive. I currently have a couple of text books I want to study with and really tryhard at school but I don't know exactly where to get help.

Our date mostly consisted of making fun of each others bad bowling skills and joking around. Nothing really happened, no hug or anything because I was pretty much too much of a pussy to even go for that lol. 

She texted me pretty soon after the date and told me to tell her when I got home (I had a 45 minute drive home). I told her when I was home and asked if she had a good time and she said yes. I also told her that I did and asked if she'd be interested in going on another one and she said, ""for sure."" I'm really happy about this and I think she likes me.

142,"Last weekend I ended up going home with a someone from my childhood who I hadn’t saw in years. It was something I’d never expected and I kind of thought it would just be making out and all that. No true sex due to being a little intoxicated. 

The one kicker here is she’s in the middle of a divorce and so that makes things obviously complicated. 

It ended up that this person made me feel quite cared for and she showed a lot of affection. She talked to me as if we’d end up here again. I guess I’ll get a little more detailed here. She would wrap her arms around me and hold me to her as tight as she could. She’d kiss my face and my cheeks and everything. I’d show the same care and affection. It felt a lot more sweet than I expected.

We were up until almost 7am talking listening to music while we lied in each other’s arms. This is the first person I’d slept in the same bed with since May of last year.

We woke up the next day and carried on for hours on end until 10:30. We probably could have laid there all day. She said that multiple times. Then she took me back to my car and dropped me off and that was kind of it. The only hint she made was seeing me at the bar again maybe the following weekend. I didn’t hear from her for the rest of the day. I messaged her later and it was a short conversation and then I talked to her a little today. I being the primary person initiating everything.

It’s clear that this was a one and done thing. I haven’t really had this situation occur before so I’m learning from it. I just need advice on how to do that. I’m kind of starstruck right now but I don’t see it going anyway else beyond unless we randomly hook up again. Maybe she regrets all of it? You just kind of sit and overthink in these situations.

144,"I apologize if this is rant-y, I'm just really high strung from stress. Long story short, I need advice on many issues, but will focus on the two big ones today. I know that I am at fault for getting into this situation.

Source of this stress: Money, a long time apathetic attitude that lead me to this case, no goals and few marketable skills (I feel). 

Little bit about my finances. In Colorado, I make about $1250 after taxes. Bills come out to $450, ~$65 for utilities (my apt complex doesn't meter individual units so water/sewer/gas are based off usage of all units divided out based on number of occupants and floor space per unit, electric usage is kept to a minimum), internet is about $22, phone is $45, about $150-$200 for food, ~$70 for gas (for car in one month.) and a $1000 credit card I've been trying to pay off $100 at a time. Car insurance is paid off for another 3 months. All said and done, I'm spending about $850-$950 leaving me with about $300-400 to spare. My girlfriend and I share the apartment and utilities as well as food which is why they are low (those numbers are actually doubled in reality)

**Issue 1) Health insurance**. About 5 months ago, I got kicked off my states medicaid for making too much money. Apparently, minimum wage at 40 hr/wk is too much. I didn't get on my job's medical plans during open enrollment because I told myself I was planning on changing jobs for a better one so I was unsure if that would have been a good idea at all (stupid, I know). I missed the deadline for the ACA health plans. Have nothing that could qualify as a ""life event."" I'm probably going to have to pay the stupid fine for not having insurance for 3 months once I do my taxes. 

So far, my lowest estimate for any insurance is a really shitty god awful plan (after my deductible of 7350 would be hit, they only cover half of any bill) that would cost about $250 a month. The next lowest priced one was about $275. I'm talking to a broker tomorrow around 4pm and I'll see if there's anything I can do better. 

Advice needed for this area: I have no idea on health insurance at all. I've never needed it and put off getting it and despite being 29, have been able to avoid fines from the ACA through luck. I need to get insurance though, I can't afford the fine and barely the insurance. I've heard of tax credits for some health plans, but I don't know how I'd apply for those or where to go for them.

**Issue 2) My personal life.** I can't afford a psychiatrist to help with the root causes of these problems so that's partly why I'm here. Most of my problems stem from my apathetic lifestyle. I've never cared for anything. And because I've never cared, I've never developed any real interests or hobbies, any drives or passions.  Every time I've shown interest in something, I drop pursuit because it becomes too much work and kills my interest in it. It's also developed a fear complex of sorts. Because of this, I never graduated college. In fact, where the box says ""some college"" I almost feel like I'm lying when I check it because my total credits amount to probably about 12. I've also missed out on chances to get managerial experience because of this. 

I need direction. I have no experience outside of retail where I have about 6 years total split between two companies in various grunt-level positions, and about 1.5 additional years working at a dinosaur museum when I was was 17-18 years old. A CDL sounded like a good idea, but I had a bad car accident 2 years ago and even if I went that route, very few companies would hire someone with that on their record. I've been told I'd be good in skilled trades, but at 29 and with no experience in literally any skill trade, I've given up on myself even getting into those fields (I know I shouldn't). Classes for certificates in various things exist, but I'm pretty sure I can't afford them thanks to the above insurance issue and even if I could, I doubt my current crappy job would be flexible enough to let me take classes while retaining hours.

Advice needed in this area: I just need some guidance. I live in Colorado Springs, Colorado and just some tips on how to get over this funk would be appreciated. Tips on what I could do to get out of retail, maybe advice or ideas on things I could look into that are in my area that anyone may know about. Or is there maybe programs I've never heard of that anyone may know about?

151,"I'm currently in a long distance or ""online"" relationship, but we consider it a more open one since we both realize that we can't *realistically* date one another due to the distance. So we tend to treat it more like an open relationship, one where we can still have hook ups with other people, going even as far to encourage one another on being successful on doing so. But the problem here is that I was never one to do this in the first place. She has told me that she has gone out and slept with other guys, and expects that I'm *cute* enough to do so, and for a while I would lie and say that I am, just to not seem, I don't know, inferior? Insecure? 

I go through a large variety of emotions when I'm with this girl. Sometimes I'm super happy that I get to know her, being the amazing person she is. Other times I'm super anxious when I'm speaking with her when she brings up things like other guys, or things with other guys from her past, and I think that might have to due with the fact that I might love her, or at least think I do.

This was the first girl in a long time (4 years of high school, the last 3 with me becoming an introverted gamer who never had a girlfriend) that had been super sweet on me, calling me handsome/cute, backing me up on things, seeing what's up, etc. But I feel an almost sort of emptiness from this experience, like how I would want a real relationship with this girl, or at least someone a lot like this. But I know I can't have this, at least with her. 

I met this girl through a mutual friend I went to high school with by playing League of Legends with him (my friend) and this girl. She is in her last year of her University, being 3 years older than me. And so about 3 and a half months ago, we got a lot closer due to similar interests, and got to a point where we eventually just started calling each other pet names, exchanging nudes, and checking in on each other on the daily. She laughs at my jokes, I know her quirks, we have inside jokes, the whole nine yards. But I can't shake the feeling of mounting dread when I get to close to her.

I've been spending the new year trying to reshape myself into a new person, going to the gym 4-5 times a week, working a part time at a job, keeping on top of my study habits (something I didn't do to much of in first semester, Engineering major btw.) becoming more of a social person, spending less time playing video games, and just enjoying life some more I guess. I hated what I had become in first semester, so this semester for me has been about turning myself into a better person. 

This girl had told me she loved me. And I finally got the courage to tell her that I loved her too. And she replied with ""(inside joke) + we're not talking in love are we? (Honesty)"". I told her that I just loved her, and she seemed to be happy with that, and then just brushed it off before we said goodnight to each other. 

I felt like my world had just been rock salted and stomped into my throat with some steel toe'd boots.

I started talking to some of the few cute girls who I had talked to just a tiny bit in first semester after some of my classes, the same day I told her (my current ""online gf"") that I loved her, and while the first one ended up getting a boyfriend (too late for me) the second one just got out of a relationship one month ago, and from what I know about her, I want to at least try to see if something's there. And I feel a sort of guilt at the thought of leaving my current *relationship*, if you can call it that.

I've been thinking of telling her that I can't be with her anymore, since I can't go through all of this pain, but at the same time I feel like I'll be crushed and lost without her. She's the only one I SnapChat on a regular basis with and talk to about some of my deeper feelings (usually about her). I may be scared of being lost/rocking the boat too much if I leave her, but that's what I might need in my life right now.

I'm just looking to think out loud and brain storm some ideas here I guess, sleeping's hard since I've been thinking about this all night. Any advice is appreciated guys. I'm going to try to sleep again, so I'll be back on tomorrow morning to see if anything's up.",31Jan2018,3

153,"I'm a first year college student. Before I started college I fell madly in love with the girl of my dreams. She had been my high school crush since freshmen year and it became heaven on earth when I got into a deep relationship with her. When we both left for college, we had agreed to drop things for the time being as to not be heartbroken if something were to happen in a long distance relationship, but we both knew we were still very into each other. About 3 weeks into first term I ended up sleeping with a girl whom I met at one of those famed first year college house parties. To make a long story short, when I brought it up in conversation with her, she accused me of cheating on her, and basically cut all contact with me and told me she needed ""time and space"".

It hurt a lot to hear such things from someone whom I trusted even my most deepest insecurities with. This was a girl who was there for me through some of the worst throws of depression I've ever had, and was someone who I trusted on such a deep level that I could tell them anything.

When she left my life I quickly realized that I had invested so much of my life into my relationship with her. I shared so much of who I was with her, that there wasn't much that she didn't know about me. I showed her my favorite movies, my favorite shows, my favorite games, my favorite music, everything. She felt like an extension of my being in which I confided all of my personality and passion in. If I liked something, I shared it with her. For everything.

After she cut contact with me, it became excruciatingly painful to do anything that reminded me of her. Everything I had shared with her reminded me of the time I had with her. I cant watch any of my favorite movies anymore. I cant eat at my favorite restaurants anymore. Hell, I cant even go through my camera roll on my phone without getting depressed.

So here I am 5 months later, still not able to get over this girl who broke my heart, and Im starting to realize dont know who I am. I dont know what people like about me, I dont know how I come off to people, I dont know what my interests are, I really just have no clue of who I am and what I really enjoy in life. I wake up, I go to class, I come home, browse reddit, jack off, get high or drunk, and fall asleep. Thats who I am.

And I fucking hate it. I want to be someone. I want to do shit with my life. I want to have interests and passions again. I want to be able to be just generally happy with who I am as a person and with the things I enjoy in my life. But anytime I try to come out of this depressed shell of mine I always end up returning more hurt and sad than I was before. Even the smallest things in my daily routine like seeing a girl who looks like her on my way to class will set off depressing thoughts that last almost all day.

So I have to know; How do I go about trying to rediscover who I am as a person? How do I stop myself from thinking about this girl 24/7 whenever I try to come out of my shell? And I guess most of all, how do I start being happy again?

Any words, kind or brutal, are very much appreciated, and Id thank you in advance for your advice. Thank you.

Tl;dr - Girl broke my heart at a pivotal point in my life. I forgot how to enjoy things in my life that I once enjoyed. How do I rediscover who I am and overcome this seemingly permanent heartbreak?",31Jan2018,2

155,"(For the sake of privacy, I’ve replaced every name with a letter.)

My name is S, and I’m a 62 year-old male; I have a ton a questions and concerns, and a lot to say, but bear with me; I think this story has earned the privilege of being thought of as complicated. 

A little bit about me: 3 years ago, I was released from prison after serving a 10 year prison sentence for the possession and distribution of prohibited weapons and ammunition; I’d prefer not to go into detail. 29 years before that I’d nearly earned a degree in computer science but stopped short of 12 credits (3 or 4 courses) because my father (who was allowing me to stay with him so I could go to classes nearby) demanded I leave his home after he came home in a drunken rage one night brandishing a gun; I left and never went back, but instead of finishing my degree, drove away with friends to L.A. with the intention of building a life for myself without a degree. It didn’t work out as I planned; I struggled; I worked full-time minimum wage jobs to try and pay for insane bills; I ended up living in my car, but I refused to go crawling back to my shit father. Around the time I turned 26, I was at a low point; I was an alcoholic, and spent most of what I made on condoms and booze; then I made a big mistake. There was this one time when I was so wasted, I couldn’t even stand up straight; I was in a house, then in a bedroom, and then holding someone (a woman, we’ll call her K) when I woke up…I didn’t use a condom. I couldn’t provide for K, so she moved in with her mother; we were never really together so we never really split; K filed for child support 2 months after the baby (a girl, we’ll call her L) was born. I never tried to see L (the baby); I just didn’t feel like L needed a father like me…but that was just bullshit…I was a fuckin pussy. I turned 30, things were looking up for me; I was waiting tables at a Red Lobster, and had a shot at the general manager position; I got happy, I got drunk, and I got my then girlfriend (we’ll call her M) of two years pregnant; it was a boy (he’s important, we’ll call him B). M was pissed; she didn’t want a kid; she didn’t believe in abortion; we fought; we tried to make it work; we didn’t; we split; I didn’t get the general manger position; I left, and started over in a new city. 7-8 years went by; M was struggling; she needed a place to stay; she needed child-care; child support wasn’t enough (cause I’m not working consistently); she moved in; we tried to make it work…we tried. M was erratic, demanding, blamed me for everything, never did anything wrong; B was quiet, but he was a good kid. M quit birth control without telling me; she got pregnant (we’ll call the unborn baby A; we eventually found out it would be a girl); our relationship was going downhill, but she was planning a wedding; I stayed for B…but…then I started talking to K again. K wanted me; she needed me; she said L needed me; she offered an escape; I felt like I was drowning; I couldn’t stand M; I loved B, but I didn’t know if that would be enough. I turned down a management position at a local 3 star diner to spend more time at home (M was in her 8th month), but also because I didn’t know if I would be staying…bad choice; some time beforehand we’d discussed a possible promotion for me, and M had made it clear that she wanted me to take it if offered…I don’t know where my head was. M found out I didn’t take the job; she threatened to take B and unborn A; she said I was hurting her and B; I got pissed; I yelled, and said some dark things (I turned into my father); she left; she took B; I should’ve been happy; I wasn’t; I didn’t go to K; I went to Chicago; I got involved with shady people; A was born at some point, somewhere; I ended up selling drugs, and then ended up selling guns, and then went to jail. This is where things started to change. 

While in prison, I thought about what I wanted; I thought about B; I thought about L; I thought about A. I thought about my degree, my life, and who I wanted to be. Prison had computers; I started studying, kept my nose clean, got into bodybuilding, and earned my bachelors. Also while I was in prison, K got married; L got a four-year degree, got married, had a baby, and bought a house; B graduated high school, got his two-year, transferred to ivy-league, got his four-year, graduated med school (also ivy-league), and got a fellowship in Baltimore; A (B’s first sister) graduated high school, and then graduated from Northeastern; M had another baby (a girl (we’ll call her C, she’s also important)) finished her two and then four-year degree, and then went on to graduate school and earned her NP. At some point in prison, I had started talking to M again, and we had begun to resolve our issues. Then my father died and left an inheritance; the state tried to claim it; I got a lawyer; I told M I was going to use it to pay back all missing child support; the lawyer fucked up and paid back all of K’s child support for L, but not all of M’s child support for B and A; lawyer wouldn’t call me back; M thought I did it on purpose; she thought I lied; we stopped talking. Eventually, I was released, and started talking to M again; we made up, and with my new degree, I resolved to pay back her child support; I moved near M, got a job, and we started dating. 

Now we're going to go a little slower…

I was dating M, but she hadn’t told B, A, or C that we were dating. I understood my place (even though I wasn’t the one who left before, I was the one who fucked up), so I patiently waited for her to tell B, A, and/or C while I continued to pay back child support and date her. At this point in the story, B (who is 32 and lives uptown) is a prominent physician, A is studying for LSAT and working as a human resource specialist, and C is getting a degree in business. Eventually, she told them about us, and then told me that, while they were all very happy (I think she lied about B’s opinion), they weren’t ready to meet me. I eventually got to meet with A (she looked well), and she was thrilled; I had been expecting backlash, but A was actually very polite and welcoming. I apologized for not being there for her, as her father, but she brushed it off; I apologized for being a criminal, but she brushed it off; I apologized for contacting M but not contacting her, but she brushed it off; I began to think she was just eager to see me with her mother and didn’t want her resentment to get in the way, so I stopped talking about the past. About two months later, we all went out to a restaurant; I was going to meet B; I was scared; I knew he probably hated me. He arrived at the restaurant, but didn’t look at me or introduce himself; he looked incredible; I tried to talk to him, but he talked to his sister instead; I got the message; I didn’t blame him…I had expected as much. The year (my first outside prison and with M) continued; M and I were getting along swimmingly and had even begun to discuss getting married (we had never been able to get married before); my dialogue with A became more frequent, she was very talkative, and I learned a few things: M married and divorced C’s father (C was the baby I didn’t father) (so I wouldn’t be her first marriage; it didn’t really matter to me), A was/is dating a physicist, and…B was/is homosexual. The last one had caught me off guard (he hadn’t seemed gay), but it didn’t really matter to me either. As the first year drew to a close, I began to ask A what I could do to get B to at least talk to me (he hadn’t actually spoken to me yet), and she was somewhat at a loss as he generally hadn’t really been speaking to her either (or anyone else for that matter)…but she explained to me that his resentment for me is deep (explained below).

(B’s life…and resentment) A told me that when B was around the age of 12, he was taken out of public school to take on the full-time responsibility of caring for his sister (A) who had a heart condition and wouldn’t be able to tolerate the school system’s schedule. B did not care at the time, but this grew into a bigger issue when C was born. M married C’s father shortly after removing B from school to care for A, but divorced him less than a year later, becoming pregnant with C while married. B had little reprieve from his responsibilities as a caretaker before C was born, but then those responsibilities grew exponentially after C was born, and were only compounded by his mother’s divorce. He managed the housework, the cooking, A’s education, his own education, and when his mother couldn’t afford childcare, his newborn sister. A also told me a few things about M’s conduct as a parent that I’m afraid I didn’t entirely not anticipate. M grew up as the youngest child in a two-parent home, with a father who worked and mother who handled the responsibilities that B managed in his own home; unfortunately, her father was physically abusive and her mother was emotionally abusive, giving M her own combination of unsavory acquired traits. According to A (who was told most of this story by B as she wasn’t old enough to remember much; A was 5 when B was 12) B fell behind most days (he was still struggling with being mature enough to handle the unfair responsibilities his mother had given him), and his mother (having grown up in a house with far more structure, but also much dysfunction) responded to his incapability with caustic verbal abuse and overzealous corporal punishment (M’s expectations and tendency for violence were not unknown to me). Eventually, either after M had groomed him to hate me or he had come to that conclusion on his own, he decided that I was to blame for his circumstances, assuming that if I had stayed, things would’ve been different…he was absolutely right. His life continued like that for some time, his mother’s involvement in her household bordering on neglect for the majority of the time, except for when she intervened with violence and abuse. B’s schooling became a low priority, for everyone, which led not only to his being illegally left in an unschooled situation, but also missing his first year of high school. When M finally acknowledged her mismanagement of his education, she was able to successfully lie to an online high school she eventually enrolled him in (giving them false courses and credits for B’s freshman year) in order to expedite his setback and ensure he graduated on time. However, once his schooling became more structured, he had to try even harder to balance his high school work with his full-time position as a homebody and caretaker of his two sisters (A and C, who were both being homeschooled at this point); M was unmoving in her determination to keep his two younger sisters outside the public school system. This only led to more violent disagreements between B and M as she castigated him for not caring for the household properly, accusing him of preferring his schoolwork to his family. He told A that he blames me for everything he endured…and I do as well. 

Realizing that A would not be much help in my quest for my B’s (my son’s) forgiveness, I decided to take matters into my own hands and employed a straightforward approach. With encouragement from M, I started calling him; the first time, he spoke, but very little, and I was pretty sure the only reason he had even picked up in the first place was because he hadn’t recognized my number when I’d called, because he stopped answering my calls after that. But I kept calling him anyway (I don't remember for how long or how many times it took), but he picked up one day and didn’t hang up; the line had been silent, and (I had assumed) he had been waiting for me to speak, so I told him I was sorry…but didn’t even know what to say after that…his life had been so shitty because neither I nor C’s father had stayed…then I had waited for him to answer…he didn’t…he cut the line. After that, I continued talking to A; we enjoyed it and it helped me to learn more about the family I had left behind. Two or three weeks later, B called me while I was working at my computer; I was so thrilled, but I didn’t interrupt. He said he didn’t know where to start with me…but he’d thought about it, and he did in fact want to start. I suggested that we try to find things to do together (I thought that maybe talking is something that interested A, but not so much B); he gave me the route he ran/runs every morning, and we started running together, even thought that felt a little weird at first. Eventually, we started going to the gym together as well. I think about 3 months had passed between the first time we had started running together, and when I noticed this…but while we’re changing one day, I saw a bunch of thin scars all over one of his upper thighs. I asked him about them (they look like scars from cutting), but he said they were actually from a motorbike accident – he had fallen off his motorbike, his shorts had ridden up, and his skin had made contact with the pavement -, but I found this hard to believe (the scars don’t really look like that, and a few were red). I stewed on this for a while, and noticed he stopped changing near me, eventually my curiosity got the better of me and I explained to A what happened and asked her if he was telling me the truth. 

A wouldn’t tell me at first, but I kept asking (this is where the story gets dark)…she verified my suspicions and told me that, yes, they were/are cut marks. When B was young (A told me), around the age of 14, he had tried to molest C (his other sister who’s 19 at this point) when C was 3 years-old; apparently, B had tried to engage in oral sex with C (her giving it to him) but had stopped short of the act itself. It hadn’t been until B was 22 and A was 15 that A had found out about his cutting; she said that she (A) had been in his then apartment and found a razor on the top shelf of his bathroom cabinet, but hadn’t thought anything of it until his shirt had ridden up while they had both been sitting on his couch one day and she had seen some of his scratches at the top of his hip. A explained that she had confronted him about it and he had gotten upset, but had promised he wouldn’t do it anymore (even though he hadn’t told her why he had started in the first place); A never told M. A then explained that she hadn’t found out about the near-molestation incident until C had told her about B coming to her and apologizing; A says that C hadn’t remembered what happened, and had/has always been relatively happy and seemingly unaffected, but when C had turned 18 (she’s 19 now), B had told her what he had nearly done to her, and apologized. A said that C had told her that B had wanted C to press charges against him, and he had explained to C that the reasons he had waited to tell C were to make sure his family didn’t need him anymore, and that she (C) was old enough to deal with the litigation. C hadn’t known what to say or do; A said that C had told her that she (C) had told him she didn’t want to press charges (having not even remembered any of what B was telling her he almost did to her) and didn’t want him to turn himself in either. After that, A said that B stopped talking to C…and M, and A, and…as far as she knew…everyone; she said that, although B was sure about his sexuality, she didn’t/doesn’t think he’d ever been in a serious relationship with anyone. She then made me promise my secrecy since at that point, she’d told me about B’s sexuality, cutting, and past actions without his permission, and she didn’t want him to hate her forever (even though I don’t think he ever really hated her at all). 

I kept working out with him after that; I didn’t want to say anything to ruin the progress I’d made with him, or further damage his relationship with his family (he’d kind of ostracized himself at that point), but I didn’t and still don’t know what to do with what was shared with me.  

As you can probably imagine, B is my greatest concern. He is a superb physician, speaks French as a second language, plays piano, is an incredible artist, looks great, and seems great, but I have good reason to believe he’s cutting again. I didn’t tell A about the scars that looked fresh, and I’m still not sure they were (I mean the kid is 33, so I’m finding it hard to believe he’s still mutilating himself…but still). Different parts of me are thinking different things and making me unsure of the appropriate course. A part of me thinks that, like me, he should be turned in for what he almost did (attempted oral rape I guess), but I don’t know if I just think that because I had to serve time for my crime, and/or because I believe jail-time would actually help B, and that same part of me doesn’t know if jail-time is appropriate considering not only this source (http://bobswriting.com/psych/abusers.html), but also that B has already discussed this with C and she doesn’t want him in jail, and If I turn B in, I don’t think A (and maybe not even M, if she even knows about any of this) will ever speak to me again. 

Another part of me really feels like this is my and M’s fault, especially after conducting research on child sex offenders and what motivates their actions. Like this source, https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/sexualviolence/riskprotectivefactors.html, which explicitly states that sexual violence is more likely in a family environment characterized by physical violence and conflict (M’s corporal punishment and terrorization of B), with a childhood history of physical, sexual, or emotional abuse (again, M’s corporal punishment and terrorization), and in poor parent-child relationships (particularly with fathers)(I wasn’t around). Another source (https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/childmaltreatment/riskprotectivefactors.html) states that child abuse is generally more likely in homes and/or families with: parent history of child maltreatment in family of origin (M’s dysfunctional family), parental characteristics such as young age, low education, single parenthood, large number of dependent children, and low income (M was 24 when she had B, “single” for all but one year, had no college degree until B was 15, and had two dependent children that B helped care for), nonbiological, transient caregivers in the home (e.g. C’s father, who divorced M before C’s birth, and then just…disappeared (kind of like me)) parental thoughts and emotions that tend to support or justify maltreatment behaviors (I don’t really know if this one is about parent, child, or both, but I read from a another source that putting older children in a parental position tends to heighten chances of sexual abuse, and B was), social isolation (B was taken out of school, and then because of responsibilities had virtually no peer contact), parenting stress (M was single with 3 kids, and B was made a parent at like 12), poor parent-child relationships and negative interactions (nuff said), community violence (M told me this story about how a whole fleet of police offices with bulletproof shields once crowded her yard in a neighborhood her, B, and A had been living in because they (the police) got a bomb threat from a neighbor’s house), concentrated neighborhood disadvantage (e.g., high poverty and residential instability, high unemployment rates, and high density of alcohol outlets)(all of this applies as far as I know), and poor social connections (if this is like social isolation, then…yeah). There are also protective factors listed in both sources, but I don’t think B had any of those. Anyway, a part of me feels like it wouldn’t be fair for me to turn B in considering not only how unbelievably difficult his life was because of me and M, but also how successful he is today and how hard he’s worked for everything he and his family has. 

Another part of me just wants to let this go or force him into therapy, because, after all this time, I really just want the family I always told myself I’d have when I was this age, and if I turn him in, everything will probably fall apart. 

I guess what I'm looking for is advice on what I should do with B; should I help him, should I turn him in, should I stop talking to him, should I forget that I know what I know, etc…?",31Jan2018,2
156,"Hi, guys. This is going to be long but I need some advice, as well as a vessel for ranting and I think hearing the opinions and advice of strangers is interesting but that is going slightly off topic. 

For a start, I'm twenty-years-old and currently saving for an apartment, and only just recently begun to do so as you can imagine, I don't have too much money spared at the moment besides for food and the essentials.

But I've recently became pissed off at how mind-numbingly selfish and deluded my parents are, and when I ""reminisce"" back to my childhood, they were not good parents. They bought me nice things, but that doesn't mean they were good parents (which I'll get into in a second). So, I'm considering getting a room-mate as soon as possible, but as I said, your opinions will help me greatly.

So, I believe my childhood wasn't great, or at least wasn't as great as most, mainly because of my father's evident problem with hoarding (it is severe where he has DVD's, old toys, just bits of junk in just about every room and cupboard) and at one point, my bedroom, which I shared with my brother as a very young child, was so cram packed full of his shit, that you could only walk in one path across the room, which was from the door to the bed. That was it. The rest was piles of stuff. I could not invite friends inside due to embarrassment, and now I wish that social services got involved at the time because no child should be raised in the conditions I was in. And I think this is the reason why, or partially why, I developed OCD in young adulthood.

So present day, I'm still at the house (and it's still a dump), however, my room is fine because I eventually got tired of my dad's selfish hoarding and moved his stuff into another room, which he acted like a child about but such is life). My cupboard is still full of his shit and my mother constantly complains about how she hates the house, and she really does her best to make it at least look tidy but any item that she moves, my dad would be annoyed and argue with her. I completely agree with throwing out most of my dad's things since they're just there to fester and gather dust. Or at least sell them. If my dad actively seeked help with this problem (and he needs help, not a telling off because he just justifies it and this does nothing but aggravate him), this would be the best thing. It wouldn't be necessarily the best thing for me, as I won't be staying at my parents' home forever, but it will be for my mother. It all seems hopeless, sadly, and she will have to suffer from my father's hoarding issues for the rest of her life.

Right now is an issue with my parents, which really steps over the line for me. Quick story, my older sister is jobless and is a single mother. However, as she's almost thirty, she is extremely immature and dumps her daughter with my parents while she goes to town with her friends (presumably to go clubbing or drinking somewhere, there's many photos that suggest so on her social media). She is late coming back (and turns her phone off when my mother tries to call her to return her daughter), and also lives in untidy conditions but not as severe as my father's problem.

Why I'm mentioning this is because my parents have clearly favoured her while me and my older brothers have been secondary priority to them while we've needed help with issues of our own. I was even told by my mother (who is, and I hate saying it, uneducated in a lot of things) that my OCD was ""petty"" compared to issues with my sister, who has no diagnosed mental illness whatsoever. She's just immature. Sure, she's a single mother, it can't be easy, but she puts her daughter second behind her friends and partying. 

My niece stays at my house most days, my parents take her to school to give my sister a ""break"" (they always have this excuse, a mother is not expected to have many breaks with a young child in their responsibilities), and as you can imagine, this pisses me off because even though I live there and pay my way, I have no say whatsoever and when I mention this, I get told that it's none of my business whether or not my niece stays here. Umm, don't I live at the house? My brother has two children, who I barely ever see, because my parents never offer to help them or babysit. They give all of the help and assistance to my sister.

Yesterday had me fucking fuming. My mother was babysitting, as usual, and my sister was late coming back from town and had my mother stand outside her house for hours in the cold (while she tried to contact her, but she turned her phone off despite seeing my mother's messages and missed calls). My mother was pissed and complained about her day as being wasted and that my niece was going straight home to her mother. Fair enough, I go out to town for something to eat.

I go back to the house late, only to discover that my niece is staying at my house once again. This is like, three nights in a row. Again, my parents are letting my sister away with her behaviour and I've fucking had it with their bullshit. By constantly babysitting my niece, they are keeping my sister from being a responsible and mature mother as she should be. They complain and promise to set the foot down, but no. Time and time again, they tolerate this shit and they're stupid for doing so. It's pissed me off badly, and I can't say anything because I'll just get yelled at. To add to the shit-cake, my mother is always complaining of stress for looking after my niece, which is understandable. But wouldn't the logical decision be to not take her, or limit your service greatly? Then your stress would go down!!!

So, should I require a room-mate to stay with, or continue saving? I don't how long until I snap, but it will happen.",31Jan2018,2

We were split up for almost 3 years. (The longest time btw and he wasnt living here either.)Yes it took me that long to realise how much I still loved this guy...however i wasn't always the most faithful partner but we always worked through it together.
So about a month or so ago this new guy started working where I work and we noticed each other almost immediately and there was tension between us right from the start anyway skip forward to lastnight things got pretty steamy between us we kissed and he touched me (alot) he then drove me home and asked for nudes so as soon as I got in, that's what I did he then sent me a text asking to meet him some place this week.. (btw he has a wife too and is fully aware of my partner) I didn't really sleep lastnight kind of beating myself up about how i let it get that far and what the hell is going on with me? I really don't know what came over me. I mean I love my man. I want nothing more in the world than for it to work and be forever this time. So what the hell was I playing at? So anyway I kindly declined his offer giving a brief explanation. He says he understands and it won't happen again.. (I'm just hoping things will remain professional between us at work and no he said she said bullshit) 
But not I'm still wondering what the hell and seriously considering confessing to my partner. I think i need to decide if this is what I really want. Even tho I'm 10000 percent sure. I mean I love this guy and the last thing I want to do is fuck this up with him.. I just don't know anymore. All I know is I'm a terrible person and feel every emotion possible right now.

I was shown how to do it by a trainer and I just felt very uncomfortable doing it and felt physical sick, I kept thinking I could contract hepatitis or gastro the smell was unbearable and as we are only provided a splash mask and desposible gloves and still in our work uniform which could easily be contaminated or splashed when you open or close the waste cap (it drips in the wind) and after that I just told the trainer I won’t be able to do it again and I’m sorry etc, I explained how it was making me feel.

The thing is It’s a good position I was moved onto in my job less manual handling and more machinery but servicing the waste was an aspect of this section of the job. I spoke to the managers and they just told me they will have to take me off this part of the job if I can’t do the waste.

165,"Okay, I feel awful so I apologize if this is worded badly or is hard to understand at any point.

Pretty much the last 6 months have been pretty shitty for me. Coming to terms with my 3+ year relationship not working out and just of recently having broke up. I am really feeling lonely. Insanely lonely and I also am incredibly behind on college work.

The only time I am happy lately is when I am out drinking/talking with girls because I guess I am getting that affection I miss and desire so much but I feel like this is a lot more than just being upset over a break up. I am not sad about the relationship not being there because it was mutual and we both accepted it was not working but I feel insane amounts of loneliness. Not something a 20 year old should not be feeling but I just feel like I am fucking up college and all that now because I honestly feel sad all the time unless I am out doing something proper or interesting so I struggle massively to actually work. I just woke up not long ago after a night out and I instantly tried to get my friends to come out again because I cant get back to sleep and have my insane feeling of sadness the moment I am awake.

I guess I just really crave that attention I once had every day for over three years and now I am crashing massively and feel really shit.

Again, maybe I am totally wrong but I feel like this is more than just me feeling bad over a breakup because I have really similar emotions to back when I was diagnosed with depression (which I have overcome) way back about 5 years ago. 

I don't know what I am asking for on here but I guess this is a cry to help to strangers on the internet because I really need some advice on my life right now or some nice things said because I feel terrible and I am honestly just scared.

We were spposed to pay for it within the next few days. Previously I offered to pay the £180 for him for the flight and hotel as an early birthday present and he would buy his own things there. He said yes for now but didn't want that to be his birthday present and would pay me back next month when he got paid.

171,"**Is it right to expect someone to pay for an unused social good inside the confines of a friendship?**

Myself and a trio of three friends live in adjoining apartment complexes with a common basement car-parking facility. My apartment does not come with a car parking space, while their apartment comes with two spaces. 

Only one of the trio owns a car. I have until recently occupied the second space without being charged. Neither of the other two occupants intend to purchase a vehicle in the life of our respective leases. The by-laws strictly prohibit leasing to non-residents, although the by-laws are poorly policed. If the trio were to lease on the market, they'd face a startup cost of about $120 dollars to get the additional access keys cut. 

In exchange for the hithertoo free parking, I have always offered to drive people places, do airport pickups, trips without expectation of compensation for fuel, parking, or time.  I've always thought that socially inside the confines of our 5 year long friendship since college, this was the right balance. 

Recently I've been asked to pay a weekly rent that is close to 120% of the market rent for a car parking space in our area.

Ethically, reddit, should I have already been paying a market rent, should I be paying an ex gratia, or is the social-ledger already balanced in free transportation in exchange for use of their underutilized asset?

I'm loathe to take any course of conduct that is overtly transactional. Should I charge my friends for lifts as an Uber driver? Who's right here. ",31Jan2018,2
173,"My friend and I (she was driving, I was in the car) were driving up to a festival a few months ago. We left quite late, due to us getting organised and picking up last minute things, so we ended up getting there in the dark. On the way up, going through a small country town (pitch black), she failed to see a stop sign at a level crossing and was pulled over. Hello $432 fine. The cop insisted we should be able to get it waived (we weren't from the state, never had another fine etc) so we tried not to think more of it. Cue a few months later, and not only did the appeal of the stop sign fine fail, she also got a $250 speeding ticket. I offered to help pay half the speeding fine, but in my current financial situation (I'm a 22 year old student, she's a full time management consultant), that's basically all I can do. She's currently guilt tripping me about my 'moral conscious' and believes I should pay half of both. What do I do? She's one of my oldest friends and honestly a very good person, but I can't afford this.

174,"I'm tired of feeling this way. I still feel so deeply in love for a girl with whom I am no longer in a relationship. It was a short relationship--three months. It's nearing six months since we split up and I just cannot seem to get past it.

I want to get over it. I really do. I'm doing all of the things that people say that I should be doing. I'm going to the gym and seeing my friends, I'm getting outside and going on dates. I quit smoking. I'm writing to deal with my feelings; I self-published a book of poetry and started working on a novel I abandoned a couple years ago again. I went on a date on Monday that, while it wasn't a romantic connection, went extremely well. I had a good time.

And all of this is fine and dandy, but at the end of the day it always comes back to her. I don't know how to get over it.

Everyone keeps telling me to give it time. I feel like I have been giving it time and it never seems to help.

When she first left me, my buddy told me that 3 weeks is the point where you start feeling better--when three weeks came I still felt like garbage and missed her every day. Then they said half the time the relationship lasted--1.5 months, still the same. The duration of the whole relationship--3 months--nope. After my Christmas vacation...Nothing. Every time one of these benchmarks hit, I just feel even worse because I still love her and I can't seem to stop. 

I don't want to love her, man.

I broke a couple of times and spoke to her. She's still kind to me when we speak--responsive and empathetic. It's not like we ended on bad terms. She's not in a spot where she can be in a relationship right now and I want nothing more than to respect that, but respecting that eats me away inside. It tears me apart.

In my dreams we're still together. When I wake up, I want to say good morning to her. When something funny happens, I want to tell her about it. When I feel down, I want her to hold me.

When I told her that I loved her, I really wasn't kidding.

The relationship itself was three months, but we'd been growing close and getting to know each other for a year. She had a boyfriend at the time--it was a kind of ""forbidden friendship"" vibe at the time--we were as emotionally attached as a couple but without a finger lain on one another. When we finally were able to be together it was like living a dream. It was the happiest that I had ever been, and on my worst days I fear it is the happiest that I will ever be again. 

She couldn't be in a relationship with me, though. She had not been single in years and had felt trapped in her previous relationship for a long time. When her other relationship ended she was left without a home (because she lived with him) and hadn't felt independent or as though she had a sense of identity for herself outside of a relationship--all things I understand. But that kills me because nothing went wrong between us. I feel like part of the reason I can't just get over this is because somewhere in my heart is this foolish notion that she'll be waiting for me one day or that she might snap to the realization that we're meant to be together or some other romantic-comedy mumbo jumbo that obviously is not going to happen. 

But it's not going to happen. We flew too close to the sun in the wake of her breakup. We fucked it up. I get that, and I just want to move on.

But I have no idea how.

I do not want to take out huge loans (the thought of loans scare me) and end up spending the rest of my life trying to pay it back, like my mother is doing. I know I am eventually going to have to take out a considerable amount of loans because of PT school, but the least amount of money I have to take the better. I really want to finish school out here especially considering all of the relationships I have made and how much I don’t like being in my hometown. My girlfriend suggests that I should go back in-state and take out loans there so I won’t have to owe as much money, but that would mean our eventual break up and I love this woman more than I love myself. 

I figured I really only have a few options:

1. Get an apartment here, work over the summer and fall semester to save up some money and take out a smaller loan to attend the next spring. 

2. Go back home, live with my mother (which is a toxic environment, but would also mean no rent) and work over the summer and spring to eventually start school somewhere near home in the fall.

3. Stay and work here over the summer and fall and find a community college nearby my current college to try and keep the relationships I have with people here.

I would appreciate responses from anyone who has gone through a similar situation or someone who has finished college and is wise in their years. More suggestions are also helpful!

186,"Heyo! Ok so I'd like to ask some advice on something related to work. A little background - I started this job on a temporary basis at the start of December - only a week to fill in. But I made a good impression and kept coming back as a temp and was offered a permanent contract two weeks ago, which I happily took. I directly support the Operations Manager. It's also important to know that the company only rebranded recently, and a lot of work has gone into the new logo, office layout etc. 

So, I was asked to organise a seminar, the first since the rebrand. I did all the administration for it from invitations to guest list to booklets and the presentation. I was also asked to help set up the reception and presentation room on the day, today (with some help to make sure I knew the process to make it look the way the Manager wanted - this is important). So the seminar was this morning. The two of us came in to finish setting up and do the tea and coffee - the rest of the organising had been done yesterday. The main receptionist told us how things were usually done but the Manager said she wanted it a different way so we went with what the Manager wanted. 

This morning the receptionist was grumbling to several people, including myself about the manager 'undermining her' and because she's been here 14 years and this is how things were always done, but because the manager wanted it differently she 'thinks she knows everything'. The others were agreeing with her but I'm unsure whether that was awkwardly placating or actually agreeing.

As the manager is my direct boss, she has said to me that I am her eyes and ears on the floor as to pretty much everything, such as deliveries, needing more orders and somesuch, which is absolutely fine. The problem is, she has directly asked me to let her know if there are any issues going on, and to tell her as well if there's any tension and she says she trusts me to let her know and she feels we'll build a great relationship over time - she took me on as her own secretary partially because we share the same ideas as to the presentation of the office and stuff. 

Long story short, should I tell the manager what's been said as she's directly asked me to, or should I not mention it because I'm fairly sure if I do and she says something about it, I'll more likely alienate myself from the main receptionist, and perhaps the other secretaries. 

Thanks in advance for any help x",31Jan2018,1
188,"Okay, so I need some thoughts please. I started online dating recently, following a painful breakup back in November last year. I think I am over that now and can see his flaws a bit more - he had MH problems and that was really hard, so all round a stressful time. My pattern though is to go for quite aloof guys, long-term singletons, afraid to commit, BUT usually pretty good-looking, smart, interesting guys. They are lovely people - but drive me a bit crazy with the lack of communication, r'ship ambivalence, etc. 

So I have been thinking I really want to change this pattern. I deserve a proper r'ship w/ someone who appreciates me, etc. I met a guy online recently and he is pretty attentive, and messages a fair bit, though not too much - a couple of times a day. We have only met once so far and I have to say from my end the jury is very much still out. It wasn't long enough for me to decide whether I like him. I pretty much said that, and he said he'd been nervous etc and I thought and said that could have got in the way of us connecting a bit more deeply. However he seems to slightly pressure me. He tried to kiss me at the end of the first date which is such a big no-no for me...I never kiss on a 1st date, even people I've really liked from the off. But he won't let it be. In messages he has twice now mentioned kissing- I said I had a lot of work but had been procrastinating, and he said 'I thought the prospect of kisses might motivate you to do work now so we can hang out soon'. I was 'UGH' for Pete's sake. To me, that is super cheesy - when I don't know him well enough - we spent three hours in each other's company. I told him it was cheesy and to chill. That I needed to see whether we had enough in common, but was willing to meet again to check that out, before I could think about kissing. But that it seemed wrong to feel pressured into physical intimacy.. (Twice before that on the dating site I'd called him cheesy too - he told me I could call him 'gorgeous' if I liked. Err. whatever). Then today he asked if a message I had sent was an acronym for a kiss (and that he lived in hope). Again, UGH. I replied that it was gross. And he said 'that doesn't sound promising'. 

The thing is, by these advances he is putting me off him and making it even less likely that we will ever kiss. I feel like he was nervous and behaving like an ass, but to be sensitive and patient with that makes me feel like his mother or therapist. Like a friend of mine said, 'yes we all get nervous but we expect that to be contained to some degree'. Part of me wants to message again and say I'm so sorry but I have cold feet. (We are supposed to meet this weekend). 

It's like he doesn't respect my boundary - that it is not the right time for kissing or cheesy jokes about kissing. Yet at the same time, I was so fed up with the aloof guys who spend days replying, and want to change this pattern. My fear is that anything affectionate etc., will be off-putting to me because I am used to people not being so. I feel like I am torn between my gut instinct (run a mile - he is not right for me), and my pattern (with some underlying belief that I don't deserve love hence go for the aloof guys :( ) I'm a feminist and it is important that men respect my boundaries. In other ways he is nice, and there are a few interests in common. Plus he wants a serious r'ship, etc. (though I suspect he is also motivated by wanting to have sex with me at the moment too).

189,"Yesterday I left work early because of the flu. Later in the day my boss came and spoke to my coworker about me. Said she knew I wanted to change to jobs, how she knew this I don’t know.

194,"Okay so as the title states I need some moral advice. It's a complicated story so bare with me if you don't mind. Little backstory. And for ease of understanding all of the money things will be in $ even though we use Convertible Marks here in Bosnia.

So this summer I worked my ass off as a waiter at a fancy restaurant at the coast, working 12h shifts for 2 months straight; saving my pay and tips so I could pay off my Uni tuition and the car school ( to finally get my drivers license). I managed to save up 2400$. I underestimated the time I had left after that, to study for my fall exams, so I flunked on them. This was to pay off my second year. The first year I scored the highest on the entrance exam, that meant that a part of the tuition will be subsidized by the ministry of education. I didn't manage to pass all my exams.

So I **THOUGHT** I had to pay 1500$ for both semesters of the 17/18 year, so I made the payment. After that happened I didn't have enough money to pay my car school thingy. I spent the remainder of the money slowly over the next 3 months on clothes, hobbies and going out. I also worked part time as a waiter when I had time, spent most of that money as well, started saving for my license again. Didn't manage to muster up that much cash. About 200$, not much having worked for some 4 months now.

Today I heard from the people who are responsible for the payments and applications that in fact I'm still subsidized by the ministry of education. Which means that the two semesters that I payed 1500$ were in fact priced at 400$. That means all of a sudden I've got 1100$ cash. A good thing right?

That's where my dilemma lies. I've got a wealthy uncle who I visited for Christmas. He talked to my sister before hand. And turns out he was ""proud"" of me for trying to handle the financial situation alone ( and maybe pity 'cause both our parents passed away) he decided to pay off my car school thing. He gave me some 1500$ which is most of the cost. I paid the whole thing upfront. I used to get into trouble with various things in the past, also lied about money somewhat frequently.

So do I come clean and possibly get ridiculed as a liar / manipulator ( accused of both before for much smaller things ). I have this feeling like they'll think that I've know about that all along, but that I decided not to tell them, to use them so I could have more money to spend on myself rather than Uni/Car School...

Or do I keep this to myself, keep the money and use it for next years tuition and take it a bit easier this summer, focus on studying instead. I'll probably have to slave away the entire summer again to pay off next year if I have to give it back... What do you think?

P.S. Sorry about the long post, also grammar and formatting (not a native speaker/writer of English), hope you can understand it all.

199,"Um, so i currently live with my grandmother. I'm looking for a rented room, or preferably a small apartment. I was thinking about posting on my facebook if anyone i knew could help. I see a lot of people do it, and my friend said it would be a good idea.

Now i'm just thinking, isnt it a bad idea that i write the max amount i can pay in rent? I'm just thinking, there is the ""danger"" that all the offers i may get, will be at my max rent on purpose, just because i said i can pay it. When in reality, they might have put the rent lower had i not written it.

I have been postponing posting for awhile because i have been thinking about this. I really want a place to live, but i also dont want to pay an unnecessary high rent.

There is also the fact i have NEVER posted anything on facebook before. I may share a video maybe 1-2 times a year. I'm very active in groups, i just dont like posting anything on my own page.

I'm planning on moving in the coming months and was looking for some advice regarding what to look for in an apartment so that I don't get any noise complaints (I don't wanna be that guy). Obviously, I could try and find a house for rent to minimize neighborly complaints. If I have to settle for an apartment though, does anyone have suggestions on what to look for so that I can still play what I want without being confined to headphones the whole time? Furthermore, what can I do once I move in to minimize the spread of sound?

I play guitar and bass mainly, but occasionally like to jam with full bands. I haven't received any complaints in my current housing situation, but I also haven't been able to play music as openly as I'd like to.

208,"23 almost 24. Living with my folks. Just finished my Associates Degree last fall. Been working since I was 17. Was planning on going to a 4 yr school (2 more yrs technically) to major in environmental science, but changed to environmental studies recently because i hate school and i've always had a lot of trouble with math and science courses, and thought there was no way i could handle it and pass. but im learning this semester that this studies degree is not what im interested in.

i had some serious health issues affect me from age 20 to now, more specifically 2016-2017 in which i quit my full time job and was unemployed for 6 months seeking out professional health care under my folks insurance. I'm doing better now, and I have a part time job.

My parents want to help me with school, and are currently paying for it, but if i don't go to school, i have to pay a hefty amount of rent and/or likely be kicked out soon. They are pressuring me to go, and I'm not even sure what I want to do anymore. I'm very grateful for their support, but I don't want to waste my and their time and money if I'm unsure what I'm doing.  I'm aware that I'm not 18 anymore, and I deal with enough depression and guilt about living here at this age, but it is very daunting after have been through hell with my health issues. My health issues are largely responsible for why I'm so off track.

I hate everything about school, the work, and what it represents as an institution. But because of my health, I'm not suited to work manual labor like factories or construction. So I''ll have to work in an office, which I currently do.

The problem is now that I struggle so much with doing school and work mentally, I hate school as it is, and I can't mentally handle more than 2 classes per semester now while working too, which is going to take me like 10 years to get a degree. I have 2+ yrs experience in semi-advanced data entry, but that's as professional as I get for now.

I play play, write and record music and I'm in a band. It's my absolute passion and reason for living, and I'm trying to pursue music with my band and music, but it's such an unlikely industry to get into and be successful. My hope is that someday I'll be able to do something with it, but until then, the situation is the same. I could go to school in my city for audio production, but again, it's a hard industry to get into, and the degree might not be worth anything other than that.

Right now, it seems I either go to school and take forever for something I'm not even into that much anymore, or I try to find a job doing something and hope it pays enough to not leave me starving and totally miserable. I'm just so lost desperate, and I don't know what to do. I've just been through so much suffering and struggle the past few years, and I just want to get my life together. I've tried therapy many times and it doesn't seem to help. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

I hope you're all hanging in out there.

212,"For my birthday earlier this month, my aunt's husband gave me a car that belonged to his mother, who is unable to drive anymore. The car is a 2004 Toyota Corolla with 80k miles on it. He made it seem like this just happened recently. He said it needed an alignment because she bumped a curb, but it was otherwise in good shape. He mentioned it might need a new battery too. I noticed when I got the title, that he'd actually been driving it for about two years. He put about 20k miles on it. I didn't think much of it, but I got a call from the mechanic when I dropped it off for the alignment. It needed new control arms on both sides, a new rack and pinion, and a new alternator (turns out it wasn't the battery at all). This all cost about $2000. The control arms and rack and pinion I think were the result of this ""bump"" he was talking about. This car drove terribly on the way to the mechanic. I had to fight it from going off the road the whole way. I don't think he drove it in this state for two years. I think he drove home drunk, hit something hard, and then decided to give the car to me to avoid my aunt finding out. He's had problems with this in the past! 

Now, I currently have a 2006 Mercury Sable with 100k on it. I love this car. It has given me very little trouble over the two years I've owned it. I know Toyotas are good cars. My dad had a truck that he nearly put 400k on, and it was still driving well. But, I have a bad feeling about this new car, and I'm thinking about selling it instead, even though it was a ""gift.""

217,"A pretty good looking guy messaged me on tinder. We talked for like a month before meeting up (I had a hectic schedule that month) and he was cool with waiting. We texted and snapchatted a lot and he was showing A LOT of interest.... a little more that I expected.

He'd text me good morning and night cutie almost every day and we'd text and snapchat in between. He didn't want to get into a relationship though and only wanted a fuck buddy situation (so did I) but I found him acting a lot like a bf and I didn't even meet him. He said he was falling for me, that he'd be my date to a wedding, and he ""actually likes me it's not just for the sex"" etc.

Anyways we finally met up and I told him I don't fuck the first time I meet. He was cool with it. We went for dinner and actually ended up at his place making out and basically dry humping. It was a good evening overall. During the first date he said he was cool with meeting my parents if they'd feel more comfortable with me hanging out with him, he said ""this is dangerous I like you a lot"", and he said that one day I'll meet his god daughter he talks about so much. Anyways again... he just wants a fuck buddy situation. Before leaving I told him to text me and he said ""I'm a bad texter"" (he was pretty damn good at texting up until we made plans to finally meet) and I was like okay whatever. Overall we both told each other we really liked each other the next day and we gotta meet up soon. He continued to snapchat me. Also note I met his roommates and he gave me a tour of his house when I went.

Anyways he has previously been in a SERIOUS 7 year relationship that ended over the summer. He said he doesn't want to get into a relationship or fall in love again cuz it sucks and told me not to fall in love. He also has slept with over 25 people (totally believable if you look at him). This was all during the times they were ""on a break"" or ""broke up"".

After the first date he kept snapchatting me but no longer texting. He'd snap me the way he usually does every day (and we'd snap message too). Again I'm a busy bee and couldn't meet him too soon (it shouldn't matter as fuck buds but I knew he really wanted to fuck soon). About 2 1/2 weeks after our first date I asked him if he wanted to get drinks on the coming Friday night he said ""he's busy with school but would let me know"" I said that if he's not interested right now that's totally okay just let me know rather than leave me hanging and... poof he never replied.

Fast forward a monthish later he sent me a sexy shirtless snap. Caught me off guard. What is this guys deal? I'm down to fuck him cuz he's hot but this is a weird situation! I don't want a relationship either and with the snaps he sends now it seems like he solely wants sex now too... but like this is all too confusing? And I know (and always have known) he's been talking to many other women too! (Doesn't bother me)

Again, I told him I'm busy with school and work and I'll let him know when I'm free and he said okay just let me know. Now our snaps have stopped again. This gives me time to think about whether I really want to fuck him that bad (he's super hot to me! And seems like he'd be amazing in bed... I just want a hook up too after the shitty LTR I was in previously). On top of that he was such a sweet guy but his behaviour seems to be messed. Thanks for any advice on this situation!

221,"I am in a distance learning program going for a masters degree that requires we complete clinical hours in sites where we are located. We have to submit paperwork establishing an agreement between the site and the school. My clinical site has been great about the paperwork. The legal department associated with the site (part of a large university itself) has responded quickly and agreed to my school’s requested changes in the terms of the agreement. The problem is with my school. 

&amp;nbsp;

Staff at my school alleges that their legal department handles 4,000 contracts annually. I had originally requested to submit my paperwork early to avoid any problems, but was repeatedly denied. I am still waiting for the paperwork to go through, which is causing issues because I am expected to complete 240hrs of clinicals by the first week of May. 

&amp;nbsp;

My school has set up this sort of trap of circular logic to avoid accountability and having to speak with students. We are told not to contact the school’s legal department directly and instead ask our faculty for updates. However when we contact our faculty they refuse to follow-up on it, claiming they are “out of the loop” because it is in legal’s hands, and that we have to wait for a message from legal. I am not the only one experiencing this issue either. It’s gotten bad enough that several students, including myself, have ignored faculty to contact legal directly.

&amp;nbsp;

Yesterday I ended up getting a phone call from the head of the school’s legal department. This person was openly hostile towards me and alleged that students calling them was “inserting themselves into the process” and making it more difficult. This person also openly admitted that in the past they have retaliated by refusing to complete the person’s clinical paperwork so that site could not be used.

I’m at my wit’s end about what to do here. I’m in my last year of the degree and I don’t want to transfer out. I just want to be able to do my coursework. It just seems like their behavior is totally unacceptable.

My boss messaged me about why I wasn't in the office given that we're in the middle of the project. I sent him a message saying I was feeling like death and can't come in. 

Since I'm the one with much of the granular knowledge of the project, there are things that they need me to answer. I just fell back asleep and didn't look at my phone. He left me a few messages and I'm too scared to look at my voicemail. I'm not sure what to do right now because this is so out of the ordinary for me. Do I keep up the lie and act sick? If so, how sick would you have to be to not answer the phone?

My wife, whom I dated for 10 years (because I bounced from job to job, and wanted a steady income before embarking on marriage) and have been married to for a little over 5 years, cheated on me with an ex (whom she’d never spoke to throughout our whole relationship until a few months prior to the affair) for a couple months. I found out, and confronted her. I decided that I love this woman enough to fight through whatever she says was going on. One week later, I actually leave work early to surprise her, and catch them in the act on my (now donated to homeless people. I washed it first...) blanket on my couch. Again, after several hours of fighting and her trying to blame me (which is bullshit) I decided to leave for a week and stay at a hotel close by. I returned after that week.

That was 6 months ago. I want this to work with her and I love this woman more than anything. I just “am in my own head” too much. She has changed her number, and blocked any way that he can contact her. Also, I should probably add that my neighbor, who I’m friends with, is a cop, and he would tell me if the guy has been over (since he witnessed the whole day when I caught them, and almost got into a fight). 

I need advice as to how to try to begin to move on and try to let this go as much as possible. My brain keeps sending up “flags” but I know she has done nothing.

My boyfriend says it might be because they ran out of space. I'm not sure what the character limit would be, but it just seems weird that they would take a character out of the middle instead of off the end.

Anyway, is this likely to be a mistake or just a cut off due to character limit? Also, if this is a typo, who do I contact about fixing it?

252,I’m a freshman in university and for the whole first semester i had a thing with a girl and she was part of the friend group that i formed here. Everything went well until a few weeks ago she dumped me which was overall for the better because she just drained me of any emotion and energy. She made me basically stop seeing that friend group bc she thought i hung out with them more than her. The friend group noticed this and slowly kicked her and I out and i was told that it wasn’t because of anything I did but it was because they didn’t like her. Now since i am single i tried hanging out with the group again and opened up to them about my relationship. Everything seemed fine for a few days then all of the sudden they began to hang out without me and slowly stopped talking to me. Now as of yesterday they invited my ex back to the group and she has portrayed me as the “bad guy” of the relationship. They all have taken her side and have now practically exiled me for the second time. Those are the only friends i have in uni and I’m all alone and have no one.

254,"Right so a few days ago my friend went home to find out that her mom had all her stuff out in the front yard waiting for her. They’ve never gotten along so as soon as my friend turned 18 she saw it as her chance to kick her out. Her mom is a crazy drug addict and has no reason to start as many problems as she does with my friend, but whatever. 

My friend asked me if she could stay with me (I still live with my mom and 2 younger sisters cause I’m only 17 and my mom isn’t fing crazy) so after asking my mom, I told her she could.

She’s been staying here for only three days now and I absolutely hate it. It’s not that she’s messy or anything, she’s very respectful of our house rules and everything, but I don’t like anyone staying at my house for too long in general. The problem isn’t with her, it’s just with me not liking people staying here.

I was not a normal child growing up lol, I hated sleepovers and didn’t understand what fun there was in my friends sleeping at my house. Especially when it’s for a few days. I feel like it creates some kind of messy embalance in my life (even though it really doesn’t I feel like it’s just more of an emotional embalance for me). 

I feel so selfish for even thinking like this in this situation because she has absolutely no where else to go. Her whole family is filled with nut jobs and she doesn’t really have many friends. I feel like I should want to be there for my friend, and for the most part I am, but i just can’t deal with her staying here. To make it all worse I have no idea when she’s leaving and my mom has expressed to her multiple times that she can stay for as long as she wants *insert me smashing my head against a wall here*

258,"Positive responses to an inquiry as to whether a chimera (such as myself) has two souls has emboldened me to ask for further advice.

If a mom drops two eggs at the same time, and both get fertilized, the result will normally be fraternal twins. It is possible for the eggs to combine early in the process, resulting in a chimera. Some of a chimera's organs will be from one twin's cells, and some will develop from the others. Through a series of convoluted events, I recently discovered I am a chimera. Unfortunately, I am not a ""normal"" chimera because parts of me are female and parts are male (on the outside I appear completely male).

He let another pill popper move in with her two kids about 11 and 13. My uncle moved out and left this lady there. She is currently selling my grandmother's belongings on Facebook and offering free housing until eviction goes through. My aunt talked to cops and lawyer and said that we could take the doors off the house, cut the cable, disable the power. I went there and did this. We called the cops and they were there while this transpired. I asked the cops for permission and they said go ahead. Then a supervisor pulls up and said I should be charged with criminal damaging. I have not yet but I fear it looms. They gave the doors back and some friend of hers put them back on. She is still there. I offered to give her $100 in front of the cops for a room and food if they left. She sold most of my grandmother's heirlooms including a clock that was over 100 years old.

I have been with my boyfriend for over a year now and live together. He is pretty successful and amazing with his money, he owns a 5 acre farm with 5bed/2baths. He makes more than twice I make, he went to college and got an associates degree. He's awesome and I'm so proud of him! But now I'm feeling like shit about myself.. I'm almost 21 with no job experience besides being a stay at home nanny and a server at a restaurant. I want to move forward and get a real job... but I have no experience, no college.. I want to feel equal to my boyfriend, be able to make as much money as he does. He doesn't care at all I don't make a lot of money, and appreciates I'm looking at other jobs but here I am stuck.. feeling worthless. My boyfriend has told me all he's ever imagined in life is having a stay at home wife.. I've been someone's stay at home nanny for years and just can't do it anymore, and I don't think I could ever be a stay at home mom. It's literally MENTALLY draining. My boyfriend is 24 btw, I met him straight after I graduated high school, falling madly in love and skipping college and moving out with him. I cook, clean, and love him unconditionally. He pays the bills, I pay for groceries. He thinks that's ""equal"" since he doesn't like cooking or cleaning so I do it.

I didn't expect to meet the man I wanted to marry so early at my age, let alone him be 4 years older than me.. he's more mature, secure, etc.. great man. He doesn't think I need college to get a good job.. and says I should be a secretary.

268,"So my sister went to a fairly good college nearby. My parents paid her way through and even paid for her vacations over the winter break of her first year. She didn't tell us but she failed every course (all 10) throughout college. She had begun dating a boy who was going to college for the 3rd time (flunked out 3 times) and was about 23 while she was 18 at the time. My parents left her alone despite her having a large meal plan and spending $50 per meal a day going out to restaurants because they thought she was just studying hard and enjoying her meals. This was very difficult financially on my family as we are just middle class and I'm currently a medical student and my parents are helping push me through school too. My sister has always been a pretty good kid and she never got into any trouble or had any issues. She had a good group of friends and enjoyed her hobbies so they didn't question her spending habits. Then during the summer we received a letter at our house stating my sister had been forcibly withdrawn from school and we confronted her about it and she told us she had failed every course she had taken. Despite failing all her courses, she signed a lease that my parents were stuck paying in an fairly costly condo by her school. She said she would apply for reinstatement into the school by writing a letter. She wrote a letter and sent it to me to edit and I read through it and it was absolutely terrible. She was an avid reader and a great writer through high school and it was just awful. I made edits to it and sent it back to her to elaborate on things to make it more convincing especially since she had no excuses for failing out. After about a month of me going back and forth with her for edits where she would make slight changes to grammar or add a sentence or two I decided I'd just write the whole thing and sent it in for her. The school said they would allow her to take a course that teaches you how to study so you can return to college. She took it and failed the course. So then she found a part time job working at the local grocery store and seems to be very happy with it and moved in with her boyfriend and her father. She lives with them while working at a grocery store currently. She claimed to be depressed and then went on to tell our family physician and a psychologist or psychiatrist (i can't recall) a bunch of lies about how she was depressed. Easily things that could be verified and not subjective matters. She claimed we didn't pay her way through school, that she struggled to afford to eat and that she wasn't failing out of school etc. Then one day my mother had a terrible anxiety attack thinking about my sister and I had to take her to the hospital. I called my sister and told her what happened and that she needed to come talk to our parents and make sure they were okay. She didn't come. 

I'm stuck and its stressing me out, since I live away from my parents and I'm studying for medical school exams this coming week, I can't stop thinking about my parents and my sister. I just want her to be comfortable in life and not have to struggle living off minimum wage. My parents were putting her through school and she would have been set to make a good living upon graduation with no debt which is a huge blessing. So I'm stuck do I make an attempt to go talk to her and help her out, or do I tell my parents to completely cut her off and thereby out of the family?

278,"Does this quality as emotional abuse or narcissism or something like that? (asking for a friend)

Age 14, they wouldn't let me send letters even to my grandparents unless they got to read every word first. Age 17, they read my journals without telling me and then forbade me from writing further journals. Until college I wasn't allowed to use the internet or play video games period.

I was homeschooled. 

And I think keeping strict control over me was one of the reasons they refused to consider sending me to school. 

I wasn't allowed to leave the house. 

I could never visit friends' houses but I also couldn't make friends because I wasn't allowed to go to any social groups where I could meet people. For a little while I could at church but then they stopped going to church too.

In freshman year they let me go to a homeschool group that met once a week.

We still didn't use internet at all.

In junior year when they sent me to private school, we had limited internet on the school iPads. But even that they were pretty upset about.

I planned to run away twice before that, and both times it was because I was desperate to go to school and make friends.
But even with the homeschool group, they wouldn't let me go to a friend's birthday party where they were watching a PG movie. PG!

After the homeschool group life was bearable. But had they continued to keep me completely isolated past age 14 I don't know what I would have done. 

I couldn't leave the house even to put flyers up about offering to mow lawns. But I did one time anyway. 

I honestly wasn't rebellious enough at that age. I didn't go out of my way to circumvent rules. I kept begging them to be more lenient and hoping they would change.

At age 10, my grandma gave me a working landline telephone for Christmas, but the point was that it was a project to assemble and it would work after I built it.

I built it and made ONE call, only to my grandma, and left a voice mail on her answering machine. My parents found out and were furious and took away the gift. Back then it was actually unusual for them to let us receive gifts from our grandparents in the first place though.

I guess they were furious because I wasn't allowed to make phone calls. Looking back, maybe they thought I would tell someone about how they were treating me?

But they treated my adopted siblings worse. They locked my sister in her room for 4 days straight while my grandma was visiting so she never got a chance to see her.

And the mere fact that my grandma was allowed to visit was a great improvement over the 10 years before that.

They didn't starve her or anything though. But yes they did imprison her.

And a few years later they gave the adopted kids to other families. I just barely reconnected with my sister after 12 years.

279,"So my two friends are criminally underpaid teachers while I make a very comfortable living. We have been planning a trip together and they both kept expressing concerns about money and cost and finding the cheapest place to stay. The hotel they both agreed on, honestly, is a total shithole. It’s a motel. It has nothing but bad reviews. It’s in a bad area. My skin crawls just looking at the website and it makes La Quinta hotels look like the damn four seasons. 

So I found a much more reasonable, mid-priced hotel and told them that I got a discount through my work’s travel portal but really I just  paid for the majority of it. Probably 2/3, splitting the remaining 1/3 between them. I had no problem doing this and it was no financial burden to me.

But then a few weeks later they asked for our hotel info and I forwarded them the confirmation email without really thinking, and they saw that I had lied about the real cost. They were fairly insulted and have since then been pretty unbearable. Every time I’m with them, they have to fit in as many jabs as possible about how I somehow think I’m better than them. Ordering drinks at the bar? “Oh I better not get my card out, moneybags over here probably wants to cover it.” Picking a restaurant for dinner? “Oh, no way she’ll want to eat there, they don’t even have a caviar appetizer!” They’ve even made jokes as if I’m somehow slumming it with my broke teacher friends. Wtf. 

It’s really frustrating, because I understand that I should have offered to pay more without going behind their backs, but I was honestly just trying to alleviate some of their stress about the trip (and save us from bedbugs). They say all of this stuff in a joking way, but it’s really starting to bother me. I’ve asked them to knock it off but they react to that with another snooty joke.

I've applied to few schools and got in but only because my parents really wanted me too. My plan was to go out to Oregon, where I've wanted to go for basically as long as I could remember. Got a good roommate and figured out the whole situation only to hear that my dad actually isn't gonna financially support me if I go out there /: he's basically bribing me to stay in the south for undergrad, and in return he would financially support my entire way through and also buy me a new car. It all sounds good and dandy but I really have no clue where I would even wanna go around here :( Money doesn't buy happiness ( I do not think he would ever understand that) and I just feel stressed and nervous and so anxious about everything. I feel so much pressure also with application deadlines sneaking up way too quickly. I do not want to be in the south but I understand his reasons. He was basically telling me for that undergrad I need to be a car ride away so that when something happens he can be there for me, instead of a long plane flight/ 38 hour car drive. I feel so stuck. Him and my mom are getting a divorce and still living together rn because she has nothing, all of this tension is causing me to freaking snap on everyone so quick. I almost feel like I'm completely losing myself in all of this. I can't think of one school I would even wanna go to over here. Im gonna major in English so pretty much any school has that major but I don't know what to do and I honestly don't think I want to be financially on my own and ugh I'm really lonely and sad :( And really wanna get away asap :( me being so upset all the time is causing a tremendous change in relationships through out my life and I wish my dad would just be understanding about where I want to be but he never will and I feel like theres really not an alternative.

282,"(If you just want to answer my question, its the last paragraph)

Hello reddit, I'm 16 male and I thought I was strait. I have a girlfriend, we've been together for 8 months. Not too long but I love her so much. We've been through some stuff, I was falsely accused of sexual assault just before I met her, we fought through that and we support, trust each other so much. It seems to be so mature, so open and she's pansexual.

I always knew that I found other guys attractive, as in I would look at a guy just think about them sexually, if they we're attractive. I openly expressed that with my friends, both male and female. For example there could be a conversation about male celebrities and I would comment about 'how I think that ""x"" male is hot' I'm quite camp and my friends have asked in the past, as a legitimate question if I'm gay. But recently, for the passed 2 months, exams have stopped and I have a lot more free time so I spend it with Jess and her friends who are mostly 'non-strait' which is obviously okay. It's just made me think of my sexuality because things like that aren't in my subconscious and more in my main, thinking part. I've told Jess that I might be rethinking my sexuality, she's completely supportive. As I know that I am very much still attracted to girls.

Essentially. I am attracted to girls, and to guys but girls about 70% and guys 30% I would have sexual intercorse with a male, but only if it was through a romantic setting wether I would do casual things with females.

290,"Here is my story.

I smoked for a very long time and I knew that I can leave it whenever I want if I had a reason to. Few months ago my couch saw me lifting weights in the GYM, I was practicing for a martial art competition. I had talked to him before about a girl fighter that I admired in a previous tournament we attended. When he saw me in the GYM he said and I quote ' If you will fight in front of your love like this, you will end up embarrassing yourself"".
He was talking about how an organized my life was. But somehow that made me think about quitting smoking. I said to myself I will leave smoking for this upcoming tournament then I will come to it. And that is exactly what I did. After the tournament that I got 2nd place in, I did not want to smoke again 
for the following reasons.
1- the fact that I can fight 3 fights in a row and perform good in them was huge to me.
2- I can smell better.
3- If I go to it again I wont be able to leave it unless another reason appears to me. 
4- When I see someone smokes I dont think they look good anymore. 
The list goes on.

But now I did not go to practice for few weeks. To be honest I lost the motivation, might be a casual fighter that comes some days and some days skips. But I dont think I want to be a tournament fighter anymore or so I think. 
The reasons that I want to smoke again are as follows:
1- It will fill my time
2- It will help me when I am stressed
3- I dont know at this point I just feel like it will feel good. 
4- I REALLY USED to enjoy playing videos games on the PC while smoking ( something was about it that made me feel happy :O) 

 A brief about me: 
I just graduated from college (Applied Media) I am an aspiring director. I cant apply for a job now tell I finish my one year in the army which starts for me on August. So yah I have a long time to wait. 

Bottom line is. I want to smoke again because I liked it before and my reason for stop smoking has gone. I also dont feel the urge to smoke but I know for a fact that if I started I will not be able to stop easily again. I've been there and I know how does it feel.

295,"It's the most dreaded time of the year....annual performance reviews. 


I started a new job back in October, and because of WHEN I started I am eligible for a bonus/pay raise and of course everyone's favorite thing - a performance review. I normally feel a bit nervous but am nervous than most this time. 

I had a few one on ones with my manager and they didn't go as I hoped. My manager told me I wasn't where he needed me to be. When asking for specific feedback on where he needed me to be he gave me a ""I don't know"". Upon continuing this conversation, he went on to say that I'm doing good...but there is room for improvement.  I went on to express concern for my upcoming performance review which he stated that there should not be any concern, and to not be worried. So basically, I feel like I'm getting mixed signals. 

We spoke today as a bi-weekly touch base, and things were a bit more Switzerland, he asked me how things were going and I stated that I was working on a few items with a lot of help from my one co-worker who was very strong in this arena. I felt like things were getting better and that the items that there are room for improvement are arenas I have not really indulged in yet as of my newer status. He agreed, and I told him the certain things I was good at but also needed to work on. 

The environment is also different than what I am used to - very laid back, people kind of do their own thing and people primarily keep to themselves. Which is okay, but I'm more used to a very loud, fast paced environment. I feel very paranoid for some reason as well. 

My question is, should I be worried about my performance review or am I allowing my anxiety to get the best of me because of this unfamiliar environment? 


TL;DR - Started new job in October and my boss has been giving me mixed signals which gives me a lot of panic for my upcoming performance review. Should I be worried? ",31Jan2018,1
297,"So I live in an apartment with two other people, my roommate C, and my roommate D.  We all worked retail in various places, and me and C are currently going to school.

D was fired from his job three days ago because he ""had a headache."" or ""someone claimed they saw him walk in late,"" or ""his boss had it out for him,"" or any number of excuses that paint him as the victim rather than someone who decided he didn't need to go into work on time when he was on a final warning.

Every time I see him I've been asking if he's applied to jobs, and every single fucking time he says that he hasn't yet, but he will in a little while.  Every second not spent by him playing League of Legends is spent getting fast food.

C and I are on the verge of confronting him, telling him that if he doesn't at least try to find a fucking job he's not going to be living here anymore, but there are a few challenges with that.

We figure there are three options. 1. hope that D finds a job, and then ditch him once our current lease is up, 2. Break the lease, 3. find someone to take his portion of the lease.

Option 1 is great, I would love for that to work, but if he doesn't find a job within like a month, I think we're going to have to go with one of the other options because we can't afford to cover his portion of the rent, and I guarantee that he would never pay us back.

Option 2 is probably the least ideal solution since in order to not have it count as an eviction we'd have to give sixty days notice (essentially two months of rent) plus the value of two months rent, and the value of utilities for two months, which would be $1600+ each for me and C if D decides he'll help, and a more realistic $2400+ for me and C if D doesn't decide to pay.

Option 3 is what I want to happen, there will be huge resistance from D - because he's a dick - but that will be the most painless option.  The only problem is that I don't know anyone in my area who is looking for an apartment, and things like craigslist scare me a little bit.

Before you ask why I moved in with him in the first place, the three of us went to high school together, and I thought D was a decent enough guy, but it turns out he doesn't give a shit about anything.

I just don't know what to do.  I'm terrified that we're going to end up getting evicted if none of these work out, and for various reasons I don't have a safety net beyond couch surfing for a while until I can get back on my feet from this.  This is such a blow to me and C, and I'm kicking myself so hard for renting with D.  C and I both make enough money that we could have rented a smaller, cheaper apartment just by ourselves, but we didn't because D wanted to rent with us so badly and it would make it even cheaper.

299,"I'm currently on break and the semester starts up next week. But I realized that I haven't done much of anything the entire break. I suffer from anxiety and depression and have since high school, and I feel like I may have sort of forgotten what's normal for people to do with their free time.

For reference, I spent 90% of my break in my bedroom playing video games or watching youtube because I just can't think of anything else to spend my time with. And it makes me feel shitty because I feel like I could be doing things more productive with my time.

302,"Okay so in January last year I got a job I really needed, full-time, decent pay.

I'm quite a closed off person don't share my problems with anyone.

Since January last year I've managed to build up an absolute mountain of debt. This morning I looked at my bank account and there was £1600 there after I just got paid. I knew I had a lot of debt but I didn't realise it was as bad as it was. I looked again a few hours later and all of that bar £150 was eaten up by instalments. I'm literally at the end I have no idea what to do as my situation is worse than it seems.

I live with my Dad, we don't get along very well and he's moving to his girlfriends house on the 20th of February. He was originally supposed to go in December but I told him I needed to save more money so I could move out myself. He was very angry but eventually agreed to move it back until February to give me time. Our relationship is very strained we've never got a long very well, he doesn't know about my mountain of debt and I know he has already handed the notice in to our landlord.

I need to pay £90 for my travel to work and my Dad has stopped buying food at home for me, I pay for the internet as well so at the end of it all it looks like i'm going to have £20 to live off this month. I know i have a loans payment due tomorrow of £500 which i obviously can't afford and next month it will be £700 or something because it's the last installment. Overall i think i owe around £3000 out in loans but honestly i've lost track of it all.

So today i've lost all hope, hence why i'm writing this. I'm going to lose everything, I'm going to be homeless, I'm going to lose my job and lose my girlfriend (because why would she want to be with some homeless loser), as a side note i have only been with her 1 month.

The things i know aren't possible are:

I can't live where i am anymore. (I have until February 20th)

My Dad's girlfriend hates me and wouldn't let me stay with them (my dad has slight brain damage so he is easily controlled)

My Mum and Step-Dad might let me live there but i know my Step-Dad absolutely hates me which is why i live with my Dad (so i'm trying to avoid that at all costs, had an awful childhood there).

I can't afford to feed myself or pay my bills or move out or anything really. ( i have a few personal possessions such as a guitar and xbox, which i guess i could sell but they would only fetch £300-£400 between them, at which i ask myself what's the point it'll only all get eaten up by my debt anyway.

It's gotten to the point where i'm moving all my money to my savings account worried that it's going to get taken out and i can't eat.

I just don't see a way out of this at all and I really need some advice on what I should do. Sorry this is a mess to read but my thoughts are all over the place.

306,"**Tl;dr at the bottom.**

I’m a 16 year old guy and my crush is a girl in my class. She’s pretty shy and doesn’t have many friends. We’re both the only two people in our year left that aren’t in a relationship.

I’ve had many crushes before, but the strange thing with this girl is that we constantly make eye contact. From 5 to 30 times per day. In a single hour (like during break), our gazes might meet every ~1-2 minutes.

Sometimes I catch her looking at me, sometimes she catches me looking at her and most of the times our eyes coincidentally meet. She will usually look away instantly, but very sometimes **she’ll keep staring** even after I’ve caught her for another 10+ seconds until she looks away again. As if she’s zoned out or something...?

My issue is that I just can’t figure out why she looks at me so often. Is she interested? Is she just an observant person? Is she creeped out that she catches me looking at her so often, so she keeps an eye on me? 
As far as I’ve noticed, she doesn’t seem to stare at any other guys. Then again, the other guys don’t stare at her so often either.

Apart from the whole eye contact thing, we don’t say much to each other. I try to talk with her but it’s not always easy and convo’s are hard because she barely has any friends and is thus bad at socializing. Furthermore, when I do talk with her, she seems annoyed or disinterested even if I’m making her laugh or smile.
Biggest issue, though, is that she’s not often alone/in a good situation to talk to.

I would have asked her out by now if it wasn’t because of her seemingly disinterested behaviour. Like a few days ago, my pen fell under her desk and she said she was too lazy to pick it up. After class, she seemed annoyed that I went over to grab it myself. I would assume that you’d help your crush in a heartbeat instead of being lazy, no?

That might be a stupid example, I don’t know. My main reason why I think she’s disinterested, though, is because I asked her a few months ago to meet up and she rejected it. She’s a photographer, so I asked her if she could teach me te basics. I never literally said it was a date, but it very obviously sounded like one. She seemed exited to do this at first, but after texting later that day, she suddenly thought it wasn’t “worth the time” to meet up just so we could do some photography. This came to me as a huge blow and if she did have a crush on me, it seems very stupid of her to reject the offer. Might be wrong on that one though.

Any advice would be appreciated, I’d love to know what you guys think about the whole eye contact thing. Thanks in advance :)

————————————

TL;DR: 16 yo girl I have a crush on makes eye contact with me 5-30 times each day. Usually she catches me looking at her or reverse. She usually looks away upon contact but sometimes keeps staring. How am I supposed to know if she’s interested or creeped out? Trying to meet up with her or talk with her doesn’t seem to work or help me in figuring it out.",31Jan2018,2

308,"I’ll start with the backstory.  My father was diagnosed with colorectal cancer when he was 32. After surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation he remained cancer free for 12 years.  It returned three years ago but this time in his lungs and liver. They successfully removed the cancer from his liver 2 years ago, but he’s been through 30 chemo treatments since  for the cancer in his lungs.  The past treatment cycle they successfully matched his genetics with an immunotherapy drug that has performed remarkably well and helped get the cancer to an almost undetectable level.  He was off chemo for 3 months, but his scans last week indicated that the spots in his lungs were growing. So he’s back on chemo again. 

Here’s my dilemma, I’m 22, and I’ve been in semi long distance relationship with my girlfriend for 2 years. The first year we lived in the same city, but now we live 2.5 hours apart and see each other on the weekends. My father, mother, and brother are moving back to our home town to be close to the rest of our family. Mainly my sister and her kids and my grandparents/great grandparents. 

My hometown is almost 7 hours away from where we currently live. My girlfriend and I are planning on moving in together this summer and starting our lives here. I’m 100% sure  she’s the one I want to spend the rest of my life with, but I’m having serious doubts/ feelings of guilt about staying here while my family moves away. 

I don’t know how many good years my dad has left and I feel like my family will need me by their side. My mother and brother are both severely depressed and suffer from their own chronic diseases, and I don’t know how they’ll handle everything.  However, it’s hard for me to be around my family sometimes because it’s incredibly depressing to see them all like this and it weights pretty heavy on me. I’m becoming increasingly depressed myself and I don’t know really know how to handle it. 

My SO is basically the only thing keeping me sane at this point, spending time with her is basically a vacation from life.  But I don’t know feel right asking her to uproot her life to come live in my podunk hometown in the middle of nowhere Southern Illinois. If it wasn’t for my current situation, I would never consider moving back there. Besides that, my family is probably about to go down a very tragic and fucked up path and I don’t want to bring her down that road with me. 

I’m basically at a loss right now and I have no idea what to do or where to go from here. It would be so easy to stay where I am, move in with my girlfriend and be close to my friends, but I know that’s selfish on so many levels, and I honestly feel wrong for even considering it. But at the same time, I’m worried I’ll be completely miserable in my hometown. 

I know this is probably a situation with no right answer, and I’ll have to sacrifice one way or another, but I’m just hoping for a little bit of guidance.

312,"I'm 18, soon to be 19 I guess, but that's not really important. For pretty much my entire life my mom has been the type to eat extremely little, and I feel like over time she keeps eating less and less.

The majority of the time she just proceeds to say things about how she's tired, or she's upset, or upset because she ate some damn chocolate. You get the idea, stuff that normally wouldn't get to someone. This happens every single day, I come home and I hear something like ""I feel irritated"", literally for no reason, so I ask how come... ""I don't know"". Okay.

The thing that bothers me most is that she forcefully refuses to eat more than practically nothing. She's 55 and for her age I consider her more frail than she could be and that's only getting worse with time. 

You might think I'm yelling at her and shit, but I'd almost consider myself the most, or second most, mature person in our family. I know that yelling gets no where, and the only thing I can do is try to explain it extremely clearly in a way she understands.

But at this point I've realized that she doesn't WANT to listen, she ""wants"" to change, but she doesn't really WANT to change.

I've realized that its almost as if she just wanted pity and that's it. A lot of the time I'm getting her on my back to do stuff for her ""because it'll make her happy"". But once you hear that everyday, you can't really sympathize with it any longer.

I'm a pretty nice person I'd say, but having dealt with this excessive, needy, and sometimes downright ignorant family, and just knowing how the world is in general has made me fairly 'dead' or just really really nonchalant about almost everything. 

I say this because my sister that still lives with us is the type to fly off the handle on the fuckin' daily. When she tries, like me, to ""explain"" stuff to my mom. She just ends up yelling and screaming at the end about a bunch of stuff she has no idea about, which doesn't help and probably just makes my mom more blue.

314,"I’ve taken two college level sociology classes in the past, and I’m taking this Introduction to Sociology class because I switched schools and credits didn’t transfer. The textbook material is easy, but in lecture my professor could be speaking another language. He’s 82, and at one point I’m sure he was extremely knowledgable about the subject. But he’s honestly just too old to be teaching. All of his handouts can’t be understood because they are riddled with spelling errors and missing sentences/words. In class he just spews out word vomit about nothing, he can’t seem to explain anything. My classmates are all freaked the fuck out, I’ve had some of them say “was there a prerequisite to this class???” nope, it’s supposed to be an introduction class. “Did i miss a reading???” no, you did not. I couldn’t even understand his explaination of the scientific method. The simple fucking scientific method. I don’t care if he’s a bad professor but this is the first time in my 3 years of college that I’m worried his poor teaching will badly affect my grade. If the exams are on the textbook material, fine. But we are only graded on 3 exams in this class, so I don’t really want to wait and found out and potentially do poorly on that first exam. What do I do?? I have been to his office hours and he makes just as little sense then. A tutor??

Ill try to keep this as to the point as possible as in my brain it feels like it is going to be extended out way too much. 
I am 20 years old and have been with my current girlfriend for 5 years this year.
All sound so good so far right. 
The problem is I fucked up, I was young and stupid when I first uttered the words ""I love you"" to her without really meaning it I mean I was 17 at the time and I most definatley rushed into saying it. About 2 years ago I started to loose then initial ""Love"" I had for her and didnt think anything of i. I am now in the situation of asking for advice of weather or how I could possibly leave her. Over the time we have spent together she has become more and more emotionally attached and I well, have not. I feel as though I love her but I am not ""in love"" with her. She is always very good to me and I do my best to hide my true feelings from her as I know it would devistate her and I dont want to hurt her. I feel as though I haven't experienced anything in the world of relationships and dont feel as though i have met enough people to settle with one of the first I meet , we met in high school and have been together ever since I dont even think we started by dating we were just young and rushed into an exclusive relationship. 
The thing is I work for her dad and he is my only source of income, coming from a very poor family this is a very good job for me especially to work my way through university. 
He also booked a holiday for me his daughter (my GF) and himself to go away to mainland europe for the summer and has already paid the deposits.
As i mentioned earlier that she was very good to me I also owe her £450 from when i was out of work and had back payments on my car. (this is not because im that bad with money i had just lent my mother money and my previous job went bankrupt)
I dont know what to do about this situation guys as I cant just leaver her but im unsure weather i want to stay with her.  ",31Jan2018,1

She's a very cool person and she's aware that I find her attractive but... She told me that she just got out of something with another guy and she's not sure if she wants to get back with him. This really confuses me because she said that she doesn't like him but they are still friends and he wants to get back together with her.

From what I understand they have a very ""On &amp; Off"" relationship if you know what I mean. I asked her why does she keep going back to him and she says that they've been together for so long so that's all she knows. 

But I still wanna try to get to know her a bit more and possibly try to start dating her. So I invited her to come with me to this event and she agreed. We are going out tomorrow.

I have been an alcoholic since the last 10+ years (I'm 31). I am presently doing my PhD and stay in the institute hostel. I had been drinking alcohol and smoking weed daily for more than two years in my room since the start of my phd . Although any sort of substance abuse is illegal and punishable for students inside the institute premises, I was never caught until yesterday. They raided my room yesterday and recovered more than 20 whiskey bottles (mostly empty that I was too lazy to throw away), more than a hundred empty cigarette packets and about 10 grams of weed. A HDC(hostel disciplinary committee) meeting was set today where they told me that the amount of bottles and cigarette packets (also illegal) recovered was unprecedented and they want to make an example out of me.I was told that this could even lead to termination unless I rat out some names of other students who also drink or smoke. If I give them some names they will let me go scot-free. Otherwise an IDC(Institute disciplinary committee) will be formed and I'm liable to termination. In today's meeting ( it was 3 hours), they have interrogated and pressurised me to give up the names. I didn't succumb and maintained that I always drank alone. They didn't believe me and have given me 24 hours to give up the names.

Although I mostly drink alone, over the past  two years I have invited several guys to have a drink or smoke with me. Guys that have helped me at bad times and also supported me for my addiction. Now I am being asked to tell their names so they can be given the same treatment.

325,"My roommate abruptly moved to a new apartment because they're bad at communication. They were unhappy with the situation and let it boil because they avoid confrontation. 

I am 28, other roommate Female 25 and Male 22. (First non college apartment)

Male-22 moved to Chicago and landed a M-F 9-5 job

Me and F-25 work multiple jobs, day and night weekends..were in and out of the house at different times. But M-22 was VERY angry he would come home to dishes in the sink. Or be home all day on a Saturday while we were at work and see a non pristine kitchen and it bothered him a lot. (But never said anything.)

He didn't understand people on the go cooking food before we head out and that we clean when we get home. He would come home and be mad if there was a dish he wanted to use. Etc.

I on the other hand have been living on my own since I was 15 and I always end up being the dish fairy. (If I have time and there are dishes in the sink and I'm doing dishes, I'll wash em, and put em away I don't care if they're mine or not.) I don't really complain or mention it I just figure it goes noticed--(apparently not).

Alternatively- When he would cook something, and not to the dishes till the next day he would announce it to us. I KNOW I HAVE DISHES IN THE SINK IM TIRED I AM GOING TO DO THEM WHEN I GET HOME FROM WORK. (Apart from the obvious---when you live with people that's just expected behavior, but would act as if announcing it made it more considerate.)

I had been in my bedroom off the kitchen multiple times when he would get home from work if I worked a morning shift---(I would be in my routine of come home-cook--enjoy my food relax watch some tv---do dishes after unless it's late then I realize clanking dishes when someone has to be up in a few hours is rude I'll do them in the morning when people have already gone to work and I'm not going to bother anyone.) he would come home---yell or mutter to himself something like ""I just cleaned this"" or ""why is there a frying pan on the stove??"" And he would knock everything off the kitchen table and make a huge mess...(idk how often this was because I wasn't home for it all the time.)

But the F-25 roommate decided to have a talk with him bc she would hear M-22 muttering, slamming cabinets and drawers open and closed etc. and said ""we need to have a talk, because if you're unhappy you need to look outside of yourself and realize we all have different schedules and do things at different times (cook/clean) and that's something you need to consider. Because it's not ok to act like this, and your expectations of the level of cleanliness to your schedule isn't realistic or considerate of the other people living here. If it bothers m-22, yoy should say something instead of being passive aggressive. We need to sit down and find out what we can all do to be reasonably considerate of the people we're sharing space with because this isn't going to work if you think everything should revolve around your schedule because you're a ""neat freak.""

This was in the beginning of the week, on Saturday I get a text from M-22 saying when are we all going to be home bc we should talk. I was working so was F25. M-22 knows it wasn't likely we'd be home...(I) F-28 come home to packing boxes and things out in the living room...M-22 said he found a great living situation with another trans person who has a similar schedule and it's going to be a better situation---I had to jump on it---I don't have any friends in the trans community and I think this is going to be really healthy for all of us. But the move in day is december 1st so I have to jump on it"" 

M-22 proceeds to say I am going to pay my portion of the rent I'm going to try to find someone to move in, I'll make sure they're not a weirdo but if I can't I'll just pay my portion of the rent. 

*its the middle of winter in Chicago-its a small room with very cheap rent in a good neighborhood* 

December rolls around M-22 is out of town and decides he doesn't want to deal with it. Says he'll keep paying the rent but if we could work on finding someone that'd be great...

January mid way thru(Jan-13) we find out ~money issues bc shit with surgery~  so we should really work on finding someone for February---bc he's out of town. 


This is a big post explaining what led up to my M-22 roommate abruptly moving to another apartment down the street with 3 days notice. Agreed to pay their portion of the rent until we find a replacement. Said they didn't want to deal with it---pushed the responsibility back onto us---****should M-22 still be responsible for his portion of January utilities? (About $76) ****

1. His car is still parked in the spot till mid February so if someone did want to move in and had a car they won't be able to...

2. It's his responsibility to find someone to fill the room. But we're looking for long term people and he's negative about the room size. (But knew about it months before and still moved from Louisiana to live in the room.)

3. M-22 punched a hole in the wall above the sink, that F-25 said he would have to fix before his name comes off the lease 

4. Although M-22 isn't physically at the apartment January--I still think he should be held responsible for electric/gas/internet. Because that's an implied obligation of living with people is utility share regardless of use or not.

5. FUN FACT TIME- Our electric bill went down in total a full $70 for the month he wasn't physically in the apartment. 

(6. That last part was about the cost of the room is cheap but the smaller room holder clearly spends more time in the common spaces using more electricity. )

7. M-22 moved out dec-1st but is still on the lease and is still paying rent.

326,There is this girl that is in one of my classes that a like. Tomorrow I intend to ask her for her instagram or snapchat. (I would ask for her number but I think that would be a little awkward.) But once I do that I'm not sure if I should message her tomorrow or wait a little bit.(assuming she'd say yes to what I'd ask for) What do you all think?,31Jan2018,2
327,"Okay so I am in a class with this girl I sit next to (well, not next to but there is somebody between us). She is pretty cute and I wanna talk to her and get to know her more. Like I don't want to just go up to her and be like ""I wanna go out with you."" I clearly want to talk to her, get to know a bit about her, and see how our conversation is.

What I was ""planning"" on doing was that I was just gonna walk into class and tell her something like ""Hey do you mind if I sit here."" Just be direct about it, and not come up with anything unique or something. After that I would just introduce myself and talk to her a bit before class started. Then once class ends I'd just walk out with her. The last time we saw each other, she handed me the attendance sheet and she looked at me and then I looked back. She looked at me for a bit, then like 2-3 minutes later she left the classroom. I don't know if that means anything (at first I thought I creeped her out). When he looked at each other I was just like ""Thanks,"" and grinned at her. So anyway, she knows I exist at least.

I know, many people are against going up to a girl just because she is cute. While I do think she is, I do want to talk to her and see if she is somebody I could get along with before making a move such as getting her number or ask her for coffee.

329,"You can skip to the tl;dr if you don't want the background.


I am an Engineering student in college and I work as a Resident Assistant in the dorms. The first hiring process takes 5 weeks to go through but for every year after that it only takes a written application. 

I'm working the job not because I feel it will be beneficial to my career choice in the future but I love the work, the socialness, the fun, and the sanity I get from the job. 

It's currently evaluation season as well as application season - my returning application is due in a week. I had an evaluation session and I was ripped apart by my supervisors and they said they have ""mixed feelings"" about recommending whether I should return to my job or not. 

The issue I'm having is that I'm a great employee. I'm not trying to blow my own horn or be narcissistic about it, but in the position I'm in you can literally just work hard and it will translate into you being a great employee. I made more hall decorations than all but 1 of my coworkers at training. I take on extra responsibilities such as large amounts of community rounds. I turn in all my paperwork and meet my deadlines ahead of time - sometimes a week or more in advance. I haven't missed a single deadline. I go above and beyond on these things and I act as a staff role model. I am also a self starter - when I do not have projects to complete or deadlines to complete I make birthday posters for my coworkers, share my resources, etc, and this is well recognized within my staff and by my supervisor. 

The good in the eval I got: 
Completes all deadlines, does all work ahead of time, hangs out with residents, etc. Basically  ever aspect of my actual job performance meets or exceeds all standards wherever possible. 
The bad in the eval I got: 
Doesn't like a challenge, not ready for the changes being made in the department for the next year, doesn't understand the intrinsic value of the position

The bad took up the majority of the evaluation and the supervisor has been encouraging me to go do other things more ""challenging"" or relevant to my future career pursuits 

My main issue is I've never said any of that. She had asked me for feedback about some of the changes being made in the department and I've given it to her. It doesn't agree with her personal perspective and that's all fine and I'm fine with the department making changes, but she literally asked me for feedback and is now using it against me as evidence as to why I shouldn't be rehired. 

Same with challenge. I told her I don't want to move on to apartments because it would make my job a lot more difficult(residents don't care at all there) and I like the dorms. Now she's writing on my eval that I don't like challenges - plain and  simple. However, I legitimately challenge myself to do at least 1 1/2x as much work as my coworkers on average, I create more work for myself, I do more to help those around me, etc.

Same with ""intrinsic value."" She really values the professional development aspects and has been known to struggle with the human interaction aspects of her job. She encourages staff members to adopt to the idea of ""social capital"" when dealing with people and it's honestly odd for a customer service position. I personally value the social connections and social skills I gain and I have expressed that, but on the eval it's all about how I don't get anything from this job and don't understand the ""intrinsic value"" - her personal set of values. 

TL;DR: my supervisor gave me a really bad evaluation and the negatives had nothing to do with my job performance/motivational fit/reason for doing my job and is instead based on her own personal opinions of me. I've told her in the past when she tried to say ""you don't like challenges"" and I've told her ""I never said that and that's not how I am"" but she has still included it on my evaluation. This evaluation and her word  carries a lot of weight - I'm trying to move to a different community next year because she creates a really toxic environment but I am scared she will try and influence pro staff members not to rehire me because of personal issues she has with me. I have another meeting with her tomorrow because I needed more time to talk about the things that ended up on my eval but I need advice on how to handle it.  Can anyone give me some advice on how I should approach some of the just plain untrue things that were placed on my eval? I don't want to just sit there and call her a liar even if she wrote things on there that were just her personal opinions and untrue. I don't think that'd help. ",31Jan2018,0

346,"Hi, I am 19 years old and from Austria. Recently (4 months ago) we (my family and me) moved to Turkey but I dont like it here. I want to move back but there are some things holding me back.

What holds me back from moving back to Austria: my family is still in Turkey, I will be alone and it will be hard in Austria. I have to earn my own money and do my dishes etc which in Turkey my mom does for me. Also, my dad doesnt want me to move back. And I have to get a job in Austria and a place to stay.

Why I should move to Austria:
I have my friends there who will support me as far as they can. I was born and raised there so its my hometown, I am used to the lifestyle in Austria and hate the lifestyle in Turkey btw. Also, I would earn alot of experience living alone and working for myself which is good.


So, should I move back to Austria or stay here with my family in Turkey? Thanks for ur time :)",31Jan2018,2
347,"Ok, please tell me if I am being irrational and over dramatic. First of all, I'm a single mom of two kids. I work full time, have my own place, car, &amp; money. I have been single for 2 years and recently joined the online dating community.. 
I met a guy 5 months ago &amp; we went to a play (his ""brother"" cancelled last minute apparently). He had an extra ticket and I had a free evening. He was very nice. Brought me roses &amp; opened the door for me...etc. we talked on the phone and texted ever since.. he became extremely clingy, wanting to FaceTime everyday. I forgot to mention he can talk his head off. I can never finish a sentence without being interrupted. He can't stop talking about all the money, cars, and luxuries he has. Although I've seen none of it. Not even a good picture of a nice car. He can't stop talking about how ""money isn't shit, I get whatever I want because I'm the best at what I do"". He's in the army. He's a recruiter.  

Every single day he expresses how much he likes me and wants to make me his girlfriend. Says he'd treat me like a queen, blah, blah, blah... I thought I'd give him a fair chance and make ONE attempt at it.

It was his little brothers  21st bday this past weekend. Celebrating it in LA. He took the liberty of surprising me &amp; buying a return flight for me.. inviting all his cousins and booking a suite in Los Angeles. 
When I'm on a date I never usually pay for anything. The guys I have been on dates with, always pay &amp; send my Uber to me. They are very considerate of the fact that I'm a single mom &amp; should not spend my money when I'm with them.
Soooo fast forward.. I flew out to Los Angeles. I had to buy a ticket to get there bc i felt it was mean to leave him hanging with the return flight.  I asked if he was picking me up from the airport &amp; he said no. I paid my taxi to the hotel ($40). I get there and he smothers me since the moment I walk in. He was too cheap to get the group an Uber. Made us walk 10+ blocks in heels. The next day we all went out to eat and he made us all get separate tabs. He didn't buy me any drinks at the club either. The second night, he also made the group walk. I COULDN'T TAKE IT! I ordered the Uber XL myself!! He was saying, ""my phone died, I can't order the Uber but I'll pay whoever orders the Uber the cash, y'all know I got money"".. he didn't pay me for the Uber. He didn't pay for any of my meals. Or my Uber back to the airport. I felt so dumb. He was also trying to touch me inappropriately the entire time. I had to tell him every 30minutes to stop. I had the worst weekend ever. Am i crazy or should i feel like i completely wasted my time with a extreme cheapskate?...    ",31Jan2018,3
348,"I'll give a brief backstory: I'm an American who has been living in Europe for the past 5 years. I moved here with my wife, who subsequently committed suicide, and life has been very difficult for me ever since then. I've struggled with depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation.

I've had steady stable employment at an office doing programming work, but it doesn't pay well and I have felt stuck there for a long time. The prospect of hunting for better jobs has scared me because I don't have any social support and I'm scared of losing my stable job. If I got another job and then lost it, I'd be fucked.

I'm ready to leave this country and come back to the US. I don't have any family to come back to unfortunately. I'm in a long-distance relationship with someone from Atlanta, so I've been increasingly interested in taking steps to getting employment there.

But every time I try to start, I get paralysed. Paralysed by the fear of failure, by the amount of work in front of me. I don't even know how to make a resume, especially given that my skills are very disorganized - I do mostly programming / apps / web design, all self-taught on the job, and so much of my knowledge is informal and I don't really know how to ""sell"" myself. The task is so daunting and I feel so far away from making a meaningful change in my life.

I'm posting here I guess because I'm hoping someone here will be able to offer me some guidance. I know I need to make a change to move my life forward, I know that I'll never be happy if I just keep playing it ""safe"" where I am, but I still feel so stuck. Help please :(",31Jan2018,5

351,"Well i'm 14 and about a month ago a new guy started in my class.

 He quickly stuck to me but i never liked him because of thi gs he said and how he acted (He acts as if he knows everything) some of the things he's said to me is that ""The gender pay gap is good. Men are stronger and better in every way"" and that ""Women who dress slutty habe rape coming"". 

The reason he started in my school was because of bullying, but he was bullied for being racist, sexist and racually intolerant. I have seen screenshots of thinga he's said like ""The only thing muslims do is hit women and cut of their vaginas"" and ""Sweden (Where we live) would be safer if all the non swedes went back""

He constantly follows me and my friends around in school trying to fit in with everyone but he keeps anoying everybody.
We habe tried walking away and running away. I habe also tried telling him but he starts shouting everytimw i tell him to lay off with his inapropriate comments. 

What should i do?",31Jan2018,12
352,I live in a quiet neighborhood and all the cars that drive by in my neighborhood don't rev their engines ever. But this one specific car some white corvette. I haven't gotten the license plate yet but almost every single day this asshole as soon as he reaches my house he revs his engine LOUDLY. He's done it at 2 am one time. I even opened the blinds one time to look at his car when he does it to see if he is actually doing it on purpose and he is. Only revv's it once they this person drive's past my house. Can't tell if I made an enemy or this dude just want's to be a dickhead. So I've been ignoring it since that's probably all I can do. Any suggestions?,31Jan2018,3

I have never been asked out, on a date, had a boyfriend, got kissed, etc. I have noticed In the last year or so I have talked to guys a lot more and they are usually the ones that talk to me first. I was interested in a guy I worked with. We used to joke around and text and laugh a lot. He ended up quitting that job and has a girlfriend so I haven't talked to him in three months.

354,"Hello. So a friend of mine got involved in a car collision (she and her boyfriend got rear ended). Here’s the details:

This was in California.

Her boyfriend was driving his car and they were at a complete stop.
Another car rams into them after ramming into the car behind them (completely pushing the car behind them out of the lane).
They end up rear-ending the car in front of them a little bit from the force of impact (cosmetic damage).
In total, 4 cars were involved in the accident.

The collision was caught on a passerby’s camera (dash cam).
CHP was called and noted down everyone’s account.

So far her boyfriend has been dealing with the insurance and has gotten payment for the damages to his car. She hasn’t gotten anything thought. However, she’s developed terrible anxiety while driving and being a passenger. It’s gotten to the point where brake lights will trigger her and she will sob and cry out incessantly.

She has tried to seek help to find funds to pay for some therapy, but as far as she’s told me, no personal injury attorney is willing to help take her case. Is there something that can be done? I want to help her but I live across the state and I’ve never been involved in something like this.

More notes: I don’t believe her medical insurance covers a psychologist (at least that’s what she told
me) and she’s a 1st generation Asian girl so her parents haven’t been much help.",31Jan2018,3

so due to illness, I missed a lot of days last year and I finally got kicked out of college. So I wasted 2 years of my life.

In Addition to that, I am currently 2500€ in debt, and I don't know how to pay it back.

I felt like shit for the last year, physically, emotionally, just every way. I did a lot of drugs and partying and girls ignoring it until I just could not be asked to get out of bed anymore.

Honestly, I have been thinking about suicide a lot recently, I also thought about getting my money fast in semi-good ways. I just don't know what to do, my family has supported me incredibly good but I have just been shitting on my education and now I'm kicked out, the guilt is killing me, I haven't told them.

Wasn't even sure if I should post here since some people might need you more, but then again what do I have to lose, I can still kill myself if I don't fix my life.

What should I do in my situation? I just don't see a way out and I honestly don't want to die yet because life can be so great, but I definitely can't live like this anymore.",31Jan2018,6
361,"I [26/F] currently live Los Angeles, CA. I moved here roughly 7 years ago for a job opportunity and have 2 family members down here as well (more on that in a bit), so I figured it would be a great landing place and a way to get out of my terrible, middle of nowhere hometown out of high school. I recently landed a great job with a world famous corporation, I have a wonderful serious boyfriend, just bought a new a car, have a decent apartment, and I make a great salary considering I have no college education. However, I really never wanted to settle down in this city. As a child/teen, I told myself I would never live here and went into moving here with the idea that it would be temporary. Seven years later and I still have that mindset. I'm flat out not happy here. 


Upon taking this new job, almost all of my close friendships have dwindled down to just the occasional text, as all of my friends worked at my past job with me and that job requires ridiculous hours and different days off. Other than my boyfriend, I am so horribly lonely here. I have acquaintances at work, but nothing in common with them who would make them ""friend-worthy"". I'm sick of the heat of LA. I want seasons. I want that city with a small town feel. I want to live in the same place as my friends who actually make an attempt to hang out with me and cherish me as a friend. Every day I find something about LA that makes me grow to detest it even more.


I have a ton of friends in Nashville, TN who are all wonderful people and love me dearly (and I love them!). They've become some of my best friends and deepest relationships - one has been my best friend for the last 10 years. Over the last few years, I've found myself buying plane ticket after plane ticket whenever I have a few extra hundred dollars just to see them for weeks at a time. I've desperately wanted to cancel my return ticket every single time and stay there. I fell in love with the city and the people there, and have known for the last 3 years that I desperately want to move there. I have a job that isn't specific to my location, so I can really find work anywhere. My boyfriend's family also lives there, and he wants to move there as well, which is really convenient!


Here's the issue - my father has been in prison for the last 16 years under a false conviction, and is due to be released within the next year or so (maybe less). He and I have an... interesting relationship. Since he has been gone for the most formative years of my life, he still thinks of me as a child. Our phone conversations and visits are only surface-level and sometimes awkward, I do love him very much but our conversations are usually just light and never about anything of importance. I've mentioned my boyfriend a few times, and the vacations we've taken together, and he refuses to acknowledge that I have a boyfriend with me. He then speaks to my two family members down here regularly (aunt and grandma, his sister and mom, who live together) and has apparently had panic attacks recently with them on the phone over me having a boyfriend (again, he still thinks I'm a child). He's also expressed that he wants to live wherever I do when he's released.


This is the real problem. We're unsure what the terms of his parole will be (how far he can move, etc), but I've been told multiple times by my aunt and grandma that I need to remain living here so that I can be where he is when he's released. I'm constantly guilted into needing to put my family first (a phrase I've never agreed with) and to stay here for him, and them as well. Another story for another time, but they're another part of the reason why I want to move so far from here.


I know it sounds so so so so selfish, but I am just absolutely fucking miserable here (again, boyfriend aside) and the thought of staying here any longer, regardless of the reason, legitimately makes me feel depressed and trapped. My boyfriend shares the same sentiment. I don't envision my future or my life here, and thinking about staying here for another few years for my father just makes me want to spiral into a depression, especially considering I've been wanting to leave for the last 3 years. I finally make enough money now to make this a reality. I know it's nothing compared to where my dad has spent the last 16 years, which makes me feel even WORSE. I'm his entire life, everything he's looking forward to and what has gotten him by. But I also have goals of starting a family (definitely not in fucking Los Angeles) and financial success. Real estate is significantly less in Nashville, and I could own a home, have a great career, and the stable life I've hoped and dreamed of since I was a child who had her entire family ripped apart at a young age.


I've tried putting the idea in his head about moving to Nashville, and he sounds pretty open to it but since our conversations are so ""fake"", I'm not sure how he actually feels about it. I also don't know if it'll be a reality for him, legally and financially. 


I was planning on saving up my tax return this year and a few more grand for trying to move to Nashville as my end of the year goal. I KNOW I will be happier there. I've never felt so at home anywhere else. 


Am I selfish for still wanting to move and feeling horribly depressed over the thought of having to stay here for my father? I honestly don't even know how to approach this situation.


[TL;DR] Depressed/lonely in current city, desperately want to move to a city I love and where my friends/life/future are. Guilted to stay in current city by family for my dad who soon to be released from prison with parole location limitations.",31Jan2018,2
364,"Finally bit the bullet and deleted/blocked my ex-best friend and ex, J (F/19). I'm a 21 year old guy, and while I haven't been the best of people (in fact I'm a grade A cunt), she hasn't tried to work with me at all, or accept the fact that she's wrong too. I've been blamed for all sorts, for example: I was blamed for interpreting something the wrong way (she didn't mean physically dragged when she said, and I quote ""grabbed by the wrist and dragged""). I'm apparently emotionally abusive and a horrible friend (despite consistently being guilt tripped throughout our time together. Like I said, I'm a cunt but it's never her fault). 

Last night she sent something to me that, while not directly targeted at me, was pointing out a character flaw that coincidentally I have, one in particular she dislikes. I, of course, get hurt by this but apparently it's my fault. 

So after yet another argument I've deleted and blocked her because she won't admit that she's not at least a little built at fault. Am I in the wrong? And how do I move on from someone I've shared (feels like wasted) over 2 years with?",31Jan2018,1

I feel like I want younger friends who are 20-25, but then I get disappointed when they don't know or don't care about more mature issues that most people in their 20s don't care about. I feel intimidated by most people I meet who are my age or older who act like there's something wrong with me for not wanting a gf or house right now. I don't even know if I'm too immature or too mature for my age at times.

I help people out and genuinely care about them, and they don't even want to respond to me asking how things are going a few months later. 

I've considered I might be autistic, but after looking through lists of specific problems that autistic people have, I can confidently say that's not me. I don't have a problem with reading people, understanding how one might react to something, or executive functioning. I can't relate to many of their problems other than the fact that I have no friends.

I wish I could have a friend or something who I truly connected with on a deeper level. I'm not even talking about a romantic connection, just more like a mutual understanding.
