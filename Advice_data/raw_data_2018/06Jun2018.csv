0,"Hi there so I'm a college student and I got an full time on campus job this summer. I was so excited and thought it'd be great! However it's not what I expected at all... The two main parts of my job are giving tours and making phone calls to prospective students. 

The phone calls are meh. Most don't pick up and we are calling people who don't want to talk usually and are rude or wary. Its very shady how the college board and other companies sell high school students info to colleges to recruit them. If you ever wondered how your email got flooded w college emails or you got a ton of mail it's bc your information was sold. I morally don't agree w this at all but all colleges do it and I know it won't change. Aside from the morality it's just monotonous to leave the same message over and over again to students. I don't feel like I'm helping them and I spend most of my day doing this.

The second part is tours which I thought would be the better part of the job. However I failed my tour evaluation by my boss today... When I was given criticism they had literally nothing positive. I got reprimanded for saying the word bursar Bc it's not a ""relatable"" word despite that being the offices name. I was told I showed a classroom too big and not representative of the schools class sizes. I was told not to use the word just during my speech Bc it diminished the school. I was told I had no personality and that I gave too many facts about the campus etc. Etc It was so nitpicky and I spent thirty minutes trying not to cry while my boss laid into me in front of a peer. The messed up part of this was the guy who was training me said I was doing great and now I'm trash. 

I regret taking this job. However it's done at the end of August and I need the money to pay my rent for the next semester. I don't want to quit but I can't stand the idea of going back after today... Any advice to get through it? ",06Jun2018,2

2,"Just going to clarify that after breaking up w/ my ex I realized that I actually did have feelings for him that I did not want to own up to.

Now it's been three months since I broke up w/ him and he wants absolutely nothing to do with me since I was the one to break it off and on again. I've done a lot of pondering on my own reflecting on if my feelings for him were real and if I made a mistake and everything within me is saying that I did.

I've already tried everything in my power to speak with him again but its just not happening. He genuinely loved me and showed me in a myriad of ways but I just couldnt see it then.

I just want to make this feeling of genuine love so it doesn't take up a majority of my thoughts anymore.

How do I make it stop and move on?",06Jun2018,3
3,"Earlier this summer, after the semester ended, I brought up the idea of moving in together with my boyfriend. We've only been dating 7 months now but I felt like we were in a good position to do so. I was looking at apartments and houses to possibly rent until I found out I was in danger of losing my scholarship. To keep it, I would have to take a class this summer and tuition is pretty expensive, even for one class. At the time I didn't know my mom was going to help me out with the costs, so being pretty upset about this and worried about my financial position, I told my boyfriend I wasn't sure if moving out was going to happen. About a week or two later, his friend offers him a room for less than $200 a month. Since it seemed like a great deal he pretty much jumped on it. He did talk to me about it the next day, but it was basically just to tell me he was going to do it.

I guess the reason I'm so upset and confused about this is because before I even brought up the idea of finding a place together, he wasn't even considering moving out. He's telling me moving out is something he felt like he needed to do because it would help him grow up and be mature. I was really looking forward to being closer to him and now he's going to be farther away than he already was.

Now we've been fighting so much the past week because he's been so excited about moving out that it feels like he's been overlooking my feelings. He's saying he wants me to be excited for him but I can't because I just feel like he doesn't care how excited I was to possibly be moving in with him and having my dreams crushed. 

He moved in yesterday (this has all taken place in the past week and 1/2 by the way so it's just been so much to take in). Last night we got into a huge fight and he wanted to break up with me because he couldn't handle all of my drama, but we eventually made up.

I want to be happy for him, I really do, and I know that if we stay together it's just something I'm going to have to get used to. I just still feel so hurt by him making such a quick decision as big as this, shortly after we were making plans to live together. I just feel like that's not the way a decision like that should be handled in a serious relationship.

Am I wrong for feeling upset about this still? Does anyone have any advice for some way I could get over this or what I should do?",06Jun2018,1
5,"I graduated high school about 2 weeks ago. Took a basic electricity course in high school and, without giving it a ton of thought, decided early on into the program that I would pursue becoming an Electrician after high school.

The college process was overwhelming to me, and well, I’m a bit of an introvert anyway.

I thought this would be fine, I’ve heard from many that it’s pretty good money. I got myself some gear, found a company, and sent it. 

We’re about midway through my second week and I’m not super into it. I’m on construction sites, it’s loud, it’s dirty, there’s smoke &amp; sh*t everywhere. On top of that, I haven’t even really done any wiring, I don’t feel like an Electrician. Sure, that’s to be expected in the beginning, you’re the grunt, the gopher, whatever, but I feel like I have more opportunities than my peers and I don’t want to hold myself back.

I’m not closing the door on college, not at all, I just need to figure out what’s the best path for me. I’m not super good at math, which is important, but nonetheless, interests include: computers, I’ve thought about getting into computer sciences, airplanes, that would probably be a tough one, but sometimes I’ll see an airplane in the sky and I’m like, ‘damn, that’s cool.’ Electricity is cool too I just don’t like the construction aspect. There’s residential, I’m considered commercial, there’s service, but from what I’ve heard commercial pays the best. 

So to give you guys something to work with, I’m a male, 18 years old, I like electricity, computer sciences, airplanes, business/entrepreneurial, not great at math, and I’m not closing the door on college just yet. However it’s worth noting, with it being the summer time, I’ve probably missed my window for any sort of 4-year university (at least for the fall) and would likely be attending a community college at first. I think that covers about everything. Thanks. ",06Jun2018,2
6,"So I'm 20 years old, in college and I had a part time job at a Burger King (first job) for about four months. I recently quit because I had trouble adjusting to the environment. It was super fast paced, I screwed up orders, my manager had no patience, and it was just physically and mentally draining. Also doesn't help that I have some lame anxiety disorder.

Anyways, I start working tomorrow at a DD's Discounts retail store and I'm having bad flashbacks in fear of also screwing up at this job as well. On one hand, it's not fast food, but I also don't really know what to expect. I would really appreciate some tips revolving around what a typical day at a retail store is like and some stuff I should avoid doing as a newbie.",06Jun2018,2
7,"I'm a 21 year old female who's the youngest in my immediate and extended family and for some reason either never took an interest or had an opportunity to ""watch"" a small child on my own. I have a combined total of less than 12 hours spent alone with a child, if not half that. 

I now work at a foster and adoptive parent training center that regularly has children, and I'm sometimes called in to watch 1\-12 of them at once and find that I have no idea what to say back to them when they speak to me and I usually come off awkward.

I swear some of the older kids can smell my fear, today one was helping me and then turned on me and ran to the computer (which he wasn't supposed to touch).

8,"I’ve been moody and crying for the past week because I’m graduating high school soon. Today was the last day of classes, and we all broke down crying. It hurts. I’m going to be leaving so much behind, having so many regrets. And some of these people, today was basically the last time I’ll see them. I just hate losing things. I hate change. I feel hollow and empty.

10,"Looking back on it now it seems stupid but here it goes:

In high school I noticed myself suddenly finding this girl attractive. Not just attractive but amazing and beautiful beyond words. She had long brown hair and deep beautiful eyes and was such a kind and funny person. I couldn’t help myself but steal glimpses of her I was infatuated. One lesson I remember she came to sit next to me, she would always make innuendo type jokes about certain things being ‘stiff’ or ‘hard’ and look at me then giggle. She always complimented my physique etc. I don’t know if she was interested in me or just flirtatious. I never took it further.

12,"Hello Reddit, 
So the situation seems to be that my overall personality is just....shitty? I'll be honest, I'm trying to decode this argument I am having with my friend and I can't really understand it... which I guess is also part of the reason she's so pissed. We've known eachother for over 7 years, this isn't the first argument we've had but I honestly am having a hard time understanding what she wants from me.

We started the spat when she said I didn't give 100% to our friendship. I can understand her explanations for those and I suppose thats fine. But she wants me to fix it, or show how I would fix it...and I really honestly don't know how to do that; I want to, but I don't know how. Not just...POOF make it happen or show some proof that I can. I've discussed it, I've promised, I've taken note of the problems but none of those are what she seems to be looking for. I'm not trying to cover my dirty tracks and just pacify, I""m just genuinely trying to figure out what I should do. Has anyone ever had a friend/girlfriend/boyfriend they've not been there for, and how would you apologize and start the ground work to fix it? She says I haven't been there 100% and essentially that I'm pesimistic and I get that or critical and don't notice the times where she really wants something from our relationship (Like to do something, etc) until she's practically screaming about it; and I get that, but I'm not sure...what I'm supposed to do to make her believe I want to work on that.",06Jun2018,1
13,"One of my close friends had cerebral palsy (his intelligence is fine but he walks with a limp). We both recently graduated from the same university program and we've both been struggling to find a job. We've been helping each other with resumes and stuff.

I should point out that he's gotten writing and media jobs in the past despite his disability, but the program would just be another option he could look into.

15,"I have this friend and at the last school dance I was supposed to go to her house and this was for 3 reasons. 1) When she asked her mom her mom said she didn' t know and sounded stressed 2) I didn' t feel to great 3) She had been ignring me for her boyfriend all night (In order of importance to me). Anyway, that was Friday and today at first she seemed first then in class we are partners on something and whenever I tried to help she would say, ""You' re so stupid"" or "" You're so annoying"" But she's my friend and I understand she could be stressed because of all our tests coming up so I let it go. At our school there is a room between the two cafeterias with two tables and chairs that my friend and I including my main friend sit at. We usually sit at the table all alone but today wanted to sit with everyone else so I suggested we push the two tables together to make a big table and there would be enough space for all 11 of us. When I was pushing the tables together my friend who has been giving me problems looked at me and said. "" They are so annoying why do you even like them"" and walked out. I get she doesn't like 1 or 2 of them but I don't like a lot of her friends and I never say anything like that to her. ( One of her other good friends doesn't like me and when I'm around they both ignore me even if I went to them specifically to talk to my friend or if the other girl walks up to us.)

16,"Long story short took some summer classes to try and catch up on credits and decided to take a continuation of my statistics class. Mind you I got a A in the previous class. The class im in now is stats 103 applied statistics and it requires heavily the use of a computer program for the class. This semester the class took on a new program called JMP. Last week was the first week of the class and of the 30 computers in the class 4 of them didnt have the program for the first 4 days. On the 5th day I was finally able to get a hold of it for the remainder of the class after getting the teacher to help me set it up. 

Now my dilemma: In those first 4-5 days we moved pretty quickly through the material as they condense a 5-6 month course into 1 month. Majority of the kids that used the program from the get go are pretty well off in the class at the moment meanwhile I am completely lost. Worst part is we have online homework and tests requiring the use of this application and I have zero clue on how to get through it as I wasn't able to really learn much on the days I didn't have access to the program. Yesterday I was sick so I missed class and today I spoke with my professor and voiced my concerns about the class to which he told me ""Yeah well this is a fairly new program so I have no real material on it and I'm still learning it myself you can try searching it up online and see if you can learn it there. It's a a fairly easy to use program once you get the hang out of it but you need to be here for that to happen"" Well fucko I was here but you dumbasses at this school made it so that I wasn't able to use this program. Now I'm unable to find information online on how to get these tasks done and today when I went to try and drop the class and get a refund they pretty much told me I'm out of luck because yesterday was the last day for refunds. I'm at my ends whit here trying to understand how this fucking college continually tries to fuck me righteously like this. I don't know what to do and need some help, advice or suggestions as to how I can go about this. If I had the chance I would drop the class now and retake it in the fall but since I can't get any money back I'm pretty much at a loss here as to what I can do. The teacher suggested going to the math help center but majority of these fucks don't know how to use the programs themselves and the part that irks me the most is his assumption that my one day of missed class resulted in me falling behind when my sole issue stems from not having the program in the first place. I'm so far behind on this fuckin shit and stressed from this that I have no clue what the fuck I should do here. ",06Jun2018,1

18,"So my dad is currently out of the country for the next few weeks, and I need some advice on a moral dilemma. For the past ten years we've had a pet parrot at home. My dad claims it to be his ""baby"" but he constantly neglects it and forgets to feed it or clean its cage for days at a time. This means that the rest of us at home have to care for this parrot, when none of us want to have it as a pet. We've talked to our dad multiple times about giving the parrot away to a friend, or even away to a humane society so a loving family can have it but he refuses and does not want to hear any more about it. The parrot stays in its cage 95&amp;#37; of the time, and when it is let out, it just sits on top of it and does not get the mental or physical stimulation it requires to stay happy and healthy. Its feathers look ruffled and overall, it does not look like it is in good shape.

Since my dad is out of the country, me and my brother were thinking of giving the parrot away to the humane society and telling my dad that it died. The parrot is old, so it wouldn't be a total shock if it died, but we're worried he will find out and be extremely mad at us, and we also feel like it is wrong to give his parrot away, even though he does not treat it properly. We feel like we shouldn't make the decision for him, but he will not even listen to what we have to say whenever we discuss giving it away.

What do you guys think? Should we give the parrot away and just tell him that it died? Or continue to let the bird be neglected at home. Thanks for all your input.

22,"Hi, I am posting for my friend, Reed, who has been stressing about something for some time now. Lets say one of Reed's childhood friends, Derrik, which Reed essentially never speaks with anymore and lives in different cities, discovers an offensive snapchat screen-shot he took of Derrik over 4 years ago. The photo is a selfie of him smiling in a dark room, with his face visible from the chin up to his eyes. Unlike Snapchat screenshots today, there is no username watermark in the photo. The snap is without a name. The photo has a single text, which is the N word over Reed's face. Because of how old the photo is, the screenshot has a subtle resemblance to Reed, but is by no means that clear of an image to Reed today.

When Derrik discovered the photo, he was with Reed's close friend, Jax. Derrik sent the photo to Jax. Jax then sent the photo to Reed and jokingly called him racist. When Reed saw the photo, he had to look at it for several seconds to even recognize himself because of how dated the screenshot was and the fact there was not an accompanying username. Reed then became worried and proceeded to call Jax and spoke with him and Derrik on speaker-phone. Derrik asked them to both delete the photo, which they then both complied with and Jax earnestly stated that, ""We understand"" and that he knows that Reed ""Cares a lot about his future now' and proceeded to delete the photo.

That was now 4 months ago. Since that time, Reed has a bright future but has battled with persistent, paranoid visions about the photo for some reason not actually being deleted and becoming leaked and destroying his academic career and a future that Reed works extremely hard for. Reed has asked Jax several times for reassurance that the photo is gone and if he ever has anything to worry about it, and Jax has assured him every time. Reed is the farthest thing away from being a racist and takes great pride and fascination in making friends of all backgrounds, cultures, and ethnicities. Anyone that knows Reed also knows this about him.

Can Reed stop festering over this every single day? If this outdated, nameless photo were leaked for some reason by getting into the hands of the wrong person or betrayal by one of the friends, would everything that Reed has honestly worked so hard for be shattered? If someone wanted to ruin Reed's life and future, could they even with this snapchat?",06Jun2018,1
24,"I’ve been living in my current apartment about a month. Although I requested a first-floor, I wound up in a second-floor. But that’s another story. 

During my first week here, I came home after a 7-4 workday to a note on my door saying my dog had been barking all day. Walked inside and I realized my dog was out; I must have forgotten to lock his crate. This was the first time he had ever been out all day (and the last). I wrote a note back and left it on my door because I wasn’t sure who wrote it. I apologized and explained what happened and asked them to let me know if it happened again.

Fast forward a week or so to a Saturday. I ran a few errands and was gone for less than 2 hours and received this note:
“Your dog has been barking for over an hour and letting him run at night or in afternoon is making me and my daughter a nervous wreck. Even when you walk heavy it sounds like you’re coming through the ceiling. If it doesn’t stop we will have to report it to the office. Try to be respectful of other people. The man next door was also complaining.”

I immediately got online and repurchased a bark collar I had used before and then called the main office and explained that I had gotten a note that my dog had been barking and I was taking steps to correct the issue because I understand that would be annoying. Bark collar arrived, problem has been solved. 

The next Monday around 9:30 AM, I gave my dog a treat and he ran to his bed with it (maybe a 3-second run across the room) and the neighbor downstairs started banging on the ceiling.

This past Sunday at 2 PM, I was putting together a piece of furniture in my apartment (because....I live here??) and the last five minutes required me to use a hammer (One of those crappy pressboard shelves). I got through about half the hammering and then she started banging on the ceiling, in sync with my hammering. I didn’t stop because, again, I live here.

At what point do I file a complaint? I am anxious just ~being~ in my apartment. My dog rarely runs inside (he has “run” for maybe a total of 2 minutes in our entire time living here-we’re talking 10 second bursts of energy). 

I’m at a loss. Tired of feeling unwelcome in my own home. You live in apartment, lady. I’m not jumping up and down at all hours of the night or doing major construction projects. I’m just living.

Moved over to the ladder on wire climb, went up the first time cautious, but belted off and leaned back no problem. Second time I went 1/4 way up, came down, adjusted the ladder so it didn’t feel like it was tilted and went straight up, belted off but couldn’t lean back hands free this tome.

29,"Hey reddit, I've been dealing with this for quite some time now, but today it's gotten really out of hand.

Let me start by giving you some background about me an my mom

I'm a 19 year old guy, living away from home sharing an apartment with a friend from highschool, my mom pays for my part of the rent (which I'm extremely thankful for) because my mom got remarried, and sold our house and she agreed to use some of that money to help me.

Recently we've came up with a plan for her to get me a car, but I'd have to get a job so I can pay for the insurance and gas. She forced me to put aside a certain amount of dollars for that, and a certain amount to put in my savings account (I didn't agree with this, but I really want a car so I did), and that left around 10\-30 dollars for my own personal expenses (excluding groceries).

Anyways my mom has always been on my ass for spending too much money, and not saving enough. For example I got a college refund check one time, and she immediately transferred all the money to my savings, and when I asked her why, she said ""You dont need all that money in your checkings."" Like ?? I didn't feel like arguing so I just accepted it.

But anyways fastforward this week. My dad (whom I have little to no contact with) texted me asking how I was doing and told me he deposited 300 dollars into my ""bank account"". He never mentioned which account  he deposited the money to (checkings or savings) and it turns out he put the money into my savings which I dont have access to. Since I don't talk to my dad I asked my mom if she could transfer that money to my checkings, and she refused. And I'm like that's literally not your money you have no right to be telling me I cant have that money. She kept refusing and threatening to stop paying for my apartment. She kept saying how I like to spend money, when really I just want money on my account.

Truthfully though I want to use a part of those 300 dollars, to buy me a herb vaporizer. But my mom also watches what I spend my money on. So now I cant even buy that because my mom is all against weed and if she finds out I bought something like that, she'd kill me and definitely actually stop paying for my rent.

So I really don't know what to do, my mom always does stuff like this, and she starts acting all crazy telling me shes sick and shes gonna die soon (shes literally only 48..). I told her today that she needs help, because no one should act like that.

Thanks for reading, and I'd appreciate any form of advice or criticism really, sometimes I do feel like I'm spoiled but I dont know. Am I in the wrong?",06Jun2018,2

The mood visibly darkens when she is around and our entire family does everything they can to avoid being around her.   


My brother is quite possibly the most passive person on the planet, which he inherited from my father.  Making most of this fall on my shoulders because no one has the courage or ability to face the situation head on and confront my brother about what a terrible person she is and how we all wish they would get divorced. 

One of the biggest problems is that she self harms. She threatens to kill or hurt herself to control and manipulate my brother. She has cut herself a few times during their relationship for various reasons, causing scares and chaos for the family and creating huge medical bills for my brother.  Making it even more difficult to deal with is the fact that she refuses to get help, she will not seek counseling or medication. 

I don't know what to do. I don't know what to say to my overly passive brother that will help him, or make him understand how toxic and harmful she is. I am admittedly afraid to hurt my brother and sister in laws feelings but this is getting out of hand. Someone needs to say something, and no one ever does.  I guess it's up to me to be that person but I don't know how.  I am hoping someone out there might have some advice, words or encouragement, or stories for me.  

tl;dr  Brother is in a toxic and dangerous relationship. My family wants them to get divorced but no one knows what to say or how to approach it.",06Jun2018,1
31,"I walked into my broken in house yesterday afternoon to find my place trashed, electronics ripped off the shelves, HD's taken, Pelican case full of $6000 worth of Canon L glass. I mean, I'm not only pissed about the event but I am trying to process it all as well. 

Is there anyway I can track the guy via my Apple TV 4K? It is signed in to my Apple ID? Is there a way I need to sign it? 

He didn't take stuff I know how to track him but my mind is spinning.

32,"Hey all, I have a low budget recording rig I set up that I want to share. A kind of DIY with a video of me playing guitar running a soundtest. I have several pics and 1 video, how should I go about it? I appreciate the insights, thanks!",06Jun2018,1
33,"When I simply ask my mom a simple question or tell her a simple story, she always has to relate it to my dad and it always has to be a negative. I could be talking about how it’s cute that a couple is holding hands, and she will bring up the time my dad left her when she had my sister. Many times she even repeats these stories. I understand that she needs someone to talk to about it, but she already has friends who she rants to about him. I believe 5-10 of them, but she still shit talks about him with my sister and I. 

Recently, my dad left the state to go to work in a city that he always wanted to live in. My sister, mom, and I didn’t want to go and he got mad and blamed my mom. He said that she was brainwashing us or plotting against him to make him lose us. Heck, I don’t even want to stay in the town I am in. I don’t want to stay or live with mom or dad at all. I applied to colleges, and I got into NYU and I was so excited, but my parents, specifically, my mom said no, because of being too young, sexual activity, and Nicodemus saying that there will be a city that will be destroyed, which she believes it will be New York, same with the book of Revelation. I graduated a year early from High School (I’m 17)  and I mentioned to my parents my goals and where I want to go to university. Once I showed them my acceptance list, my mom tells me that I have to go to the closest one that is on the list. I try having a sit down conversation, but it’s no use. So many people thought it was stupid, not only kids, but other adults as well.  I can’t even live in a dorm at the commuter university, I have to live at home, which means I have to commute back and forth to where my mom, sister, and I are moving to and enroll there for at least a year. I’m hoping that I can transfer out and leave afterwards. I tried compromising, since NYU is out of state and tried to go for a university that is only 1 hour and 30 minutes away and is the best in the state. She still didn’t budge, leading me to have to have no choice but to follow what she says. 

I come from a strictish household where I wasn’t allowed to go outside unless it was on my front porch, which made me barely make any friends and lose many. When I could go outside, I couldn’t go outside during the weekdays even when homework was completed, only the weekends. My only activities really consisted of church and school. I wasn’t allowed to cross the street to just buy something from the CVS or The Yogurt shop unless it was with my older sister who is 8 years older or my mom, even though I was a teenager. I’m not allowed to celebrate Halloween. I can’t be on the phone on a call with friends when it’s 12 or 1 even during the summertime. I can’t go over friends’ houses, even if my mom has met the parent and there’s nothing wrong with them (unless it’s a birthday party or graduation party). I especially can’t be at friends’ houses if they live with a dad, uncle, grandpa, older cousin,  or older brother. If my friend is lesbian or bisexual I can’t go to their house. I can’t go over a guy friend’s house (not too big of a deal, I can understand this one a bit) . I can’t sleepover because of the potential of me getting touched by somebody or magic getting performed. I couldn’t go to a birthday party because it was masquerade theme and my parents said it was evil and dealt with voodoo/witchcraft. I can’t be friends with my bisexual friend because apparently it looks bad and people will think that I’m her girlfriend. Also, because she’s not necessarily a believer in God, and she’s living a sinful lifestyle. 

Every time I try to compromise or let my mom know that I’m maturing in a respectable way, she always puts me down and says well I’m talking too much (even though we barely discussed) and says that she’s getting mad and that we won’t be continuing the conversation. It’s not like I’m not putting in any work, and I’m far from disrespectful. I provided evidence against her reasons why, and she says you know what I don’t care you aren’t going. I’m hoping that when I move to go to the commuter university that I can get a little more freedom, but honestly I doubt it. When I try to make my own decisions and my mom doesn’t like it she will try to shame me by saying who will provide for you financially or see when you go there you will not have a warm bed or good food to eat. If that’s not enough, she will find a way to not allow me to go. If she has a bad dream about a situation I’m in or a place that I’m going to I can’t go. One time she had a dream that I got raped because I went to a club, and she started to say because I wore leggings. She talked about how she was screaming in the dream and said that it was no place a Christian should be. She told me to stop wearing these leggings that I wear (which I cover with a long shirt and make sure to cover my butt).

I been talking about what some peers of mine do (no illegal things or immoral things, that the typical parents would be cool with, and she overacts). I know when I officially become an adult it won’t get better and I love my sister but I don’t want to be in her spot. She barely goes out, my mom always meddles in her business, and she’s too dependent. She’s going to be 30 in the next couple of years.  There’s this guy who is her friend who she doesn’t like because of his metal apparel and because he’s not Christian. My sister doesn’t even have a crush on him, but it’s part of the reason my mom wants to move, then he won’t be in our lives as much or then my sister won’t date him. 

I’m sorry for my rambling, but I guess I just want some discussion points or pointers for anyone who has gone through what I have gone through. I don’t know if mentioning that she’s Haitian and Christian will mean anything. I love my mom and I know that she has sacrificed a lot to bring us to where we are now, but I just wish that she wasn’t as hectic as she is. I’m blessed with shelter, a roof over my head, and food, but I feel like she’s doing too much. ",06Jun2018,1

He's always quiet around me but he saw an instagram account I made that had reeaaally fucked up and edgy humor. I thought it was funny and then i let go of it, but my sister still had it on her phone although she never used it. He found it one day and he threatened her and made her feel like shit about making such rude jokes and I had to say it was JUST ME (even though me and my sister made it.) TO THIS DAY he still doesn't like me.

 Also, her phone is at the apple store so she lets him open her snapchats. I sent her a joke on it about something that sounded sexual (It wasn't.) Her texts were opened up on my computer and I couldn't help but read them. (I know this is so invasive and rude but as a sister I want to look out for her and make sure shes in a happy relationship and not with someone abusive) 

Hes so rude to her on texts but shes OBSESSED with him and getting back at his exes. She cuts over him, it really scares me. She said she'd kill herself if they broke up. I told my mom and she just brushed it off. 

Anyways, from her texts she does ""tabs"" (I don't know what that means, can someone explain?) And xanax and weed with him. He obviously pressured her to do this cause shes normally not like that.

Also he said that he saw my snapchat and he literally fought with her like ""fuck you why do you let people send you perverted shit"" like.. im her sis... not some random dude...

Hes such a dickhead and i dont want my sister to be with him because hes so rude to her and i think he verbally abuses her behind closed doors. they almost broken up like 500 times and he always threatens her

• Study math/ela/science for next year in my older sister's ACT books

I catch him staring and trying to touch her bum all the time, it’s incredibly uncomfortable.

I didn’t know what to do so I didn’t bring it up. 

Today we were hanging out with some other friends, and someone asked him and a good friend of his how they became friends. The friend of his answered, “well a good friend of mine really liked him and I wanted to hook them up. So I invited him to sit with both her and I at lunch and we ended up really liking each other. I basically stole him from her.” That friend was me, and all of this is true. 

Then, out of the blue, the guy I’m into says, “yup. I know who it was.” He didn’t say anything else. 

So if he knows how I feel, why hasn’t he made a move? Why did he even say that when no one asked? Was he trying to subtly say something to me? If so, what? I’m at a loss here.

42,"This has been an ongoing issue for the past 6 months or so. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I live in an apartment complex that allows small animals as pets, as long as you pay a pet deposit and additional monthly pet fee. The neighbor below me had a cat and dog but was not paying extra to have either pet. When confronted by the office and told she would have to pay, she claimed the cat was not hers because she didn't want to pay extra every month for it. When she claimed it wasn't hers, they sent in animal control to try and catch the cat with raccoon cages without success. She abandoned the cat and stopped feeding it (but would still let it sleep inside for some reason) and over a few months the cat lost a significant amount of weight. Everyone in the complex knows it's her cat \- despite her neglect. The cat still follows her when she walks her dog. It's obvious that she is/was the owner. But the cat started to look sickly so my neighbor next\-door and I started feeding the cat regularly because winter was starting. The cat would still sit outside the owner's door and sleep on the patio beside her apartment so we put blankets in a cardboard box and she eventually started sleeping in that to keep warm. The neighbor next to me continued feeding her through the winter.

Fast forward past winter. It's now June and temperatures have been around 85 degrees most days. Neighbor next to me still feeds her and the box is still there for her to rest in. Today, someone called the office on her and reported her for ""feeding feral cats"". They told her to cease/desist feeding the cat or face eviction. As far as who reported her, I'm guessing it could have been the exterminators that made their yearly visit to the apartments last week. Everyone living nearby had no problem with it (or so it seemed). 

My boyfriend says it's none of our business but I feel for my neighbor. She cares deeply for all animals and it really affects her to see an animal in distress. I've seen her cry over dead rabbits and nurse a baby squirrel back to health. As far as I'm concerned, the cat isn't feral. It's a kind, albeit older, cat and the neighbor next to me worries that calling animal control will end with the cat being euthanized. She would take the cat in but she already has a cat that isn't friendly with other animals. I've tried asking friends and family if anyone would consider caring for the cat, but no luck. I have a dog that is indifferent about the cat but my boyfriend doesn't want to get involved and/or take the cat.

To anyone still reading, thank you. I know this is long\-winded but I'm trying not to miss any details. 

TLDR; Neighbor A had cat and abandoned cat to avoid paying additional monthly pet fee. Neighbor B and I fed cat and gave it a place to sleep. Someone reported Neighbor B to the apartment complex and B was told to cease/desist feeding the cat, as they claimed the cat was feral.

Is there anything that I can do to help my neighbor in this situation? If not, is there anything that she should/can do?",06Jun2018,1

48,"It sucks when people don’t understand, or refuse to understand.

I care about my mom and everyone else in my family. Though they don’t understand what I’m going through, I go to therapy for depression and anxiety and while my parents take me there, they don’t seem to understand what depression and anxiety are.

My mom and my older sister both think that depression is just something made up and that I should just snap out of it. I try to explain to my mom that depression isn’t just feeling sad all the time and that it’s a chemical imbalance and other things that affect someone. For example I stress a lot about school and we’ve had some pretty big arguments regarding it, as well as I tend to feel less energy most of the time and I don’t really like doing stuff like going outside or socializing (mainly because I have no friends in real life).

Whenever I try to explain it, my mom just says that I’m not the only that suffers and that she suffers her own problems too and that everyone’s a human being so I should stop being sad.

Right now I’m at my final week of school and I tried explaining to her that I’m exempt from most of my exams (I only have two left and so I just have to go one day), tomorrow, I’m exempt from both classes that exams would’ve taken place, and those two classes are the only ones for the day as students leave early. I tell her I’m not required to go as I’ll be excused, however she thinks I should go in order to not be marked absent? Like, I just told you that I’d be excused from those classes?

And thus we argued, me trying to explain to her, and she called me a “male chauvinist” out of nowhere, I never mentioned anything offensive towards females. She calls me that everytime we argue, the only way I found about that term was because she said it to me.

Also she compares me to other people in my family like my little sister, who goes to school everyday (I have attendance issues and it’s affected me) and as well as my cousin who’s already graduated recently.

What do I do? I want to tell my therapist about this (I haven’t told her because I didn’t want CPS to get called or something), I hope she can explain to my mom but I suppose even if she tries she still won’t understand, or of course, refuse to do so.

49,"So I currently have two options that I can make and have had people that I am close with telling me to make the other choice that I want to do as it is ""better"" in their eyes.

 I am in my senior year of college and have changed my major a couple of times, (as most college kids do), and had decided on double majoring in marketing and accounting. I definitely enjoyed marketing more, but had felt that accounting was more challenging and would be a better option as marketing can be seen as a sort of schmooze major. Well, after a couple semesters of accounting courses, and just sort of coasting through some of the courses because I disliked them so much, I am at this sort of fork in the road. 

My boyfriend of 3 years attended a coding bootcamp a few years ago (he was a music major in college and made a full career change), and his career has been booming, not to mention he's always working on SUPER interesting projects and actually moved to SF not too long ago for a sweet job opportunity. I started coding myself over a year ago, and have continued to study with intentions on doing a bootcamp myself. I just find software development fascinating and much more interesting than accounting and business, and could really see myself going down that path. 

So, I have the option to graduate early this summer with just a Marketing degree and then attend a bootcamp, or finish up the Accounting degree at the end of the year and THEN attend the bootcamp. I should mention that my dad is really supportive of my education and will pay for the fall semester, so that is not an issue. So, I have been told that just finishing up the accounting route would be ideal, but I REALLY dislike it, although I do understand that it can be seen as more marketable for other business positions that aren't completely accounting related... 

In the grand scheme of things I want to do a coding bootcamp. I just don't know how I should finish up my college education and move forward. Is it even worth that double major when I know that I want to pursue something different anyways? 

I REALLY appreciate anyone's opinion, I honestly feel like I have developed a lot of emotional ties to this problem to solve it logically and could truly use some outside perspective. ",06Jun2018,1

54,"Hi everyone.

I feel a bit weird writing this post because it is very personal stuff and painful to think about, but I’m starting to really question my brother and what he’s really like. Sorry for this massive post, but I feel like I need to mention it all to make it all make sense.

Some info about him:

· He’s in his early\-to\-mid 20s 

· has just finished college and is trying to find a job 

· He has never had a job in his life (even a basic waiter/service job) 

· He has never had a girlfriend

· He has no friends aside from myself and my girlfriend 

· He lives at home with my parents (who have money and buy everything for him)

When he was a kid he was very happy\-go\-lucky and personable. Super friendly and always laughing, but when he turned around 15 his personality changed a lot. He became very brooding and serious. He liked to talk about philosophy and question existence, but did it in a very dramatic and cringey way (what you would expect from an edgy teenager). 

He cut off all of his friends and became obsessed with being seen as “smart”. Now, he is an intelligent person, but he would sink almost 100&amp;#37; of his time into studying and working towards achieving highly. To the point where he wouldn’t even sit with his friends during recess and lunch at school, but would go to the library and study. He studied all weekend too and would get hyper\-focused on studying and doing well on tests etc. This was HIGHLY encouraged by my dad, who is basically the same kind of person (no social life, only works, values success a lot etc).

Now this isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it felt really extreme and he didn’t seem really all that happy. He also became very blunt and kind of an asshole to my mom and to other people. He wouldn’t laugh at their jokes, he’d stare at them when they talked and he was also really critical of other people and their achievements. Always tearing them down.

His personality almost felt like he was trying to act like Dr.House from House MD. Or like ‘L’ from deathnote (if you’ve ever seen those shows). Like he was trying to come off like this genius who is so intelligent that they only know how to converse using pure blunt logic.

Ironically, in the face of all this obsessive studying, he actually failed his last year of high school and had to repeat it at a community college. This drove him deeper into isolation and intensified his personality traits. He became more of a blunt asshole to people and went out even less. My parents justified his asshole behaviour as him just being “awkward” but “very smart”. Basically buying into the tortured genius persona.

One thing that showed the depth of his obsession with being the best…He actually graduated top of his class the second time round and was given a government grant of $1000 as a prize. When he was told this news, he was pissed off that he wasn’t the best in the STATE (only his class) and didn’t want to go to the ceremony. 

He went to college to study pre\-med, saying he wanted to become a neurosurgeon. He didn’t get any job throughout college (because my parents paid for everything) and my dad later confided in me that he didn’t push him to get a job because he “didn’t want to distract him from achieving his goals”. Basically he saw my brother as a rocketship on the way to the moon and a job as just some meteors in the path.

He wasn’t able to get into medicine at the end of his course and struggled to pass. He later admitted that he just wanted to be a neurosurgeon for the “prestige” of the job and not because he was actually interested. We decided to all have a talk and ask him what he really wanted to do, and he kept saying stuff like “I don’t want a boring life at a desk job. I would hate to be like my cousin John, his life is such a failure to me, it’s so…normal”. Keep in mind, this cousin owns his own law firm and has an awesome family and is a great guy!

His pre med degree gave him lab experience, so he has been trying to get a ‘lab’ job for the last 6 months with no success. He stays at home and occasionally hangs out with my girlfriend and I.

During this past 6 months, he decided he should start dating. He made some profiles on some dating apps and then met some women just for sex. 

This is where it gets weird. 

Now before this time, he had never even kissed a girl or been friends with one. This all changed when one night he went to this girls house who he was talking to on tinder. 

He had sex with her and then she went for a shower. He left the house without saying anything, drove home and deleted her number. She would have literally gone for a shower, then walked out to no one there and a then no one answering the phone. This creeped me the fuck out and made me think that he might have some serious issues with empathy.

When I told him that was fucked up he just laughed.

Another time he went on a date with some girl at a bar. He got drunk before going there and then started talking to this girl. He said “ughh her teeth were all fucked up and she was just embarrassing to be seen with.” He said that she kissed him in the bar and then he stood up and just walked away. LITERALLY SAID NOTHING AND WALKED AWAY.

Then he went to his car (still drunk) and sped off home. He said that he had this paranoid thought that someone filmed him kissing her and put it online, so he spent the next 4 days googling terms that would match his experience to see if he was filmed. What the fuck.

He recently told me that he is looking to join the Air Force (which is the most difficult and longest commitment of all the armed forces jobs), yet he can hardly drive a car.

55,"So I have the option to go to another high school which I was going to go to at first.

I wanted to go there because of the variety of options for classes, activities and etc.. I was kind of forced by my parents to go to this school that I go to now, but I started to like it, I also like the other school as well.. I need advice on what I should make my decision based on or what I should consider.. any kind of advice would help, I know this decision is ultimately up to me but I don’t what I should do here, I don’t want to leave the friends which I currently have in the school I attend, but I also don’t want to just leave my friends at the other school either..

58,"Hi there,

I was wondering if somebody might be able to provide insight into whether the following books exist, or if you have any alternative suggestions.

I am looking to improve my wellness as a whole - just not feeling quite like myself these days and hoping to get myself into a positive and healthy mindset and routine.  I work long hours and have a 2+ hour commute to work every day, so find myself pretty exhausted when I get home... which is likely the cause of my mental exhaustion.

Things I am interested in reading more about: self-reflection/creating a positive mindset, generating more “mental energy”, being more present mentally, learning how a healthy diet/active lifestyle impacts the above mentioned  (prefer alternative workout methods to gym considering my limited “home” time), perhaps a journal for everyday/week.

Thank you in advance!

59,"So I am in the middle of switching jobs. As part of the new company’s onboarding process I am required to complete an I-9 to confirm my US citizenship/eligibility to work. 

Part of this requires a Notary Public to be a witness in verifying and confirming copies of my identity (drivers license, SSN, etc.), with the last step being to “submit” photo copy proof of said ID docs to the new company HR team.

One of my friends and ex-coworkers is a Notary Public. So I give everything to her that’s required: Notary completion steps and photo copies of my ID documents as required by the I-9 instructions. For this last part I gave her the copies on a flash drive and told her for security reasons to not email these docs openly &amp; to delete them after doing what was needed, to which she agreed.

Well, in completing everything she ends up directly emailing the HR guy the unencrypted PDF copies of my drivers license and SS card, with the file name being my name and what the file pertains to.

The bright side: I know everyone involved on both parties. I know both her and the HR recipient are on encrypted WIFI networks using secure email servers.

60,I have had 3 different school advisors since I have been attending college. Not one has given me a 4 year plan until this year. I am going to be a senior and thought I would be graduating in the spring semester. My advisor has told me I have to take one more class the following fall because I will not have a prerequisite for a class. The previous semester I asked multiple times for another class so I could have 18 credit hours and my advisor was no help. That advisor is no longer at the school. I feel as I am getting scammed into giving the school more money due to their mistake.

61,"hi! so, i started at this job in retail (i work at a grocery store, if this helps at all) almost 4 months ago. i've developed deep feelings for one of my co\-workers. i've managed to make a few friends there already and i've been trying to get close to this one guy that i'll nickname ""x"".  however, i've hardly been given the chance to talk to him since we're always so busy and we have to keep up with customers, etc. i'd say i've only gotten to have 2 or 3 long\-ish conversations with him since i started. i've managed to ask him some questions and gotten to know a few facts and details about him, but that's about it.

recently, i'd say about a month ago, he got promoted. i can see him behind the customer service desk but i don't ever get to talk to him anymore. i can barely even manage to find the time to say hi to him, and the only times i can see him is if i happen to catch him coming into work, leaving, or going on break. he seems very shy and possibly introverted, but that's just from my observations. 

anyways, i've asked many of my closest friends and have considered a bunch of options as to how to approach him. some of the ways i've considered is to possibly write a note about everything i want to say and give it to him (which a couple of my friends found to not be a very good option), to go up to him and say ""hey 'x', i know this is out of the blue but i enjoy talking to you and i'd like to get to know you better, would you be okay with exchanging numbers or snapchats?"" or just going up to him and say ""hey i really like you and i want to get to know you better"", etc etc. the problem is that i don't want to scare him off or come off as too bold or brash. i'm very nervous as to how to go about this, and i'm really not one to ask people out that i don't know too well. i get too much anxiety about it.

(p.s.: i don't know if this helps at all, or if this is just a coincidence (which is pretty damn likely), but during one of our conversations he stuttered a lot while talking to me, and throughout the course of me working there, i manage to catch him looking in my general direction a lot. i've tried to study whether or not the other customer service employees look around as much, and so far i don't see them doing so. i don't know if this is just because he's an observant person, or if he's shy, or if he actually has even a tiny amount of interest in me.)

i know this situation is kind of weird and extremely specific, but i legitimately don't know what to do. i've wanted to ask him out (or get to know him better) for months, but i have social anxiety and i don't want to create an extremely awkward situation for either of us.",06Jun2018,1

64,"I have a few online friends and I just want to be supportive. I find that I distance myself when someone tells me that they have lost someone or when people start ranting to me constantly about their depression. I know its bad, i'm trying to fix it. I just don't always know what to do or say.

A little background

One online ""friend"" (explanation of quotationmarks later) told me he lost his father. This guy bad-mouthed his father constantly and their relationship was strained but he did seem a little sad the day he told me. I didn't know what to say. except ""i'm sorry"" his responce, ""oh my god if I hear im sorry one more time"" 

This is exactly what I was afraid of. Saying the wrong thing, this is why I distance myself. I know people don't want to hear the same thing over and over. And everyone is different. My dilemma: Some people want you to coddle them, let them rant, and have you give them advice. Others want you to just treat them normaly. What am I supposed to do!!?  If you have a  person who wants to be comforted but you treat them normaly, they may get very upset and think that you have no emotion. On the other hand, If you  give advice and show that you feel sorry to a person who just wants to be treated normally, they might get annoyed. 

The 'friend' was toxic and I had been making up ways to get out of the relationship but I just didn't know how. After the day he told me his father died I noticed that whenever he texted me I would reply extremly late or give short answers. I distanced myself and I felt bad for being such a coward but I just am not sure how he wanted things to go after that. Eventually he never replied to the last text I sent and I felt a bit of relief. I was glad that he got tired of me and my one word answers. I also felt bad for feeling happy. 

Another online friend had depression. He constantly complained and ranted to me everyday about how his life was so sad and a classmate did this or that to him or that he cut himself again. I tried to help, I really did, Eventually I grew so tired of hearing the rants. I didn't know what to say. I didn't want to give the same cliche advice that even I didn't use to improve myself. I also didn't want to wind up saying the same thing that everyone else does. I was battling my own demons at the time. I never complained or ranted, I'm far too self conscious of seeming annoying, self centered, or bothersome. Again, I distanced myself until he stopped replying. I felt the same emotions as mentioned earlier. 

tl;dr As the title states, I just want to know how I can be more supportive.  

Now I have an online friend that I really, really like. He never complains but recently he has been extremely busy because a close family member is sick at the hospital. I'm aware of my behavior in the past where I would distance myself. I don't want to do that to him. If he happens to lose this family member or just needs support I really want to know how I can help him, this is what inspired this post.

65,"Ok so here is... basically my life story. (but I need advice (and not my whole life if that makes sense))

So I'm 15 and my mom is an Ex-Scientologist and my dad (and all of his family and friends) are still current Scientologists. This includes my older (half) sister (let's call her Jade) and my (half) brother. (they have a different mom, but the same dad as me) I have a (whole) sister (let's call her Zoe) that is a year younger than me. My mom and dad are divorced and have been since I was in kindergarten and it hasn't affected me at all. 

Ok, so those are the basics. Now the story.

My mom used to be a Scientologist and then something happened and they got divorced and my mom left the church. My mom has never said  WORD about Scientology so that's why I don't know what exactly happened to trigger the divorce. Like I said she doesn't talk about it at all which is strange because she and I always spend long nights talking about conspiracy theorys and stuff. My dad on the other hand only talks about Scientology and same with my older sister and other Scientology friends. I love them both so much and my older sister just had a baby (and another one on the way) that I love so much. I am against the church though and I have seen the crazy amounts of money they spend on courses. At dinner, with my dad, Jade, Zoe and I, he mentioned that he was paying over $20,000 for one of his courses and that was why he couldn't help with paying for Jade's wedding and explained that Scientology was more important than family. Both of my families, my dad, and my mom, aren't super wealthy and my dad is WAY in debt. My dad has recently been trying to get me (and Zoe) to start Scientology and wants me to do a very expensive purification course to start of. I'm trying to pretend to be on board but I do not want to be a part of It at all. One time My dad's friend called him when I was in the car and explained that he was thinking of leaving the church. They are super close but my dad said: ""If you leave I won't make contact with you anymore, you know that right?"" Basically, If you are against the church in any way you are declared a ""suppressive person"" and any Scientologist, including family ""disconnects"" and never sees them again. My mom has been harassed a lot (from what I've seen) as she always get mail and calls from the church and she has always told them to stop. Recently I got home and a lady, who was wearing an outfit from the church, was sitting in my living room talking with my mom. My mom said it was an old friend of hers and I went to my room without a word. I decided to eavesdrop and they were talking about Scientology, but I just got the last bit. I thought my mom was going to rejoin but it sounded like they were shit talking the church but I honestly don't know. Maybe she was considering leaving and knew my mom from when they were both Scientologists and decided to ask for help? I don't know. It freaked me out because recently my dad has been getting Zoe and me more involved in the church and talking about it more than ever, thats why I decided to post this.

Watching my dad and Jade mindlessly following this cult breaks my heart because I love them so much. And the cycle will continue with Jade's son and my nephew and it makes me feel sad and helpless. I also don't know how to say that I don't want to be in the church without getting disconnected from my dad, my older sister, and brother, my nephew, my dad's girlfriend. I am also, not straight, and the church believes homosexuality as a disease and they push conversion therapy to become straight. I came out to my mom, exactly a year ago actually, but it didn't go well. She said it was hormones and denied my sexuality and hasn't talked about it at all since then. She is not only an Ex-Scientologist that still believes in some of the principles of Scientology (because of brainwashing) but also a Christian now and has said things like: ""Marriage is between a man and a woman"" or ""Gay people got AIDS because it's not natural."" and other stuff like that. But mostly she doesn't talk about LGBTQ+ at all. (I'm not out to anyone else) I grew up only knowing about gays from my friends because she never talked about any of that. I still love her though. Same with my dad but he's worse. He says faggot in texting and makes fun of gay people. Also being he's in a church that says being gay is perverted. My dad has been in Scientology since he was 17-20 (i think) and my older sister Jade had been in it since she was born and doesn't know anything else. I don't know what to do. Eventually, I have to say something or I just become a part of the church and never come out. I cant keep my opposition to the church to myself or the fact that I'm gay entire life. I want to get my dad and my older sister out of the church so my nephew doesn't have to go through this vicious cycle and I want to be able to express my self and not get sucked into the church like they are trying to do. But that means a chance of my dad and older sister and everyone on that side disconnecting me and I won't see them again. I need advice because I don't know what to do and I need help.

67,"I am a junior in high school and I recently began dating a freshman girl. As I began to get to know her better I found out something was horribly wrong in her family. Her parents were drug addicts and her father overdosed when she was three and her mother lost custody of her. She lived with her grandparents and then a few years ago moved in with her uncle. Both her grandparents and her uncle are abusive to her but her uncle is far worse. They ground her and her brother (age 16) constantly and beat them with a belt repeatedly until they have bruises. Last night her uncle got her brother sneaking out of the house to smoke weed. He became enraged and barged into her room. He found her Juul and a phone that she wasn’t supposed to have because she had been grounded from it for months. He took the Juul and the phone and put them in his bedroom. She ran into the bedroom a short while later to get the vape and phone but her uncle caught her. He he picked up by the collar of her shirt and slammed her into the grounded. He gave her a black eye and numerous bruises and kicked her out of the house. She walked three miles sock-footed, in the middle of the night, to my house. She didn’t have her phone so she slept in my truck bed all night. I dropped her off at a friends house where she stayed for the next day. Tonight her grandma found her and took her back to her house.

69,"My gf and I are in early twenties and live in apartments. We have these friends couple doors down that consists of a dad that is in his 50's, his son and son's gf that are same age as me and gf. We're all friends, hangout with the dad sometimes, sometimes with the son/gf all good, except till recently. I went out of town for about a week and my gf stayed behind. The dad (let's say John) has been getting creepy. He's lonely, no friends, no ladies in his life or anything. It's been getting worse and he's been expressing that through my gf. For example he keeps telling her how pretty she is and how lonely he is. For example, when I was gone they'd talk out front and half of the conversation would consist of him complimenting how pretty she is, a quarter of convo being how lonely he is and another quarter of him bragging about ridiculous things like getting kicked out of the baseball stadium or cussing out people, etc. It started gradually to where gf and I thought he was just being socially awkward what with no friends, but it's pretty obvious. When I was gone he asked her to go to the pool with him and tried pushing her in, and told her,
""Don't tell anyone we were here, might give off wrong impression"" even though it was public pool with other neighbors around. He even texted her saying,
""Hey I got a secret door to my room if you ever wanna just come over and chill"". But after every weird thing he says he immediately apologizes then says it's because of how lonely he is (annoying circle). 
My gf and I are avoiding him at moment but I'm not sure whether I should confront him and say to back off or tell him to not speak to gf again or what.

I'm in middle of getting it expunged and it should be cleared within a month or 2. I'm afraid of confronting him, we get in a fight and he tells management on me getting gf and I evicted. Not sure if he'd do that or not but he has low temper (not violent though). His son said just don't hangout with him anymore, son's gf doesn't get creeped on and they just think we should avoid him, but Im not sure. Should I make it clear that I know what he's done?

Well, I’m a soon to be college graduate, I attend one of the best unis for my major and have had internships that most people would kill for. 

These are great companies, with great opportunities and great pay. I also have a loving family and girlfriend, plenty of friends, and have (knock on wood it stays the same) never needed anything.

I have an amazing life, which I am EXTREMELY grateful for. By almost all, I have it made, and yet I can’t seem to find a passion or even something I want to do. These large companies always left me unfulfilled, and generally I just did them because well “that’s what you’re supposed to do”

Don’t get me wrong, my family and friends don’t really put any pressure on me, it’s just the way I feel.

Reddit, I don’t know why I chose you to maybe answer my questions, probably because I’m anonymous and I’d hate it if anyone could see what I truly feel. When I talk to my girlfriend or parents about it, they always say that I will figure it out, that I’m still young. They’re probably right, but I just want to have something to look forward to.

72,"Now, I know there are many other adolescents like me that are struggling with the same things. To me, I feel alone in my problems, so, as this subreddit was designed for, let me get some things off my chest.

My mom was a teacher, an amazing one at that. She got teacher of the year 3 years in a row, and still talks to students that she's taught, and I've met a couple of them myself (including my now\-divorced dad). After teaching and getting a job with Title 9, she got very sick. After about a year, we learned that my mom has *adiposis dolorosa* or Dercum's Disease, as it is more often called. Dercum's Disease is an extremely rare disease, affecting people in the mere thousands, if I'm correct, where non\-cancerous fatty tumors wrap around nerves, eventually killing them off (making them hypersensitive) and causing her insane chronic pain. When I first hit puberty, I started shutting myself off more and plunging into the realm of technology, to the point now that everyone in my family says I have an addiction. I was home schooled for a year before because we had moved, but the next year she couldn't do it because her condition worsened. At this time, she met my soon to be step\-dad, who later on was simply a pathological lair and used her for a place to stay in exchange for helping her. After that year of homeschooling, my mom still wanted me to work from home, so I joined an online school. At this point is where things started to get a major turn for the worse. The step\-dad was gone, being arrested for assaulting my mom, and I started school where they sent me a desktop for the year because we were under the poverty line and I barely passed that year because I was constantly bypassing restrictions and playing whatever I wanted. In the middle of this year, though, my mom had started to get more and more angry quicker because of my repeated behaviors. One day she caught me playing a game on a laptop that she had given me, and proceeded to take a hammer to it in front of me while I bawled in the corner. After this, still in the same year, I aced every ACT test but the math one, showing I could clearly do the work easily and have good grades. Near the end of the school year, I was succumbed to a lot of depression surrounding school and my problems and set up a plan to kill myself but my mom found out and sent me to a hospital. At the end of the year, after seeing that the online school didn't work out, I was accepted into the local IB program for middle school. I made a couple of friends and still barely managed to pass. At this point, me and my mom were having semi\-daily fights over schoolwork and technology. Also at the same time, I had gotten medicine that made me manic, medicine that didn't help, and just multiple months without any treatment at all. At this time, I devolved some dangerous coping skills, like completely forgetting any upsetting events and self harm. Next year in the same !B program, the 2017\-2018 school year. I go to the hospital again for suicide, this time for about a month because I had to sit in the ER for some time before somewhere could take me. I saw my grandma pass out from drinking too much alcohol and was placed in the hospital then about a month later she became drunk and I had to yell at her, eventually I left and my mom went off on her. Also this year I've devolved anger issues and have destroyed roughly $2000 worth of technology damage ($1600 of that was at 1 time). In the heat of the moment I will see the technology as a force that is against me and is causing all my problems, so I destroy it. I now have no technology other than a computer I borrowed from a teacher to do work, which I still don't do. A couple weeks ago I did something (but my coping mechanism made me forget it completely) and now my mom keeps harassing me, to the point where I dread coming home. She keeps saying the most mean things she can possibly conceive in an effort to make me change and hits me and throws things at me, because she ""ran out of other options"".

What do I do? If you have any questions, I'll try to answer to the best of my ability, as there are many things I left out that were a bit specific. More specifically, how can I ""change"", and be a good person that does what he's supposed to? I just want to be happy with my mom before she dies, probably before my grandma, and debatably my great\-grandparents who are still alive.",06Jun2018,1
73,"I'm twenty years old and I've essentially been bored out my mind since I was at least twelve\- at that age, though, I had depression/anxiety to keep my mind entertained; now that I'm older, I feel like my depression/anxiety are way less severe, which makes me bored out of my mind constantly. It's like my my anxiety, specifically, was a defense mechanism to keep my mind entertained\- I swear. 

I just can't enjoy anything, currently. Nothing gives me this pleasurable feeling. There are actually only two distinct moments I can say that I felt happy or stimulated in the past year. One was a speech I had to give. I was nervous as shit, but afterwards, I had this euphoric high. The other is when I went hiking to the top of a mountain and was walking near the edge of a cliff. These are literally the only two moments in the last year that this boredom has gone away. However, I can't maintain things like these all the time. I can't constantly be giving speeches to keep myself entertained even though I hate them. I can't be walking along cliffs to feel that sense of fear that makes me feel alive.

I have even avoided relationships since I know I will find that person boring in coming weeks. I'm twenty, a handsome dude who gets approached by a fair amount of girls, but I turn them all down. I just know no of them will keep my interest unless we keep doing insane activities.

I don't enjoy games anymore. I get bored. I don't enjoy reading. I get bored. I don't enjoy hanging out with friends. I get bored. I don't enjoy anything because its all so boring. The thing that kills me, is that this is stuff I want to enjoy. I WANT TO ENJOY THIS STUFF SO BAD BUT I JUST CAN'T. I don't want to be bored of everything in my life like I am now. I realize that I'm bored out my mind, which generates anxiety, which generates me doing MASSIVE amounts of research online, like this.

People keep saying that it might be mild chronic depression. Maybe. Maybe that's a part of it, but that isn't the whole thing. I've been depressed. I've been the furthest a person can go.

Before this incident they had discussed the blue whale challenge and the show 13 Reasons Why, and had expressed admiration for the person behind the bw challenge. In October someone started a rumor that I tried to end my life before (it’s true - 2009, 2011 and 2014 and I have permanent injuries. I’m still possibly bipolar - it’s a lifelong condition - and have considered it but I know better than to actually do it).

They started acting friendly and flirtatious to me. We would sit together every class period. They gradually started introducing morbid topics into the conversation.

One day they asked me “do you ever feel like living isn’t worth it?” and I said “no, not really.” They told me “be honest” and “give in to it.”

Later they asked me to sing along with them. First we sang a nonsense song that goes “do you see the light, do you see the broom, do you see the light at the end of the room.” Then they asked me to sing “do you want to cry, do you want to die.” I said that it was too depressing and then they said that I didn’t understand and was a bully.

They talked about death and suicide every day, and always glorified it. They said that everyone is suicidal but very few people have the courage to go through with it. They said that everyone who says life is worth living is lying or too stupid to know the truth. I made a comment about a celebrity suicide being sad and they said we should be happy for suicide victims as they’re not in pain anymore. One day when I was upset over some issues with friends they made comments about how when you die everyone will love you.

In Spanish class one of them even pulled up a website with instructions on how to kill yourself and showed it to me “in case your finals get too hard.”

I planned a suicide but only took 2500 mg of acetaminophen before panicking and not going through with it. Two days later I planned to suffocate myself with a plastic bag but again didn’t go through with it.

After therapy I’m feeling better and now I want to report this as they’re going to be seniors next year and I’m already graduated. ",06Jun2018,7
75,I have a sister who always wants to see her friend at night but my dad won't let her drive at night. She finds it sexist as she feels girls have a right to drive at night as much as guys. Do you think my sister should respect my father's wishes or do whatever she wants?,06Jun2018,1
76,"I'm a 17 year old dude in high school and I have a bit of a dilemma. For the past year or so, I've had a pretty bad crush on a girl (call her A because I'm bad at making up fake names) and me being myself I haven't meaningfully acted on it. However, in the past couple of months, I've gotten **really** close with another girl (E). We have an amazing rapport and I've never enjoyed being around any one person more than her. As I've gotten to know E better, A kind of began to occupy less and less space in my thoughts because I was spending so much time with E.

I really think I love and care about E. She makes me warm in a way that basically no one else does. And I'm fairly confident that if I asked her out she would say yes. But I'm scared that I'm confusing our intimacy with me having feelings for her and I'm worried that by asking her out I'd risk screwing it all up. In the same vein, I'm nervous that I haven't actually gotten over A (who is now somewhat out of the picture because someone else asked her out), and I'll fall for her again once the novelty of being close with E begins to fade. If I go out with E, find that my feelings were not as strong for her as I thought in the heat of the moment, and we break up, I'll be very sad to have lost one of my 3 most important friendships and a wonderful person. I'm wary of this possibility because a VERY similar thing happened to me a couple of years ago and my current situation is uncomfortably similar to that.

I know all of this is very personal, but I was hoping some of you with more relationship experience could weigh in. Thanks!",06Jun2018,3
77,"My family calls close family-friends around our age cousins even though we aren’t even blood related and I know a lot of other people do that. Me and this kid grew up together and our siblings are close. We are invited to family gatherings together and have been called “cousins” for most of our lives. So, my “cousin”, who isn’t blood related to me has always been attracted to me...I think. When we were little kids he would always try to rub my legs, waist, hips and sit next to me and touch me... we would kinda fool around I guess nothing actual sexual (never kissing, sex, etc.) since we were kids. But, he’d get horny when playing “house” and he’d be the daddy and I’m the mommy and he touch and grind himself behind me, so I guess there was always sexual tension. That was the farthest anything would escalate and the actual grinding stopped years and years ago. I admit I would sometime get horny too, but other times uncomfortable and leave. So I’m 16 (junior) now and he is 17 turning 18 this year and going to be in college and I saw him recently. We were sitting together in his room with all of our other “cousins” and they weren’t paying attention to us on the bed and we were just watching something and he started to rub my thigh especially upper thigh. I tried laughing it off and all but I think he was trying to make me horny. I don’t have a crush on him but there is definitely mutual sexual tension. We act flirtatious toward eachother but that’s just because we are close I think. Since we aren’t actually related, it’s not incest, but it just seems weird to me because we’ve always called each other cousins (though not technically incest). 


1. We are not actually related 
2. My friends know him as my cousin. His friends know me the same way
3. It is weird because we’ve always called each other cousins.

80,"When someone else is talking, I listen to them, but when I talk, they completely zone out or listen to someone else.

I’ll try to talk about something, suddenly someone else starts talking over me and everyone pays attention to them. It’s driving me absolutely crazy. 

When I try to ask for help, I’ll get rude remarks and glares. Why? What’d I ever do to you? 

People who I’ve known throughout school that have been nice to me would start ignoring me or not wanting to talk to me. Why?!

All of this has caused me to be emotionally scared of being seen by others. I don’t want others to look at me because I’m afraid of what’ll first pop into their mind.

I don’t have many friends at school. People who I’ve met would always end up being an asshole or abandon me later on. 

And when someone actually starts talking to me first, I don’t even know how to respond and end it altogether.

I stay inside my house during the majority of the summer because I’m afraid of seeing other people I know.

All the other people I’m familiar with get hundreds of texts that interrupt them when they talk, have friends to hang out with after school.
They have people that ask them to hangout.
They have people that start the conversation instead.
They have people who want to talk to them.
They have people who actually want to listen to them.

I wish I was one of them. I want to be someone who has people that want to talk to me, to actually text me first and invite me to movies and sleepovers and fun times. But I can’t, and I’ll probably never will. I’m just some loser who hangs around in the house all day, too scared to take even one fucking step outside the god damn house. I hate myself. I feel like a literal waste of space. My entire life doesn’t bring any benefit to anyone, so why should I even try anymore? What’s the point?

81,"My girlfriend of 3 years and I broke up a few months ago, and have been on and off talking since then. She now, completely out of nowhere, claims that throughout our relationship I sexually assaulted her, even thrown around words such as rape, which is entirely untrue. 

We did have intimate relations on several occasions, as all normal young couples do when dating (we were 17 when we started) but never once did I force, coerce or beg her for sex or any sexual activity. It was all entirely consensual and if she did not feel the same she did not express anything beside the fact she enjoyed it. In fact, she would often be the initiator of a lot of the intercourse and for her to now put forth these allegations is completely unlike how she acted during our relationship. 

I am extremely distressed and emotional, not for the fact that I am guilty, but how personally hurt I am that the women I once loved is now accusing of of horrible things I never did. 

So I guess what course of action do I take from here? She has said she does not want to inform the police, nor has she show any inclination of taking action with the allegations. I’ve had many sleepless nights about this and it’s weighing down on my mental health.

If anyone has heard of or experienced a similar situation and can give me some advice on what to do about it would be appreciated.

84,"Ok so I'm 17 yrs old and my sister is only 14 so when my mother has a problem or drinks too much she always ends up exploding on me. 

Well the specific issue is that my sister is best friends with this girl and has been since she was in 4th grade, theyre also on the same voyleeball team in which they're captain and co-captain. My parents are friends with this girls parents. Well the girls father is a saint, he's the manager at a popular restaurant in my area, he coaches little leauge base ball, etc but the girls mother is the exact definition of an alcoholic. 

So my mother is at the point in her life where she doesn't have many friends close by so the most convenient person to be around is the girls mother. So they're friends but it's a very toxic relationship that always ends up with my mother drinking alot when they're together then they get in almost physical fights and I have to pick my mother up and drive her home which always ends up with my mother and I getting in very large arguments (forgot to say but my father works out of town Monday to Friday so he isn't home during the week to deal with these sitiations). But they continue to be friends and the cycle repeats not to mention even when not drunk my mom's friend constantly causes her stress and anxiety.

Well today a particular incident happened where my sister and I got in an argument in the car when I was picking her and the friend up from voyleeball practice (before I left the parking lot, I wouldn't drive while in an argument purely out of safety for the girls and myself). Well apparently my sisters friend went home and told her mom that she didn't want to ride with me driving anymore because my sister and I apparently scared her with the argument well while this may seem justified, the argument was very small and further, the girls entire family fights constantly and being Italian and from New Jersey their verbal arguments are insane and happen all the time no matter where they are including at my house. Now whether my sister's friend actually made such a big deal about it or if her mother blew it out of proportion I have no idea but the family is known for stretching the truth and exaggerating alot.

So tonight my mother was at the family's house agian, drinking with the mother but wasn't drunk yet and the mother brings up what her daughter supposedly said and begins intensely arguing about it with my mother so she left before it escalated and came home but proceeded to scream and yell at me calling me a terrible son etc, etc, etc all because I got into a small argument with my sister causing her friend to start an argument between our mothers. Finally after calming her down like I have to do several times a week i explained to her that the friendship is very toxic for her and that it even translates onto me and my father (when he's home). She then explained to me that she understands this and has for a long time but told me that she has no other friends that are close by and that she's very lonely and depressed and went further to tell me that the other mother is very petty so that the last time my mother tried to end the friendship, the other mom wouldn't allow her daughter to see or communicate with my sister anymore which would be heartbreaking for my sister not to mention, being captain and co-captain on the voyleeball team requires lots of communication throughout every week.

So what should I recommend my mother to do because looking at the current options, she either continues the friendship but stays unhappy and additionally gets drunk several nights a week and gets in large arguments with me that has even started to effect my mother and fathers marriage or she cuts off the friendship which results in my sister losing her best friend for who knows how long and possibly messes up the voyleeball team due to lack of communication. 

I need recommendations because I can't continue to get into these arguments anymore.

85,"So I'm probably going to be cooped up alone in a small place for several months without access to internet, television, computers, smartphones, etc - basically 'off-the-grid'.  The problem is that I'm normally very introverted and spend *a lot* of time on my computer.

Normally, in my free time, I'm always listening to some discussion-based podcast or 'lets plays' on youtube, because I really hate silence.  At the same time, I'll usually be browsing around online, researching random topics that interest me (like history, puzzles, math, comedy, and linguistics) - or playing video games.  Obviously, I can't do any of those things without the internet or a computer.

Now, some types of entertainment seem obvious, like downloading some audio onto CDs to listen to, getting some dvds to watch, and getting some books to read.  But besides those things, I'm wondering if you have some other suggestions?  Maybe there are some activities that I'm forgetting?

He was kind of weird but it wasn’t a big deal. I hung out with him no more that 2-3 times as a child . He always was trying to hang out more. 

Later in high school he friended me on Facebook. At this point I knew he was autistic through the school( high functioning).  He wanted to play video games with me and I didn’t at all mind doing that. He came to visit and asked to get lunch with some friends so I did and it was fine. He was definitely strange and was pretending to be on the army and was carrying around fake radio equipment. but we just tried to have a good time and be nice. 

Months later he messaged me coming out as homosexual. And sent me messages basically asking if I would have sex with him. I said politely no. And about four years later he sends me messages regularly saying he’s suicidal( not because of my rejection) just suicidal over his autism. I’ve begun ignoring everything . I try to be understanding but i do not want him fixated on me  . I have no reason to believe he is harmful to me yet .

“Nick, I really wish that I had started talking to you freshman or sophomore year. I feel like we would be so perfect for each other but there really isn’t enough time. When I couldn’t go to prom with you, I locked myself in my room and cried my eyes out (she had a photo shoot). Seriously, I want to be with you one day cause I’m worried that every guy is just a downgrade compared to you.”

Tears are silently running down her face. She tells me that it hurts her to kiss me like that; it’s like teasing.

I really like this girl. She is just like me, but the thing is, I have not caught these types of feelings for her. I got out of a relationship more than a year ago that has kind of left me numb, so that was never a problem for me.

107,"Fuck people who write long stories..... : D I separated it into 3 parts so if you’re like me and run from things looking like this I ask that you give 1, 2 or 3 a go for me. I would appreciate it. 

WARNING!!i can’t read good** /s seriously I am 28 years olds and incapable of writing grammatically correct without training wheels in outlook or word. I ask that you disregard my lack of regard while hearing me out. Thank you. 

I’m going to try and be as vague as possible with as great of detail necessary to put you in my shoes. I like sincere takes of what’s going on from your head in my day as much as you will. I have no animosity towards anyone within this story. Here we go. 

I began working at this company 10 months ago with no experience in the field. I’m in a state that’s extremely conservative, cost of living low, workers rights minimal to most people that I’ve met don’t even consider them. After health insurance I’m pulling down between 10-12 an hour (have 2 Jobs). I got this job through my good friend from back in the day. We’ve known each other for about ten years now. Friend for life. I was not at work all of last week due to a surgery and holiday but made sure to have my surgery the day after the unannounced day of the week NO ONE EVER MISSES OR YOU SUCK AT YOUR LIFE (not knowing it was a holiday) AND 3 different people from 3 different departments plus your immediate co worker (good friend) will remind you that you are never to do that. I know this because after requesting this day off 2 months in advance to hike in The desert and while holding signed approval from 2 higher ups and buying plane tickets I discovered that the higher ups just sign pieces of paper related to time off that don’t say the forbidden day even if it says the actual date in numbers of that day. I didn’t write the word of the day and was given the talk from many people in a way that was so bothersome I made sure to get back to work after 6 days from surgery so I wouldn’t have to relive the horror of keeping my mouth shut while being talked to like a 4 year old because I missed the day due to invasive surgery in a painful area. 

1. The first thing I would like your perspective on: I gave one month notice to a person who is #2 in operations of the company regarding surgery. He’s a lot of things at the company and a very busy man. His demeanor is confident, a little threatening at times (tone of voice facial expressions, completely ignoring you when you say hello. Sometimes, not every time), hurried and often gives you the feeling that he’s very irritated that you need something from him. Sometimes he will throw in a laugh to let you know he’s human and doesn’t actually want to kill you but none of that this week. I emailed  him over one month prior to surgery asking how many days I have accrued for sick leave (no pto 401k until after 1 year). He does not respond so I send another email a day or two later, I’m not trying to irritate him. In the email I ask how many days I have earned, what if anything else is needed for me to do and stated that it’s very important for my budgeting purposes that I have this figured out before my surgery stating the exact days I’d be gone in month/day format. He responds with “you have accrued 2 days” I said that’s great,thanks. Fast forward to 4 days after my surgery when my pay stub shows no sick days applied. I called him and was told I didn’t get it because I didn’t fill out the proper form and turn it in. I gathered myself, kept it cool and he said we could talk about it Monday. Monday rolls around and I send him the correspondence of what I stated above now asking that I was unaware of the form in relation to sick pay as I lack education regarding the subject leading me to unknowingly not hand it in. I then asked to be given the check today or tomorrow so that I am able to pay my bills. Having a rough time sitting at my desk due to the pain and playing catch up from missed days  I Hear nothing for some time. My main manager comes in and holds up the form For everyone in the room calling our attention. He starts about what they were for and how to be used then said that in my email I did not even give the exact dates to use the sick days so why would that be assumed and it’s my responsibility. I kept it pretty cool and responded with the fact I asked if I needed to do anything else, it’s whatever and he eventually leaves. Manager asks me to go drop something off to #2. I deliver, tell him what it’s for and he digs into me about not filling out the form saying this is now the third time he has asked me to fill out the form for sick pay. I responded with I’ll be right back with the form. At no point until that did I hear him say or give me the impression I would be able to receive the pay by handing in a form after the fact. I handed in two forms the second regarding restrictions and was told a dr note was needed before anything would move forward. Totally cool, completely understandable. Fax was sent, Forms off, I’m fucked up on pain meds doing the best to my ability to catch up from a missed week of work not focusing on how I’m going to pay my bills this week. Meanwhile #2 and manager are noticeably irritated with me. That’s where the second scenario begins to unravel. Again, fuck people who write so much then ask others to read it... thank you if you’re with me still.

Now a Scenario of my life I ask advice of you for the second time in a day:
I fucked up. I don’t know how or when or can even recall the specific conversation but they dont stop coming. In this one specific week for memorial weekend I manage to destroy any trust in my ability to do my fucking job. At least that’s the way it feels and that’s the way I’m being treated. I’ve even fathom potential sabotage from a new employee but know that’s just my Brain scraping at the walls for anything other than my actuality; fucked.  In total I have currently cost the company an extremely small fraction of a cent times 80,000 (money is money and I fucked up that’s on me. Just sharing for scale) and the time of my peers while Gone that had to deal with any of this shit. An hour I’m guessing. I had been dealing with a lot of stress the week prior to my surgery due to multiple things going on in my life which isn’t completely uncommon but never has it caused this to happen. I’m flabbergasted and disappointed in myself. I wrote an email to manager apologizing and taking full responsibility for my actions. He writes to me that I’ve made more mistakes than his entire department x2 and that I need to stop making mistakes. I agree and sincerely feel like shit. Then another call regarding, wait for it! I fucked something else up from 4 months ago and now it’s come to my attention and wait, nooo it isn’t. YES!!!! Something just came up that you fucked up 2 months ago!! Hahaha. 

Let me rewind it to my week off post surgery. I have been feeling complacent, lacking motivation, drive and often allow the negative to take over for parts of days in my weeks, months in truth. I got out of surgery and told myself I’m done being that me. I want to be a better me. I went on to study for 10 hours or more and implement some triggers and cognitive exercises to my day. I hung up signs throughout my house to trigger the positive thinking, journal positive experiences every night (this is night three) and have created daily tasks related to doing something kind to a stranger, researching what steps I need to take to get into my skilled areas of interest. I wrote an email to one of my clients today pertaining to what I have available for her regarding my work and then gave an in-depth description of Echidnas and Platypus Because they are my favorite species. I then thanked her for having been apart of my day in that way and that she is appreciated. “Not every day can be a good day but when it is I take the time to be thankful for people such as yourself.” Last we spoke two-months prior she was not doing great and expressed that to me. I was distracted and could do nothing more than to wish to her it gets better and goodbye. Not the me I want to be. Not the me I’ve always been. Lack of focus and energy. 

Back to me fucking up: I am embarrassed and now worrying about my job (no one gets fired here. They only quit. Unless they can prove that after2 months of the cash register being short that you were the culprit then you would be escorted from the building and face no charges.) I know I’m ok on that front but I sincerely care. I don’t remember a lot from the week before surgery except the owner coming in making a comment about how he had the surgery once and was back to work the same day. No idea why I need the whole week off. I expected that but otherwise I t’s all kind of a blur of me apparently repeatedly half assing everything. Where the hell was i ? 

3. I am utilizing what I’ve learned studying a book about creating habits to be my better self imperfectly but making progress, keeping my chill mode in overdrive towards myself and others. I get anxiety when confronted by authority figures X10 when they project anger, tough guy or lack of regard for my well being. When I am confronted with intense emotions my subconscious has always slapped the mental shifter into “fuck you” and extreme anger. Never blacked out but been an idiot in the past on rare occasions.  I have the anger in check 95% of the time. 
As told by coworker/friend my only option to alleviate some of the tension towards me is to ignore #2 And Tomorrow walk into my managers office, ask to speak with him and have a conversation about my anxiety in the workplace and what steps will be taken from that moment forward to insure this week never repeats itself. He has been upset regarding previous mistakes, understandably it’s only been 7 days and I’ve screwed up more than I have in 10 months. He was upset about me not giving specific enough info about restrictions that I didn’t know about either post surgery but rather than tell me this he chose to bring it up to my friend/co worker who often has a pretty shitty attitude about her day and can be a roller coaster of emotion sometimes (why would you do your finances every single morning at work and verbally your concern for not having enough money?). I love her none the less. That lead to the first half of my day being treated like I wronged her in some way so she was crabby towards me which is not uncommon so I kept on with my positive thinking. It’s a small room, no cubicles. I want to go in his office and tell him everything that’s going on in my head but I’m afraid he’s going to be a dick to me and I will become visibly angered/offended or he’ll be chill and I’ll end up crying my eyes out. It’s hard for me to stay calm in those situations and speak concisely. I lived out of a van for 1.5 years and survived off meeting people, taking chances and selling hand crafted goods. Occasionally some of my dvd collection but that was only in extreme disparity for gas money. 

2 days passed and still no word on sick pay and while I’m taking part of the day off due to pain I could use it for that so going to bring that up if I’m well mentally. 

If you read all of this God Speed ! Or even some of it I thank you dearly. 
I’m going to write out what I imagine will happen in both the best and worse scenario to attempt and prepare myself for it. The physical pain 0-4 at times at my desk and seemingly constant roller coaster of those needing to be appeased or being let down and if not let down then not satisfied for a moment has me constantly on edge in what I feel is counter productive to growth. Within ourselves and the company. I sincerely appreciate you and hope you have a wonderful rest of your week. All thoughts appreciated. I can only imagine few to none would cypher through all of this as I would likely pass it up in my time to rest between everything you just read. My second job is substantially more laid back but equally dis functional.

108,"Reddit, I'm at a loss. I feel like I barely have time to eat or sleep along with getting housework done. I have a 2 month old whom I love completely and utterly but she fights sleep like a champ. My husband tries his best to help but gets extremely frustrated when she cries at which point, she comes back to me. She eats like a champ, I breastfeed. When I do pump so my husband can feed her, she downs the entire 5-6 ounces and begs for more, forcing him to wake me up. 

How do I balance actually making time to eat something/getting sleep while also getting housework done and making sure she's content so her father doesn't blow a gasket?

110,"About to rent a basment suite and the landlord is absentee and doesn't want a deposit?

Hi, I am hoping you can help me out. I'll be renting for the first time In Canada and im on my own. Im looking at a basement suite and I spoke with the landlord. He said he doesn't believe in asking for a deposit. Also he didn't seem to care if it was month to month or a lease. He also had his phone number with an area code on the other side of the country so I am worried he is absentee. 

Would it be weird to ask the upstairs tenants what the landlord is like? Is this all normal for renting? 

I'm just worried that since I'm younger and inexperienced with this I might get taken advantage of. Any tips are much appreciated.

111,"What advice can you give a 21 year old guy who is lost and has no direction in life. I’m currently working at a car wash and don’t want to end up like others who are stuck there because of poor life choices. I’ve been working customer service since 16 and am very tired of it. After high school I attempted to get my associates degree from the local community college but failed/dropped too many classes and was put on academic suspension. I don’t know my gpa exactly but I know it’s around 1.5. Anxiety and depression were huge factors as to why I wasn’t doing too well in school, and before I go back I’d like to get better first. My interest include music and video games: i don’t really have any other hobbies or go out often. I’ve been stuck with this problem for about a year and am worried I’ll continue wasting my time.

114,"I'll save you the trouble of the whole story but basically, there is this kid who was depressed and lonely so I befriended him and gave him nice gestures. He immediately latched on to me and bombarded me with text messages, phone calls at midnight, about 100 snap chats a day (this isn't an exaggeration), and spontaneous trips to my front door. 

I've been extremely busy because I'm dealing with school, volunteering, work, and finding a new apartment to live in so I can't tend to all his needs. He noticed that I haven't been receptive of him as much as before and now he's been texting me about how ""I got his hopes up and just crushed him"" and about how ""his depression haunts him once again"" and all sorts of depressing things about how ""he knows no one truly cares about him"". He even told a couple of my friends that I only talk to him when it's convenient for me and now people think I'm a douchebag for not being nicer to an already depressed and emotional person.

117,"I’m looking for advice on how to not look back in anger and instead learn to once again cherish memories of good times with him. The problem is that he fucked up so bad, I truly cannot forgive him. Here’s context:

I have a twin brother who is my favorite person in the world. He dated a girl all through college and a year afterwards, totaling 5 years together. He was convinced she was the one for him and wanted to marry her. My entire family embraced her as family at this point.

I met my former best friend (will refer to him as M from now on) freshman year in college. We truly had a deep rooted trust and love for each other ever since. We all lived together sophomore year (M, Twin and I), and M got to be a very good friend of my twin as well. My twin had been dating his now ex-GF for 6 months when we all moved in together - since January 2013 and kept dating til October 2017. We both picked up on flirty vibes between M and exGF that year, but never thought anything of it because it seemed harmless and twin and exGF were so in love.  

Fast forward to graduation May 2016. We are all still best friends, M gets a job in the city close to where my parents live, but has no one to room with. My parents, the best most accommodating humans in the entire universe, graciously offer up a room in our house rent free  while he settles into work life for 8 months. They loved him too. He takes it. I move back in August, having accepted a job in my hometown, so we are roommates once again. Life was great. Rent free living with my best friend, with home cooked meals from my mother every night.

He finally moves out of my parents house in May 2017. This is where the trouble begins. Summer 2017 everyone is picking up on extremely obvious flirtatious vibes between them, while twin and exGF are still dating. I confront him after months of mulling back and forth over whether or not what I’m seeing is legitimate. 

I looked him in the eyes and asked him right there “have you ever had feelings for exGF?” He says no, never, how could I ever do that to twin, blah blah. I explained that not only me, but everyone was picking up on what they were doing. He assured me, nothing there. I trusted him entirely. Cool, nothing to worry about.

Break-up happens in October 2017. Twin devastated. Convinced he’ll never get a girl like her again. Commence the awkwardness of exGF being engrained into our friend group and consistently hanging around M in a group setting, often conversing off to the side. December 2017, I confront him after a particularly touchy night...is anything going on there? This is my brother’s very recent exGF we are talking about here, M. If anything is happening I need to know. He says no absolutely not, nothing has happened. It’s just how he talks to girls. He’s just naturally flirty. It doesn’t mean anything. 

Phew, I trust this guy. He’s my best friend AND a great dude. He lived with my family. He’s never wronged anybody. He could never make my brother hurt like that. 

There’s a room open in M’s house January 2018. Hell yeah! I moved out of my parents house and in with M. Roommates once again!

Here’s the colossal fuck up where he lost the respect of our whole group of friends. They started dating and hooking up with each other in December. Not a soul knew until the end of a March. The bomb was dropped by one of my other roommates when he saw them go into M’s bedroom one weekend night. Once again, total devastation to twin as he can hardly even pretend to be over exGF at this point. I honestly think he will have trust issues for the rest of his life. 

M and exGF were able to hide it from everybody for a while by lying to everyone about what they were doing, why they didn’t come home that particular night, etc. All while I WAS LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE AS HIM. He or she didn’t have the balls to tell my twin directly, and chaos erupted when he found out from my other roommate.

As a rule of respect, if you’re interested in a good friends long-term exGF, you either wait until they’re completely over them (about a year from what I’ve heard) or at least give the courtesy of asking them if they’d be ok with it. Or you can just not even risk the chance of hurting said friend, and decide to not act on any feelings at all. 

The day after I found out, I packed up all my shit immediately and moved right back home with Mom and Pop. I couldn’t fucking believe my best friend would ever lie to my face and hurt my twin brother like that. I can’t lie, the emotional trauma to myself from having to move back home under those circumstances still hurts. It was demeaning, demoralizing, unfair. Maybe that’s why I’m writing this. 

Now I’m left here back at home, unable to forgive M for what he did because I don’t think my twin will ever forgive him. Nobody fucks with my family. If he started dating one of my exGFs, maybe there’s a chance down the road that I could forgive him. That’s because it’s between him and me. This situation is different than that. It’s between M and my twin brother. I can never forgive what he did to my twin.

He’s paying a price by losing a group of friends. However, so am I. 

Every memory I have of M in college and beyond was truly amazing. I’d say half of my memories involved M. We lived a surreal college experience that I only want to look back on fondly. I’m a peaceful person that is struggling to grapple this dramatic situation. How am I able to move past this? 

TL/DR: former best friend/roommate goes behind everyone’s back and starts dating my twin brother’s long-term ex-girlfriend 2 months after their breakup. Feelings ensue and I want to somehow move past them, but it’s not up to me.

118,"He's long-distance, and he's older than I am. For a little context, I'm 17 and live with my grandparents. I'm unhappy living with them, and am depressed because of it, because they aren't nice and have a ton of issues themselves that they won't ever change. My boyfriend is always my go-to when I'm upset, because he's there for me and he cares about me. I really love him. 

But lately, if I try to talk to him about how I'm feeling, I'll worry I'm bumming him out, or that I'm being over-dramatic, and end up over-explaining myself and trying to justify every action I've done to the point where he just doesn't know what to say. I wasn't like this when we first met, and I'm really scared it's going to change how he sees me, but I don't know how to tell him without feeling like I'm being stupid and weird. He's very understanding, so I don't know why I feel this way. Part of it might just be my anxiety.

But then, I've been depressed a lot more lately too. I mean, things have been getting better ever so slowly, I just feel lonely and end up feeling down, so what's happening is he ends up hearing about it instead, and I don't know how to make myself stop. I keep spamming his phone and I really don't mean too, and it's embarrassing. I want to apologize to him, but he's stopped responding to me saying sorry because I've said it a lot. What if he's starting to think I'm crazy? I certainly feel like it.

121,"I am a volunteer at the boys and girls club. I hope to work there at some point and I am actually pretty close to getting a job there. The problem is, the cost of getting the job would be that I’d have to snitch on some very kind people.

Backstory: so, the coordinator and lead of the classroom are not too good at their jobs. They “run” the K-1 classroom but they do not know how to manage it very well. There are always incidents with the kids and little things happening that worry parents (the site director told me that parents have been worried). Myself and a different staff member have been staying in contact with the site director over something that happened two weeks ago in the classroom. What happened was the lead was being rude to me and the other volunteers and was acting like it wasn’t our job to control the classroom (he said “they’re not staff it’s not their job” but we’re still there to support so it kinda is our job too). So me and the girl went to talk to the site director last week. I was honest but I felt bad. And again today she wanted to speak with us. This time she brought up both the lead AND the coordinator, which we were not expecting. I wasn’t going to say anything about the coordinator but since she asked I felt obligated. I don’t want to bad mouth any of my coworkers. They really are great people and they are my friends. I just don’t think they are very great at their jobs. Am I being a total B for snitching on them? The director says she is unappreciative of staff who lie to protect their friends. 

She wants us all to have a meeting tomorrow so we can bring up things they need to improve on. She wants us to sandwich the info we give them (what I mean is giving compliment-negative-compliment). I’m so worried that my coworkers will hate me. I already have anxiety and it will get worse knowing that I’m in a room where my two head staffs hate me... idk what I need I guess advice? As to what to say tomorrow during the meeting? If I should stop being honest? I really want a job here and the more honest I am the closer I get. But I also don’t want to be the reason someone loses their job.

I moved recently this place, and had four other room mates, currently down to three. me being a foreigner to this culture, i tried to keep my distance, respect everyone's boundaries and pursue my studies. however one thing led to another and i started occasionally having chats with a few room mates (not by choice) and got to know them on surface level. few days later conflict breaks out somebody's food has been eaten and the other new room mate is being blamed (rightfully so), this became a pattern as conflicts like this would break out often and i would find myself in the middle of it, i was getting texts from this guy complaining about the other when i really did not want to be in any part of it and made sure to keep contact minimal. things escalated and at one point every other day i would get walls of texts of  roommate A complaining about roommate B, I tried to be a nice guy and never took any sides and remained neutral, but i find myself being dragged into this and ""forced"" to take part in it with the continued harassment and the fact that roommate B now has made it a habit to deceitfully record people's conversations. i'm at the breaking point, i've had issues with room mates before where i had to move out for my own safety and peace of mind, however i am mentally exhausted with studies and this is making me suicidal, how do i deal with this without putting myself at risk?",06Jun2018,1

Other times, I think I'm fine with people \-\- until the word comes around, in one way or another.

I'm sick of having this cloud of anxiety over me at all times around other people; I'm sick of feeling like I have to ""please"" other people by engaging in conversation that is strictly relevant to *them*. All in order to make sure that I'm likable to the ""average\-case"" person. 

I don't want to feel this way, but how am I supposed to act confidently around people who may or may not dislike me? Wouldn't they just trash\-talk me after I left the immediate area?

127,"Sorry if this post is kind of incoherent, it's really late and I'm exhausted but can't sleep. 

I was basically socially isolated from seventh to tenth grade, which was devastating to my mental health. I had no friends, nothing I really enjoyed doing, and very restricting/controlling parents. During my junior year, I became friends with this girl I knew as a kid (4/5 years old) but hadn't really spoken to. I was still an awkward mess but I felt comfortable around her and we were best friends for about a year. I developed feelings but she had a weird on/off relationship with her then-bf so I never really told her. One of the times they broke up I finally said fuck it and told her. Her response was super unclear initially, but it turned out she liked me back and within a week or so we were a couple. 

Things were amazing at first. I've never been as happy as I was during those first few weeks in my entire life. She was the perfect girl and I loved her so much. We were supportive of each other and had a great relationship. I never really noticed the red flags until way too late. 

It's kind of hard to explain, but basically being the stupid high schoolers we were we would joke about my social awkwardness by calling me retarded, autistic, etc. Even before we were dating, it was kind of a joke between us. But as time went on, it just became more and more engrained in my mind as the truth. She convinced me that I was incapable of looking after myself and should be grateful someone like her was even giving someone like me a chance. She would later tell me that she only dated me out of pity. She never took me seriously and she was always way more important to me than I was to her, even at the beginning of our relationship. I tried asking if she needed space on multiple occasions (she would deny it and I was too in love to tell she was lying). 

I don't really want to get into the details, but this really damaged my self-worth. We eventually broke up because she was cheating and tried hiding it from me. 

I know I made a lot of mistakes too. Since she was my only friend, I was extremely clingy and wanted to be with her all the time. I was so afraid of ""messing up"" around her (being clumsy, making mistakes, etc) that I would work myself into ridiculous anxious states basically every time we saw each other. I couldn't function normally and became hypercritical of my every action, beating myself up over every small thing I did. Also, being way less experienced than her, things like hugging, cuddling, and of course kissing and sex did not come easily for me. I just wasn't confident enough to really let myself go and do anything right, even a simple hug.

131,"I am 16 and a junior in HS currently, this is the summer between my 10th and 11th grades -- class of 2020. I finished Sophomore year with a 3.93 unweighted GPA and a score of 1200 on the PSAT, spent both semesters of sophomore year on the honor roll, and I'm doing a collegiate honors math program this summer (it's a week from today, ahh!!!)

However, my current school doesn't offer any courses rigorous enough for me to feel comfortable, or any courses very rigorous at all. It's a charter school, we don't have any AP or IB classes, and honors classes aren't traditional, they're considered after-school clubs, students aren't separated based on interest or capability (not that that's necessarily a problem, i'm not one of those ""you need an IQ of 9000 to understand the Office Humor also i love the ivy league lmao"" people, just information.) This worries me, though, as I'm planning on going into the biological sciences and my dream school is UC Berkeley, which is currently out of state (I did grow up in California and I've always dreamt of being a Berkeley hippie and running around on the bay, going to the alma mater of Edith Head and George Takei...i really am from socal lmao). My current school does have unique opportunities though, like mandatory senior internships and end-of-year presentations regarding your own learning and growth, as well as a small, close-knit environment that fosters genuine and supportive student-teacher and student-student relationships (there are 200 students for all 4 grades). All of the public schools around me offer extensive AP and IB and XYZ programs (generally rigorous than ANY curriculum at my current school), as well as just generally more academic opportunity than my current school. I have been told that it doesn't necessarily matter if your courseload wasn't ""rigorous"", and that universities mostly pay attention to what you did with what you were given (and the ""additional notes"" part of college apps is MEANT to explain things like this), is that true?

Additionally, I just don't have friends so that really isn't an issue.

So, all-in-all, my question is: is it worth it to transfer from my small charter school with minimal academic legroom but lots of place to develop personally to a large public school with much more opportunity for academic growth but less opportunity for personal development? 

Thanks for any thoughts, let me know if you have any questions!

Tl;dr i go to a hippie school and am worried that the lack of rigor is detrimental + should i transfer to a larger public school for more rigor if it means possibly sacrificing the closeness and security of my current situation but possibly getting a better chance to receive scholarships and get into a good college?",06Jun2018,2
132,"Hello redditors, I need some advice which is obvious seeing as I’m here.

Anyways, my issue stems from childhood up until the age of 17. (Currently 19.) 

I was molested/raped a few times as a kid by different people. Ever since that occurred I was very sexual my entire life, way too sexual as a kid and when I became a teen took to the internet to really explore. I sent nudes around, sexted a lot, flirted, and had a few relationships where I was abused more than once and used. I cheated twice on two different people, the first time I was 15, he was 18. I was naive, didn’t know what a relationship really was. The second time he was threatening and hurting me, so I cheated in attempt to make him leave.

All that aside I ended up leaving that phase eventually, getting sick of being hurt and used after a guy I fell in love with ended up only wanting my body. 

I found someone I love, I met her in person, lost my virginity to her, I love her. She hasn’t always been good to me, she cheated when we first got together and lied a lot. Was very abusive, however we got past it and she’s changed and fixed the things she needed to. I’m happy, but I often find myself thinking about the past, exes, the attention I got from being a prominent figure on the internet. I no longer use social media and I’m beginning to miss it. I miss the attention I got from random people, I miss flirting, I miss showing myself off. 

I don’t want to fall back into that lifestyle... but I’m scared I might if I continue thinking about it.

Can I get some advice? Opinions? Please...",06Jun2018,1
134,"Hi, 
So my mum and I have a really difficult relationship. I’ve moved out but I live pretty much round the corner from her. We’ve been having an difficult time for a little over a month now - which she strongly fuelled- but it has led to me deciding I don’t want her in my life anymore. Currently that isn’t possible as she is my landlord but I’m trying to move out and I don’t want her in my life. 

However we have been talking a bit, mainly about practical things regarding works in the flat etc but she’s ‘calmed down’ so to speak (I’m diagnosed BPD , and I’m pretty sure she’s undiagnosed something because point blank she’s crazy, and I can totally see how I suffer with the things I do, have come from her parenting and such) 
Anyway - it’s her birthday next week and I’m wondering how to handle it. 
If I ignore it, it’s basically saying this is definitely it, we are completely done. Which I think is quite harsh whilst I still live under her roof. 
Or I try and go see her for the first time in weeks with like a card and just see how she is. 
Or I can just message her happy birthday and leave it at that. 

I’m honestly not sure on protocol here. I have in the back of my mind from when I was 17, she upset me a lot around her 50th so naturally I didn’t get her anything and she called up my best friend crying on the phone that I didn’t get her anything for her birthday ... so yeah it was kinda awkward. 


TLDR: not really on speaking terms with emotionally abusive Mum, what do I do for her birthday next week? 

Any advice would be appreciated, I know it’s a fucked up situation. ",06Jun2018,1
135,"So I'm currently 17 turning 18 in July. I participated in a program that allowed me to take my senior year at a community college tuition-free. I also took two free college classes via another program and completed an AP class junior year. A year at my college is roughly 8k, and I have about 4k with my and my parents current savings for college and plus whatever I end up getting through financial aid. The 4-year I plan to go after (if I choose to continue) is about 14k per year. 

I work minimum wage  (10.50) at about 15 hours per week. I know financially wise it'd be better to stay in my job and that in reality it's not that many hours. But I've missed so much from my last year because of my job. I always feel like I get shifts on days where something happens and I miss out. 

I was only able to go to one meeting of my favorite club out of 12, i missed prom, the big talent show we have, the senior group photo, and I miss out on so many parties/gatherings/ect. Its partially my fault because I didn't go out too hard to search for the dates to ask for the time off and my friends are super spontaneous. 

Currently I don't have a liscense and I have to ask others for a ride, often my grandfather and it makes me feel terrible. It also doesn't help that my friends and school is 30 miles away from my home and where I work. I hate asking him to drive me somewhere 3-4/7 days of a week. 

TL:DR

I just really want to take the summer off from work to focus on taking a couple online classes and working towards my liscense. Everyone I talk to just tells me that ""it's what being an adult means"", ""life sucks"" and I understand that but I want the ability to take a couple months off while I still can and go randomly hang out with my friends or enjoy my last bit of teenage years. I feel so separated and honestly really stressed. I often can't sleep the nights before a shift.

137,"Ok so, the explanation of things is a little long. Sorry. My friend, X, is incredibly suicidal. I’m trying to be a good friend. I visited him everyday after he was in the hospital. And now I hang out w/ him a lot more. I drive 20 mins to his place since he can’t drive. I drive him around a lot and his other friends. I don’t think I’ve ever said no to hanging out w/ him. Normally, by the time we are done hanging out I’m exhausted and have used about a third of my gas in my car. He can’t drive. He’s got me hanging out w/ him once a week. He also texts almost everyday and calls unexpectedly. I hate calls, and sometimes I don’t want to text back. Normally when he texts me, he either asks to hang out or he is depressed. I get so tired from it all I become apathetic, but I don’t want to ignore his texts or calls bc I don’t want to be the reason he kills himself.   
Anyway, that leads to a recent thing. He texts me asking me to drive his friend somewhere. I know his friend, but I’m not friends w/ this person. I ask if his adult friend w/ ability to drive can ask his parents, or pay for an Uber or something. He tells me they just have a bike, and that he doesn’t have any money. I ask him the same question, and that I know his friend buys weed so he has money. X says his friend thinks his parents won’t drive him and that he can’t pay Bc he buys weed w/ the money.  I ask the same question: did he ask his parents? And I agree to drive his friend since x will go too. X gets back to me and says he will personally ask his friends parents. He then says he’s a shitty friend.  
I constantly have to reassure him that he isn’t. I hate repeating myself bc it means that nothing is changing. I tell him why he isn’t and that he has friends that support him. He still holds onto him being a bad person and says he’s worried about telling me something. So I direct him to friends if he’s worried about talking to me. He says they’re  asleep. So I give him a few more friends. He then tells me that it’s really painful for him. And I tell him he has a lot of friends he can talk to. (Ps I didn’t mention therapy bc I always mention therapy and he never does it. I even had him call a therapist but he never tried after that. I don’t think he wants to get better). He then asks me what I would no if he hypothetically force me to kill him.   
Now, I hate this. Bc I don’t want him to die. And I’m telling him I don’t want him to die and I don’t want it to happen. He continues saying what if he just did it while I was there. And I’m just like I don’t want it to come to that. Then he moves the conversation in a while other direction. Saying that a different friend of X’s thinks X loves me. (He crushed on me back in high school. 4ish years later this is happening.) this is where I’m scared and start asking him about his friend and told him he has options for support: therapy, friends, and parents. (Ps he doesn’t live w/ his parents. He lives w/ his verbally abusive and neglectful grandmother). He also always asks me if I'll cry if he dies or if I'll ever leave him. I hate making promises. I hate it because I hate breaking them bc it feels like betrayal. I didn't even cry when my grandmother died. and I dont know if I'll ever leave bc what if he commits murder or i die in a car crash.  
Here’s where I need advice pls.  I think it’s entirely possible that he does like me. I don’t love him. I want to be friends. I’m afraid now that he might kill himself in front of me. He told me he thought about it before too. I don’t want to stop hanging out w/ him, but now I’m worried. I’m scared he might kill himself bc of me (saying no to hanging out, not answering a text, not wanting to drive him around, not wanting to make promises). I’m worried he thinks I hate or judge him (I don’t, which I tell him. But he always asks when he is high or drunk or depressed or thinks I’m annoyed). I’m scared he might kill him self bc I don’t love him. What do you think about what I described above? What should I do?  
I feel like I’m a bad friend bc I think I don’t care enough about him. I’m getting tired and scared of repeating myself and listing to him say that he wants to die, but I don’t want to abandon him. I also feel like I have to do everything w/ him so he won’t kill him self and bc he bought me some things (which I told him not to do). Am I a bad friend?  
He thinks he’s a bad friend bc he’s irresponsible, clingy, selfish, and other stuff I guess? He doesn’t go into specifics usually. Is he a bad friend? (After reading everything)  
He refuses to go to therapy. He says he copes w/ weed but it sure as hell isn't helping. He won’t talk to anyone else about this stuff. I think he doesn’t want to get better. What do I do? ",06Jun2018,0

Anyways been here for 3 years, and I'll have around 45 transferable credits towards my major. So most likely would graduate in 6 years if I go to the universities I was accepted to.

150,"I want to ask what others would do being in the situation I’m in. And here is our story to explain.

Since the beginning of my Jr. year in high school I have had a crush on this awesome and beautiful girl. And she kinda liked me too, but during our time in high school we had best friends of the opposite sex and we both though that the other wasn’t interested. The year went by quickly and we began to talk more and more. To the point where we knew everything about each other and found ourselves to be almost identical people with the same morals and dreams. And we’re always there for each other during our darkest times for those 2 years. Fast forward to the end of my senior year we were at a mutual friends bonfire with a few of our friends from school, and once she decided to leave, I walked her to her car and made out with her before the others decided to find out what was going on. I wanted to ask her out, but being that we were going to college so far apart and knowing it wouldn’t be fair to miss out on our freshmen experiences I had decided to hold in my feelings. We kept in contact, snap chatting each other every day to keep our streak “alive”. I’ve always enjoyed this but things over the past few weeks have been different.

Now normally when I ask her to hang out she’s normally “busy”, which is cool, but I never thought about it much. However when the semester was winding down a wave of courage came over me and decided to ask her out on a date. I was stunned she didn’t say no, but rather why, and I told her that “I don’t want to pretend to not like you, I’ve kept my mouth shut for so long and I would much rather ask then let another one go.” Long story short after about a 4 hour FaceTime she told me that she wasn’t ready for one and she hopes that it wouldn’t put a strain on our relationship. ( She had gotten into a relationship with someone I knew was toxic and big into drugs which she knew about but they were best friends because he opened up to her about his life issues).

A couple of weeks into the summer I asked her to hang out a few times, being told she was busy like always until one night she texted me 
“hey idek if you’re doing anything but i’m j chillin drinking if you’re bored and wanna have a long deep talk.” Now for her to ask to talk was nothing out of the ordinary, so I FaceTimed her and she said she was hoping that I could talk in person. Well, I guess I was headed over to her place. 

We chatted for 4 hours about everything that had happened to us our first year in college. Towards the end of that long conversation we were both a bit drunk and were chatting again about the idea of us and how we are just in different places in our lives. To avoid it, I just turned up some of the country music that was playing the in the bg. And to sum it up, it was basically Sam Hunt’s House Party for the next 45 minutes. But after that the mood changed, I was standing over her and she pulled me towards her and we started making out. We then proceeded to have our fun. And we did it 2 more times over the course of the night. When we woke up, we both joked about it and proceeded with our day. When I left we exchanged a kiss, and smile.

Now we have chatted since, because a week later I hit her up asking her if she was okay with everything that had happened and she said she doesn’t regret anything and honestly hasn’t put in a lot of thought. But this kinda has left me questioning what we are? She knows I like her, (and while doing it she said she loved me) and it is something you can’t really take back. We could try going back to being just friends but I don’t think that would work well, I like the idea of friends with benefits but I want something closer to the idea of a wholesome relationship.

151,"I'm not asking for advice to change her, she will never change no matter how much I try. Sometimes she can be a good mom, but most times she's verbally abusive and toxic. Some might call it tough love, but it's gotten to the point where it's traumatically damaging.

When I was around freshman/sophomore year in HS, I can recall her saying terrible things to me such as ""You're a waste of space"" or ""Go die"". This one time she had purchased a new car and totaled it, her response was ""Maybe it was karma for talking too much trash about you and your sisters"". 

We had a terrible fall out and she had kicked me out a few months prior to my move\-in date with my dad. I did not bother to associate myself with her afterwards, so she threatened to call the cops on me and take me to court if I did not visit her. This was all done on the phone, and she was yelling at me and calling me a bitch in our native language. 

We've patched things up now, but she's still not a loving mother. When I came back from college, we got in an argument  about the way she treated my sisters and I. She told me to just quit college, because I wasn't going to get anywhere and I was a loser. It honestly broke me.

i had friends over this weekend and i crashed really early like 7pm.
i said my friends could eat whatever and chill.
i trust them! or i did?

when i woke up i asked them what they ate, they said they ended up eating some frozen lasagne from the freezer. 



so anyway, my mum ended up coming home and on Sunday after they left and at first accused me of giving my friends a bunch of food. 

she showed me a few boxes in the food cabinet that used to be full of packaged food. like easy pasta and soup etc
i recognise that the boxes used to be full too.
now they’re almost empty 

she told me she’s 95% that my friends stole the rest because no one in my house has eaten them

i said i thought it was weird because why would they take all the food if it was so noticeable that it was missing? 

she said that when she saw the boxes that the remaining packets were sorted in a way that looked like nothing was missing (perfectly separated to look full)

my mum thinks my friend took all the food because her sister just moved out and maybe she took to give them to her sister 

i know, it’s only food but it’s the principle. if her sister needed food, my mum is so giving. she would have given her food! 

honestly, these two friends are quite manipulative and deceitful to others but it still would surprise me. i thought i was an exception to that but i guess not?


so what comes after that is what i should do about it


these are my two closest friends
i honestly never thought they’d do something like this 
if i ask or confront them and i’m wrong, i’ve ruined a friendship i value for nothing.

if i stop hanging around them they’ll demand an explanation. i really like them too and if i’m wrong then i’ve again- lost a friendship i value.

but i’m kinda uncomfortable because if it’s true then i’m hanging out with somebody who obviously doesn’t value me, and has stolen from not only me, but my FAMILY. which rubs me the wrong way completely.

only solution i have is to hang out with them at their houses and snoop around a little.

I come home, and my mom (who is drunk out of her mind) has a talk with me. She tells me that I don’t pay rent (which neither of my parents do anyways) and that I have to follow the “rules”
Ps: No rules were EVER mentioned or agreed about! I wouldn’t have a problem if I was just let known of the “rules” that I apparently broke
I told her that 1. I’m an adult 2. He’s an adult 3. We miss each other so I would be out late

I never really told her where I was, so I get that. But the problem is, deep down, she is afraid that I’m going to have sex. She doesn’t want me over at all, sleeping over, NOTHING. She wants him to see me at my house where she can supervise us like we’re 12 year olds. We’re working adults who pay bills.. 

My mom blames me
My dad blames him
they’re both pissed I was out late. 

I need advice on how to approach this problem. I’m sure a talk is in need, but what should I say? Should my boyfriend be present? I’m so sick of this treatment. They’re fine when I’m out this late in any other situation. I just don’t get it. I need help

I am not an art dealer. I purchased them directly from someone who works with the REAL art broker for alex.

I have not been able to sell any of them yet. I told him that I can't and wont sell them for him now... he is demanding payment for the prints because he doesn't want to sell them either..

He is threatening to contact my bank about fraud for the check.

What do?

They sent nudes to each other via snapchat but he had an app that let you save the snaps without the other person knowing. After a while, she ended up not wanting to send him pictures anymore leading him to become enraged and he threatened to post the photos on Facebook. Calling his bluff, she ignored him until she got a phone call from one of her friends telling her about the pictures. She got them taken down soon after but he kept posting them every day for weeks until she finally got him to stop. 
It has been years but she still gets texts from him almost every day. Knowing he still most likely has the photos, she cannot block him or cut contact completely in fear of him doing it again. Nobody knows about what happened to her and she feels so ashamed that she has never asked for help. She knows she made a horrible mistake by sending him nudes, but I don't think she deserves to be constantly tormented by a man that almost ruined her life and her trust of people in general.

166,"I'll give background info so this might be a bit long.


My sister married her classmate from college 6 months after graduating. On her wedding day she learnt government was sending her to a tiny village (that doesn't even have roads) as a teacher. The next day she was at the tiny village and she had to teach there for 3 years before she could request to work at another place. Her husband (also a teacher) was sent to the city right next to my sister's. They were living seperate but spending their free days together. A few months later, my sister's father-in-law was arrested with false accusations. Court day was postponed again and again and again (it still didn't happen and i don't know when it'll). And my brother-in-law was kicked out from his job because of his father. So my sister and her husband started living together, and he became a house-husband waiting for his dad's trial so he could return to his job. Then he started nagging my sister asking what she bought with the 5$ she earns and lecturing her not to waste money. (They didn't really have money problems thanks to my sister working). He started asking what she bought with every penny missing from the shared bank account. Then he asked for my sister's personal account info so he could keep track of those too and my sister got mad and refused it. 



Now I'll give a little backstory about my sister. 



I didn't really like my sister because she clearly has narcissistic personality disorder and she made my childhood hell so i actually wanted to watch her suffer but i didn't want her to suffer *this* much. She LOVES to be the queen bee. She wouldn't let me get the same brand shoes as hers and I'd always have to get a cheaper one because otherwise she'd go mad. She ridiculed me whenever she could, always brought the bad memories when someone started talking good about me etc etc. He biggest issue is shopping. She had financial problems in her childhood and was made fun of being poor so she has a inferiority complex and she lives to flex on others (buying expensive bags, shoes etc). She married and left the house but most of her clothes are here in my room. I can't find a place to put my books because she uses my bookshelf to store her shoes. She has boxes of stuff on top of my wardrobe etc. What I'm trying to say is, SHE LIVES FOR SHOPPING. And the main reason she became a teacher was to earn a lot doing the minimum but she got married before getting her first paycheck and her husband was keep nagging and complaining for her 5$ purchases. 



My mom always tells us to be the bigger person so my sister tried to avoid the arguments. One day my sister was cleaning the bathroom and her foot slipped and she hit the stone ground and couldn't even get up. She called her husband to help her go to hospital because she couldn't move. He said it wouldn't worth the gasoline and she should have been more careful. He didn't even help her get up. Her friends were horrified and took her to hospital ASAP. Turns out she hurt her coccyx and she had to use the donut shaped pillow for months. 


He started gaming and he was gaming when my sister was at work and he was sleeping when my sister came home. My sister loved to go out but he kept saying he would stay at home gaming and she should go out alone if she wants to go out that much. My sister has driving license but she had never actually used a car until then and her husband didn't allow her to practice and don't forget they're living in a tiny village in the middle of nowhere so when her husband didn't take her out she wouldn't be able to go out. 


My sister tells me that as if he is trying to punish her because she has a job and her dad is not in jail. Also her husband treats her really cold when she uses makeup and dresses nicely. But he treats her really nice when she's without makeup and with pajamas etc. (My sister is kinda out of his league too). 


When they go out, it's usually when he brings his friends with him (and their partners). And even they noticed he was acting so cold towards my sister. Actually when he left the table my sister told his friends that she'd like to go to the lake nearby and his friends told her to tell her husband. She said she would never go there if she was the one who made the request but they didn't believe her. When he came back my sister asked him if they could go to the lake and he said no without thinking and it was impossible etc . When his friends saw that they told him that it'd actually be nice to go there and her husband was smiling and saying ""Oh yeah that's a nice idea!"". 


He looks like a really kind and friendly guy from the outside and he only shows his true self to my sister and he tries to act all macho like ""I am the man of this house we will do what I say!"". He wasn't like that at all before they got married. 


At another fight, my sister said, ""How about you ask your mommy for pocket money instead of me?!"". And that really pissed him off and he didn't talk to my sister for months. I must mention that he is his mommy's big boy and his mom always talks about how perfect his son is etc.


Now my sister completed her 3 years duty and she can choose to work at another city and she wants to come and live near us, in the biggest city of our country but her husband threatens to divorce her if she comes to us and says ""Choose that city and save us both from this misery"". He thinks they should go to another tiny city because his best bud lives there, ignoring all of my sister's friends and stuff. She decided to live near us and he said he was coming with her, but he'd turn her life to living hell. My sister isn't sure if she wants to divorce him because she actually did love him and she thinks maybe his father being in jail ruined his mental health and he will go back to normal when his dad gets out of the jail. Also she's afraid of not being able to find a husband again and having to die alone. 


My sister said it'd be the best to divorce immediately but he told her that his mom was sick and they can't do that until she gets better and she should better keep her mouth shut. Oh and that he will torture her everyday. 


TL;DR
She is hesitating to divorce him because he might go back to normal and she might not get married again. Do you think she should wait for him to fix his personality or just dump him?",06Jun2018,7

170,"Long story short, I moved to college this year after my GCSES.
College was nothing like I expected it to be, no one really talks to each other and overall I just didn’t enjoy the course that I chose. I don’t have any friends and I recently got broken up with by my boyfriend of a year, who was all I had. 

I’ve decided I want to leave the course I’m in as 
A) I don’t enjoy it 
B) I don’t want to see my ex boyfriend everyday as he’s doing the same course. 

I’m struggling to decide what to do as I really want to start going out and making friends. I feel as tho if I start an apprenticeship it will be difficult to make friends and have a social life as most people working there will be a lot older. 

I thought of doing my a levels again however that’s another 2 years and I don’t think I would enjoy it benefit from them.

In class we do almost everything in teams and i have never had a good team partner, so i work mostly alone. Now i just hate class, feel like everyone i judging me for not being perfect. 

I know i have it in me, even speak perfect danish and three other languages fluently, am healthy, supportive parents. But i am so fucking insecure. 
In Germany making friends is no problem for me, here it feels impossible and strange. After 6 months here, i lost my German girlfriend, that's where something really broke inside. I need thicker skin, but i just feel alone all the time, like a miserable copy of myself. Barely leave my apartment now, hate going to school, a fight to go outside, even for buying food. I feel like an alien. My apartment is my prison and my save haven at the same time. All i wanted was to build the foundation for a good life, now it's so bad. I don't want to bother any person with my feelings/problems. I act like it's good, but i can't take this much longer and i feel it's going to prevent me from finishing this study.

Then she invited me in and I knew where things were going. She walked me to her room and we sat down on the bed to talk. I could see a box with my things in it as I sat. I decided to start conversation to prevent from hearing the dreaded words a moment longer. I started by talking about what I feel I had learned from our time apart and my plan to fix this about myself.

I broke, I snapped inside and fell apart like glass. But, I kept talking with her. She said she has a lot going on and then that she is going home for the summer. Which we had talked about while still together, I wanted to be with her and promised I would drive to see her at least once a week whenever I had time off from work. Then she asked me if there was anything I had wanted to say. I was honest and said there was a lot but that it would be considered wasted breath now. She asked me to go on and then sat silently so I explained how I’ve been and how I’ve felt about not being around her (I missed the absolute hell out of her). She said she would be there for me and wanted to still be part of my life. Then she walked me out to the living room with the box of stuff in my hands. I set it down and we talked a bit more. I jokingly said that I could see everything that happened throughout our relationship going on around me, (that’s just weirdly how my memory works, it’s like a hologram laid over what I see) and she laughed. Then she made me promise to not do anything stupid with a handshake. I turned the handshake down and asked for a pinky promise as a joke to lighten my mood. She did it and then came close and laid her head on my chest. She kissed my cheek and I asked why. She said it was because she wanted to but didn’t want to start a problem. So I kissed her cause that was all I could think for a moment. Then she kissed me back. And then she kissed my cheek again. Then as I was walking out I said “you ever feel like giving us another shot you let me know” and kissed her before walking off. I got down the path and every muscle in me was shaking and wanted to turn around. So I did the stupid thing and threw my stuff on the ground and ran back knocking on the door.

195,"I got my braces when I was 16 because my parents couldn’t afford to get them any time sooner. I was told I’d have them for two years. All my prom pictures, my graduation pictures, every picture with my friends, I have braces in all of them and I hate the way I look. I’m 18, I’m an adult, and I look like a fucking child. My smile I awkward and forced and I still have acne. I look like I’m 15. Every time my friends have had their braces removed, I feel intense jealousy and anger. At least I was looking forward to having my braces off in college. Well it turns out I’m going to have them on for a “significantly longer” time than what I was told, according to my orthodontist. It’s been a year and nine months and I haven’t even gotten rubber bands yet. They want me to get a second round of oral surgery, then go to the dentist to fix one tooth that’s particularly fucked up. And you know what the kicker is? My teeth weren’t even bad when I got braces. They were relatively straight. I thought I would only need braces for a year or so. All this mess is because of ONE SINGLE TOOTH. One tooth that grew in the wrong place in my mouth and they’ve been pulling it forward for over a year now. I’m so fucking sick of this. If I was a freshman in high school it would be different. My friends would have braces too. I wouldn’t look like such a fucking loser next to all my classmates who are the same age as me and haven’t had braces since middle school.

When I’m older and I look back on pictures from my freshman year, this is what I’m going to see. I just want this to be over. I want people to see me as an adult, both physically and mentally.

He slept with multiple prostitutes while abroad, and he showed us photos, bragged, etc. Because I have been friends with the bride to be for 20 years, I started to get to know and hang out with her fiance a bit more over the past few months. He seemed like a good guy, and I enjoyed hanging with him, but after hearing that news I really felt obligated to tell my friend the truth. I've always had an inkling he wasn't the most faithful partner. At the time, I felt like I did the right thing by telling her, but now I am doubting my choice, as the wedding is in 3 weeks. Although my friend is glad I told her and said she has no ill feelings about it, she doesn't believe he actually did it. I'm not getting involved any further at the moment. Just looking for advice on anyone that's been in this situation. 

For those that think I violated bro code, I guess I did. But I'm closer to my friend than some of my guy friends. Our families also know each other. So that code is bullshit because her fiance isn't someone I want to be associated with going forward. ",06Jun2018,246
198,"Alright, so today I was waiting for a bus and a shady looking man comes up to me (The way he looks just screams ""I will sell your internal organs). He comes up to me and asks what time is it. I reply and he asks if my bus is coming soon. At that point I was already kinda skeptical and told him that I don't know. He goes away. I put on my earphones and continue waiting. After not even 2 minutes he taps my shoulder. He literally asked me where do I live. In a hurry I told him where do I live, just a part of the city, and immediately after I realized what a fucking retard I am for doing it. He puts on a fucking smile and says: ''Oh yeah, I have a house there, you did look familiar."" I nod but I am getting ready to grab something from the floor and shove it up his face. He then proceeds to talk how he is a student and not from here. He is over 40 at least. At that point I was getting sort of mad and told him ''Okay''. Then he asks me in which school do I go, and again, like a fucking imbecile I am, I tell him what he wants to know hoping that he will finally go the fuck away. Finally my bus arrives and I go in. I was expecting him to follow me so I prepared scissors in my backpack in case I need to pull them out quickly and stab him in the fat gut or neck. But he does not follow me. 

And what do I do now. I am almost certain he will approach me again and that would probably be the easiest, I would pull my scissors out and probably kill him, my only worry is that I don't get his neck for the first time and he notices. That would be much easier than waiting for things to happen on their own like this. I mean, it is self-defense, right? :D",06Jun2018,2
199,"Hi there c: Firstly thank you very much for reading this and apologies if this feels somewhat spacey and poorly written, I’m just trying to get all my thoughts out on paper. I hope to gain some insight into this issue and I apologise if things don’t make sense, if there is any need for additional clarification I’m happy to provide it.

Background:

So me and my room mate Bert have known each other for around 3.5 years now and have been living together for around the past 4 months. We met through a hook\-up with his now ex\-boyfriend Ernie, from the minute I met them both I knew that we’d get on really well and over the next two years I had a wonderful friendship with Bert and Ernie, with some fun on the side (sorry for the disturbing mental imagery of sexual muppets :c).

After the two years both mine and Bert’s relationship with Ernie deteriorated for different reasons, and in the end they split and we all went our separate ways, but still in contact with one another. After another year Bert wanted to move out of his area and closer to mine, and at the time I was living alone and not loving it so we decided to move in together! Cut to now.

Now:

Living with Bert is awesome. We have lots in common and get on really well with each other. I could really see myself being with him but I’m not entirely sure he feels the same way about things. We’re affectionate with each other though I find it’s mainly me who makes the first move, though I’m very much a touchy\-feely person, and he is somewhat reserved/low libido and I have mentioned to him before that I feel like I’m bothering him by wanting to cuddle but he assured me that wasn’t the case and whenever I do ask for some kind of “attention” and he says no for whatever reason I’m always respectful. We usually kiss each other when we come home from work and before we go to sleep, and maybe once a week we'll do something sexual. I just feel like if he likes me too then he'd be more keen to be close to me?

The main reason I don’t want to say anything to him is that I don’t want to make things awkward for him as we will be living together for at least another 9\-ish months, also I know that other guys are always after him, asking him out etc and he always tells me that it’s so annoying and awkward when they do that and I don’t wanna be another person doing that to him :c

Another reason I don’t want to say anything is that currently the state of my mental health is fairly poor, I have quite bad anxiety that I’m currently working on improving but I understand that makes me not the most AMAZING person to be around, much less a potential romantic partner, but Bert is very accommodating and understanding about this which helps c:

\*\*TL;DR; \*\* I have feelings for my room mate but I don’t think he feels entirely the same way about me so should I look to confess in some manner or do nothing and still have a pretty good time c:

So what do Reddit?? Do I try and say something to him or do I try to continue to live a pretty happy home life with the thought that one day he might meet someone who he likes and starts something with them peculating my sub\-conscious? Thank you for reading and I hope you all have a wonderful day \&lt;3",06Jun2018,0
201,"As the title says I feel like my life is going no where. I feel like a failure. I've been out of high school for 2 years now and haven't done anything with my life. No job. No volunteering. No hobbies. No interests. No friends. Nothing. I spend my days fantasizing about the future and coming up with scenarios in my head which would never come true, or I'll browse Reddit/Imgur/Porn and waste my hours. I don't want to end up living as a NEET with my parents for the rest of my life or till they kick me out. I'm too afraid to go out and do something with my life.

I want to move to the city to put myself out of my comfort zone and force myself to act. I also want to move to the city because I like the feel of being anonymous in the crowd and no one knowing me. But the 4k that I have in savings won't go far and I'll end up on the streets most likely. Getting a job needs experience and references, while getting a room in a share house needs references payslips etc. I have none of those.

My confidence and self esteem is not very high. On top of that I blush a lot at nothing (probably due to self esteem), which causes me to shy away from things. I cant picture myself in a job at all. I go red even when talking to my family sometimes. It pisses me off. I know all this is in my head but I don't know how to go about it. Can't see a therapist for it cause I live in the middle of whoop whoop and it costs money.

I realize a LOT of people have it worse than me and I'm being self centred, but I just feel hopeless about it all. I know what my problems are but I just don't want to fix them. I should stay at my parent home and go do some volunteering, then get a job, save up money for a year or two then move on. But I just want to leave and be independent even though it is a stupid idea and I most likely won't be able to get a job after trying to move.

Sorry for the being all over the place with this post. I just feel like my life is a mess (like this post) and just wanted to get this off my chest. Any advice you all have is most welcome. Should I take a giant leap that will most likely cause me to fall or should I take baby steps?",06Jun2018,6

203,"Hey y’all, first time posting here. I’m at a bit of a cross roads in life career wise. I’ll be graduating college this December with a bachelors of science in marketing. I’m a huge sports fan and took an internship at my local minor league baseball team. It’s been a great opportunity for me but lately I’m not so sure if it’s the field for me. So many of them say how terrible the money is in sports, as well as the hours which I’ve learned real quick. I love sports but I’m not sure if I’m willing to sacrifice more financial support and time with my future family. 

Me and my girlfriend talk about marriage a lot now a days and I know a family isn’t very far off barring anything weird happening.

I’ve been on dating apps pretty much since I was 18 outside of my one relationship since then that wasn’t found online. In my history of online dating I’ve sent a shit load of messages, had a lot of replies, had some conversation, and only met one woman in person. 

I’m not an ugly person. I by no means won any sort of genetic lottery but I’m an average joe so to speak when it comes to physical appearance. 

I live in suburbia and I’ve had a hard timing finding events to go to. I don’t drink alcohol. I spent time in another city recently and would always go to this one tea spot, and chatted to a few women, even got a number once, but still nothing every came of it.

207,"Me and my partner are planning parenthood, but have so far kept this quiet.

My sister in law has a 3 and a 1 year old and I don’t agree to how they raise their kids but you know, that’s their choice. 

I often see my inlaws interact/babysit the 2 kids from my sister in law and I really wouldn’t appreciate them handling my child that way. To give an example, if they refuse to eat dinner, without even trying to get them to eat it, they will offer candy, sweets etc to the child. 

They also talk about how they ignore all sister in laws instructions for the kids as they think it’s bullshit. This goes as fas as not applying medical cream because it makes the child cry.

They hardly pay attention and let the kids walk outside by themselves or go upstairs etc.

Without even knowing about our plans for kids, they have told us we are idiots if we don’t get at least 2 children and that nothing good comes from only children (I’m an only child myself...)

They disagree with out diet choices and have refused to cater to that multiple times. So we stopped having dinner there to not complicate things. 

They are already counting on the fact that they can babysit/see our ‘children’ regularly, as they have told us many times. My partner waves it away as if it’ll be alright once the child is born but I feel very uncomfortable with this. He doesn’t want to start a fight with his parents.

- gotten a scholarship, with monthly pays
- won first place in 2 competitions
- got easy subjects with easy/good drs (can get As in all)
- signed for an internship &amp; research
- covered the financial situation at home w/my scholarship money

This school semester I had, 
- messed up sleep cycle/food/quit working out
- skipped many classes like crazy
- screwed up my grades in the easiest subjects...although I had worked to ease my way in prior
- everything was done 30 mins b4 class/same day be it study for quizzes/do hws...etc...At least I'd studied my final a day before?
- mostly the competitions wasted my time, I only benefited of teamwork from 1 of them..the other I ended up making alone although we were 4+
- doing work took a long time...it's like my brain went out the window, until I took sometime off but instead I stopped moving much..

This year I had, 
- spent all of my scholarship money on paying family loans
- tried reaching out to ppl online..it worked for few weeks, but instead it became a distraction, they needed me more
- lost joy in many things...including gaming and music..

- realized the only way to escape losing my freedom now is by getting married, although I don't wish to..

Issue:
- I'd checked my blood levels/health, they're normal

I don't know what happened, I had prepared for this semeste alot  during winter off, preparing reports to get time to study more .I dug for tutors' contact in case I skipped class,

I have no dependable friends, no legit hobbies..Literally my time is spent on school 75% worrying about school 20% and 5% utube etc

214,"Hi, I'm an adolescent. I've got a story to tell. Before I begin, some details have been changed due privacy reasons. Also, I don't have the best social skills but I'm learning. I'm usually peer pressured into doing things I don't want to do. I'm on the quiet side and I like to be the people pleaser. Let's begin.

I go to school in the United States and I am currently still in school. Whether it's College or High-school, you won't know. I used to have a single friend, we'll call him Erin. I used to go over to his house since Elementary school. He used to get physical with me, IE drawing on my clothes and other childish things. I didn't mind it. I used to play MMORPGs and RPGs on my little laptop, making me a computer nerd before I knew how to do Algebra One. I had a ton of online friends, but they either stopped talking to me or I stopped talking to them I just got busy, that's all.

When I switched to the school that I'm currently enrolled in (had about 5 or 6 under my belt), I met my friend RiceGum (A pseudonym, not actually the youtuber.). Things started off kind of smooth, talking about our favorite superheros and technology. Then, one day, I stumbled upon this website where I met my S/O.

So, my S/O lives a long way from me. But I love her. I love her to death. The first couple of months Sharon and I were talking, RiceGum was really supportive. Always asking about her and how we were doing (but as I'm typing this, I'm starting to realize that it wasn't b/c he was checking up on us.) I suddenly stop hanging out with him for about 2 weeks, best two weeks of my life IMO. Let's just say he insulted some of my family members (and then, after being called out, proceeded to play it off as a joke.) But again, we start being friends again b/c he wrote me a passive-aggressive sorry (saying how it was both of our faults.) Later in class, he confronts me and tells me his S/O said I was a fake friend. I shrugged my shoulders and said to myself, ""what do I care?""

Now, if I disagree with something he says he always says ""did your S/O make you agree with [insert pronoun]."" I quit doing a hobby because I didn't like my environment, I should say. I tell him and he crudely makes it seem like my S/O pressured me into quitting. Did I stand up for myself? Yes.

I might be over-reacting but I don't like receiving text messages on my SMS bc it has a different text tone than whatsapp. He always texts me on SMS and it feels me with sheer anxiety and dread b/c I'm so used to being questioned 24/7 on there. ""What're you doing?"" or ""why aren't you hanging out?""

But recently, he only texts me when he wants something or to give me his opinion on something he thinks he could ""destroy me"" with if I disagreed. I usually get told to shut the f*** up if I disagree with him on more serious subjects (IE: Politics for example.) I don't like having conversations with someone who I feel has an ulterior motive. My mental health, without talking to him, has improved 10x fold. I don't want to drop him as a friend but at the same time I dont want to be friends with someone who thinks it's okay to talk gang up on me and belittle my ideas in the group but afterwords act like he's my buddy and tell me my relationship is ""toxic"" b/c I'd rather spend more time w/ my S/O than any other person.

217,"I've had a close friend since we were 11 (now 26) and for the last 8 years he was one of my primary drinking buddies. Typical reminiscing of where life was going, pledging to be each others best men whenever we started dating someone new, all that. But right out of high school, he developed a drinking problem stemming from family issues, etc.

Every few times we would go out for a drink, he'd get blackout drunk and the night would rapidly spiral out of control. It would range from fabricating unbelievable stories, verbally abusing strangers, destroying property, and on more than one occasion assaulting our friends and/or myself (choking, kicking, glassing, threatening to beat the shit out of someone). He'd recall nothing the next day and despite constant attempts to control his drinking, over the years all his friends began to distance themselves from him. Except me.

It has been 9 years of this (I've been wilfully ignorant that I was in fact perpetuating this problem until a year ago). For context I've had my fair share of binge drinking and multi-day benders, so I don't think I'm overreacting. But I'm at a loss as to how to proceed. I've quit ever drinking with him again. I don't feel safe being around him when alcohol is even remotely accessible, nor do I feel safe letting him be around my partner, family or friends. I also don't want to completely abandon the guy because I think I'm his last friend, and my walking out will be the last straw.

When writing with a pen, drawing over places where the ink didn't fully come out and left (even a little, unnoticeable) empty space. Moving my cursor *right* to the centre of a line of text so it's perfectly lined up, sometimes then moving it either up, down, left or right from the text so it touches every part since otherwise it doesn't feel right. Now I've started to write out the whole alphabet in the middle of sentences, making sure I don't miss any letters, or it feels weird again.

If I don't do these things, I'm not exactly anxious, but they drag on my nerves. I feel very uncomfortable, keep thinking of the thing that wasn't completely perfect (or is this anxiety? I don't really know). This has gotten worse, and is sometimes taking up a lot of time. Writing takes longer at school because I have to get every letter right. And because you humanly can't do everything perfect most of the time (like hitting keyboard keys exactly in the center or hard enough) I feel ""unsatisfied"" and sort of weird a lot of the time. It sometimes doesn't let me relax, especially now when I've consciously thought about it this entire time I've been writing (it's slowly killing me right now).

222,"Sorry for formatting, on mobile. 

I'm a 19 year old male from Scotland and I'm currently unable to work or go to university/college due to mental illness (I was attending university in September 2017 studying psychology but had to leave a month into the course because I was really struggling to cope with the stress and commitment whilst trying to battle with my own issues).
I have severe depression and anxiety which prevents me from getting outside the house on my own and I'm also being tested for some sort of psychosis - my nurse reckons it could be schizoaffective disorder or psychotic depression. However I'm not on any benefits like PIP etc as I've heard how difficult it is to actually get accepted.

Now, I live with my mother and sister, parents are seperate, dad is living close by and we still see him on a weekly basis, he is also giving my mother money every month but I'm not entirely sure of how much she gets. Mum works a part time job at a plumbers merchants and only earns something like 11k a year but does hair dressing for friends and family on occasion for extra money. Sister has only just started high school so she obviously can't contribute financially and we don't expect her to either. 

While we aren't exactly impoverished it is still a struggle for us to live happily and the strain on my mother to provide for us is starting to take its toll on her. My question is, what can we do to help stabilise our financial situation? Mum only receives some benefits since I'm no longer considered a child and is about £500 down simply because of my age and it makes me feel so useless to be unable to help.

I'm so scared to go out and meet people though. I want to meet people and I'd like to go out to clubs or pubs just to see what it's like but I'm afraid because I would be going by myself. I worry that I could be attacked or something.

I don't have a job or study obligations etc so I don't have opportunity to meet people there.

224,"This kind of a stupid scenario I know. 

Basically last year I organised a dinner at a buffet we're all familiar with. Most told me they couldn't come which was fine. 3 didn't bother telling me in the group and it kinda rubbed me the wrong way. It hurts to see them attend others but not show up at all for I plan. I accidentally messaged 1/2 to personally invite (him and another person had the same name) and he ignored that, and in the group chat too.

Now to be fair, I'm not close with them anymore. And didn't want to be for one reason or another. I've let most of those reasons go since I've forgotten most of the reasons but I was kind of the odd one out of the group and they weren't always the nicest of people at times during school days. And I felt like if I ever retaliated back they'd just back up the other person.

So I slowly just kept my distance a little after we left school and just attended a few organised things here and there. I found it hard to cut them off completely over the years but I've not seen any of them since August so that's that. I went to a birthday of one of the guys who bailed on my birthday simply because I had nothing else going on in the day, and shouldn't have went.

I'm kind of done holding grudges to any of them because the negative shit was 4 years ago and I started doing my own thing after and found better friends. 

So, 2 of the gatherings are organised by 2 people who no showed last year, and I'm conflicted whether or not to attend them. 

Before I just attended outings because I didn't wanna be at home all day and pretend I wasn't lonely but I don't have bad blood with anyone. I'm just never gonna organise anything with them again.

**TLDR: Don't know whether or not to attend 2 gatherings of people who bailed on my birthday. I guess kind of to prove a point of that if they don't value my time I won't be there for them.**",06Jun2018,1
225,"Hi everyone,

my mother has recently changed her name of FB to her real one. Before this, she had used her account with the name of the fanpage that she was managing. She was once asked to verify herself with a photo, but not with an ID. She passed it, I guess that she had to do this because that she had no friends, she was just managing her fan page.

  
She didn’t have any issues since and she had always had her phone number added to her account.

About a week ago, she started to use her profile normally, including putting on her real name and datas, like birth date, etc…She also started to add some friends and also received a lot of friend requests.

So, my question is that does Facebook deletes users for previous issues? **Like will they delete my mom’s account because she had prevously used a nickname, than her page’s name as her account’s name, even if she uses her profile 100\% normally now**? Or will the system detect as something suspicious that she has only made friends now(about 40\-50 only) and simply shut down her account?

Thank you very much indeed in advance.",06Jun2018,1

238,"Why recycle right? It lowers the cost of recycling, makes it more economically viable, and makes recycled materials more usable to manufacturers. In some places, recycling programs have been removed since contamination is so high and many recycling providers are charging fees because they must slow down the separation process to remove non\-recyclable items. 

 1. No flexible plastics\- In almost every case the numbers that your recycling hauler takes only applies to rigid plastics. Flexible plastics are lighter weight, have different melting points and jam up separation machines at the materials recovery facility (or recycling plant). Grocery bags, air cushions and film overwraps may have a 2 or 4 recycling symbol, but they can only be recycled via drop\-off locations (See: https://www.plasticfilmrecycling.org  ) 

2. Don’t bag recyclables\- as mentioned above flexible plastics like bags can’t be recycled. Bagging recyclables often increases the likelihood of them ending up in a landfill since it is very tedious and time consuming for workers to open bags. Most companies require recyclables to be on the bin loose and require any recyclables placed in black trash bags to be thrown out for safety reasons. If you need to use a bag to collect your recyclables, just dump the contents into you bin and reuse the bag. 

 3. No food, liquids or hazardous chemicals (i.e. pesticides, paint and motor oil) in containers\- all containers need to be empty prior to recycling. Food contaminates other items and causes materials to go to the landfill and liquids destroy the quality of paper and cardboard (sending them to the landfill) and create a mess at the plant 

 4. No multi\-composition items\- items like pumps, triggers, toys, frozen food bags, housewares, waxed paper cups and wrappers contain more than one type of material, which makes them too complex to recycle. 

 5. No 2D plastics (i.e. loose lids, disks, CDs, utensils, sheets)\- materials are sorting by shape to separate paper and cardboard from containers. Flat pieces of plastic sometimes mix in with the paper and bypass quality control, causing contamination of bales of paper/cardboard  

6. Ask your recycling provider if they accept: plastic cups (#1,5,6 rigid), milk/juice cartons, plastic boxes/clamshells (#1,6), microwavable dishes (#5), and plastic buckets (these items are sometimes accepted) 

7. Discard trigger or pump before recycling a soap or spray bottle (pumps and triggers are multi\-composition)  ",06Jun2018,2

245,"Me (26/f) and my boyfriend (25/m) have been together almost 3 years now.

He is very easy going, which is wonderful. But I find myself way too often overloaded with decisions or things to take care of and he just goes with the flow. 

If I ask him to do a simple task and it's something he can do right then or there (usually physical tasks) he will do it. But anything about planning for the future or thinking about something is like pulling teeth.

What I'm currently having trouble with (and kind of feeling like I'm being pushed to my breaking point)....like I said, we've been together for almost 3 years. Last year when our lease was up on our apartment we decided we wanted to travel and find small jobs during our travels to support ourselves. This was supposed to happen for a year or two while we stock piled some money to buy a house. After about 3 months (after we put all of our saving towards this, got rid of most of our belongings, and sold my perfectly fine car to buy an SUV to travel around in, and I liquidated my business) he decided he wanted to go back to our home town.

I was very sad about the whole situation, but I wasn't going to let it ruin our relationship, so I agreed to come back. We agreed we would stay with our parents for a while and really buckle down for preparing for a house, marriage, family, etc. 

Since we've been back (8 months) he has taken his not so good job back, I took a job at a company that is known to be shitty on my field of work (not great working conditions and very underpaid). I've been paying off our debts from buying the car and $2k we borrowed from my parents. He is JUST getting around to buying a car (hopefully this month, but possibly longer away) and we are no closer to getting a house. We live with our parents about an hour away from each other. We see each other for 1 1/2, 2 days a week if we are lucky. Which means I spent about 2 hours to get him and 2 hours take him home. 

When I try to talk about a house he seems annoyed, but if I directly ask him what the deal is he will (sometimes with an argument) say that he wants to get our lives moving and thing will ""just happen"". He doesn't want to think about it or talk about it....he thinks it will ""just happen"".

He has also started hanging out with some new friends I've never met maybe 4 times a week very late at night. Apparently he goes and hangs out and smokes weed (we both smoke). He even lied to me one of the times about relaxing at home only later to slip up and tell me he was hanging out with friends. I haven no problem with him hanging out with friends and never have....but I do feel like we were pretty settled down before and now he is acting like a teenager. 

I'm just starting to feel insecure about everything and it's freaking me out because I'm getting older. 

I've always prided how strong and great and mature our relationship is, but now I'm feeling like I'm putting in a lot of effort and not getting as much back as I need. 

I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to break up, but I want a house and a family and I don't want to have to beg for it. I also want some security. 

Sorry for the long rambling post, I'm just very stressed.

250,"I have been with my boyfriend for about 3 years and we have been living together for 2. When we moved in together, he left the suburbs to come with me to the city (not really far away from each other). Since then, he sees his friends very less often because they don't want to come to the city and/or he doesn't wanna go there.

He has been working at the same place for 2 years also, without any vacation (but we did plan one for September). 

Although he doesn't have much more symptoms than emptyness and sadness, I'm wondering what could it be. Depression? Burnout? Or simply just extended fatigue and anxiety that led him to this?

He always says that he feels like he's not doing anything, that life is boring, and often uses videogames as a loophole, and because he says it's the only way he can connect with his friends.
He cries from time to time, saying that he doesn't understand the feelings he's having, that he doesn't understand what's going on with him, and why he always feels like this.

I've asked him many times if he feels maybe it's the relationship, but it doesn't seems like it is. He did say in the past that in order to make me happy, he has to find his own happiness first, and that he is scared that would put me aside.

255,"So recently,   I've been questioning whether or not I should drop a friendship with a   guy I don't know if I could even consider a friend. Let's call him  Zack.

We  met 3 years ago on an online  game and played on it for a while.  Eventually the game dies but he  messages me around at the end of the  summer in the same year to add him  on skype (and he had girlfriend that  would also play with us) and  we've been playing pretty much ever since.

He'd   buy me games that we'd play together on Christmas and he seemed like a   pretty nice guy.About a year ago,  his girlfriend left him and she  told  me that he was controlling since he questioned her after she  seemed to  be flirty with a boy on her snapchat (even it actually turned  out that  she left Zack for the guy she was flirty with). Anyway, she  reveals that  one time she found sexts of him with other girls months  prior to her  leaving him but she forgave him anyway at the time and  Zack's excuse to  me a week ago was ""I stopped before she even found  them."" and said that  he really loved her.

Personally,  I am  strongly opposed to cheating. He even continued this when he got a  new  girlfriend but claimed that he wasn't a ""fuckboy"".

We   also play games with his childhood friend who also recently cheated on  a  girl he went to school with for some other which I absolutely  despise.  Zack didn't seem to have anything to say against it. We'll  call this  ""friend"" Danny.

Moving on,  when we play  together, we say some pretty offensive things.  I'm black  and also gay  (though I'm not out but he isn't homophobic) and I really  don't mind him  saying ""nigger"" or ""faggot"" (I think anyone should use  the word and  should hold it in a less high regard) since I say it too.  Recently  however, its been bothering me since it feels exclusively  directed  towards me. When the word is used, it's either at people we  are playing  against (though they can't hear him) or at me and not at  either of the  other ""friends"" we play with. He also constantly makes  racist dad jokes  which I don't really care about but they grew unfunny  after the 10th  time they were told.

He  also doesn't seem  to care about the concerns of others from my view.  The girl that Danny  (Zack's friend) was in a relationship with (not the  one he cheated on)  took offense to something that Zack said and she  called him out for it  and left the call we were in. She was offended by  what he said because  it was sexually related and it had to do with a  problem she and Danny  had during intercourse and it was clearly  personal and she's made it  clear that she doesn't want her business  shared. But he told me and even  told others in our ""friend group"" about  her problem.

Since  we met online, he  wanted to see what I looked like so I sent him a  terrible picture of me   about 3 years ago that I even regret taking and  that same day he  showed everyone in the group and they made fun of me in  a skype call. I  didn't say anything but I felt like crying since I am  extremely self  conscious about my appearance and I thought I could open  up to him.  More recently, last summer, I told him I didn't want him  sending photos  of me to other people and I thought I could trust that he  wouldn't but  just two days ago, I found out that he sent pictures of me  Danny's  girlfriend for whatever reason.

He  also  talks bad about two other people in our friend group (regarding  their  skill in games) and today we also got into an ""argument"" (he  called it)  over a game. Basically, I said points don't matter and he  kept  twisting the subject to a different aspect of the game that had  nothing  to do what we were talking about and essentially claimed that I  was  jealous for bringing it up. When I said forget about, he referenced  his  ex girlfriend claiming that I was doing the same thing she would do   (bring up and argument and try to end it) and then called me a know it   all.

I would also make ironically   immature ""jokes"" like responding ""your mom"". This morning, he said ""you   know you're a stupid nigger right"" in the words of Tana Mongeau and I responded ""your mom"" and he actually told her I said what he said and also   an hour prior to writing this, he trapped the ball in a game and said   something ""and I responded your mom's a trap"" and also told her I said   that. Based on the tone of his voice, I assumed he didn't care but his   parents did. Before they went to bed, his mom went to his room and I   could hear her tell him ""tell \[my name\] to stop saying mean thing about me""   but I couldn't tell if she was being serious or not based on her natural  tone of voice. He responded ""I know he's being mean to me too"" all of   which happened only a Zack responded twice ""It's a joke"" but I feel like it had something to do   with me or him regarding the subject matter but I couldn't tell. We didn't talk about it after. Regardless, I feel guilty for it.

Zack is the closest thing I have to a friend since my homophobic ""friend"" at school is transferring.

I was accepted into an arts university and the fall after high school I attended there for a year. I worked a part time job and juggled school alongside it. Everything was fine until I realized the program I was studying wasn't really what I wanted to do. I was pursuing Psychology but my heart was definitely not in it. I was also going through some heavy mental health issues and family problems. I ended up leaving that university after my first year and applying to the community college in my city to study to be a Practical Nurse. The problem there, is that there's a huge waiting list in my city to get into this program. I was told I would have to wait a year so I ended up having last year off to work full time and get some life experience. I worked a few jobs until I found one I really enjoyed. I'm currently working in homecare (I work with the elderly and disabled to make their lives easier in their homes and encourage independence for as long as possible). A few months ago I called the community college to check on my waitlist status and they told me that I still had a few years of waiting to do until I could make it in. This crushed me. I was expecting to make it into school this fall and I was finally excited to move on with my life. Now, I have my own apartment and I'm working full time still. I live with my boyfriend and my brother. They both have wonderful jobs through a co-op program through their university degrees that pay them more than double what I make. I feel so stuck at my job and sitting around not making any progress. Currently, my homecare job requires me to sit next to a bedridden client 8 hours each day. So I find myself getting very anxious and depressed because I feel like I'm not DOING anything. I guess the whole situation of being stuck waiting and working a job where I'm not doing a lot is really weighing down on me. I just need some life advice because it's affecting my mental health. I find myself slipping back into my depression and I fear I'm lashing out at other people because I feel so frustrated with my situation.",06Jun2018,1
257,"Pretty long post/story. Sorry.

I currently live with my boyfriend, and his brother. His brother has two dogs. A german sheppard/lab mix, and a catahoula leopard dog. The catahoula leopard dog is a little over 1, and the german/lab is like 7 or 8. I've been living here for nearly a year now.   


The catahoula leopard dog is in a kennel all day that he can barely stand in, and all night. The dog constantly cries/barks and it's the most deafening noise. BF's brother does hardly the bare minimum to take care of said dog. He takes him out maybe once or twice a day and feeds him on a very inconsistent schedule (if he remembers to. sometimes he leaves work in the morning and doesn't take them out or feed them). The dog has shit and pissed himself in the kennel before and the brother has waited hours before doing anything about it. The brother also tends to beat the dog and make the dog yelp in agony.  When he gets super mad at said dog, he makes giant holes in the wall by kicking or punching the walls in.

The german sheppard is never in a kennel, only when we're eating because he tends to get in your face to beg. 

Me and the boyfriend have started to take care of the dogs more because it is hard to deal with. I take them out when I get home from work and we are the sometimes the ones to feed them. The brother tends to not refill their water, either. We do that.  He sometimes doesn't buy food when they run out for a couple of days.

More about the living situation. The house is technically their moms house and I pay rent along with the boyfriend that goes directly to her. The mom is aware of all the shitty things her son does, but constantly makes excuses for him; ""He had a bad day at work"", ""He's tired"" etc etc. I was once in an abusive and manipulative relationship before this, and have expressed my concerns to their mother about how I'm scared of him and it brings back the trauma. Her reply was just to ""Move out.""

I would move out honestly \- but I don't want to cause issues between me and my boyfriend and I cannot afford a place on my own. We were saving to move into our own place but my boyfriend recently lost his job so that is currently on hold.

If anyone knows anything about catahoulas \- they're a very high energy breed that don't do well with isolation so this dog is just miserable. 

We let him out every now and again, but he doesn't get along well with the other dog and it causes issues sometimes.  If he's left alone, he chews up everything.

This dog is not ours, should not be our responsibility yet we take care of them due to the fact they would be even worse if we did not.

The catahoula has developed bed sores on his belly to the point there is no fur, and we have noticed sores on his paw as if he'd been chewing on it. Told the brother about it. 

""Yeah.""

That was the only response.

I'm getting really close to snapping and I want to confront him, but I'm honestly scared about him snapping and beating the shit out of me. All I want is to re\-home the catahoula. It's not right for the dog and it's extremely frustrating and I don't want to do. I have no idea how I can convince him to give up the dog without him losing his shit because we have to walk on eggshells. ",06Jun2018,2
259,"So I just graduated high school. My grandparents let me live with them, but now that high school is over they’re saying I can’t live with them at all anymore due to not enough space. I tried to tell them I’d pay rent, but they genuinely don’t care enough to let me stay some more. I’ve never had a job and I’m expected to get a full time job during the summer and school year to pay rent which will be anywhere from 550-800$ a month. It will only be a small room not a full apartment ( I can deal with that) What I can’t deal with is the amount of money I’m gonna magically pull out of my ass. Minimum wage around here 13.50$ if I were to work at least 40 hours a week I’d make 2,160 $ not including taxes. How the fuck do I pay my rent, pay my community college classes, pay for food, car insurance and basic necessities with just fucking 2,000$

260,"Original advice post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8mshnx/whats_the_best_thing_to_say_to_my_neighbors_to/?utm_source=reddit-android

So, since I'm jobless at the moment and generally too depressed to go outside unless I have to, I actually haven't seen these guys in a while. When I do go out, I try to time my departure for when I don't hear them yucking it up outside. 

I actually left two days ago. I was in miserable back pain, and wanted comfort food. I heard no racket outside, so I felt it was safe to leave without getting catcalled. 

Unfortunately, as I was walking around the back to my car, they were walking up from the back, all three in a row. The most vocal of the three yells, ""hey sexy!!"" at me.

So, back pain does a certain thing to a person's mood. I was basically waddling and a little cranky, and everyone's advice went completely out the window. 

I said: ""Stop it. Just stop. Stop hitting on me. I don't like it."" I kept walking. All three have had different reactions. 

The short one seems to respect it. He was outside when I came back. He recognized my waddle was from back pain and sympathized. No mention of what I'd said, and no compliments on my bare shoulders.

I haven't seen the meth addict, which is strange because he's almost always outside waiting for a chance to talk to someone. 

The one with white hair, though... he's the one who said ""hey sexy"" and he's pouting. 

Boyfriend came to visit last night, and we went to the gas station for beer. On the way to his car, we stop so he can admire a car parked on the street out front. I'm standing on the sidewalk when White Hair walks past. Me, being friendly and wanting to express no hard feelings like with Short Guy, I said hey to him. 

Nothing. No response. Didn't even look at me. Walked through the grass to his front door to stay as far away from me as possible. 

Boyfriend was oblivious to it, because he was taking pictures of the nice car. I told him what happened when we got to his car, laughing. 

BF: ""I guess you're a bitch now, huh... lol""

ME: ""Yep. He probably expects me to apologize like 'aww, it's ok, you can objectify me all you want.'""

I know this is how he feels because this is how he acted when I snapped at him over hanging out near my bedroom window. Maybe I'm too nice in assuming he meant it when he said he really was just playing with my cat in the window and wasn't trying to peep on me. I told him as kindly as possible that I still felt like my privacy was being invaded and he should stop. For six months he ignored my existence and acted all hurt and dejected when I saw him.

I tell myself, ""It's okay to just do what I'm doing, while I make sure that I don't fall prey to any stereotypes.""

265,"My friend rejected me a year ago, and it still hurts because she's the only person I've ever liked in my life. However, I accepted her rejection (because she's trying to figure herself out an us on the asexual spectrum) and I haven't brought it up since I asked her. The thing is, she was also the only person I confided to about my depression. I told her thoughts that now make me cringe and cry because of the things I told her. I told her about my depression after I confessed but before I asked why she rejected me. I talked to her regularly but I didn't make every conversation about my depression, we also talked about our mutual interests. 

Anyways, in our next text conversation and three days after I asked her about the rejection a year ago, I told her about my suicide attempt without even paying attention to the previous discourse of the conversation. It really looked like manipulation, and I can't shake the fact that she probably thinks I tried to manipulate hey into liking or guilt-tripping her into feeling bad about rejecting me. In truth, my dad abuses me emotionally and verbally when he comes over and though I'm 20, it hit really hard. I have a lot of hate for myself because I look just like him. I told her that I tried suicide but I didn't tell her why or what caused me to choose that because I didn't want to know how dysfunctional my family is and I didn't want be to get involved with my family as well. She helped but I could tell something changed in her. She stopped laughing over text but in person, she laughs a lot and I make her laugh.

(Note: I stopped talking to her about my depression last year and sought help, I kept talking to her via text since theh and I never brought up anything dealing with my depression until I formally apologized to get). 

I feel like we're a lot closer and she showed that when we're hanging out with mutual friends. She's always smiling at me and telling the others about the funny things we talked about. Even when it's just us, we're laughing and chatting. We even had a semi-serious conversation in the car on the way home. I can tell she likes to talk to me, and from the last time we hung out, I can tell she cares about me. She said that hurt my feelings when we hung out and I brought it up to her, and she said she never meant to hurt my feelings and that if it happens again, to please let her know. She is also comfortable taking to me about sex and romance and genitals, and had indirectly told me that she prefers guys to girl and that she likes the idea of dating. When we hug, dependent on who's around, our hugs vary. In front of her brother, side hug. But when it's just us, it's more of a cuddle, even with my hand in her lower waist and she never minds. I have apologized for the way I hugged her but she never remembers them or seems to care.

What I'm trying to say is it's like she treats me better even though I told her about my suicide attempt. And I just don't get it. It's to the point where had I not told people that she rejected me (on Reddit), they would have said that she definitely likes as more and wants you as more (which I secretly want and like). But know I won't disregard her boundaries like that. It's just that I realized that she truly is a good friend to me and that something in my life that I don't have. I want her and like her as a good friend but I do still like her as more.

However, I feel like me telling about my suicide attempt really ruined any chance I had with her in the future, and it hurts because she's the only person I've ever liked. I never intended to come off as manipulative, and the day haunts me every night. Everytime I read a story on Reddit about an abusive ex says that threatens their SO with suicide, I can't help but feel like that's me. ",06Jun2018,1

268,"When I was  and younger (21 and under), I was always the smart kid that everyone talked highly about. I did everything correctly and obeyed the law to the best of my ability. I tried hard in school, work, and relationships. I read a lot, invested and saved a lot of my money, never drank or did illegal drugs, and focused on making my future great. I had great references from jobs and professors and I was the model citizen. 

Now I'm 22, and I've gone downhill. I feel as if I just don't care about things like I used to, and I know it's not going to get me anywhere in the long-run. I haven't cared much about reading anymore or learning new things, I don't care much about my jobs and just want to get my paycheck and leave. I have problems with challenging authority now over ridiculous rules, even though when I was younger, I did whatever I was told regardless. 

I've been fired twice in the past six months for being late a lot and retaliating against customers when they start yelling at me (I worked in banking). For example: a lady came in yelling at me because I wouldn't refund her overdraft fee. I then yelled out all the Taco Bell and McDonald's transactions she made when her account was low and printed her an account cancellation form and told her to go to Wells Fargo across the street when she threatened to close her account. It caused a big scene in the already-crowded bank. Corporate did not like that. This was completely out of character for me.

I also have been smoking a lot of weed and using other substances, even though I know I could face a felony if caught. I would have never done this before out of fear of ruining my future, but now I'm just not bothered because if I get arrested for drug charges, I'm just going to commit suicide. I also used to save money a lot and wanted to start investing, but now whenever I get paid, I just buy expensive things that I want and buy weed from the neighbor. I even have sex with any girl I can and not worried about pregnancy, even though I know that would fuck my life up. I'm cursing a lot more and listening to music that I normally wouldn't, such as rap and heavy metal. 

I feel as if I'm just living day-to-day. I'm not worried about the future, and the people that looked up to me are no longer thinking well of me. It seems as if I just became ignorant and uncaring over the course of a year. I no longer have a filter, and just do and say whatever I want. I know this is wrong, but I just don't care to change. It's like my brain chemistry just decided to change suddenly and turn me into my dad, who is exactly like what I described in myself (he had 12 kids, did drugs, and committed suicide to bail out of child support by all the women).

270,"My brother (22 years old) has been diagnosed with Asperger's and something related to the way he processes information HOWEVER for school he has always gotten accommodation, tutoring, psychologists, various therapies, etc. 

He's always gotten bad grades and it seems it's because he doesn't care (he is known to play video games instead). I've _personally_ studied with him for a class and have gotten an A while he's gotten at most a C. He's studied with *other* tutors and has not fared well either in math and chemistry classes. He says he doesn't want to switch majors making it so that he won't have to take certain math and chemistry classes. He cannot make the decision whether he wants to drop out and do something else, altogether outside of a bachelor's degree. 

Let's say he scrapes by and gets a bachelors degree, the problem is he has no idea what to do with it, and, again, has no interest in finding out. 

My mother is looking for a psychologist that deals with this in particular, to see if it helps. I see the gravity in the issue that he doesn't think about how he's going to _feed_ himself when he's older and be independent. 

Some might suggest he's depressed. He's been to a lot of psychologists and if I recall correctly, one described him as a depressed boy and treatment was pursued but not medication.

275,"Bonus question:  Should we be worried?

  
This happened last night (technically early this morning).  It was 1:30AM.  My wife and I were fast asleep, when we were jolted awake by the sound of a man yelling at the top of his lungs \- and I mean full force.  Probably as loud as a human male can yell.  Frankly, it was 110&amp;#37; terrifying.  We live near a liquor store and are used to the occasional drunk slurring and yelling incoherently \- I am very confident that this was something else.   


My wife, who is usually the first to say ""It's nothing, don't worry about it"" to odd noises like that, was just as scared as I was.  This was no ordinary scream.  This was... *an advanced scream.*  


Anyways.  It was one single yell.  Full force, blood curdling, terrifying, lasted about 5 seconds.  It echoed all throughout our complex.  No sounds after that.  We looked out the window, but couldn't see *anyone.*  We heard our upstairs neighbor (female) get up and walk around, too.  She definitely heard it.    


We thought about calling the police, but were hesitant.  I think we both wanted to go back to sleep and forget about it, and didn't want to draw attention to ourselves.  After about an hour, I think we were calm enough to fall back asleep.This morning, I didn't see anything out of the ordinary outside.  I checked alleyways, didn't see anyone.  As far as I know, the police never showed up either.  


Could this have been nothing?  A misunderstanding?  Reddit, what do you think caused a man to make such a loud, horrific scream just *one* time, and then no noise after that for the rest of the night?  Lastly, as the title suggests, should we have called the cops just to take a look around?",06Jun2018,1

278,"I just want to start out by saying that my father is probably the worst person I've ever come across. He's despicable. I feel ashamed for having to admit to this, but he's a paedophile. My mother had me when she was sixteen and he was in his 30s. When I was born he put a fake name on the birth certificate and disappeared. My mother has told me stories about how he had sex with girls her age and much much younger. To be honest I never really wanted to know to that extent but I didn't want to upset her by saying so.

Since then he has popped up every few years and asked how I was doing and why I didn't call him. Every time he reappears I suddenly freeze up, all the anger and things I finally wanted to say don't come out. Instead I give some half-assed excuse and he drives off in his car without a care in the world. I feel so hopeless and pathetic when it happens and it leaves me in tears every time.

He did it again a few months ago. That was when I first found out his real name. I'm ashamed to say that I stalked his Facebook for days afterwards trying to find out as much as I could. It made me so angry and worthless. He had these happy pictures with his sisters and friends on cruise ships and exotic holidays, while I'm struggling to plan how I'm going to explain to my future boyfriends/husband and inlaws why I only have two family members who actually want to talk to me. 

Everyone in those comments loved him, calling him uncle and asking how his son was doing. I forgot to say that he has three other children who he also does not support. I only knew/met one of them. 

He then has the *audacity* to say that the boy isn't where he should be academically. Yeah, NO SHIT, he probably hasn't seen you in years and spends his free time hanging out with gangs on the estate. ***nowhere*** does he ever mention me. I mean nothing to him.

Around march, my mother contacted a government agency which managed to track him down for child support. We know he has money, he just choses not to pay for my school lunch, or my £200 school uniform, or the university summer schools. 

On my way back from school, he pulls up next to me in a silver car. Like always, I freeze and timidly say hi. He asks if I know who he is and I say the he's my dad. (I can't bring myself to call him that, let alone daddy, like I did when I was younger). He asks why I haven't called him and goes on to say that he has wanted to contact me, but couldn't because my mother threatened to call the police. He then gives me his number and drives off. 

I have no doubt in my mind that he got the letter from the agency. Why he chose to meet me now, I have no idea. (The other thing is that there is no way he could have possibly known where I went to school since it's quite far from where I live. Which means he followed me. Though it wouldn't be the first time he's sat waiting in his car for me. He did it the last two times I saw him as well.)

He lied about his income. He's not rich but he could afford yearly holidays abroad. But because he lied he only has to pay ***£15*** a week. That's barely enough to cover school lunch. And suprise surprise, he didn't pay it. He hasn't paid anything at all. We've done just fine without his money, but it hurts.

Am I not worth it? He cares enough about my brother's grade but not if I have food for the week? I'd like to day that I don't need a father anymore, and that I'm a grown woman who can look after herself, but I want one. I want one so badly and I just wish I could have a dad who wants to take me out for my birthday and ask how school is going, and to walk me down the isle when I get married. It's not fair, I've spent my life trying to be good to others and making others happy. I can't even raise my voice to the man who abandoned me all those years ago, and who had the fucking audacity to turn up and laugh smile like it's a fucking joke. 

All I want is a proper fucking family. Is that to much to ask? I've been accused of fucking *witchcraft* by people who were supposed to look after me. I just want to ask him **why**. What did I do to deserve this? Why is he like this?

The neighbors with their friends responded by taunting them openly. I think nearly all of the family occupying next door have a criminal record. Most likely some of them are gang affiliated.  I actually indirectly know of their friends  from a place I use to volunteer at , generally bad people. 

They have lived years next to us but we have learnt to stay out of their way. They have caused trouble with us but it was over small stuff. 

However there are times when they act up. This is especially when I get to spend the day at home. And now that I am on holiday this is becoming so so frustrating. 

The neighbors sit outside their garden all day/night. This means we can hear them and they can somewhat hear the ongoings of our house. My room faces their garden so I can unfortunately hear them and see them if I peak from the window. 

They often smoke weed (day and night) so the smell comes through. This is illegal in our country and they are not subtle about it and will even smoke while we are in our garden.   I am assuming no one has reported them as this has been going on for ages. I ve asked one of my family members about it and they do not want to report it in fear they retaliate, which is understandable.

They do not like us being in our garden and I am guessing will smoke the weed infront of us out of spite. The neighbors also often comment aloud 'What are you looking at' when we are there. They are super paranoid and think we are snooping on them, which isnt the case. 

They have also started whistling at me whenever I bump into them outside or when they can hear me near the windows. If I leave my window open they whistle. My toilet also faces their garden, when I begin to do my business they whistle because they can hear. 

Out of frustration I now put the tv on loudly because I know that bothers them. I also use the toilet with the window open , which again bothers them because I heard them yell before 'thats disgusting close your window' .

To mention aswell...They behaved similarly last summer too. It affected my health alot due to my anxiety condition, I had to take time off work and spend time else where to recuperate. This time though, I am not afraid (due to less people now living next door) but rather upset.  

I have come close to ringing the police many times. Even if I ring anonymously they will know I did it. How do I approach this? 

ps. When I lived in a different area I had problems with neighbours before but these people have a real bad rep. ",06Jun2018,1
282,"Every time anyone expresses any negative emotions it happens. Once my younger brother made a kms joke and I flipped out and reported him, resulting in him making more jokes about it around me to set me off (he’s 12 and was 8 at the time). In middle school two classmates frequently told me this to set me off as well. 

It doesn’t help that the new edgy trend is “I want to die” memes. I know it’s just young people pushing boundaries (first it was the poop jokes in preschool, then sex jokes, then dead babies and finally suicide). It still scares me.",06Jun2018,3
283,"Hi reddit first post so hello there, need some advice on dealing with jealousy .

TLDR: chick i dated twice a long time ago shows interest in a coworker and he at her can i get so jealous i cant act normaly, need advice on how to be less clingy, move on or deal with that feeling. Or should i just avoid this shift when they work at the same time(it happens about ocne a week)

So there's this girl at work where we went on 2 dates at the time( about 8 month ago there was a good timing to kiss her and she seemed interested but i didnt have the balls and didnt go for it) so from time to time i see her at work but not always there's an opportunity to talk to her properly but sometimes where there is the converstation is just so fun.

llast 2 times we worked she seemed to have fun talking to the bartenter, and i noticed some body laungage between them that seemed like something is starting overthere and got fucking jealouse, couldnt think right couldnt talk right couldnt even stand in the kitchen area because i see them talking and going nuts inside, kind of like if a mall entrance gaurd would drink 5 cups of coffee but wouldnt leave because he has to stay at his post.  


So it happened only twice, first time was the worst feeling i've ever felt, second time it was much less worse but i still dont want it, what do? try to avoid the shift with both of them working together not to feel like crap? stick through it and maby learn to deal with it somehow?",06Jun2018,3
284,"So my family is visiting me for my college graduation in a few weeks, and I am really nervous about the trip. 

My mom is an alcoholic who relapsed a few months ago. She hides the fact that she drinks, but it is obvious to everyone. 

My dad seems to think that he can fix this by controlling her every move. He calls me as if it is our job to be one step ahead of her drinking.  

I tell him each time that trying to control my mom is pointless. I can't control her. I can only safeguard my own sobriety. I'm an alcoholic, and have been in recovery for 2 years. 

On top of this, my sister (active alcoholic) called and said that she also booked a flight to see me for graduation. While I know she wants to celebrate my accomplishment, I really think this trip is one of her many ""pauses"" to forget the painful stuff happening in her life right now.  

Now my parents are tense over the idea of ""sharing"" me over their trip. I can tell by my dad's comments that my mom is upset about my sister coming and ""taking time away from her."" He also said that he would prefer it if my sister were not involved because he thinks my mom drinks more as a result of my sister's attitude. While my dad and sister get along, my mom and sister do not get along at all. My parents have made her the scapegoat for my mom's drinking for years. 

The sad thing in all of this is that, for the first time in my life, I am genuinely proud of myself for accomplishing something...and yet, I feel like this sense of pride can never feel 100&amp;#37; earned as a result of the shame that comes with my family's alcoholism. I am finding it hard to relax and just enjoy this milestone when I feel pressure from my family to play mediator, and make sure everyone is comfortable.  

I have asked people in AA for advice. They are compassionate, but they refer to the Serenity Prayer and other phrases like, ""Let go, let God."" I would like any advice on how to respond to my family in a kind but firm way once they are here and start accommodating or ignoring my mom's drinking or behavior. Thanks.",06Jun2018,1
285,"Hi I've seen some people give good advice on here, sooo... I get this often. I know it sounds cocky or whatever. But it's a nuisance. Every time I think I've met a friend, I find out later that they've only been nice to me because they plan on asking me out or admitting their feelings. 

I had stopped talking to one friend because he was overly complementing me and it was making me uncomfortable, despite already telling him it did and making it obvious. 

Different ""friend"" threw a tantrum during a party because I fell asleep next to another male. 

One stayed at my work place for 2 hours before my shift ended just to hang out, I barely knew who he was, he was a friend of a friend. We barely talked about anything during the time and kept getting in the way of my work

Another won't get the hint and keeps trying to message me, during the times I did message him back, I didn't agree to anything with him and I've even tried giving one word answers or no replies. Didn't work... he even thanked me for ""keeping him company during hard times"" even though I ignored his messages like 80% of the time.(i know it's mean but I have screenshots that he only messaged me because he likes me, and I have never spoken to him in person. He was a friend of a friend). 

Friend asked me to have sex with him, I've turned him down multiple times before. We were both sober, oh! And we've known each other for a number of years. Starting to think he's only around so I say yes one day. 

 Each one of these was a different person and I have many more stories of ""why I don't talk to you anymore"". My guard is beyond high because of this, I make it so clear I do not want anything more than someone to hang out with. I've literally said ""no thanks I don't like you"" or ""I just want some friends"". 
That apperantly doesn't mean anything to these dudes??? 
Bluntly, it's gotten to the point where sometimes I gotta be a bitch about it. I feel so uncomfortable, I don't even hug or wanna shake their hand when I first meet someone. I don't wear make up as often anymore, or even like leaving my house unless it's with friends I'm confortable with.

If I'm nice then they think I have some kind of feelings for them. If I show no interest they take it as ""keep trying"".

Am I overreacting?? It makes me so uncomfortable and immediately lose any interest in developing any kind of relationship (friend one or not) ",06Jun2018,2

287,"Hello guys, I have a hard time talking. Yes that’s right, talking. Though I do love public speaking like doing presentations when I was in school.

Since birth til around a year ago, I was **ALWAYS** the insecure dude who never talks. I averaged about 10 sentence a day. I mumble when I do talk, and the sound comes out quiet no matter how hard I try. 

Last year, I decided to take a change in my life. I started trying to talk at every opportunity I got, but I couldn’t find the words I need when I do talk. I consider myself not bad at writing/reading compared to my peers, but I am really bad socially. As a result, I had only 1-2 friends that didn’t last a year throughout my entire life. 

Right now, I cannot talk a complete sentence without stumbling for words, so I believe people feels talking to me is like a chore. They almost always seem to have no patience/interest talking to me although they are acting like they do. However, during speeches when I was in high school, I had a lot of fun and get good grades on them. It’s the social talking/phone calls that my brain isn’t fast enough to follow up that I have trouble on.

I don’t know if any of you have/had this problem in your life before. But if you do, or if you have an advice for my situation, can you help me? I feel like I failed at life for talking so less. Thank you very much",06Jun2018,1

During this period I never received notification that they couldn't read my meter. They estimated my bill for the entire 19 months until last month someone stopped by and finally made an updated meter read. Now they want to have me pay a 'catch up' bill. I feel they let the estimated charges go on too long and underestimated the bill to a point of negligence.

290,"Background: I have been with my boyfriend for a year now as of last week. I love him so much and always will but I am struggling with this feeling that we aren't meant to be together forever. I am now 23 and he is 22. We got together at the beginning of last summer, I studied abroad so we did 5 months long distance, he came to visit me in Europe and we travelled around for about 3 weeks and then we finished college together at the same University. 

So, recently I have been feeling like he doesn't value me as a romantic partner. We hang out but he just treats me like a friend a lot of the times and I expressed to him I felt this way the other day. The only problem is, this is the 4th time so far I have felt this way and he has promised to put more effort in and he never has. Once, he took me on our first actual date to make me feel like he was putting in more effort. Then nothing after that. I feel like he treats me so casually (he didn't even get me a card for my birthday or make any plan). For our anniversary he barely acknowledged the day besides posting on instagram and we didn't do anything. 

I have put effort in and planned things for us to do, taken him out on dates, but i'm at the point where I'm done coming up with ideas and I just wait for him to finally be like ""oh let's go on a date for so and so special occasion."" 

I know it sounds like I am being materialistic, but it's really not the case. I feel disconnected from him recently and I am scared that this is just a passing feeling and I don't want to break up with him without allowing time for it to go away or allowing him to put some effort in. I feel nervous to break up with him because I don't live near many of my friends and I feel if we aren't together I may lose all of my connections. I know that sounds selfish but I am scared about a lot of things that would come along with a breakup. I just need some advice, has anyone else ever felt this way? What can I do?",06Jun2018,2
291,"To detail my history with this so far, I entered after graduating from high school and dropped out during my first semester due to a lot of emotional problems, and my parents let me take the next semester off to try and recover. I kind of returned the next year but with much less classes, and have gradually been increasing the amount of classes I take to a standard 5 now. I've taken classes out of a variety of subjects, but nothing is interesting enough for me to say I want to major in it with any kind of confidence. My current situation now is that I'm supposed to be graduating by this fall, at the latest, hopefully by this summer, and transferring to a four year institution under computer science. I hate computer science and never want to take a class under it again, but I'm running out of options. My parents were kind enough to let me take that first year off, essentially, but I'm not producing any results or showing any hope of a future in college, so I need to move on. I don't know what kind of job I'm looking for at all or what I'm trying to achieve other than get a degree in something and hopefully get a job that isn't terrible, but I'm losing motivation fast and I'm terrified of the tuition I'm going to be facing in the future.

293,"Roughly a year ago, I went on a date with a really nice guy. We had a good time, but in the few weeks after said date, I decided to call things off before they got too serious. My main reason was that he's white and I come from a very traditional Chinese family. My step\-dad isn't very strict about most things, but my mom is very strict and controlling, specifically over who I date. She only wants me dating other Chinese men and in the past when I've dated white guys, my mom went out of her way to treat them badly and butt into the relationship every chance she got. They never worked out and I figured that I would just end up back at square one with this new white guy. I called things off with him, told him the exact reasoning behind it, and we parted ways.

The difficult thing is that we're coworkers and things were definitely awkward after I called things off. I was going out of my way to avoid him so as not to lead him on and give him false hope for the future. After a few months, though, I suddenly decided that I wanted to be with this guy and that I needed to finally gain some independence in life. So my new plan was to get into nursing school (it's my dream job to be a nurse) and once I start making the nursing salary (they start paying as soon as you're enrolled and begin training) I was going to find a place of my own, move out, and do whatever I want with my life. In the meantime at work, I was going to go back to being friendly with this guy and act a little flirty to let him know that I'm still interested so that he still likes me and doesn't move on. I never told him about my actual plans of moving out, though. We would just grow close again and be friends for the time being.

But two major things recently happened: One, I was denied entry into the nursing program, so there goes my living wage. Second, my step\-dad has changed his mind on who I date. He use to think that I should be able to date whoever I want, but he is now urging me to date other Chinese men for the sake of the family. If I were to move out and defy my mom, she'd disown me like she did with one of my older siblings and our family would be torn apart. And honestly, I agree with my step\-dad. Our family is already fractured, I don't see the point in making things worse.

I'm torn on what to do with this guy. These past few months, I can tell that he still has feelings for me and we've both been acting kind of flirty and extra friendly towards one another at work. I know he's waiting on me and he's expecting me to come back to him, but I need to move on. Do I just simply move on without informing him, going back to avoiding him and letting him down? Or should I at least tell him that we can't be together and that he shouldn't be getting his hopes up anymore? Like I said, he's waiting on me and I kind of feel like I owe him an explanation?

294,"Hello! Posting this under an anonymous account for privacy reasons. Basically I have a Bank of America account where I receive payments from a company in the US that I develop software for. 

Selling US dollars here in Venezuela for bolivars I tried to send a 20 USD transfer to another account. Bank of America blocked the transfer and internet banking. 

I tried calling to the BofA number from Skype (I can't make international calls from Venezuela) and they asked me for social security number, US address, etc... 

I really don't have this information (I know, this is in great part my responsibility) and the phone operators can't access my account. I'm feeling desperate because I have all my savings there and I don't know what to do. I can't buy a ticket to the US and solve the issue.

Note that we in Venezuela have a exchange control and we can't have accounts in foreign currency due to this exchange control. Hyperinflation makes impossible to save money in our local currency thus I have all my savings in this US account since I can't open a bank account in let's say Colombia due to limitations to Venezuelan nationals (Money laundering is sadly common).

295," To keep it short, my bf was showing me some pictures of him, and when he  was going through different albums I happen to see an album cover which  had the picture of his ex wife,besides this picture they send text  messages to each other/communicate on a regular basis (I really don’t  know who starts the message or conversation) and he even sees her in  person when she needs a favor from him, should I feel worried an  concerned or not. he is a great person with me, treats me very nice, but  I want him to forget about her an move on. I get they where married for  quite some time but they don’t have even have kids together so I don’t  get all the communication between them. She is 58 and he is 46, I am 30.  
 

Plus the WORST is that yesterday we were together, and when we were  going back home, he was checking his messages and he then tells me:'' it  was my ex wife she texted me that her car broke down'' she is with a  friend. and then when we get home he tells me let me call her, so he  goes outside, why in the world would he not call her in front of me? you  see this is what makes my head spin around, , the other thing that I  don't get why the hell does she have to call him to tell him that? and  the worst part is that he sometimes goes an caters to her needs  (Obviously he did not that day ,he was with Me), I feel he is a fool for  being a way to nice after a divorce people usually don't get this along  after a DIVORCE! Honestly I really don't know what to do, if just get  it over with and have a conversation with him an tell him to forget his  past and move on, I just cant keep swallowing my thoughts over an over.  this has to stop or I am out. Why in the freaking world is he with me if  lets say he still ha feelings for her? does not make sense at all.  
 

I talk to him about it and he understood, he seemed very sincere and  told me he was really into me and he felt very good being with me and  that if i did not like something that he was not going to do it anymore.  that's why he is buying this house so we can plan a life together. that  if I left him he would be deeply hurt.

301,"The title is essentially the entire situation condensed into a TL;DR but here's a little more context as to what is happening. 

I work (and live) in a little company owned bar. Behind our backs, the company has sold the bar without informing us in any way or form, we discovered this ourselves after some business men came in claiming to own a contract stating that they're the new owners of the building. This basically means tbag in 4-6 weeks, we will all be out of work at this particular site. 

The bar is managed by my parents, hence how I am currently living here as well as working, meaning that we'll also be moved out of course. While I understand this sounds pretty dire, it's not as bad as it seems. We were offered a new bar a few miles away to take over, we will be living there and everybody currently employed here will be offered work either there or in other local bars owned by the same company. 

Now, I have worked here for 8 years... I have grown to hate it, it's not for me and never has been, I've stuck with it all this time for one simply reason: It's convenient. 
Living in the same building that I work eliminates everything that may include expenses including paying rent and travel in my case, so you can understand why I've been putting up with it for so long. As I have grown to loathe this place more and more, I've been looking for a kick up the arse to change my life drastically... This is it, but I'm not sure it's _wise_.

I have been discussing this with my girlfriend whom lives in another city. She has suggested that I move in with her and look for a different line of work in that city. I'm all for it, I hate this city too, but the problem exists that I may be potentially unemployed for a while if I don't successfully land another job.

I could resume work in the industry at the new place as it's guaranteed and look for work while I'm there but then I fear I'm falling into a trap of getting too comfortable again and the cycle repeating. I have about £2000 saved up to fall back on in case something like this happens and my girlfriend has suggested that I wouldn't have to share the rent with her (being unemployed, I wouldn't be able to anyway) until I get a new job. 

Essentially what I'm asking is whether or not this is a good idea or if there is anything else I should do or consider before taking hee up on the offer. Moving to another city and out of something I've been used to for the past 8 years is like putting all of my eggs in one basket. I'd rather be unemployed than work in the pub industry any longer, but that's likely not the best idea, though I'm convinced I'll be happier, struggle or otherwise. ",06Jun2018,3

303,"My nephew is getting married a seven hour drive from my house, during the weekend of the 4th of July.  He was the first nephew born in our family, and my son, born two years later, adored him and looked up to him.  

However, ever since adolescence, my nephew has snubbed my son. In truth, that whole family has snubbed us pretty hard.  My sister and brother\-in\-law are much less educated than my husband and I, but he has been a successful contractor since his 20s and have a house 4x our size and more cars and way more bling.  My sister has always treated me and my son rather patronizingly, like poor, befuddled relations, and often hosted events and invited my other sister and our cousins and I was left off the invitation list.  When I asked why she did this, she told me  to ""get my own friends.""    


My son went to the same college town as my nephew, and my nephew thought it was funny to dent up my son's old Honda by repeatedly kicking it.  I'm not sure why he thought that was funny.  His father has bought him more than one Lexus, and even bought him his own house to live in.  My son tried visiting my nephew on several occasions, and the nephew's roommate didn't like him, and asked him to leave, and my nephew never even once  stood up to him and said, ""Hey, that's my cousin and my house, he can STAY.""    


My son has distanced himself from this cousin.  Actually, my son legitimately has to work and can't get the time off for this wedding.  


I know we'll be talked about for not attending this wedding, but I just cannot face going.

Backstory: We've been doing long distance for 2.5 years (I live in UT USA, she lives in SD USA)  and back in march we talked about finishing school (we're both enrolled where we are) and then moving together and getting married. We have a son together who is turning 3 this year. 

So a couple weeks ago she tells me she's going to a weekend get away with some of her siblings and friends. Halfway through the weekend I get a bad feeling and she breaks up with me the following Monday night. I've since put it together that she's probably seeing one of the guys that went on this get away, but she won't talk to me about it. She just shuts down and deflects.

I've since been out there to spend time with my son. I was able to talk with her some, but I feel like I'm not getting any closure. She said when she broke up with me that she wanted some time to figure out if this (she and I) is really what she wants. But I know she's messaging this guy through Snapchat. So I'm hurting because I don't know how to process what's happening. I try to talk to her because that's what I've known for the last several years, but I feel like I'm not helping and I'm just causing problems.

I think the advice I need is how to deal with the grief and my emotions so I don't cause problems between her and I. We've agreed that no matter what we need to stay on at least civil terms so we never have to fight over our son.

So what advice can you give me? How can I stabilize myself so I don't cause more pain for either of us?

Also sorry about the formatting. I'm writing this on my phone during my lunch break. I don't have time to clean it up.",06Jun2018,1
306,"Hi Reddit, 

Im 29, have a decent job but without a partner. single for 6 years. 

I never felt that i need a girlfriend in the pass few year, i do miss having someone for the TLC but i can live happy without it. i miss fucking, i miss having someone by my side when i wake up, i miss having someone who can see that im having a bad day and perk me up. But i've learn to be ok with all this, i learned to be ok with being with myself.

I can travel alone, watch movies alone and don't feel weird about it.   I have a healthy group of friends and whenever i need someone to vent or to talk to they will be there. 

my problem is i'm turning 30 next year. a big turning point for people or men in general. most of my friends (90%) are with a partner, planning to get married, married or already have kids. 

i feel like if i don't find someone soon or get married i'll be left out from all this, like i dont know what i will talk to these people/ being left out in society. on the flip side, i'm also ok with not getting married, do whatever i'm passionate in (Chase my dreams) and continue on living my life the way it is.

it sucks seeing happy couples sometimes, but im fine with it. i mean, im happy most of the all, but i want to be ecstatic and i see that in a relationship, but i also see the hardship, the drama, the fights, the expectation of a partner which i dont really enjoy 

What do i do? am i missing out? 

i realize this is more of a vent than a question, but please do let me know ur thoughts. maybe what i'm missing is actually achieving my dreams? i dont know",06Jun2018,1

308,"This might not be the correct subreddit to post in, and I apologize if it isn’t, but I’m not aware of where to ask this...

I suspect my boyfriend may be cheating or planning to cheat with someone he works with. I found some odd, but not 100% damning texts between them. He is a mortgage advisor and she works with home insurance. 

Anyway. He failed to tell me that he made his first “close” today (I don’t even know what that means) and had to travel almost 2-3 hours away to do so, which I find a little suspicious. 

Before I confront him, I wanted to ask...do mortgage advisors typically travel when closing on a home? I don’t know much about his job, but I thought he did all the financial legwork when someone is buying a home. I don’t want to confront him with wild accusations until I knew for sure, and Google isn’t really providing me with an answer 😅 

I’m sorry if this is a weird question, I just feel like I’m going crazy after finding those texts! Thank you in advance!!

311,"We’re 26 now..we were best friends in middle school. For whatever reason we had a falling out. After 7th grade we stopped talking. Never said a word to her again even in high school.

Anyway I felt incredibly guilty about the way I treated her during my youth. She was an amazing friend, my only friend, and now as an adult I’m a completely different person.

I friended her on Facebook in 2014. To my complete shock she messaged me almost immediately. Said hello and asked if I wanted to meet up for happy hour. I lived across the country at the time. I told her when I’m home for the holidays I’d love to see her. I apologized for my actions in middle school..she accepted.

Anyway, when I got home for the holidays she ignored my texts. I recall getting one text where she said she was busy and focusing on work.

I text her every year on her birthday. I’m moving away again, this time probably for good. Would love to reach out one last time but don’t want to be weird about it.

I just don’t understand why she responded initially if she wanted nothing to do with me.

312,"So I’m going to college in a little less than 3 months and am just not in a good place right now.  I know this might sound dumb but this girl who I thought liked me ended up saying we should just be friends which hurt and I still think about it all the time. Since I’m leaving in a few months I don’t want to try and find anyone else. It’s also pretty hard to meet new people when I’m working daily and don’t do much else in the rest of my time. I do lift and go out with friends occasionally. Any advice on improving myself before college and how to stop thinking about her, as well as meeting girls in college?",06Jun2018,1
313,"About two years ago, a girl I was dating ended up getting accepted into a great university about three hours away. We made it work for a long time, but eventually things crumbled. Allow me to elaborate. 

I (M,20) have a long history with mental illness. I’ve been depressed my entire life (Dysthymia) and struggle horribly making friends. Anxiety pushes me to say no to most things, and I have a hard time saying what I really mean. All of this is being worked on, obviously, but it was at its worst when I was with this girl (19).

Basically, throughout the relationship, I was in a downward spiral. I hated myself, my life, and at certain points our relationship. I had my good moments, and we both loved each other very much, but I had formed this need to be with her and hear from her constantly. In hindsight I realize my behavior was toxic, and so I will never say she made the wrong decision by dumping me. She would try to help me, recommend me medicine or doctors visits, would push for me to step outside of my comfort zone. All the things she could do, she tried. But I ignored most of her help and wallowed, for the most part. 

In the end, both of us were complete wrecks, and the reason she cited was that we both need to find ourselves before we can really understand love. And I agree with her. It makes total sense. Also, since she had been living so far away for so long, her life had already swung off into a different direction, and she had an entire new friend group and support system. We were basically perfectly set up to be single, and we went our separate ways.

The issue is, even though I can recognize how shitty I was, I still love her. I think about her and want the best for her. I don’t want to cause her any issues or overload her like I was before. I’ve met plenty of new people in the time we’ve been apart, but I can’t bring myself to move on. What should I do? Give up? Move states away and pretend like I never met her? I really need the help.

Thank you for reading this.

So Jake knew that I knew about it and eventually told me. SO today the guy that got cheated on decided to tell me, I was really jelly that hes getting to tell me now after all the other guys knew about their broke up when I literally knew him from over 10 years. I was like yeah i know about it all. He really got confused and told me who told you about this. This is where I knew I fucked up. I tried telling him I know from another person who you don't know and shit. But I described how she cheated on him when only 2 guys know about it. He told me that he literally will lose all the trust between his friends and that i need to tell him, He promised that he won't confront him or anything and he just needs to know for himself, Then he told me well then that other friend of ours ""one of the 2 who knew about how she cheated on him""told you. I really got mad because that wasn't him I told him hell no and thats when I said its Jake and he didn't mean to tell me""My mistake and i admit it "". Well we later met Jake this day and he confronted him. Jake is now really mad at me and saying that he didn't tell anyone about what happened. When he literally did. Now I don't know what to do. I don't want to lose friendship with Jake cause hes a really good friend, And I decided to end my friendship with the guy who got cheated on for passing over what I said after he promised.
Now I really don't know what to do. I'm seeking advice from you guys here!

317," Hello all, I am a new user to reddit and I have a lot of sexual questions for anyone really. I am a 24M who has a very high sex drive and a GF with no sex drive. She was my first person to have sex with and then she got pregnant. So she has basically no sex drive at all and in all honesty she hasn't since we got together. I have a lot of things I want to try and she doesn't want to do it. So I was hoping people on here would be able to give me an idea on what some of this stuff is like and possibly give me some advice on things i could do to make our relationship more sensual. I feel like I'm drowning with here because we haven't had sex in over 5 months\+ but I don't want to cheat on her I don't want to do that to her and my kids. IS there anything else I could do that would help with the sexual frustation? I know I can masterbate but that only does so much for me. Any advice would be appreciated.

318,"Before I start here’s some important info. My family is religious, doesn’t believe in sex before marriage and all that fun stuff, but we’ve been aware my brother has most likely been doing those things. He recently moved away at 18 and this had occurred while he was still living here. 

So basically I knew my brother had reddit and I was bored so i decided to see if I could find him. No harm in that right?? Well i found him and apparently about 6 months ago he got his girlfriend pregnant and was trying to find a way to legally get an abortion without their parents knowing. I know this really isn’t my business but I’m dying from the guilt of knowing this and I don’t know what to do. 
I know if I talk to him about it first, he’s gonna freak out and make me promise to never tell my parents or else he’d probably hate me... and I’d feel so bad. But if I tell my parents, knowing other situations he’s gotten himself into, they won’t always tell him they know and he doesn’t have to know it was me who found out. (note: my parents wouldn’t like disown him or something, they’re very understanding people, they’d probably just be shocked).

Maybe this sounds stupid but I just feel guilty knowing something this big and having to keep it in. What do i do?!!!",06Jun2018,1
319,"Short version:

Me and my SO are both giving each other the silent treatment and I don't know what to do.

Long Version:

After an evening out,  everything was fine at this point. I stopped to get some gas and while getting out of the car SO said something like ""It's so loud"" because of a nearby car wash. Offhand I said something like ""Get over yourself"" merely joking. She laughed but didn't quite hear what I said but had an idea of what I said. After paying and so on we got back into the car she kept asking what it was I said. I simply told her not really thinking much of it. She asked ""Why would say that?"" not really defensively, still had a light tone to it. So I said, still jokingly not accusatory ""Because you're always complaining"" Now is when she got defensive and exclaimed ""I do not"" to which I didn't quite understand the immediate tone shift and also in the back of my mind I know that she does indeed complain over transient things often so I with a little hesitation I just said ""okay"". After this, she stated she wanted to go home at which point I was really confused but she has done this before where apparently I'm completely misreading a situation and out of no where she'll just demand to be taken home and won't speak a word to me on the way. 

Some background and other info/my bias:

We've been dating for about 7 months and both in our early 20's. After this happened I kind of got pissed off about it too because, perhaps my remarks were rude though I did not intend them to be so, I'm just getting really tired of her acting like she's always justified in every opinion she has. In short, she's extremely stubborn. An example of this would be one time I sent here a close up picture of my nephew who is 2's face simply as a joke because he looked funny. She has a dislike for children and told me she did not want to see me that day and gave me the silent treatment then. Another example would be how I asked for a little more tlc because she always seems about what we're doing and not actually hanging out with me. After I asked I was immediately shut down and she simply said we're not talking about this. She's not like this all the time, I have to say that, otherwise I wouldn't be with her. But when these things do happen it really brings me down and I really question what really matters to her in this relationship. Is it me or is it what I have? I'm not affluent or anything but I can drive her places (She doesn't have a car) and so sometimes I feel like I'm just a chauffeur especially during the times when shes just done and wants to go home.

ANYWAY, right now we're on day 2 of no communication. Yesterday she sent me a message but I didn't respond and I checked this morning and apparently she deleted the message. I didn't respond because I knew she just wanted to forget about everything and continue like nothing happened as we have before. This time is different, I'm really just tired of this shit. I want to talk to her but I don't know what to say because deep inside I really want to just tell her so but I know there's not point in that because that's not how a healthy relationship functions and if I really feel that way I'm better off just cutting ties. However, I don't want to cut ties but I really don't want to just repeat the process. I feel like the answer here would be to apologize but it really aggravates me because it moreso justifies to her that she is right and will continue to be like this. Honestly I want to just have a calm discussion but she's got a rather fragile ego. I'm obviously very biased here so hopefully anyone who reads this can see through that. I just want to think straight and go about this in a clear-headed manner. 

If you did read all of this, thank you.",06Jun2018,1
320,"I have a younger brother who is a junior in high school, and earlier this year, a kid at his school shot another kid outside of the school building when classes let out. My brother was about four feet away when it happened, so my family was kind of shook up\-\- gun violence is very common where we live, but none of us have had close contact like that.

Our mother wants to transfer my brother to a safer, more academically rigorous school for his senior year, but to be honest, my brother struggles to get decent grades already because he doesn't apply himself. He's been threatened with being left back twice now, although his most recent grades were good. 

I had to transfer to a new high school in my sophomore year when I was younger and it was probably one of the worst years of my life lol. I felt like I had no friends, and struggled to keep up with the curriculum because it was totally different than what I had done my first year.

At the same time, I would imagine that this new school is undeniably safer than his last one. So I'm torn on the whole thing.

325,"So they were together for nearly five years, primarily long distance (7 states away).  Truthfully I dont care about their relationship. What I do care about is over the past year she will randomly make contact towards me saying mean crap. 

In the first month, she would try to make contact with my boyfriend. A couple times begging for him back, another time asking for some things back(letters), and another time on what would have been their anniversary asking why he wont reply to her. She then saw he had a new gf and sent him a very lengthy email on how he wronged her. He never replied to her which is why I think the texts, calls, and fb messages turned into emails.. About a week after that, she made a fake account of my bf claiming he was a cheater, wronged her, etc. Then she commented sarcastic stuff all over my and his social media accounts (Instagram and facebook). I thought I'd be a decent human being and hear this girl out, i thought that would calm her down and she could move on. So she called me and cried on the phone for 45min about how heart broken she is. I gave her advice I'd give to my own friends, move forward be happy. I then asked her politely to never contact again and we hung up. Afterwards I looked at her social media account and saw she actually had a boyfriend herself.
That entire day my bf recieved phone calls, voicemails, texts, emails, messages on social media accounts, messages on old apps they used to share together like dropbox, etc. My boyfriend just ignored it all and each time a new message was recieved he would block her on the account. Eventually I told her if she continued this, I would be getting in touch with her boyfriend. It didnt end, so I contacted her bf. He claimed he supported her in whatever but the harassment would stop.

For the next 8 months, usually once or so a month, would receive any of the following: facebook/Instagram message request, friend request, random messages from her. Usually she would unblock me, spam my inbox with nasty messages, then reblock before I could do anything about it. A couple of times I had been able to reply and simply said to leave me alone.  Anytime I reply, she says any more messages and shes filing a restraining order/stalker charge towards me. I've never threatened her, met her, or anything like that. 

Normally I ignore her but this weekend I got so irritated by her hurtful messages that I told people to text this bully some dick pics as a funny way to get back. Only like 2 people texted her and didnt send any pics. 
Hell unleashed from her end and she started messaging me on any platform possible. When I blocked her on one account she would find me somewhere else. After running out of ways to contact me she started emailing my bf made up restraining order documents/evidence. 
 
She later admitted had another bf where she is the last two years of their relationship.. I think shes just insane..

I dont want a false restraining order against me, or to be harassed anymore. My bf has contacted a lawyer to file a restraining order on her instead. She claims I had been stalking her, but the worst I did was occasionally look her up on social media to keep tabs, nothing bad..

Whether there is anything I can do to make the move easier from the UK, or whether it all needs to be done in the US.  

More generally any advice you'd give, or mistakes you made, when moving to the US that I could try and avoid. ",06Jun2018,2

335,"Something (which I prefer not to say) happened last week at school, and I have raw evidence of it in a video on my phone. this is something I know I need to report to administration / the police, but if I do i’m afraid that they’re going to confiscate my phone. not that I have anything bad on there, it’s just that I don’t want them reading my texts / looking through my other photos. this video is around 7 minutes long, which is why I feel like they are going to take my phone. is there anything I can say or do to not let them look around my phone, without me sounding suspicious? i’m very stressed about the whole situation (not just my phone), and can’t get it off my mind. thanks in advance for your time.",06Jun2018,1
337,"Throwaway account because I don’t want friends or family to know this is me.

Recently I moved into a new apartment near my school, and I needed a guarantor to get approved. I called my old family friend who I knew since I was 6. He is very wealthy and has helped my family with a lot: given us money every Chinese New Year, bought my mom a new car when my dad’s car was stolen(my mom’s car is now the car I am driving), and overall, helped us with financial situations. I even remember for my 8th birthday party he allowed me to host it at his house, which is pretty big and has a pool. 

He even allowed my family to vacation at his lake house up in the mountains and use his private hotel room membership in Las Vegas. This guy was honestly a blessing to my family. And ever since I asked him to become my guarantor, I’ve frequently visited him and he has given me money as well. I’m very thankul for him.

He is a very old man in his 80s and of course, knowing him my whole life, I trusted him. A couple of days ago I visited him to help him sign my new lease for my apartment online(he is also very technology-challenged) and it was done. I stayed there for a bit more just to chat. 

I know this is just a grandparent thing, but he likes to give me kisses on my lips. I do it with my parents too, so I didn’t find it strange. We were hugging and he gave me a kiss, then I felt something cold and wet slightly poke at my mouth. I immediately pulled away and he stopped. He went to take a phone call that came in right after and after that, nothing else happened but when he tried to give me another kiss I was more reluctant.

I’m still unsure if he had tried to stick his tongue in my mouth or not or if his lips were just really cold. But I haven’t been able to shake it off my mind and I don’t know if I should tell my mom. I’m thinking if I ever go visit him again I would bring someone with me. But yeah. I’m still unsure as to what has happened and I know in a few days I won’t think about it as much cos this literally just happened a couple of days ago. 

So I don’t know if telling my mom would do anything because I don’t even know if I’m overreacting. Thanks if you read all the way. ",06Jun2018,1
338,"So here's the details, I'm an 18 year old guy who recently finished high school and wants to pursue politics in the future in my state. Thing is of course, I have plenty of obstacles to overcome that I'm aware of...

1.I dont have a high school diploma due to me having to make up a class In the summer to recieve one by then, I basically felt like a failiure for not attending MY own graduation.
2.I want to improve on my leadership and social skills, in highschool I never pursued leadership positions nor did I socialize that much unless it was friends.
3.I want to pursue a Major in psychology or in Business, afterwards apply to Law school.
4.Once I get my major in w.e I choose, i want to join the Military as an officer through ROTC or OCS (Navy or Army)

One of my biggest concerns are how in the whole summer...I'll be discouraged due to my own failiures and how I will be seen.

My old pants are all very baggy and I’m on the last belt hole barely holds them up. My shirts are super big since I’ve dropped two sizes like even the arm holes are huge compared to my shoulders. I didn’t have a problem with this at first when I lost like 10 or 20 or even 30 pounds but once I hit 40 and beyond it became like way too much and I don’t look very presentable anymore.

The thing is, I can’t afford to buy a bunch of new clothes. Honestly I can probably spend 50 or 60 tops TOTAL... but even then that’s pushing it. I’d probably need 3 pairs of pants, a new belt, shirts and boxers. I think I can live without other stuff like shorts and jackets for now since it’s summer and I live in SoCal.

Does anyone have any advice on how I can get l clothes for very cheap that are very worn out, I have an internship coming up as well and I need to look at least somewhat presentable (it’s casual attire so no need for fancy clothes).

347,"Hi Reddit, I'm a 15 (M). Every summer, my mom signs me up for a wilderness camp. The camp involves lots of walking, canoeing, and team-building exercises. I don't find any enjoyment in the activities. The experiences I've had were not enjoyable. The camp is located in a heavily wooded area. There are lots of ticks/mosquitoes/wasps. I genuinely don't like going to the camp. However, there has never been another option. I am always forced to go; no escape. My mental and emotional health degrages when summer rolls around. This camp lasts for one week.

I want to convince her that she shouldn't sign me up. She is 54 and is old-fashioned. She thinks that camping is a necessity to build character. She thinks that I don't get out enough in the summer, which is another reason why she signs me up. I am **not** antisocial, I am just an introvert. I can't be around people 24/7 and feel fulfilled and joyful. My energy levels are severely reduced. My emotional state is crippled.

How do I approach this situation? I've been crying for the past 3 hours. I can't go back.",06Jun2018,2
348,"so me and this guy i met through my roommate have hooked up a few times, usually after drinking with friends or late night hangouts. it’s very casual despite him being very affectionate and cuddly, and we don’t talk much throughout the week, but we are in a group chat together with our mutual friends and if there’s ever a weekday hangout we’ll interact some then. 

2 weekends ago we hooked up and ended up spending the night together, followed by an entire afternoon of naked cuddling/spooning. then later that night we all hung out and drank again, and he told me he’d drive me home (this usually means we’re gonna fuck). but that night he just actually took me home, saying he was too tired. when we got to my driveway (i was very very drunk) i casually asked him “what r u trying to do here?” 

i asked bc i just wanted to make sure we were on the same page that this is casual. a relationship isn’t even really doable once summer ends bc he goes to school in nashville and me in atlanta. like i said, i was super drunk so i actually barely remember the conversation. i just know that he said he wasn’t “emotionally ready” for a relationship and that he isn’t looking for one bc that would be “irresponsible”. i told him i was good with that, and then i remember asking him if he wanted to hook up and he again said not tonight, followed by “we all have summer”. so i assumed it was all good between us. 

since then though, he’s been more distant. we didnt hook up last weekend, which is the first weekend in a while that we haven’t. sunday night i texted him at 9 ish asking if he wanted to hook up but he said he was in bed already (he never sleeps that early). he still talks to me when we’re with friends but i’ve noticed he sort of keeps his distance. now ive actually been talking to this other guy in the friend group bc my FWB has been so distant that me and this second guy have had chances to talk and bond. he’s even given me a ride home a couple times. idk why guy 1 would think i have feelings for him based on my reaction and the fact that i’ve sort of started a flirtation with guy 2, but i think that’s what’s happening. 

how do i talk to him and make it clear that i only asked what his intentions were just bc i wanted to clarify the situation, and that i’m down to keep hooking up? 

or do i even address it all? should i just try and ask again this weekend if he wants to hook up? and if he says no again simply back off? how do i handle this? i really like having sex with him but we don’t know each other super well so idk how to bring this up casually enough that he won’t think i’m just adding more drama to the situation.

352,So yesterday I told my work that the end of the month will be my last day with the company. I was supposed to go on a business trip next week and had to purchase my plane ticket on my credit card a couple weeks ago to then later be reimbursed after the trip. I had to cancel my trip because the trip is now meaningless since I will be gone at the end of the month. My manager told me today that they could not reimburse me for the tickets and my ticket was nonrefundable so now I’m out $500.  Am I entitled to be reimbursed by my company since the trip was required?,06Jun2018,1
353,"So, before you jump to any opinions, let me provide context.

My friend has always been incredibly self-driven. He goes above-and-beyond at work, no matter what he's doing. He's been with this company for about 4 years, and they actually *created* a position for him, so that he's heading our ""Internet department"".

We've been friends for over a decade, but I only started at this company about 8 months ago. We were technically peers when I started, but since the promotion, he's now technically my boss. Our working relationship is otherwise perfectly fine.

I'm the polar opposite; to me, a job is a job, and having been taken advantage of in previous jobs, I prefer to clock in and clock out. If it's something *I* dropped the ball on, of course I'll work extra, but otherwise, I don't believe in ""working late"".

We commute to work together, but I feel we are *constantly* staying anywhere from 15-45 minutes later. I've mentioned it in the past, that I just want him to *ask* me, or even just *tell* me, if he needs to stay late. But he said he often doesn't know until he *does* wind up working late.

We got in early today (because I've told him, I would rather go into work early than leave later), but when I ask if we'll be leaving on time, he says ""Probably not, it'll probably be like 6 before I'm ready"".

So...

Here's the thing; I know that he has risen -- skyrocketed, even -- at this company *because* of his willingness to work a ton of overtime. I do not consider myself lazy, but given that I *don't* enjoy working overtime (we don't clock in or out, there's no overtime pay, the company actually asks we don't work more than we have to), perhaps *I* have the wrong mindset?

On the other hand, when commuting together, I feel it's kind of disrespectful to automatically volunteer me to work extra time without my consent or even knowledge. I don't think *asking* me to work late, or giving me a heads-up if he thinks he's going to, is asking very much.

Because we have very different mindsets on ""work"" and ""going the extra mile"", I suspect that if I bring this up, it's probably going to lead into an argument. So I'm wondering if this is truly a fight worth picking, or if I'm the one who is maybe in the wrong here? Or how I might ought to handle this?

Also, something else; I may *possibly* be looking to move in the next month or two. If so, we probably wouldn't be commuting together anyway, so maybe it's better just to stick it out unless I think it's going to go much longer?",06Jun2018,1

355,"Hey guys, I have a problem that I need help with. Currently I am living away from my family (13-18 hrs away in another province) by choice. Due to being jobless for about a month and a half plus quitting college I'm in debt. With that comes bad credit, no phone and no way to get a better job than what I have. This has all happened just a few days shy of me living here a year. And honestly I would move back and be miserable but I met someone here and I'd have no way to call them which is also why it's a dilemma for me. I could move back and get a very well paying albeit depressing job.
 But the reason why I moved away is that my family (mostly my grandma) is emotionally abusive and manipulative. I'm not gonna go into too much details about that but I moved in w them when I was 16 after leaving my abusive mother and since then things have been rocky. Like a small fishing boat caught in a hurricane rocky. Physical fights, obvious favouritism, being a closeted gay in a very conservative place, name calling, being told that you're not wanted on top of being told you're the reason life is horrible doesn't make a person stay. And besides my financial issue is the fact that there was a family tragedy recently so my grandma is guilt tripping me and enticing me with the job. This all has been taking its toll on me physically so I need to figure stuff out. 
 I'm not sure if any of this makes sense so asking for clarity on stuff is perfectly fine.

I'm moving states soon. I have a boyfriend that wants to come with me but I'm not sure if I want him to. I know in my head I love him, but I don't really ""feel"" I do. I don't mind hanging out with him, but it gets boring and monotonous constantly, we watch t.v while he plays games, and it makes me more upset. The sex isn't bad, but it's not exactly everything I want/need. My brother tells me he's head over heels for me but I don't feel/get that from him. We don't usually casually converse about life or interests because they conflict. I feel like when I just start mindlessly chatting he doesn't care. He doesn't really know how to help with my depression and usually just leaves me alone when I get really bad. I don't really have interest in seeing anyone else, but I kinda miss it. Sometimes if I don't see him for a while I miss him, but most times it seems like I'm going out of my way to see him. He doesn't like my friends, so won't hang out with them; I highly value my friendships and spend a lot of time with them, which he doesn't appreciate because he wants more of my time.

And yes. I have discussed all of this with him, he makes an effort for like 2 weeks, then it just goes back to the way it was. I'm kinda worried this is the best relationship I'm going to have though. I'm worried I'm going to regret leaving him. I just don't know. ",06Jun2018,5

A couple of weeks ago I ran into my ex and we had a brief ""how are you doing"" talk. She mentioned how she was struggling to find work after graduating from college. Out of empathy and wanting to do her a favour I referred her at my job. I work at a relatively large company (the office where I live has around 400 employees) and thought that it would be unlikely she'd get an interview, and even if she did, it would be unlikely she'd land in my department (comprised of about 20 people). Turns out she's having an interview with my boss this Friday...
We broke up over three years ago, and I've moved on a long time ago and have no issue in maintaining friendly chit-chat from time to time. However I do still hold a bit of a grudge for some things that happened after we broke up, and I'd rather not have to see her right next to me every day.
I made a dumb mistake, I should have never referred her in the first place, I'm fully aware of that. But what should I do now? I feel like talking to my boss about it will make me look like an idiot, since I wad the one who reccomended her in the first place.",06Jun2018,0

I really didn't want to share it with anybody because it doesn't feel right when somebody else can just mooch off my work.  
Go figure, the day I finish my crush asks me if I can send her the study guide.

Now normally I would have absolutely no issue sending it to her. but the thing is on google drive, and I know for a fact she will send it to a group of friends of hers consisting of around 20 people that will all be mooching off my work. This leaves me in a dilemma I can either:

1. Send it to her and have upwards of 20 people looking at my work that I wanted to keep private

362,"Hi guys I was hoping I could get some advice on how to deal with my dad. Today he threatened to “do something we will both regret” and to kick me out of the house because I showed him attitude. This is not the first time he has threatened violence with me and a few months ago he kicked me, which led to me living with my then girlfriend for a couple of weeks, during which time he offered me money and material things in order to make things normal, which I declined because I wanted an apology, which led to him threatening me more until eventually after a couple of weeks he sent me a 2 line apology over text and I accepted it because I felt I couldn’t exactly ask for more, but that is just kind of for background and isn’t necessarily relevant to what happened today. 

So today I offered to sand down part of a gate for my dad. I did a little bit but was sidetracked by calls from my ex (the same girl as before) trying to make things work. My attention was distracted by this and the phone call ended pretty poorly so I went up to my room feeling pretty miserable and ended up not finishing the work I had offered to do. Later on my dad tells me I’m going to lose my new job within a month because I don’t know what real work is, I point out the fact that I had done other things around the garden and house over the last few days and then he kind of went crazy at me, threatening violence and to kick me out of the house, calling me every name under the sun because I had shown him attitude. I apologised and asked what I could do to make things right and was told to stop talking. I’ve barely spoken to him since apart from offering him a tea which he grunted at me, and saying goodnight which I was ignored for. I don’t know what to do because I don’t feel comfortable approaching him to talk about things because I am afraid he would get violent with me if I pointed out things that he disagreed with. 

Sorry if this is long or the formatting is rough but I don’t really know what else to do. I have close family nearby but I am worried about getting them involved as it’s close enough that he may just go to their house and do something for getting them involved.

364,"My little brother has never been fond of toys. Rather he wants to make stuff ""by himself"". He always comes to me to tape something, draw this thing, cut out this thing, print this map. it was nice at first but now it's just getting painfully annoying.

i always wanted to teach him how to draw but whenever i try, he always tells me that he ""can't do it"" and will go on a tantrum if we don't draw it for him. (to make matters even worse, he's a perfectionist. there's always something wrong whenever he even tries to draw.)

it's the worst. we're always out of printer ink. he has speech problems so when he tries to tell me what i need to do for him and i just can't understand he starts throwing a tantrum again.

so here's where this all happened.

so today my lil bro wanted me to draw a swimsuit for him. since i was feeling a little dead inside i just told him to do it himself. then he started screaming at me and my mom. (mind you i was trying to keep him calm)

my mom told me not to do anything for him. i did because if i just gave in he would just learn that screaming will get everything his way. then she started screaming at him like always.

so he went into my room to take refuge from my screaming mum and started begging me to draw for him.

i tried to make him draw it himself, i showed him more tutorials and kept trying to explain to him that there's no need to want all drawings to be perfect. 

that didn't work, so he started screaming again. i ended up giving him a pillow to scream on to muffle his screechs and tried to stay calm the whole time.

then my mum walked in and started arguing with me because ""he's just a kid, he'll suffocate on that pillow"". for some reason she thought i was trying to choke him (spoilers: i'm not)

and shit happened. i don't know exactly since it was all a mess, but i ended up arguing with my mum for quite a while: she would keep telling me to not interfere and that i'm not good enough to actually take care of someone while i would tell her that i'm just trying to ""protect"" him.

my brother just gave up (so did i) and now my mum's on the couch crying. actually even my brother is crying. my dad (who works at a nightshift) even punched the damn wall because he couldn't sleep from all the noise.

i just don't know what to do. i really want to be there for my brother and help him out. i can already see this is going to have some long-lasting effect on him but it's just unbeareable for me sometimes. i don't wanna keep doing everything for him. 

i hate to see my family like this.",06Jun2018,8
365,"About 1 year ago, my family moved across the country for a my job. Left a great company to go to a well known consumer brand. The job is going well. I'm having success and being rewarded accordingly 

My kids have adjusted to the new area really well. We live in a really cool area. Great schools. Great activities for all of us.

My wife has really struggled with the move. We lived near all of my siblings and hers. Prior to the move, she saw a family member almost every day. Her group of friends hasn't changed since elementary school. We also had a baby right before the move and post pardom depression is  too  real. I knew that the move would be hardest on her.

It was really rough for the first 6 months. She became suicidal. We got her on some medication and the post pardom depression appeared to be going away. She found a group of friends. And for about 3 months I thought things were getting a bit better.

The last month or two, things have gotten really bad again. She puts on a happy face for others but will not talk to me for days. Will go to bed at 8:00 PM and only wake up to take care of the kids. She'll go to lunch with her friends or hang out with them every once in a while. But, she is not doing well.

We talked about working in this area for 3 to 5 years and moving back to our home state. Based on me moving out earlier than the family, I'm only at 1.5 years now. That is shorter than planned and could negatively impact my career.

I need advice on two items:

1. How best can I help her? Or how can I help her help herself?

2. I might have an opportunity to take a job in our home state, but only staying at this company for 1.5 yrs is short. If I have to leave the job to keep my marriage and possibly keep my wife alive, it is worth it. However, I'm worried that moving back will not help. Do any of you have experience from a similar situation? Does moving back to the area help? Or is depression deeper than simply seeing friends and family/being in an area you love? She had depression before, just not this bad.

Any other advice is welcome. Thanks.",06Jun2018,1
366,"This year out of education has been mixed, as on one hand I've found extra work and experience that'll prove useful when at university, I feel that due to not knowing when I'll be working and spending money unexpectedly to afford travelling to work experience has thus led to me becoming quite set in my own bubble and world.

It's not been a drastic change, but I was quite gym-focused and active, but at the moment I'm lazier and only occasionally work out, along with struggling to find proper motivation for wanting to do things I'd like to.

369,"We've been living together since she came back from out of the country. She's developed hyperthyroidism and has a bad heart. As a result she uses these as reasons to prevent me from moving out. She claims that as a mom she has done more than her fair share to raise me, which I admit, and that if I leave her in this state then I am a bastard.

I would receive no less than 5 phone calls from her if I go out. On the other hand, I do ignore her half the time when I come home, only responding without enthusiasm when she requests something. 

I am personally struggling with mental health issues including GAD, OCD and on and off depression. She is trying to be understanding but me being unemployed for the past 4 months as a result of my anxiety has taken a toll on our already draining relationship. This morning, for example, I was making breakfast but I didn't ask if she wanted any. She started complaining about how she would cook for me and I don't reciprocate. Then I discovered that she took some food from my plate and I started cursing at myself because she always likes to play the victim card and it makes me upset. She took great offense, telling me that if I had a job and a real boyfriend I wouldn't need to take this out on my own mother. 

It just seems I can't stop being nasty to her and then she would tell me that I'm abusing her and maybe I am... I am my worst around her and as it is my mental health is preventing me from making my own income so I can move out.

 Please give me some insight on this. Perhaps I am being abusive. I don't know anymore... she is overbearing but maybe it is my fault because she is also sick and I should take care of her... what are your thoughts. She is driving me insane. I like to love her but as it is I am starting to hate her.

371,"Hi!

I am a 22 year old male and I've been having a lot of issues feeling good about myself and life lately. 

For some background, let me explain the last year or so of events that have built up to this. My dad developed an alcohol addiction about 3 years ago and it only got worse at the beginning of last year. He essentially got to the point where he was always drunk and had a hard time doing anything else. In September he was diagnosed with an aggressive esophagus cancer and he passed away shortly after in October. This triggered anxiety attacks and overall sadness for me.

Luckily, I had a very supportive girlfriend of 4 years who was there for me. She told me to go to the doctor, and she came with me the first time I went. I was given general anxiety as a diagnosis and started taking medicine for my anxiety in December. Unfortunately, I didnt react well to any of the medicine I took, and they killed my libido, which started impacting my relationship. Sex pretty much stopped and I became very distant from my girlfriend. I would go to college and my job and come home and do not much else. I stopped doing the things i loved with my girlfriend and family and lost a lot of motivation.

This lasted until late April when I snapped out of it and started to come to terms with myself. I tried to be a better boyfriend and a better person. However, I think my girlfriend had lost her spark for me due to how I was after my dad passed and we broke up about a week ago after almost 5 years. This definitely hurt me immensely, mainly because I slowly becoming myself again. But I understand I neglected her and that I should have been better.

So I've lost my dad and the girl I thought I would be with for a long time. I also started a full time job right after college and that has caused me to feel like I'm trapped. I'm just repeating my old cycle. I wake up, go to work, come home.. I dont have much of friends. I have one friend from work and some online friends, but I feel incredibly lonely ever since my ex left me. I filled many of the holes (small amount of friends, happiness, motivation) with her and I realize that that way of living is extremely unhealthy. Of course I didnt realize it at the time, but now that it's gone I am just.. empty.

I dont have much in the way of hobbies. I play games and watch sports, but all of that is becoming so bland to me. I have been seriously trying to fix my mental, but I cant figure out how. I started losing weight, working out, eating better, taking care of my skin. I want to just be happy with myself as a person. It's not like I am a failure. I'm a software engineer and I make money and I should have it all laid out for me. But the more the days pass the more I find myself wishing for something different. I cant forgive myself for past mistakes and my anxiety makes it hard to try new things. I have recently gotten into chess, however I cant even bring myself to go to my local chess club.

So at this point, I'm lost. I feel like I'm living a sad, uneventful life and that I wont be able  to find friends and be happy with myself. I have tried therapy, but it didnt work. Maybe I just need to try a different one or maybe I need to just suck it up. Either way, I dont know what to do and need some advice.

TL;DR: Lost my dad and 5 year girlfriend in the course of one year. Went into a shell and lost a lot of my passions and friendships and I'm struggling to find myself again. Tried therapy and medication, actively attempting to better myself, but nothing is working.",06Jun2018,1

One of the things was my favorite toy, a red truck, and he completely destroyed it. My Dad gets angry like that to this very day, except now he rarely throws things and breaks things. He was physically abusive towards my mother too, last week I was asleep on a Saturday and i'm awoken by their arguing (As per every weekend)  and my mom rushed into my room, screaming at me and calling me names (Again, as per usual.) He had hit her while I was asleep, so she started to yell at me ""for not doing anything"", calling me a bad son, even though I had no way of knowing, I was asleep when it happened. 

My mom puts me down a lot. She screams constantly, always monologuing about ""how i'm an idiot"" and ""How I am useless"" and ""How i'm a bad kid.""

_____

So I'm stuck between two stressful situations. I'm 20 years old. I'm going to college for computer science. In March, I moved out of my parents' house and moved into a house with two friends that I've been friends with since grade school. Now, I'm sure you know where this is going. I didn't listen to the horror stories. But now I'm living in it and it's definitely my fault. My friends are terrible roommates and moving in with them was a mistake! I know this isn't /r/badroommates, but it's a big part of my problem. They don't ever pick up after themselves, they leave dirty dishes and clothes around the house, end up using my dishes when their dishes are dirty, and one even left their dog's vomit lying around for two weeks at one point.

This is all living in a neighborhood that is super trashy, and in a house that is falling apart because they had their heart set on living here since one roommate's relative is renting it out to us (no lease/contract). I went along with it because I felt as if moving out was the best thing for me. My parents would fight all the time. Something I've grown used to. It breaks my heart every time they fight and it's a big reason why I wanted to leave when I did.

They warned me how it'd be hard living with two friends, and I didn't listen to their advice. My friends were confident that we were all going to live minimally and be super clean. That didn't end up happening. Now, my relationship with my two friends is starting to go south. My friend's birthday just passed and him and the other roommate went to a baseball game together. I wasn't invited.

On top of all of this, last semester, I failed my fourth semester of college because moving out, working, and living here became such a huge priority. I hate where I'm living, the house I'm living in, and I hate being the only one who picks up after themselves. I've thought about getting different roommates, but I can't think of anybody. I wouldn't even know how to go about living with random people, or if that's even a good idea.

My parents have always kept the offer of me moving back on the table. I'm just not sure if I'll be taking steps back in life by doing so.

I know my decisions put me here. I will say that this situation taught me a lot about the real world and I learned a lot about who I am. 

So anyway, I'm laying everything out so hopefully somebody can give me advice on where they think I should go from here.",06Jun2018,1

387,"Hi all, 

Very odd situation. Basically, I just completed about 6 years of university. Undergraduate degree + combined graduate degree with a professional designation. Both of my degrees were ?decorated? (for lack of a better word) I received lots of awards and scholarships, will have two publications in my field by this fall, do work part-time for two of my former professors, and generally kicked ass. I have zero debt and ~$13,000 in the bank. Currently making about $60,000/year which will move up to ~$110,000 in the coming years. Saving lots, low expenses etc. 

My issue is this. I have an overwhelming desire to buy something nice for myself to commemorate all of this. I am not extremely materialistic (my wardrobe tends towards minimalism) and aside from a massive book collection, I don't tend to accumulate a lot of things. I have been overwhelmed with the idea of buying myself some nice simple jewellery, say classic earrings or a necklace that will fit with my aesthetic and transfer well into my professional career. I'm thinking about the price range of $300-600. 

Is this a good idea? Am I batshit crazy for wanting to do this? Where is this need coming from considering that I'm not a big spender normally?

Went on a date with a girl, we had a great time connected well. Unfortunately due to life circumstances (we had talked about this prior) her schedule was just too chaotic to be dating at the moment. No harm no fowl, had great company, moved on.

Month later, she texts me explaining things had gotten better and she wanted to reconnect if I was still interested. No problem. We text and set plans for dinner next weekend, friday or saturday. We make some small talk and I text her Monday to see how the weekend was looking, no response. I texted her today asking if we were still on for dinner and figuring if she didn't reply, I'd move on. She replied a few hours later now saying she has plans and if a different day would work.

I'm not sure how to take this. While we didn't settle on a hard date, I'm a bit.. Irritated?

392,"Hello,

I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbv757kup4) and got interested in mental strenght.

From what I got from the talk is that:

- **I should stop self-pitying me**.

*""When you think things like, “Why do these things always have to happen to me? I shouldn’t have to deal with it.” That way of thinking keeps you stuck, **keeps you focused on the problem**, keeps you from finding a solution. And even when you can’t create a solution, you can always take steps to make your life or somebody else’s life better. But you can’t do that when you’re busy hosting your own pity party.""

**""The only way to get through uncomfortable emotions, the only way to deal with them, is you have to go through them. To let yourself feel sad, and then move on. To gain confidence in your ability to deal with that discomfort.""**

As for me, I felt discomfort many times, but I didn't grow an ability to withstand it. **I just dread it**. I can't help to feel sad? I keep pushing myself through the feeling, but I can't overcome it. It just sweeps me away. **I don't grow confident at all**.

- Accepting that life isn't fair, that the world owes me something

""But ultimately you have to accept that life isn’t fair. And that can be liberating. Yeah, it means you won’t necessarily be rewarded for your goodness, but it also means no matter how much you’ve suffered, you’re not doomed to keep suffering. The world doesn’t work that way.""

I didn't really get this part. **The world can stomp me anytime, but I'm not doomed to keep suffering**? Seems like I'm talking to some evangelic priest.

""Your world is what you make it. But of course before you can change your world, you have to believe that you can change it""

The world is just a brawl between opinions, Nietzsche said that much already. I don't really know how to deal with this fundamental truth, though. I feel like I'm an empty shell. **Even if I happen to have some thoughts on my own, I feel like they don't really matter at all. I can't sustain these thoughts by myself**. I feel like I need others to validate them. I don't want to impose my arguments on anyone, but by doing so, I let myself die out.

How do I get out from this?",06Jun2018,2
393,"I don't really have much time so I will cut it very short.

I live in Europe in one of the less developed countries. I can't say crime is usual here but it's very present.

I was standing at a bus stop and a man walks up to me. He literally looks like every cliche abductor in the movies. He asks what time is it and I politely respond, but then he asks me if my bus is coming soon. I stopped for a second and thought ""Do I maybe know this guy?"", because why the hell would a stranger want to know if my bus is coming soon? He got me kinda shocked so I just reply with ""I don't know"". He goes away and I thought it was just a strange guy, nothing serious. I put on my earphones and continue waiting. But he comes back. Not even 2 minutes have passed and the guy taps on my shoulder. He straight up asks me where do I live. I was very confused at that point and I was slowly starting to realize what is going on. I was again shocked and replied: ""What do you mean?"" He makes some kind of innocent face and I buy it. I told him in which part of the city I live in, and immediately after I realize what a fucking moron I am. He then smiles in the most fucked up way possible and says: ""Oh so that's why you looked familiar, I have house there"". I started to get mad thinking ""Is this the best he can?"".

I very easily realized where he was getting and after he started talking how he is a student here from another town, all of my doubts were gone. I didn't even ask him about it, just replied what time is it and where do I live. He talks for half a minute how he works here, has a house in my part of the city and is a student. Someone would think he was just being friendly but he then asks me in which school do I go. And naturally, the imbecile in me tells him what he want to know. He tried to get as much information as he possibly can and I gave it all to him.

Then my bus arrives. I go inside the bus and prepare a pair of scissors in my backpack in case I have to stab him in the fat gut or neck. But he does not follow me. Which is even more suspicious because he said that he has a house in my part of the city. Not to mention other contradictory things he said. He is well over 40 and claims to be a student, which may sound okay but in the country I live in it is hard to make a 20 year old go to college. He also claimed not to be from this city but to have a house in my part of the city and go to the college on the other side. He must be a very rich student, and that is not how he looks.

If it all ended there it would be fine. But in the next few days a girl went missing. And of course, I saw him again today. And he saw me too, I am 100% sure, although he tried to act like he did not.

I am carrying a pair of scissors under my shirt for some time now. I am certain I will be kidnapped soon but it still does give them a factor of surprise since I don't know when exactly will it happen. My only worry is that I won't be able to split his neck before he notices. And I must admit, seeing him bleed to death would be very satisfying to watch.",06Jun2018,1
394,"I was good friends with a coworker of mine, and he asked me out on a date. I agreed and got dressed and ready, and he stood me up. I was upset and told him we should stay friends, and he practically begged me for a second chance and gave a somewhat reasonable excuse, to which i agreed to giving him another chance. So I got dressed, and excited and ready, and he stood me up again. 

Obviously, I felt disrespected so I kept my distance for about a month or so, lately I’ve started saying hello to him again when I see him at work rather than disacknowledge him, I would like to be friends and I don’t like tension. 

I’m over the past, but he seems to avoid me and seems afraid, even tho I’m very friendly to him. Today I picked a seat near him and he switched seats, I don’t like being on bad terms, especially in my work place, and I’m not sure why he’s afraid..?",06Jun2018,1
395,"So a friend of mine was looking living in Atlanta Georgia with his insane father, bipolar I believe. And he threw him out on the streets. Upon learning this, my other friend went and got him and took him up here to PA to live in his parents bed and breakfast. They got him a job and let him stay there for free to help him out. Apparently he lost that job in December and didn't tell anyone about it. So my friends parents were going to kick him out, upon learning this my friend got him before they could. Other friend and I are in the Air Guard and he was being sent to the middle east for a 2 month tour the day that he was to be kicked out. Panicking my friend dropped him off at a homeless shelter in a bad part of Pittsburgh and headed to the desert. He then told me of the situation and begged me to give him some of his stuff. When I went to give him said stuff he told me he had been on the streets for a week and was subconsciously shaking. I knew I couldn't let him stay there so I took him around til one of our friends agreed to take him in. If he gets a job of course. I took him around town to get him applications to minimum wage jobs. That was weeks ago, he still doesn't have a job. When I ask him about it he says he's working on it, but another time when I asked him about it he said he still hasn't called some places he applied to. He has all the time in the world and he doesn't make any initiative. Even when he knows he has a deadline. Because my friend who took him in said his mother is coming home from Mexico halfway through June and she'll kick him out upon return. I don't know what to do. I don't want to enable him but I don't want to see him on the streets again. Some background about him. He's truly brilliant, in high school he once scored the highest score on an AP course with no studying whatsoever. He has the ability to recall pretty much anything in intricate detail. It's incredible. The amount of information he has taken in and documented is insane. That's why he can never get off a computer. He just does not know how to interact with people. His mother left for California when he was 3 and now his dad is homeless as well. His parents never helped him out and he basically raised himself. No license, never filled out anything for him nothing. He belongs in a college. I gave him a packet about joining the Guard and how they'll pay college tuition for him. But when I checked up on his decision about it he criticized the clip art used on the packet and expressed absurd things he'd rather do than work for Trump. When he does get kicked out again I'm not going to help him this time. But how can I try to help him before he does get kicked out?",06Jun2018,1
396,"So I am currently struggling with becoming an optimistic person without being lazy. This is because I've trying to study really hard as of lately; I'm on 11th grade and want better grades. Back in 2013-2014, I studied in Spain in a really good school that made me work really hard back then. It was so much harder than any other school I have ever been to. I even ended up studying 5 hours everyday and getting really good grades. However, I got lazy when I came back because my new school just didn't demand that much work. It made me get lazy and even though I do work hard from time to time, it's just not the same. I have felt pretty ashamed of not living up to my own expectations, but ultimately I have thought about this and have concluded that I simply am valuable whether or not I work hard, and that I have the ability to work just as hard as before, like everyone else. I kept being somewhat lazy like that until a few days ago where I  suddenly got a really low grade on a subject 'cause I was kinda lazy and thought I would be fine if I studied for a couple of hours over the course of a few days for my exam. However, since I didn't get the score I was expecting, I felt really compelled to working hard again. And I did. It's been a few days where I've been non-stop at it. It seems like only difficult situations can push me to become better. When I get into this mindset I don't even procrastinate for a couple of minutes. 

Even though this has worked just fine, I am not longer okay with working hard as a result of circumstance. I was fine with it when I was 14 and my self-esteem wasn't super great, but I am not fine working on something based on a pessimistic outlet. My mother even once told me that hardships are to people like friction to diamonds; it either makes them shine or it breaks them. While I do think that it's impossible to throw all of the population into the same bag, I don't believe in things like ""you're either born with willpower or you're not"". Even though I may feel like I've done wrong at times there still is a voice inside me telling me to believe in myself and to give it all I've got. I believe in working hard and using your will power without taking circumstances as a source of motivation. Working on something as a result of people telling you to work or circumstances pulling you towards a specific goal won't do crap in the long run; it's like being a goal grinder. You grind, get the goal and then stop. It's what I did back when I was around 15. But the thing is you gotta grind for life, not for a short period of time. The work never ends. It's an important thing to also love what you do, but I guess in my case it does not apply.

How can I work hard on something I hate doing (studying) without being too hard on myself or feeling guilty? My problem is that only guilt seems to push me, and I don't want to work after feeling such terrible emotions. I have to give it my all believing I am fine whatever happens. How can I do this?

397,"So my family is Hmong and a part of that, the youngest son has to take care of the parents.
Which is my uncle, who is married and has 4 kids.
My aunt hates his parents because they constantly annoy the shit out of her for like 10 to 15 years.
My grandma will do stuff that’ll make my aunt life much more harder by doing family parties such as thanksgiving and Christmas dinner, cause then my aunt has to do all the work, and it stresses her out.

My dad says as the daughter -in- law you can’t kick out your mother and father in-law. 

Well if I was her I would! One reason is because grandpa threw BOILING HOT WATER at my aunt daughter face (she was like 5 years old at the time).
Also, he kicked my cousin little dog! Thinking she was going to bite my cousin in the face when she was only trying to sleep next to him.
Another reasoning is that my grandpa is very delusional because of old age. Not only that he doesn’t listen! He’s not suppose to drive yet he does! He already has his liscense taken away and if he gets caught it could cost them the house.
I could see why my aunt has had enough!",06Jun2018,3

402,"Hey guys. Sorry if the formatting is fucked up, I'm on my phone. This is also my first post to reddit. 

Anyways, I'm really having a hard time here..my boyfriend and I recently moved in together, and I've started to see just how irresponsible he is. Before him, paychecks would last until I got my next one...I've lived places with roomates before, on very little income, and still managed to make it work. I've been trying to talk to him about it, because this month was a shit show, money wise.

 He's struggling with some work-related issues, and is trying to contact his HR dept about it.. in the meantime, he hasn't been at work at all. I've been going to my shit job every day I can stand it. I ended up having to pay the majority of rent this month, and last month..etc. The bit that he paid is coming straight from him asking for it, I assume from parents but he doesn't really disclose that stuff.

If this doesn't stop, I absolutely plan on breaking it off, but it sucks because I feel so bad about it.. he's a good guy besides the financial issues, but it's really having an impact on me emotionally as well (and my wallet.) 

But right now, I have no money. It all went to rent the day I got paid. This has never happened before I moved in with him.

I'm just curious what I can do in the meantime to stay calm and collected about it.. I have no idea what's going to happen, or really what needs to happen...came here for some moral support, advice, and maybe some reassurance that I'm not overreacting about this whole thing. Thanks for hearing me out.


Tl;dr:  moved in with my boyfriend, he's a huge burden on my wallet but still a sweet dude. Help.",06Jun2018,1
404,"**Background**: I'm from Australia, I have a Bachelor of Nursing, Bachelor of Paramedic Science and have been working full\-time as a Paramedic for the past year and a half (also an RN). I have a strong interest in business and am currently in the process of starting my own (very) small photography business as a learning exercise really more than anything. I am considering a career change, possibly to the business industry. Unfortunately I have next to no experience or knowledge of this industry and hence have posted here for advice.

* **Q1**: Is there a position which combines both business management and problem solving skills within the health industry. Can you think of any areas where my previous knowledge and experience within the health field would be beneficial? (eg. problem solving skills, team management, leadership skills, high\-level communication skills, medical terminology knowledge, working well under pressure, etc)
* **Q2**: What are some pathways to achieve this position / do all business positions require a graduate diploma, bachelors, masters etc to get there?

My current plan is to approach private healthcare companies regarding work experience in their HR department as a foot in the door to gain some more knowledge.

Thanks in advance, I appreciate your help and am open to any suggestions.",06Jun2018,1

406,"Hello kind people of reddit, I'm a desperate colombian student. I study Systems Engineering in the ""Universidad del Norte"" in Colombia thanks to a scholarship. I've never done this before but I decided to start [asking for money on the street](https://imgur.com/a/HuLdwtp).So far I've got 14,200 COP or about $5.04 US Dollars in about 2 days of begging about 3 hours.

I study Systems Engineering so if there is a math homework I can do or a spanish class I can dictate I would be pleased to work to get to my goal of $25 usd to at the very least go to my ol' hometown to live with grandma and abandon my studies, or the $47 USD I need [to pay my student bill](https://imgur.com/a/HuLdwtp) (it was due to may 31 but I can still pay).

The scholarship pays for my tuition, but not for my food or place to stay, I've been living in Barranquilla so far thanks to working as a waiter and selling candy on the street, but I can't get this kind of money in such a short time. 

My family is selfish and drowning in debt. my father is a gambling addict and my mom is indifferent to my situation.

I don't want to have to kill myself, but every day this situation becomes more and more overwhelming, I failed 2 classes already and if I fail a third I'm seriously going to start considering suicide.

It's not like I have tremors and need treatment or anything. It's a mental thing - the second my hands are occupied it's like they're aware of all the things they cant do and want to do them, repeatedly. Idle hands..

411,"There are a couple people at my new work place that are just flat out hostile to me
all other people are either super kind or just neutral. These two though I can't
understand what's their problem. They're very very senior level. Been here more than
10 years and super important to the company. This is my first job fresh out of college.
Do they just think I'm stupid?!!?
Should I tell my manager?
Should I just suck it up?
Should I ask themselves what is their problem?
One of them seems like a generally non friendly and serious dude(I still feel like he's more
hostile to me than others though) the other is actually kind of a nice person too
others. He volunteers for search and rescue in the local community.
I really feel intimidated when I talk to them.
And It's driving me crazy. one moment I feel there's something wrong with them
the other moment I feel like there's something wrong with me and I'm just being a pussy.
There are some other side information that pop up in my mind,
English isn't my native language, although I speak it really good I get intimidated by 
these and Just he's like I don't understand what you're saying. Again my spoken 
English way better than average.
I'm a racial minority here. very very minority, pretty much the only non-white person
in our group!
Again these should not have any effect on how those think of me since as I said 
except with me, they're nice and liberal people!
I feel like one of these days I'd have a melt down when talking to them.",06Jun2018,1
