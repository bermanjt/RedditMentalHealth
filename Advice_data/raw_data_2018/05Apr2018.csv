2,"My parents divorced when I was 2mo, and I've lived with my mom for 23 years. My whole life my dad and his family have been close to non-existent in my life. He lives across the country and has a new family, so he never visits. I've seen him only a handful of times since I was 10. Naturally, his side of the family has been absent too. Like, *ZERO contact* sort of absent. I don't even know where these people live...

Anyways, recently he came by to visit. He took me to go see my cousins on his side that I haven't seen since I was a toddler. Funny thing, they live in the same town as I do and I didn't even know it! I re-connected with my cousin and we parted on good terms and she added me on facebook to keep in touch (even though we never did keep in touch and I hardly use FB)

Recently, her mother passed away. I had no idea she passed until my older brother (who has a better relationship with my dad than I do) told me a day later.

But my father and I never talk, we've never had a decent relationship. Same goes for all the relatives on his side of the family. I'm never on facebook, and nobody on his side called me to let me know, so I didn't even know that she had died.
On top of that, I hardly know my father or my cousin so I didn't even think to contact them and send my condolences, which is insensitive but so is abandoning me until it's convenient for them to pop back into my life.
The contact between us is so poor that I didn't even know what the plans following her death were. Nobody let me know anything, and I only had contact with her on facebook and didn't feel like being the one to constantly have to put forth effort just to communicate and find out what's going on.
Recently I found a message she sent me on FB that basically said ""You didn't come to my mom's funeral, you don't care about your dad or our side of the family. So, goodbye. Have a good life."" and blocked me.

I think it's ridiculous that her and her mom have been missing in my life for 23 years, but I visit her for a few hours and all of a sudden I'm family again and obligated to go to the funeral of my ""aunt"" who I never even knew to comfort my cousins and my father who I never even knew either? She's holding me to this familial standard all of a sudden, and trying to shame and guilt me for not attending the funeral of someone who wasn't shameful and guilty of not giving a crap about me?

People say, if you died and they would have attended your funeral, you should go to theirs. But I honestly don't even think she would have come to my funeral - I don't know her or her family at all!

I was giving my dad and his side of the family a chance to become my *actual* family, but this has just completely turned me off to that idea.

Advice? Am I in the wrong for not going to my stranger aunt's memorial that my stranger cousin and stranger dad didn't even let me know about?
Should I look past this and try to reconcile with her? I just really don't think it's fair for her to expect this of me and even shame me for it, when she and her side of the family have never done anything for me ever.",05Apr2018,0

6,"Hi, I am 15, and I just moved to a new school and I am finding it quite hard to make friends. Anyway, here‚Äôs the problem:
In the school where I come from, I could be classified as a nerd, so I didn‚Äôt have much popularity or friends out of it, so when I got to my new school no one knew me. I got along really well with some popular guys and I am always with them at break and in the classroom. The problem is, when I ask ‚Äú Hey guys what are you going to do this weekend‚Äù because I don‚Äôt know better, they usually say dumb shit like, oh yeah I‚Äôm going to milk my cow in the farm I have in Russia (obviously not true) and they change subject and so on. I don‚Äôt really know if they go out behind my back or not but I‚Äôve gone out with them twice, but that was last year so I really don‚Äôt know, sorry for the super long text but does anyone have any advice. I hope I was clear enough.

8,"Physically, I can stand up for myself just fine. Even if i get beat up i don't care, so i'm ready to go in head first in fights. But i don't know how to do confrontation. In situations where it it doesn't have or really shouldn't get physical. Examples:

 A landlord won't give you back your security deposit - You send your computer to a repair-shop and find out something in it is missing or replaced with a cheaper version

Someone in the street throws a rock or something your way to intimidate you

You're walking with your lady and a couple of guys try to start shit by insulting you or catcall her (which is the biggest reason i'm very picky on where to take my dates)

What would you do in situations such as these? Completely blowing up instantly doesn't seem like the smartest decision in most situations i get into, yet i can do nothing else. Because every time something like that happens, all my social skills die, and i can't think of anything that would actually make me win the situation. **What are the right words, the right attitude for situations such as this other than blowing up like a dumbass?**

Especially in situations like the first one, when you have a goal, which is your money back. Or the third when it concerns/includes someone close to you.

p.s.: getting physical where i live won't get you in any trouble, it will never get big enough that the cops would be concerned, and no one ever got arrested for fighting. so ""just ignore it because fighting might get you in way bigger trouble"" doesn't work around here unfortunately.

9,"I would post this to r/teenagers but from what I‚Äôve seen there most of them enjoy school and... I kinda want help from adults.

I‚Äôm 16 and a junior. I currently have no friends because my old group decided they were too cool for me (that‚Äôs literally what they said). It‚Äôs a little too late in the semester and high school to be making new friends so I‚Äôve just been kicking it with the nerdier kids. It‚Äôs lonely. But I can deal with that. 

What I can‚Äôt deal with is the school itself.  The people there. The atmosphere. With the nerdy kids it‚Äôs work work work, school school school. Their hobbies include shitting all over my life choices and stressing me out. With the rich popular kids (I live next to a lot of wealth) it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm the scum of the earth. Everything‚Äôs a competition with them and they always win.

Maybe you think I‚Äôm over generalizing, but I fucking tried my best to find new friends ok. I‚Äôve scoured clubs, electives, sports that I‚Äôm not good enough to get in to. Social groups are pretty much cemented now and I‚Äôd rather be alone than be the odd one out.

What I also hate about school is that nerdy or popular, everyone blindly goes along with the whole school‚Äî&gt; college‚Äî&gt;job narrative that adults tell us is the only way to success. In my opinion school is pointless and college won‚Äôt guarantee anything; also, not everyone wants to be a doctor/lawyer/engineer. I also don‚Äôt believe adults should dictate how I live my life. Your life is yours to live, not anyone else‚Äôs.

Every hour I spend sitting and being lectured by adults who don‚Äôt even have their own lives in order, I want to scream. So much of this is bullshit, everyone here sucks. I‚Äôm considering skipping classes but where I live there‚Äôs literally nowhere else to go. It‚Äôs so draining and soulsucking, I hate it.

Maybe there‚Äôs something wrong with me. Maybe I‚Äôm the only one who doesn‚Äôt subscribe to the linear path adults say I have to follow. Maybe I‚Äôm just a failure as a person. I don‚Äôt know how long I can hold on guys. I already know this is a lot of what adult life is and honestly, it doesn‚Äôt seem worth it.

10,"Hi everybody,

I'm approaching the end of my freshman year of college. It's been quite a volatile year; I haven't done well academically, and haven't made any lasting friends. I commute to my current university, and, to be honest, I'm not a fan of it. I take the shuttle bus to campus because I do not have a license or a car. I'm working on getting both (I have quite a lot of money saved), but the commute isn't my biggest problem.

I don't like living with my family. More often than not, I find myself inundated with numerous chores, although I have two siblings who are perfectly capable of doing them. These include taking care of three dogs and a cat, doing laundry, running the dishwasher, tidying the house, etc. I'm expected to do these chores, and get called ""irresponsible and lazy"" if I fail to. This is incredibly draining, especially when I have classes and a part-time job to worry about. 

In addition, every time I voice concern to my family, they don't take me seriously. My siblings don't like me; they call me a ""loser"" and a ""fat cunt"" among other insults. They tell me I sound like a child when I speak, and make fun of me when I get down on myself. I even had to delete my previous Reddit account because my brother would find my posts and tell people about how ""sad"" of a person I am.

My mom doesn't discipline anyone; it was never her strong suit, as my dad did most of it when he was alive. I try my damndest to not let my siblings get to me, but sometimes, I reach my breaking point, like yesterday, for example. Since I'm the oldest, I was immediately blamed for the whole thing by her. She told me ""I should have institutionalized you"" and ""you wish I was dead, just like you probably did with your father"". That couldn't be further from the truth.

Furthermore, she uses me for emotional support to an extreme. She doesn't have any ""girlfriends"" that she regularly hangs out with. Every problem with money, relationships, work, etc., she tells me about it. I like being there for my mom, and I care about her deeply, but I feel more like her best friend than her daughter.

I wanted to transfer before the beginning of the spring semester, and almost did, but my mom revoked her permission last minute. The university I wanted to transfer to would have been cheaper for me to attend, and is one of the top public colleges in my state, but that wasn't enough to convince her. It was four hours from home, and she didn't want me being that far away. She said it was ""too expensive"" although she's happy with being $8000 in debt, and with me being $5500 in debt thus far, so I can attend my current university. It's mind-boggling to me. 

I tried to make the best out of this semester, but I'm actually doing worse than before. I don't like my situation, and I think I'm taking it out on the school. A lot of the time, I can't bring myself to go to classes. I just sit home for most of the day, alone, until my boyfriend swings by or when I have to leave for work. I feel alone and sad. I can't be in any clubs because my mom doesn't want to have to pick me up late. I haven't made any lasting friends, although people have been nice to me and vice versa. 

Sadly enough, I kind of want to flunk the semester so I'll lose my scholarship and have no choice but to transfer. I resent not being able to take control of my own future. I hope this doesn't come across as whiny or entitled; I'm just at my rope's end here.

TL;DR: toxic family environment and expensive school makes me want to transfer, but I don't know if I'm making the right decision. Want to pay for my own schooling. Don't want to be a loser anymore.",05Apr2018,1
11,"Really don't know where to start. So I'm just gonna start listing things off. I live alone in a one bedroom apt. I'm a 43 yr old male. Been single for the last 5 years And haven't been laid since. And really don't care to. Who needs a woman when you got porn lol.

I work 8 hrs a day. 40 hrs a week. I have no ex wife or kids.I really enjoy gaming. Been doing it all my life. PS4 and now just recently a PC. 

I barely watch tv. When I do it's either Netflix of Amazon prime. I spend more time on YouTube watching vids on gaming if I am watching something.

I used to have a lot of friends but they all quit my employer. Now there is only a few of us.

I am actually more sociable online than I am in life. Not by choice. I just really don't talk to anyone at work. Or at home on the phone talking or texting. Its all online..,

Things I look forward to when I get off of work. What I'm having for dinner. What I'm going to watch while having my dinner. And what game I'm going to play for the majority of the rest of my evening after dinner. 

This is me. I have been living this way for a loooong time. And strangely enough. I'm happy.... Sure I would like a girlfriend. But will she be compatible to my lifestyle? 

What I'd like to know is. Am I weird? Most guys at my employer think I am. They can't understand my life  and why I live the way I do. No wife or kids etc. And they can't understand how I'm happy.

14,"I got a new job about 10 days ago. It's an ok, not the greatest, job for me as I'm a busy student and only needed something part time to pay for my car, gas, school, etc...

This job seemed perfect as the general manager agreed to my limited availability, and that I have a family related job on the weekends. So far I've worked 3 days and each day she has made me feel terrible about myself. She's incredibly mean to me, I have no clue why, and constantly puts me down in front of customers. On my days off she calls me multiple times in a row and today texted me something rude because I didn't pick up her call (I was sleeping and my phone was on silent). I apologized twice, and she was still pissed. I explained when she calls me I am in class, at my other (weekend) job, or like today my phone was on silent and I was sleeping, but if I was awake I would have come in and that I felt bad I missed the call and text.

This job is incredibly understaffed and so far I can tell she has 0 clue as to how to schedule anyone. Which is stressful. I'm a highly anxious person and have been on the edge of having a panic attack because I'm scared to see her at work tomorrow, as she's very gossipy and is just so mean. I made a few mistakes, obviously I'm new, and she screamed at me in front of customers and employees saying ""I HAVE BAD OCD AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS TRIGGERING ME. DON'T DO IT AGAIN YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER. UGHHHH"" I was kind of shaking, since all I did was stack plastic cups on a shelf, with one row being a cup higher than the others and everyone was staring at me.

I can't really quit as this is the only job that agreed to my availability (yet calls and texts me nonstop) and pays decent for what it is. It's hard finding a job here too which is difficult. How can I get through work/deal with her? It's hard for me and I'm so anxious about going tomorrow but I know I need to.

A couple weeks ago my mother and sister went on a weekend vacation out of state over summer brake and me being a massive cunt decided to stay home because Farcry 5 had just released  couple of days prior.

The flash drive is voice activated and records any and all conversations as best as it can. This sparked a search throughout the house to which my sister found one in her room and I couldn't find one in mine. We looked everywhere and I mean EVERYWHERE. We unlatched outlets, unscrewed light bulbs, and basically turned the whole house upside down. Today my mom and I searched her car and we found a GPS tracker on the underbelly of the van. None of us know what to do about it.

23,"Hello! I'm 17 years old, and on my final quarter of my senior year in high school. 

My entire high school career, even in middle school, I've wanted a career in computer science. Computers have been an interest of mine since as far as I could remember. However, I've come to a realization that it's not particularly something that I'd want to wake up every morning to, and make a living off of. I wanted to find a job that has more of a substantial and more direct impact on society, such as being a doctor, more interest pointed towards being a pediatrician. 

Looking back to earlier years in high school, I'm filled with regret in not applying myself to my full potential, i.e. not taking any AP classes, and in the standard classes I was taking, I chose to just get by with a B/C average in all my classes with the ""just get the diploma"" attitude. I'm afraid that I'm not going to be well prepared for pre-med and medical school to be able to thrive in that setting and eventually give my contribution to this world as a doctor. 

I understand that not everyone knows what they want to do with their lives, even in the middle of college. That still doesn't change the fact that I wish that I did take those AP classes, or had given my 110% all the way through high school. 

The original plan was to attend community college for the first 2 years, and transfer to a state college after that.

my aunties new baby and my built up ‚Äúsocial problems.‚Äù Among other things mentioned below.

You see, my mum and I are used to being left to fend for ourselves as my dad works offshore and my gran (mum‚Äôs side) very clearly prefers my mothers sister. Who recently had her second baby. She apparently ‚Äúlost alot of blood‚Äù  This becomes a problem since my auntie and most of my mums side live too far away since we dont drive. In turn meaning they dont visit us and help us as there is a much closer problem for them. 

This leaves me and my mum needing to balance visiting hospital to see my dad, work and school. (thank fuck im off right now though.) Oh and as for my dads side? My dad is the middle of 3 brothers and my gran on that sides husband is about to have heart surgery so much of their focus goes there.

So yeah, im shit scared for my dad and feel like nobody cares about us. Money is now worrying me too. Its not like im going to get a job any time soon, my mum has had to take time off. And no shit my dad aint working any time soon.

And the only teachers that know are the PE department as im now refusing to do PE because it puts the anxious thoughts and all that bullshit in my head. The best part about them knowing? First Tuesday I go back the head of PE says he will be phoning my parents to inform them.
Its strange as well because in Primary (School years 1-7) I was a middle of the road popular guy who had no problem speaking to new people.
But around Secondary 2 (School year 9) I just completely lost any social capability. I pulled myself from the band I was involved in and have now isolated myself to almost exclusively online friends who I miraculously feel confident around. But then become a full on dickhead bipolar fuck!

Most of the time I would be mocked and insulted until I got to know this group. By the end of the year I earned respect from most of them and noticed I left them to never talk to them again on one peculiar day. This was because I realised that they were the same people who did these things to me and for my tiny bit of the self respect I had in me. But there was someone who was an exception to that group.

This person still sees me as a easy target so he constantly humiliates, and mocks me. He eventually got kicked out of that former group due to losing a couple of friends by pissing them off.

29,"I'm overweight and in my mid 30's. I have a desire to get my health in control after having gestational diabetes and hypertension after my last pregnancy.

Being overweight is not only uncomfortable, but is also very taxing on my health.

Here's my struggle.

Food.

I need it to survive and I am worried I have a terrible relationship with eating. In the past I have use eating as a way to deal with stress. Bad day? Time to crunch away the problems with some chips. 

It's not sweets...it's chips that I struggle with and ANYTHING fried.

Anyways. I started keto in January and I feel that is really best for my body. One chip or one bite of carbs will set me into destroy-the-entire-bag mode.

So keto keeps the bad cravings at bay, but I still ended up over eating. Large salads, lots of full fat low sugar dressing. So. Much. Meat. So much homemade keto frankenfoods.

I felt like I hadn't solved the eating issue, just found something to keep me from going crazy with the carbs.

I felt the desire to try a partial fast along with a low carb diet. So only eating between 5pm-9pm and eating something that consisted of meats, vegetables and fats.

I feel so conflicted about this and could really use some feed back.

Since I started the partial fast I feel I have actually gotten my eating under control. I don't feel the need to binge. I'm working on other methods of dealing with stress.

Here's the catch... now when I do eat, I cannot eat much. I can only handle small portions. I couldn't finish my low carb turkey wrap for dinner. THIS NEVER HAPPENS. EVER.

I feel my clothes getting looser and I actually feel like I'm getting some sanity back. I'm not screaming in traffic and I feel like it's helped me be more mindful about what I eat and how much I eat.

But why does it scare me so much?!?!?!

I am so afraid of developing an eating disorder from this, but I honestly can't keep being overweight and unhealthy. I am really grateful for the food not controlling my entire life. No more emotional eating.

Am I on a good path or a bad one?

34,"I don't want to come off as a loser, though at times I feel like one, but that's not the point of this question. 

Here is a little backstory. I had a very long term relationship, it lasted nearly a decade, we lived together and had joint accounts and all. Due to some nasty stuff on my partners side and her pretty much deciding to end everything I found myself alone and very much without a social circle. As we all do we tend to join friends in relationships and it just so happened my main social circle left when she did. I have some close friends who have been around for longer than the relationship, but they are either too far away now or married with kids and have their own lives. Her leaving really messed me up, and I sank into self destructive activities like smoking and drinking. I'm getting above all that and now I'm seeing things differently, but I have no direction or idea where to go from here. 

I've been single about 4 years now, and have sunk more and more into solitude. I spend time with my parents and family every week or so, but other than that the only social activity I have is at my work. I have some friends there who do movie nights every couple months or so, but its not the kind of circle that will ever bloom into new relationships. 

I have (undiagnosed) social anxiety, I am very skittish in most social situations. I also have a bit of anthropophobia, I fear strangers and other people outside of my comfort zone. Every day I relish the idea of simply getting home and spending time alone with my cats and Netflix. 

I'm curious if anyone has advice for where to begin? I think joining clubs or social groups but again as I mentioned above I'm very scared of new social situations and new people. That stuff scares me back into my hole of solitude. Its safe in there, but its not fullfilling. I would really like some true kind advice if anyone has any. Please be nice as its been a long road getting to a stable place in life, I ask this only because I want to get back out and grow myself more. ",05Apr2018,1
35,"Hi guys,
      Not sure if I'm posting in the right subreddit.
I am 21 year old male who live in a 3rd world country.
I take the train to college. Our trains are very crowded and slow. I use that time to look at people and try to walk in their shoes.
I found myself wondering: what makes these people get out of bed to a crowded train to go to work they don't like and doesn't even pay well?
Is it a basic instinct to survive or have they found  something I don't know about?
The thought that someday I might lead a life like this is truly depressing.

37,"I am currently a freshman in college. I have struggled with anxiety and depression for many years now, but recently it had gotten worse than usual and I was unsure how to cope.
In January, I was hospitalized after attempting suicide. I spent five days in a psychiatric unit before returning to school. Though I am doing much better, anxiety and depression still heavily affect me.
I want to make up as much work as I can to keep my grades up. If I don't make at least a 3.0 I will lose my scholarship and my parents will kick me out of the house with nowhere to go. My grades are incredibly important.
The majority of the work I missed happened within the past month when I was going through a tougher period with my mental health. I have spoken to a few professors about this but all want a medical excuse before I make up any work. I have not seen my doctor or therapist since the beginning of the year. I tried to schedule appointments as soon as I could but neither can see me until two weeks from now. 
I don't know what I can do at this point. I've considered really sitting down with my professors and explaining what had happened this semester and why I had been gone (they only know that I've been ""sick""). I don't want to beg them or lie about anything.

39,"This all started because I complimented his dog. We had a quick impersonal convo about our dogs, and that was it. Somehow he found me on Facebook and started messaging me. He started friendly, but turned to flirty real quick, &amp; I told him I am zero percent interested in any of that &amp; that I am in a happy relationship with my boyfriend that I am currently living with (all true).  He says ok cool, and I had like 2 convos with him following that, both about apartment-related stuff like if he‚Äôs seen the landlord around. Then he jokingly asked me when I‚Äôd be home alone so he could come into my apartment and pour cold water on me in the shower as a practical joke. I told him I‚Äôm always with my bf &amp; then stopped talking to him immediately. Today he came to my apartment door to tell me my dome light is on in my car. So I thanked him for telling me via Facebook messager, and he replied calling me ‚Äúdarling‚Äù and then sent me his actual phone number.

42,"So, long story but I've been with my boyfriend for 7 years, we met while at university. Shortly after getting together he kissed another girl but because we weren't ""exclusive"" I forgot about it and went on as normal. Fast forward a year and a half down the line I found out he kissed another girl, I forgave him again after much thought. It was a hard decision but he was very apologetic and blamed alcohol and at this time we were only 21 or so. I forgave and we again went on as normal.

Now I say I forgave him but I really struggled with trusting him after this. This is partly my own fault because I probably should have broken up with him then and just taken the heartbreak because it would have been easier then than it is now. So he then went on a ""boys"" holiday which I was not too happy about seeing as I still had alot of trust issues. I went home to my hometown and ended up getting very drunk and kissing a guy I had known from my teen years. I've never felt so guilty before in my life. I cried for days after this happened. He was still on holiday and had his phone stolen while he was there so I had no contact with him for over a week, so this made me even more paranoid and because of my own recent discretions I was feeling really low.

He came home and we then moved in together. I wanted to tell him about what i had done but was so nervous of breaking us up that I bottled it every time I thought about telling him. About 3 months after we moved in together, I was back home and I logged into my laptop and opened up the browser which facebook was logged onto and saw I had a message. After opening the message I realised it was his Facebook that was still logged in from a previous time. The message was from a girl he went to uni with and he was basically asking her to come over to our flat. I confronted him about it and again decided to forgive him because I had never told him about me kissing that guy, the guilt had told me I deserved this and this was my karma.

Fast forward now about 4-5 years, there had been no instances of cheating, that at least I'm aware of. We have gotten to a good place where I now trust him again. We have just bought our first house. The problem is, we are no longer intimate and he's more like a best friend than anything. I've gotten to the point where  if I found out he cheated I don't even know if I'd care. I really want to move back home but he won't move with me and I'm kindof in limbo. I love him so much and it hurts to think of not being with him, we've just bought our first house and I have a decent job with a good wage. Problem is all I can think about is how this relationship is going no where, we are not intimate, he doesnt want to get married and I just want to move back home to my family and friends. I should also mention there is  not great job opportunities for me back home. If I were to end the relationship I would have to sell my house and leave my job and move back to a different country.

I don't know what to do. Please any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",05Apr2018,2

I'm 17f. I'll be 18 in a little less than two months. 

I work retail with this guy.. let's call him Jason. Jason is 30. 

I mean hes pretty cute. And he does flirt with me, a lot. And due to my parents socially isolating me (besides my job) I can't really tell if it's me appreciating the extra human contact, or if it's me genuinely liking this guy.  Anyway. 

He knows some about my situation (I have a shitty relationship and complicated issue with my parents right now) and he knows I want to leave my parents house soon after I'm 18. 

He offered to rent me out a room in his apartment, for much cheaper than someone in our city would ask for a room in an apartment.

52,"without spilling out my life story I will briefly give you the run down, I realize it would be a kind of Immature thing to do, but i'm still in the feels pretty deep and for rational reason(s).

Dated a girl for a year and a half, we were in a deep love, living together after 7 months (sooner than I would have liked) but rolled with it. Coming up on our 20th month together, and we hit a bit of a rocky road. I know that most relationships hit a tough spot around this time and the real ones power through and come out stronger on the other side.

She gives up on it,  moves out, I'm super bummed about it, she  comes up with the good idea of me to travel to Boston (1 month later) then we would talk about it and see where we were. Made an agreement to not see each other. 

Go to Boston, Return, Find out (via Facebook) she is now in a relationship the day my plane landed @ home. Slightly in shock about it, she still wants to come by and talk about it. Comes by find out she began looking online 2 weeks after we had split. She had been on a few dates with other folks. Met the current guy, lives 2hours and 40 minutes away. Spent Easter weekend with his family and here I am expected to be her friend and im acting like an asshole about it.


Bought her a ticket to SoMo with the soundcheck experience, and she is all excited and was showing off on Facebook. I would like to go and scan the ticket ahead of her and just leave leaving her embarrassed  and in a tough situation, I'm just not sure if it's worth the 30 minute drive although I am really really tempted to do so.

53,"Back story: last week I was grocery shopping when this women, lets call her Susie, stopped me to tell me she liked my pants. Susie asked me where I got them from and some other friendly questions. Then she started asking me more personal questions like if I lived around [the store] and what I do for a living. She mentioned she was retiring soon but she looked young so I asked her how that was possible. She told me she has a mentor who's entire family retired in their 20's &amp; 30's and that they designed some sort of ""information age business model"" to help them do it and now they teach people how to do the same. Anyway I got her number and she said she'd talk to her mentor for me to see if she was taking any more clients.

Fast forward to today. Susie called me and told me she had gotten a hold of my her mentor and that the mentor would be willing to sit down with me to maybe teach me what she knows. Susie's mentor suggested that Susie and I sit down first to get to know each other better and to see if I would be the right fit for this mentorship.

Now I want to believe they are going to help me. I have a meeting with Susie next week but red flags are going off in my head and my gut tells me this woman Susie gets paid or has some sort of incentive to bring people into whatever kind of business they are running.

56,"I'm in my sophomore year now and I realized I had more friends last year than I do now (a lot of my friends last year were from my floor, and we haven't hung out as much now that we live in different places). Basically, my freshman year social life &gt;&gt;&gt; my sophomore year social life. I was talking with a senior acquaintance and she said that in freshman year she met a bunch of people, then in sophomore year she kind of became isolated and only hung out with her roommates, and then in junior year she branched out more and went abroad, and then senior year ""is just chill."" She also said that this trend is very common. I was just wondering if there are other people out there who agree with her and would say that socially, sophomore year was the worst.

I'm very loud and pretty popular with guys, I pull pranks and play sports and shit with them, my hair is cut short and I don't shave my legs or underarms (never have), sit with my legs spread out, I mean normal shit you know. Sort of like normal tomboy stuff.

However it's been causing me a lot of struggle recently to accept that I'm stuck as a ""tomboy"" and not, well, a boy. I know that people looking at me see me as female and that grosses me out. When I hang out with other boys, the fact that people can see I'm a girl is legitimately uncomfortable to me, and it makes me want to hide myself in some way so that they can't see my body. It's not necessarily that I'm uncomfortable with my body, it's that I'm uncomfortable with how everyone will see me with my friends and think that I'm a girl. 

I'm going to a new school next year and I realized I would be the new GIRL. Whenever they split us up by sex, I'll be stuck on the women's side. I don't know exactly how to express it, but it's very distressing to me because it doesn't feel right.

Background story: I come from a small town and had never gone clubbing, so I was up for trying out new adventures. We were very touchy with each other; meaning, we would sometimes cuddle, hug, and obviously dance with each other. My male friend got a girlfriend, and we were both happy for him, since he was like a brother to us. His girlfriend was making him happier. But the problem arose when he let his girlfriend go through his phone. She read the past messages where I had told him I was going through depression. So John tells Vanessa that his girlfriend had gone through our text messages. Vanessa tells me about the situation and I start having a panic attack, because it had taken me alot of courage to tell somebody I was going through depression. John was the only person I had told. I had even asked him if I could call him when I was going through an episode. So I tell Vanessa why I am very upset about John's girlfriend going through his phone. Vanessa tells John that he has told me. He than denies that his girlfriend has gone through his phone. So two weeks pass and I am sinking deeper into depression. John never trys to reach out to me about the situation. He brushes it off. It was as if me telling him I had depression hadn't mattered. He had let someone else into my secret. I kept sinking further. I was heartbroken. He didn't contact me and that upset me even more. I was suffering while he had no clue that I was, and that it was because of him. I am a Junior is college now. A year has passed and I have lifted myself up. But there is something that still annoys me. Vanessa still speaks to John. They hang out and go to school events together. My question is: Is Vanessa truly my friend; even though, she knows how much John hurt me and she is still friends with him? I sometimes feel like she is just using me. Am I overreacting?

However both my mom and my sister say they've noticed changes in him. His right side of his body is weaker, and when he works long hours his speech starts to slur and he gets very tired easily these days. He isn't as strong as he was before this happened, and he's not super old, he's 54.

I'm just worried that if I decide to commit to going to med school, and something happens to my dad's health, I won't be in a stable enough position in life to be there for him and help him. I'll be a broke ass med student.

A part of me thinks it's better to get an MS in bioinformatics where it's only 2 years and you can get a salary at 80k, which is ok, not great, but enough to at least be stable. A part of me also knows that I'll regret not at least trying to get into med school. Though if god forbid my dad has another stroke and I'm not in a position to help him, then I'll regret that the most.....idk what to do.

76,"I‚Äôm really worried about 2 of my friends. I‚Äôll just call them Sarah and Carly. I wasn‚Äôt really friends with either of them until this school year when I started hanging out with their friend group. It‚Äôs a group of 6 girls and me and we are all sophomores in high school. At the beginning of the year none of them really did anything illegal or risky, but this year most of them started trying out stuff like vaping and drinking. I had already done those things so I didn‚Äôt think much of it. All of us in the group are ok with occasionally getting high or drunk as long as we‚Äôre being safe and careful. I know weed and alcohol are bad for teenagers but infrequent, safe use doesn‚Äôt have a bad impact from my experiences. Sarah and Carly are not very smart and a little boy crazy, so they don‚Äôt realize how dangerous these things can be. 

Over the past 5 weeks they have been going downhill FAST because they started spending time with this girl named Megan. Megan vapes at school, does lots of drugs, and steals shit from stores all the time. S &amp; C have been posting stories getting drunk with her almost every weekend, and they went to the mall with her and stole lots of clothes. Over spring break they got drunk 6 times in a week. They also started spending time with these senior boys, and I think they are influencing them too.

The rest of the group was talking and we were really worried about them, but also angry because they basically abandoned us for Megan. One of us tried to reach out to Carly by sending a text about how worried she was, but Carly kinda brushed it off. 

We were going to just let them do their thing and hope they learn from their mistakes but after what I heard today I feel like I should do something. Sarah was drunk at a party a few days ago and she woke up to some guy fingering her. She told us in class and we asked if it was consensual she said ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say no.‚Äù What she way saying made it seem fine to her but I could just see the guilt and sadness in her eyes. We also found out they stole stuff again and one of them got caught by the employees, even though they all had stuff and could have gotten in huge trouble.

I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do. From what I‚Äôve said they probably seem like horrible people, but they used to be super nice girls. They are just too stupid too see the difference between having fun while you‚Äôre young and ruining your life. Taking to them wouldn‚Äôt really work because I‚Äôm not super close with them and I‚Äôm a guy. I‚Äôve thought about contacting their parents but Sarah has lots of family issues so I could end up making things worse. 

Any advice will help. I just really don‚Äôt want to see my nice friends turn into alcoholic criminals.",05Apr2018,3
77,"Small edit: also *how* would I go about doing all this stuff?


I‚Äôm in a huge split right now. I‚Äôm a senior in high school, and I‚Äôm going to do two years of community college. After that, I have no idea what I want to do. The three things I‚Äôm most interested in studying as majors are art/animation, geology/gemstones, and zoology/marine biology. These are things I‚Äôve loved my entire life, and I know for certain I can‚Äôt not study art in college, because I‚Äôve been working up to it. I just don‚Äôt know what to do with the others- do I do a double major?? A *triple* major?? Is that even possible? I know that college is expensive, and I don‚Äôt want to be in massive debt my whole life. I also know that an art degree is absolutely worthless- I just want to study it to be able to have the knowhow to do advanced art/animation and be able to sell and market it better.

The things I‚Äôm aspiring toward for jobs would be having a cartoon, being a freelance artist, selling my own future comic works, working as a convention artist, working in a zoo, working with wild animals in exotic places, or working with gemstones in some way (possibly lapidary, but that isn‚Äôt where my interest lies).

My other question lies in the idea of studying multiple things- I know I‚Äôm going to study art as a major, so if I want to do a double major I‚Äôd have to find a college bag excels in both art and zoology/marine biology/geology. Art schools, from what I know, are specific to art and art only. If I want a good artistic education, I‚Äôm going to have to sacrifice the others, right? Is there any way around this? Is art school + online college a good option?? I have no idea what to do. üòì",05Apr2018,1

80,"Long post incoming.

So back in summer of 17, I met this girl, who's family started going to my church. We're both 16, she's about to turn 17 in May. We don't talk a whole lot but we do every now and then, we're pretty good friends like we'll make fun of each other and what not. In December one Sunday, a mutual friend of ours, who I've known forever, asked me if I liked her. I didn't really straight up admit but I let her know that I did. My friend says she thinks the girl likes me as well. I say I don't think so because she's out of my league. She then tells me I should hit her up and I say I probably shouldn't because it would be too random and obvious, I said if she posts a HMU or something I will. Within 3 minutes exactly, the girl I like sends a Snapchat that says ""goodnight y'all someone hmu"". Keep in mind she has already sent streaks earlier that night. We talked a couple more times that week I think. Then Monday the next week, around 7:00 she messages me ""Hey"" nothing else. I didn't get it until an hour later but I'm freaking out and apologize about not responding and all that. We talked a lot that week.

I love talking to her, and I try to read the signals to make sure I'm not over doing it or just being stupid. I want to tell her how I feel, but I'm afraid of doing so because of these things. Obviously in afraid of embarrassing myself and/or ruining our friendship because of it. I know I screwed up when we met by putting her on a pedestal and thinking about her nonstop since then. I'm considering these two options, 1. Asking her out the old fashioned way and all that. And 2. Just being straight up and tell her. But the problem with 2 is I wouldn't have a chance to do it in person because we don't get a lot of time alone. I would have to do it through text which I don't know is a good idea or not.

A few months ago, my parents got me a child psychiatrist and I got a prescription for Lexipro. At first it seemed like it was really really helping and making me feel so much insanely better, but lately everything has just been shit. I wanted to talk to my dr. About getting an increase in the dosage last month, but because there was a blizzard it was cancelled and moved to this month (19th). 

Lately everything has just been shit. I feel hopeless and lonely and I feel like i‚Äôm looking for an escape from reality. My best friend, lets call her Jamie, just broke up with her boyfriend and I think i‚Äôve been feeling a lot of mixed emotions about that. I‚Äôve been friends with Jamie for 5 years and we‚Äôve been through a lot together, despite the age difference (4 years older),  and even at one point were in a relationship. If i‚Äôm being completely honest, I still do have feelings for her which is a weird situation, because she initially ended the relationship because of the age gap. You can say that the age gap is weird, but I never found a problem with it. I think with her ending it with her boyfriend brought up some conflicting emotions inside of me. I‚Äôm not going to be that douchebag who says ‚Äúoh, now heres my chance!‚Äù. Shes my best friend and I would do anything for her, and I don‚Äôt care if we just stay best friends. 

A lot of the time Jamie is pretty busy, so I have no time to talk to her. I have other friends but none that I could talk to about all this. I just feel lonely, and I have for a while.

I have pretty bad insomnia which kind of comes from my ADHD, and lately its been killing me. I just fall into a hole deeper and deeper while thinking about my emotions. I lay in bed with my eyes closed for hours and can‚Äôt even fall asleep. Its straining mentally and physically. 

To tell you the truth, I don‚Äôt even know why i‚Äôm posting here. I guess its because I need to vent kind of and I have nobody to talk to.

But it's frustrating to have to scan my entire, huge backyard before I let my dogs out.

He had to go out super late, like immediately. I watch him like I always do, and I thought he was eating poop, so I called him back in. No,  he had a cheese sandwich in a plastic bag. 

I'm frustrated, and I'm starting to think kids are purposely throwing their lunch in my yard. They often eat outside. 

I dont know who to even contact about it. The principle? I dont want to seem overdramatic, but now it's just making me worried about all my dogs, and if kids really are dumping their shit in my yard, it needs to stop.

In the USA

So my friend (Q) and I are in the process of starting an online retail shop.  

We are close to going live and Q has decided to move to California.  We are currently East coast.  This is part of him not being happy with his life here and his career choice (aspiring chef), so he plans on going to California with H ( his best friend) for at least two months but the plan/goal is to never come back and just travel the world being a cook and saving up for a plane ticket to the next place.

Our partnership is Q is doing most of the leg work while I am handling the legal/website end of it.  The reason for this is at my current job I work close to 80 hours a week so I don't have time to run around town doing photo shoots and getting product, but, I do have down time at work and access to a computer.

 He's really pushing for the website to be live before he moves. I don't think he understands that the amount of work is going to increase once we go live.  We were talking about doing promotions at events which I don't have time for he would have to do them, so I would have to ship him product and a camera or he would have to buy a camera in California.  It could work but our supplier is on the east coast and we've already created networks with promoters in the east.

Q is coming over to my house tomorrow to talk about the last few products we need before we can go live on the website, I'm going to bring it up to him that this isn't going to work with him on the exact opposite side of the country and that it's going to be expensive to go live.  I think he's expecting for the site to go live and then move to Cali and just start getting paid.

About a month ago H had brought up this idea of going to California but he's always talking like that and he was drunk at the time so I didn't take it seriously but now it's happening.

 Q sold his car bought a one way ticket and is abandoning his roommate in the house they are renting from Q's parents.  H is abandoning his apartment he's renting with my friend (R).

100,"Hi everyone. I've experienced severe depression and anxiety my entire life (had severe trauma as a child and what I suspect to have already been a predisposition to mental health issues). I've been doing my best to work through these problems. I've recently realized it is more of the physical sensations in my body that are perpetuating my emotions than the thoughts in my head. For reference:

- A negative thought occurs ---&gt; ""Seems like my fiance has been talking a lot of about his female coworker...""

- I shut that negative thought down, knowing it is just an anxiety ---&gt; ""No, he really hasn't been talking about her any more than any other coworker and has given me no indication that this is an issue,"" or sometimes simply, ""Stop""

- This actually **works** and I am able to let the thought go!

- But, I continue feeling the physical effects of the original thought. A tension in my jaw/throat/chest area, a lump in my throat, a general tightness in my shoulders, a sort of dropping in my stomach, and a type of buzzy adrenaline.

- These feelings continue, ultimately bringing the original thought back to the surface (as I remember it was the reason I felt these physical symptoms in the first place), and I then start thinking about it again.

This process ends up happening over and over again until I usually end up just talking to my fiance about it, resulting in a major crying storm over a thought I actually didn't even accept until the bodily sensations wouldn't subside and overwhelmed me. I usually feel a type of release after talking about it/crying about it, and then the bodily feelings are gone and also the mental thoughts. I've noticed this cycle several times. Throughout the conversation and the feelings leading up to it, I feel very logically in control and aware of my thoughts. It's just these physical feelings I can't seem to handle. It's like trying not to cry when having a lump in your throat; or in this case, trying not to get upset vocally when having a lump in your throat... and your chest... and your stomach.

I'm not sure if this makes any sense, but I'm hoping others might have more understanding of this situation than I, and might be able to give me some insight on what I can do the next time this happens. I truly believe I'd be able to cope with my anxious and depressive thoughts, and ultimately minimize how often they occur, if I didn't end up dwelling on them/talking about them for an hour or two due to the physical feelings bothering me and not leaving. Thoughts?

**TL;DR** The physical sensations I have in my body after a negative thought end up lasting for several minutes, even when the thought itself is easily brushed aside. These bodily feelings end up overwhelming me, ending with me crying or talking it through with my fiance. Since the original thoughts aren't that overwhelming, what are these bodily feelings and how can I handle them?",05Apr2018,1

She was perfect. She gave me everything. She did everything just perfectly. She was my best friend and I was hers until I drove her away. The only thing she did wrong was to not leave me sooner.

106,"So I recently got put in a group with this girl I've been eyeing and I've liked her for a little while now.

I'm shy extremely shy and  also shit with talking to girls. She seems really cool and idk what to do. I wanna ask for her number but as I said earlier we haven't really talked that much. I never ask girls for their number and I would hate for her to 'reject me'. I'm also not around her much as we only have this 1 class together. Also idk how I'd confront her. Like idk if I'd go up to her when she's by herself or something because if she's around friends I feel like it would be awkward. I'm probably wayy over thinking this but I'm an awkward person sometimes and I get nervous extremely easily. I just don't know what I would say. So tips and ways to approach her/ get to know her better and talk to her more would be very greatly appreciated. Sorry for rambling so much.

107,"For the record, we're both guys in a loving homosexual relationship. Using a throwaway because we know each other's reddit accs.

Not too long ago, we were having a semi-serious, semi-pointless convo about the things that made us into who we are today. He then brought up his sexuality and asked if he could tell me something he hadn't told anyone else before. Of course I let him do it, and he said that he thinks one of the reasons that he's gay is because his sister molested him when he was young and has found girls gross ever since. He also said that he was traumatized by it but forgave her because she was a teenager with hormones at the time.

My knee jerk reaction to this was telling him that it wasn't an excuse for her and that she shouldn't be forgiven for doing that to her little brother. We kinda quickly changed the topic after that but it's still got me upset. We haven't said anything about it since. Was what I said right to say?

109,"

My friend and I met about 10 or 11 months ago at our job.  We haven't known each other for very long at all, but she has quickly become my closest friend.  This is mostly because I don't have a large circle of friends these days to begin with.  We worked with each other full-time and got into the habit of getting coffee together after work or just generally hanging out after work.  She and I get along quite well about 99 percent of the time.  We do practically everything together and are even planning on going to school together in August.  

While I love her to death most of the time, lately I've found myself feeling hurt by the way she treats me the other part of the time.  I have a long history of blatantly allowing friends to abuse me mentally/emotionally, which is why I don't have many friends anymore.  This girl is the first person who doesn't treat me like shit the majority of the time, but I've found that the times where she does have been far more off-putting and have hurt me a little bit more than friends in the past have made me feel.  Think of it as quality vs. quantity.

For instance, tonight she and I arranged plans to meet up for coffee after a dinner I was having with a relative.  She asked me to call her when I was heading over.  My relative wanted to spend longer time with me but I told them that I had other obligations.  The relative understood and I went home.  As I started driving over, I called my friend and told her I was on my way like she had asked.  Her response: ""Oh, I'm actually sick now so I'm going to stay home tonight.""  I understood and told her it was totally fine and that I hoped she felt better.  My friend then went on to talk about her day at work and I listened to her wholeheartedly as usual.  After the conversation about work, she then said ""Yeah, so right now I'm on my way over to (her abusive ex boyfriend)'s house to hang out with him and (MY abusive ex boyfriend)--"" I was slightly shocked that she'd blatantly told me after cancelling our plans and asked ""Did that slip?""
She immediately became defensive and said to me ""oh but I'm still sick"".  All I said was ""oh, okay..."" and stayed silent while she continued to talk about the plans she had with the guys.  At the end of the call, she asked if I wanted to hang out with her tomorrow.  The only thing I could muster up to say was ""No thank you.""  I was trying to hold back tears.  She asked me ""why?"" And I just told her ""I don't know"" as it was the only thing I could think of.

I think what got me the most this time that actually drove me to tears was the fact that the boyfriends she chose to hang out with have been harassing me non-stop for months.  I get messages nightly from them calling me a fat whore, telling me my laugh sounds like a dying horse, telling me to lose 10 pounds, etc.  My friend knows this and still chooses to hang out with them, has laughed at the messages they send me.  The only thing she says to me about them is ""well you're not fat so don't worry about it.""  She isn't obligated to comfort me or defend me, but it hurts that she still chooses to hang out with them over me.  As a generalization, she often chooses ANY male over ANY of her female friends and throws a lot of her female friends under the bus.

This happens on a weekly basis.  I have asked her before to please at least text me beforehand if her plans change.  I don't mind her hanging out with other people for the most part.  Granted, I found it super hurtful that she chose her and my abusive ex over our previous plans.  But overall I don't mind.  All I want is a little bit more consideration of my time...  There have been instances where she won't answer calls or texts until hours after we were supposed to meet up to tell me she decided to cancel to hang out with someone else.  A lot of the time the plans we make take up a considerable amount of time that I have to put other plans with other people on hold for.  I have asked her to please just be more considerate.  She keeps doing it though.  I don't know how to express to her how frustrating and saddening it is to me.

I don't know how to talk to her about this but it's really bothering me.  I want to bring it up to her without some kind of argument.  I just don't know how.  My whole life has consisted of me allowing friends to abuse me, so I don't really know the best approach.  I really don't want to lose another friend over this, as we're still early in the friendship and I want to give her a chance to change.

TL;DR:  Friend ditched our plans tonight last minute to hang out with our abusive ex boyfriends, even though she told me she was sick and wanted to stay home.  This happens frequently.",05Apr2018,1

111,"My girlfriend and I met back in the summer and our relationship started early that fall. At first it was tough because we didn‚Äôt exactly live close to each other but we made do- FaceTiming, Snapchat, and holiday visits. It was pleasant and sweet. She really knows how to talk to me and vice versa. 

Time went on. We‚Äôre both seniors in high school so college was really getting in our faces when winter came around. With school and sports added on top of this, her and I talked less and less, but we still made the best of it. We hit a couple hiccups but rebounded within a couple days.

Spring came around and I sent her a Valentine‚Äôs gift, which she absolutely loved. Though the next week she told me that ‚Äòwe needed to talk‚Äô- so we did. She basically told me that this relationship just isn‚Äôt going to work out with the distance and how busy we‚Äôve been- because of that too, she‚Äôs lost interest in me and just wants to be friends. It wasn‚Äôt me, it was her- that‚Äôs what she said.

At first, I was very confused. It was almost as if my life flashed before my eyes but instead of my life, it was my past year with her. I expressed her my confusion but then all that turned into anger. I was just so mad. After a night of accusing each other of things- I blocked her from all communication outlets so that I could take a breather and think about what just happened.

I eventually came to an understanding and apologized to her. I told her that she‚Äôs right about how it can‚Äôt work out but I wanted us to see where we‚Äôre going next year before we move on to something new- so I wanted distance. 

A month goes by and I make small talk. I got the scholarship I was working my butt off for so I told her and thanked her for being there for me all the way. We got sidetracked and made some jokes but the reality set back in for the both of us and that was that. 

For spring break, my family and I drove past her area to go see some family friends. Despite us being in an awkward situation, we decided to go out to breakfast because we haven‚Äôt seen each other in a while and who knows when we‚Äôll be able to see each other again. Surprisingly enough, it was not awkward. We gave each other a hug when we saw each other, got food, sat down, and brought up old jokes that I surely thought were dead. 

It was perfect until she announced that she was going to a college less than an hour from the school that I committed to. I pretended to be happy for her but on the inside I was screaming. I was kind of hoping that she‚Äôd go somewhere far away so that I can just accept the death of our intimacy- but now that‚Äôs not the case. 

Us being geographically closer together is what we‚Äôve been wishing for the whole entire year. Now it‚Äôs just taunting me. She still cares for me dearly but only as a friend- I don‚Äôt really want to be just friends. 

I did some research as what any desperate guy would do and this is what my sources have told me to do (paraphrasing);

‚ÄúHave a long period of ‚Äòno contact‚Äô so that I can heal and I won‚Äôt be viewed as a desperate, unattractive male. After that is done and she hasn‚Äôt reached out to you, text her first- throw her some bait- then just play from there and wait for her to initiate.‚Äù 

Now, I know ‚Äòme posting my relationship issues on reddit‚Äô doesn‚Äôt exactly show me healing from this break up but I‚Äôd really go the extra mile for this girl and I‚Äôve kind of come to the last straw. 

So, what do you guys/gals say? Does this sound good? Any advice you can give?",05Apr2018,1

115,"TL;DR: Transferring for financial reasons. Texas/ UT Austin or Georgia / Kennesaw State University?

Some context: Parents are divorced, college getting too expensive with sudden change in my parents‚Äô incomes 

I am currently a sophomore at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. Despite scholarships, financial aid, etc, I came to a realization that if I were to stay, I would acquire a mountain of debt. Considering I just changed my major to Film and Digital Media, I‚Äôm not confident in having so much debt upon graduation as I would be if I were a business or another more (immediately) lucrative major.

So I need to transfer.

My first option is to live in Waco for a year (gap year), get Texas residency, and transfer to UT Austin with in-state tuition rates and do their Radio, Television, and Film (RTF) program, which is a great program. 
 
Originally, this was THE plan. My dad had told me I could move out to Georgia and live with him, but I didn‚Äôt envision him helping with college,  because he‚Äôs been unwilling to help in the past. However, my dad, who has never been willing to help pay for college, and who has been physically and emotionally distant from me my entire life, calls me and tells me this:

He‚Äôs willing to pay for ALL of my expenses. Tuition, fees, books, food, rent, the whole nine yards. I‚Äôd enroll at Kennesaw State University (KSU) in Georgia this coming fall, hold down a job, and pay for my incidentals/extras. 

It‚Äôs an incredible offer, and I didn‚Äôt expect him to be so generous given his track record throughout my life. 

What do you think I should do? If this were a normal situation, I‚Äôd imagine I‚Äôd go to Georgia each time as it‚Äôs an incredible deal,  but I don‚Äôt want to miss any thought or leave any stones unturned.

116,"So after school my mother had to pick me up quickly, and usually there's no parking spots and the wait line to pick up students are terribly long. So she placed her car in the handicapped parking spot (many people temp park in the handicapped section because there are so many, and I guess she was tempted in following the crowd), stayed in the car, and waited five minutes for me to come out.

She was angry at first, but then I reminded her that what she did was illegal and there really was no excuse in parking in the handicapped zone.

120,"Many people don't really know me, and on here it's obvious because it's the internet, but people irl don't usually know me. I don't like myself, in fact I hate myself, I hate myself so much that I can't go a single night without thinking about bad things happening to me and me thinking it should happen and I deserve it, this has been happening for years. I was diagnosed with ADD when I was 9 years old and have had it since, but the condition does give me bad mood swings from time to time and horribly enough in situations where I'm having more fun than I usually am, my mind suddenly goes to shit. I also row and I guess I'm good at it, I have gone to championships down in other states and I think I'm okay at it. My split time on my recent 2k is 1:50.2 so I think that's pretty good, and my best lineup is a double with one of my best friends who I met through rowing. Ever since we started this double in races I feel like I'm sort of left out and he's the one getting the compliments and all that, I remember specifically at our most recent one someone came up to him with me next to him, and only said good job to him, like ""oh you looked really good out there"" while I was in clear view. Another time was a few weeks ago when we passed another practice going on and two people when I was there said the same shit. The same shit was said to him when it was an effort between the two of us and I'm left out, I'm barely complimented on things I do, and it feels unfair to me.

121,"I‚Äôm dealing with resenting a person right now and at first I thought my anger was justified, but now I realize that a lot of my negativity hinges on jealousy and it‚Äôs starting to impact other areas of my life. How can I deal with this in a healthy manner? This will be long and vent-y so I‚Äôll include a tldr at the end.

There‚Äôs this girl in my uni classes, let‚Äôs call her ‚ÄúShannon‚Äù (not her real name of course). Shannon has a very childish and immature personality and puts on a ‚Äúcute and bubbly‚Äù persona to mooch off of people and get things she wants for free. She often doesn‚Äôt actively strive to learn new things or better herself and instead cuts corners or depends on other people to hold her hand through everything (I really don‚Äôt mind helping others learn things from class if they‚Äôre lost, but after I‚Äôve showed the same simple process about eight times and you look at me like a confused goldfish it gets old fast...teach a man to fish, ya know?) We have a lot of mutual friends because everyone knows everyone in our major, but most of them practically worship the ground she walks on by enabling her and encouraging her to act like a child. Most of these people are genuinely good-natured and fun to be around and collaborate with, and telling anyone how I truly feel about Shannon just isn‚Äôt worth socially isolating myself.

I caught onto her true nature early on in knowing her because she and a friend of mine (let‚Äôs call him ‚ÄúMatt‚Äù) were dating when I first met them and had been together for a long time but broke up shortly afterwards. The circumstances of their breakup were messy but mostly involved her getting too close for comfort with other guys and deciding she needed to see what else was out there. To keep her friend circle, get certain shared possessions out of the breakup, and keep Matt from opening up about what really happened, she blackmailed him by threatening to tell people that he hit her and has already told mutual friends of mine and hers that he was ‚Äúpsycho.‚Äù I‚Äôve always been inclined to believe Matt‚Äôs side of the story ever since my SO and I became close with him while supporting him through the breakup aftermath. He has a kind and down-to-Earth personality that would make it genuinely shocking if he ever laid a hand on a girl while Shannon has a history of manipulative and ill-planned behavior, and they also had a roommate who witnessed arguments between them firsthand. 

So why on Earth would I be jealous of someone like this? Well, Shannon happens to be passionate about a certain hobby/eventual career that I used to have an interest in but was never in the right place or time to pursue it because I didn‚Äôt previously live in an area with a community for it. I had planned to get my foot in the door once moving to my current city, but it seems like she‚Äôs already involved herself in every last branch of it in the area (of which there aren‚Äôt many). I‚Äôm sorry this is so vague but it‚Äôs something really specific/possibly identifying; let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs difficult to get into without making connections and without having prior experience, neither of which I have and that I can‚Äôt get without running into her or even worse, making her think I‚Äôm competing for her spot in the community she‚Äôs so tightly knit into. I feel like I can‚Äôt really do anything until she either loses interest and moves on to something else (super unlikely) or if she moves away after getting her associates next year.

I also think that I see my own worst traits in Shannon, which augments my annoyance towards her. I‚Äôm behind in life with no car and only an unreliable freelance job at 20 (not having a car is indefinite, but I want to get an actual job in about a month once the current semester ends and better my situation). I absolutely hate mooching off of people and try to be as self-sufficient as possible to the point where I pretty much only feel comfortable asking my SO for personal help of any sort, including rides. Shannon and I also have a lot of similar interests as well as similar living situations. Somehow she has a more active social life than me despite being perpetually broke spending money on alcohol and other indulgements all the time (very vocal about this). This all leads me feeling like I have to compete with her and try to be ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than her, something I‚Äôve felt deep down for a while but only recently gained the self-awareness to actually acknowledge. Shannon also did not have a license/car but just recently passed her drivers test. My first thought maybe didn‚Äôt necessarily have to be jumping for joy, but I should have at least been happy that someone in a similar situation to me found some independence right? Nope, all I felt was a cold dread that she was ‚Äúahead‚Äù of me. This has led me to believe that my obsession with nitpicking her flaws and ‚Äúcompeting‚Äù might be getting unhealthy.

There‚Äôs a catch to why I can‚Äôt just ‚Äúlet go‚Äù though and either get over it or distance myself. To be completely honest, I rarely hold grudges. My biggest reason for holding onto my grudge against Shannon is because in some twisted way, it motivates me to better myself. I have to keep my apartment clean, or I‚Äôll be messy just like Shannon‚Äôs roommate complains that she is. I have to stay motivated to complete my weekly school projects on time even on weeks where I‚Äôm feeling burnt out, depressed, or uninspired with new ideas because if I don‚Äôt, I‚Äôll be just like Shannon who occasionally doesn‚Äôt turn in assignments on time. This is a huge one because my professor now sees me as a stellar student because I have to make my projects over the top...but, and I could never admit this to anyone from school, that‚Äôs like 50-80% actual passion for the project/ambition to produce good work and 20-50% Shannon grudge. Without her influence, there would have been at least one week where I wouldn‚Äôt have had my work ready on time. Hell maybe at this rate I‚Äôll finally actually try to get my license within the next year instead of making excuses because guess what? I can‚Äôt be stuck eating Shannon‚Äôs dust. Motivation is motivation. I have a hard time holding onto motivation sometimes because of my depression/anxiety so when it comes in large doses, I‚Äôm always appreciative. However, I realize this mindset is still not mentally healthy, probably immature, and could even eventually end up biting me in the ass somehow.

**TL;DR:** My peer is an obnoxious person all around and I‚Äôve grown to strongly dislike her. I realize that this is not just because of objectively shitty things she‚Äôs done, but also feelings of jealousy over things she has that I don‚Äôt as well as an irrational feeling that I need to compete with her due to similar life circumstances. I realize this is a childish and even unhealthy grudge, but my need to be ‚Äúbetter‚Äù is motivating me to stay organized and stay productive in school at times when I otherwise feel burnt out. I also cannot completely cut her out due to ties with mutual friends and she just isn‚Äôt worth hurting my relationships with them.

123,"Recently, I spotted a girl who I thought was pretty in one of my professor's other classes and through mutual friends, I've been getting little hints that she seems to like me in return. However, I was told that she is super religious where as I'm very much the opposite. I don't have a problem with it at all, and I think her religious morals would actually be a positive. 

I've also learned that she hasn't dated much at all in the past where as I've had my share of girlfriends, and it seems like that would be a bit of an issue since I'm comfortable with dating and she is very much new to it. Now, I have no issues with taking steps at a comfortable pace, but it worries me that maybe this whole situation is far too complicated for what seems like just physical attraction. I'd rather abandon my feelings for her before it gets to a level where I may get attached. 

My question: Is it worth it? I clearly like her and her situation doesn't bother me at face value, but I can see many scenarios where things could conflict. I'm much more interested in making it work, but I'd like a second opinion.

129,"I met this girl and we had a bunch of stuff in common.  Some rare things.  We really had a rare connection.

She had ended a long term relationship about half a year prior and was really depressed about it. I asked her out and she gave me a maybe, saying she really shouldn't be in a relationship.  Despite that, we still hung out, and she started to make things intimate, very quickly. 

Things escalated pretty fast and I thought things were going well, but she suddenly wanted to end things but remain friends (which she was adamant about doing, until she recently started ignoring me).

I'm worried because I know she's lonely.  She has no true friends, aside from her out of town ex-boyfriend who she still frequently talks to (but has no intention of getting back together with apparently). Most of her friends in this college town are fair weather friends. She struggled with serious depression and anxiety in general.  If she's backing away from me, I guess there's not much I can do.

But she frequently brought up that only one person would ever care if she suddenly disappeared or killed herself and it was her ex.  Is she saying this kind of stuff just to get attention? Do I just let her go?

This girl sunk her hooks into me and disappeared. It just feels so unresolved. 

I don't text her much since she broke up with me, but I do check in once in a while.  We hung out as friends a couple times after it ended.  Is there anything I should say or do to check in with her or do I just need to leave it?",05Apr2018,1
130,"Too often, I ruminate and dive into all the things I‚Äôve done that I should be ashamed of. Anything from how I handled criticism, to how bad of a friend I am. Some days, these self critiques are so believable when I examin where I‚Äôm at, and who I‚Äôm with/not with.

To stay balanced, I meditate, practice yoga, I write and run, jiu jutsu once a week. I eat healthy on most days. I just got involved in a side business I‚Äôm excited about.

I do everything in my power to not self sabotage. Still, I often feel disconnected from people at the end of the day. No matter how productive I am, I don‚Äôt feel ‚Äòwhole‚Äô. I only have myself to blame, the love you receive may be similar to the love you give. I‚Äôm ashamed of that fact

How do you surrender to your reality, even though it‚Äôs not perfect? How do you stop yourself from self sabotaging? I want to make something of myself, I believe that I can, but behaviors of self sabotage is killing me.",05Apr2018,3
131,"The dog is a Shih Tzu. He is almost ten years old and has been expected to live for another 3 or 4 years. He means absolutely everything to her since she has serious depression and he's one of the only things that can help her through the really low periods. 

He's been having some issues for about 3 months now. He's lost a lot of his balance, is hesitant to use his front leg, and, as time has gone on, is highly prone to falling over. First vet told us it was a tweaked/rotated vertabra in the neck that was punching a nerve. Just a few days ago he had a serious fit of immense pain and couldn't move, just laid on his side and cried. We took him in to an errand, and the vet there went more in depth than either of the two we'd seen previously, and told us she expected a slipped disk in the neck. The vet was highly concerned at the severity of the dog's lack of balance and coordination, so she gave us two painkillers in addition to the steroids he's been on for the past couple months. She also told us briefly about surgery to fix a slipped disk. They'd need to scan first, but if it turned out to be a slipped disk than the surgery to fix the problem has a 90% success rate, and other dogs having gone through it returned to nearly full mobility and activity, living long and healthy lives as a result. Problem is that the surgery costs $5000. The parents are divorced, and the dog is the mom's, the dad is also a mailman so he wouldn't have the money anyways. My girlfriend's mom has said that the surgery is too expensive and she can't afford it, leaving the only option to be the dog down this coming Saturday. 

Today on two different painkillers and one steroid, the dog was about 75% to full health again. His balance was remarkably improved, hardly ever falling over, he didn't have any pain all day, nor tension in his neck or shoulders, he was attempting to run and bark at the door before we stopped him for fear of him overexerting himself, etc etc. His love for life felt renewed. 

I know it was likely the painkillers making him feel like he had energy and no limits again, but he went from not even being able to stand last night to running across whole rooms without any slight issue literally overnight.

From everything I saw today, he doesn't look at all like a dog that needs to be put down, he doesn't look miserable or of a horrible quality of life. I've had to put three dogs down previously and feel as though I kind of know the signs. But this just feels wrong. Yeah he was all hopped up on medicine today which undoubtedly  helped but still.  

My gf is devastated by this, as she also thinks he doesn't look or seem like he needs to be put down, but she agrees that something needs to be done because he can't continue as he was. We are both in college, and she lives at home with her mom rent free  and currently without work due to the depression. She says that she's willing to drain her entire savings account of ~$5000 to pay for the surgery herself, again citing his ability to walk and run and the surgery's supposed 90% success rate. I agree that he seems to be doing too well and definitely doesn't need put down given his current condition, but I don't know what to do. It just feels like the wrong decision.

I could really use some advice~~~~

Tldr: girlfriend's dog is set to be put down in a few days. Whole thing feels like the wrong decision, like he's still got 3-4 years with an expensive 90% success rate surgery.",05Apr2018,0
132,"Story:  I have been trying hard to get back with my ex for 7 years because I fell in love with her ever since we broke up. I have always been there by her side with everything life has thrown at her, I was always her shoulder to cry on. I got tired of dealing with the pain and confessed to her while she had a boyfriend, obviously was rejected and she told me she just liked me as a friend. 
I disappeared from the face of the earth after that and ignored her. I came back to her life after a few years. We reconnected better than before and spent almost every week together. Amazing moments we had.  But she realized I still had feelings for her and advised me she was not ready for a relationship at this time. 
I took the hint but she distanced herself until recently. We hanged out like usual and  that's when she dropped the bomb on me. She is pregnant by her ex boyfriend and she is not sure she wants to be with her ex. She proceeded by letting me know that she was falling in love with me. 
I connect with this girl like no other, we are inseparable and I love her to death. How can I cope with this? If she proceeds to reject her ex, would it be stupid of me to take responsibility? I would be up for it just to be with her but I'm not sure if I want the commitment. My head is spinning,  I haven't slept since this. I am feeling sick and nauseous. I need advice.",05Apr2018,5
133,"Throwaway because my late night writing is cringey and this post might come off as desperate. So this happened a while back and I'm just now realizing what it meant. This is also kind of a half r/offmychest post and half r/advice post, profanity warning for all your pure, innocent reddit eyes. I probably should just calm down and chalk it up as a loss to learn from, but I just fucking realized that I make fucking basketballs look sharp. I've always kinda had this tendency to gloss over details or forget little things, usually to the detriment or inconvenience of myself. People have usually found it either endearing or insufferable, but this time I fucked up. Not horribly, not in a way that compromises someone's safety or obliterates relationships, but regardless fucked up. There was this one girl that I knew in middle school (roughly 4 years ago) That kinda stuck with me. I had a big crush on her for the duration that I knew her, and even after I left to a different high school she crossed my mind from time to time. Not like that, Lenny. So me being a senior in high school, walking home (gas is stupid) when somebody my age rolls down their window at an intersection I just walked across and addressing me by name, surprised, says that its been awhile since I've seen her and asking if I recognize her. Now I have shortsighted vision, and I can usually tell basic outline and hair color a distance, but she could have been a broom with sunglasses for all I knew. So I said, embarrassed, that I don't have my glasses and that she seems familiar. She describes aspects of the class we had together, and an association is drawn. I ""identify"" her as this one other girl I had banter with at one point when doing a project. I can't see her facial expression, but there's a pause and an, ""Oh"". She says something else and wishes me well, and I walk away, satisfied and pleasantly surprised, thinking, ""Huh, its a small world"". I just realized, however, months later, in the shower, that the voice matched the girl I knew and still thought about, and I whiffed a reeeally chance encounter like a jackass. It's nothing too extreme, but holy shit, am I bummed out and also really, really slow. I'm wondering if I should try to contact her through social media (which I'm not sure if she has) or again, just chalk it up as a lesson and move on. In the chance that I've got the wrong girl (Which I really doubt, short term memory is shitty but long term is solid, at least most of the time) I'd hate to come off as weird and spontaneously contact someone who has not seen me in years claiming I saw them months ago.

140,"New to Reddit, but this seems easy enough..So, my issue and the backstory behind it is a pretty lengthy story to try to explain, but I appreciate the time taken and will try to make it quick and painless. Several years ago I fell in love with someone who I was very much outside of my general ""type"" of guy that I would typically date. I had no self identity, no self esteem, and no standards for anything before I started dating him, and eventually became engaged to him (his name is Nolan) after dating and living together for almost 2 years at that point. His family absolutely loved me and treated me like one of their own. He had constant suicidal depression when we first got together which seemed to improve significantly over the corse of the relationship, so his family would tell me how happy they were that we had met because I may have saved his life. On my end, I love my family dearly but cannot seem to do anything to make anyone satisfied with choices i make in MY own life, so they've always caused more harm than good, so I stay pretty distanced from most of my family members and only speak to them/see them on holidays. I don't give a fuck whether I'm there at the gathering, no one else gives a fuck either, family gatherings with my family are a disaster. However I've always been the closest to my father, however just barely closer. There's not exactly any warmth between us, but he's the relative that I have the most in common with. End boring back story. So as I was saying, Nolan and I had been dating for quite awhile, and when I would call my dad on the phone I'd usually mention Nolan and say that I'd like my dad to meet him sometime soon. My dad would sound as though he were up for it, which made me really happy. However any time I tried to put wheels in motion with any actual plan to meet up (a date, time, etc), my dad would have some lame excuse as to why that date wouldn't be a good time for him, while offering no other options or resolution to the predicament. The reasons he had for not meeting up with us to go to dinner or whatever were so minuscule yet somehow still so over the top. Not so blunt and hurtful as ""I can't, I have to watch paint dry."" But more like ""it's raining a little and I'm not so keen on going anywhere tonight"" when I know that it's never been an issue for him before. I've been with him in be car plenty of times in worse road conditions and the man has his CDL license, he's no stranger to driving anything anywhere.After 3 attempts at it I just stopped trying...we eventually got engaged and my dad still had yet to meet him even then, and I was afraid of my dad's reaction to my engagement because they hadn't even met each other and somehow that would come back to bite me in the ass, it would be my wrongdoing. I would be an uncaring brat for getting married to a guy and not even caring enough to have him meet my dad. Nolan had proposed to me one January after we'd been together for 2 years, and then in May the same
Year my fianc√© had a fatal car accident less then 10 minutes from home on his way to work. He was 23. He had recently been pretty upset that my dad all but refused to meet him, and that first face to face introduction would've made Nolan feel so uncomfortable after all the BS that introducing them to each other started to seem like a dreaded chore that had to be done eventually. After the accident my dad called me and as we were talking, he begrudgingly apologized for never meeting him, but I could tell that he wasn't exactly sure what he should be sorry for, just obligated to say it. I let it go, as there's really no other choice, what's done was done and I can't change it, but I will remember it. Now I'm engaged again, and guess who still has yet to meet my new fianc√©? 

It's not as though I'm completely oblivious to what is happening here, I realize that it's manipulation. I'm just having trouble understanding why...I'm pretty sure what needs to be done but it's hard for me. I love him, and the last thing I'd want to do is hurt him. But I'm not going to put my future husband through the pressure of meeting my dad and the whole formality when it's extremely likely that no matter how happy he makes me or what he does, he's going to end up being rejected anyhow. I haven't even bothered with it this time around, and my fianc√© gets it and honestly doesn't even care if he never meets him at this point, as many teeth have to be pulled. There are options as to who I spend my life with, and as I said, any option I choose is the incorrect one and I should've chose differently, and how was that not common sense? It's consumed so much thought for so long now, and I feel like I don't even live my life for myself anymore, I live to make my parents proud. I want to live my life my own way, but by doing whatever's needed to regain my life or even tell
Him how I feel,  I may hurt my dad, and it fills me with rage that I even feel this way about someone who's done very little to support me or show me the steps to becoming a well-rounded, well developed adult. Whatever option it is, it will definitely be wrong, I'm definitely made well aware that it's wrong, and if he doesn't agree with a decision then I'm overcome with shame and worry that I've disappointed him and now he's ashamed of me. I don't understand it, and I don't understand why I continue to care so much. considering the circumstances, is it completely irrational to just let it go for now and if he doesn't meet him until the wedding then that's on him? Does that make me a POS daughter? How does one simply stop caring about hurting family members that don't seem to care whether they are harming you? Why am I taking on the full load of guilt for being happy and living my life the way that I know I should be? At what point does living your own way become liberating/ rewarding and not just a giant shit storm of guilt? I'm not sure how to get off of this ferris
Wheel or how I got to be this way, maybe it's common sense to most people, but maybe I'm not ready to accept it for what it is...",05Apr2018,0

144,"Posted a few days ago regarding my ex g.f (23f) ignoring the shit out of me and what would be the causes.
I was called names by a few, others just said shit I guess to make me feel shitty. Without asking for the whole scenario.

Yes I was in the wrong, cheated through Instagram texts. Just flirting with a girl who I was never going to meet anyway. 
My ex saw this, and ofcourse broke it off.

We dated for a year, while we were dating, she went out on a date with a guy and thought it was fine. It was always hard for her to say the truth, and I had to ask over and over again even if it was a few days later for her to slip up and tell me the truth. Another day, she goes over to another guy's house and she doesn't tell me. She gets cold with me throughout the day until like the next day we meet up and talk. Again, she doesn't tell me the truth, she lied and it built on lies, until she confessed that she went over a guy's house and spent time there but nothing happened. I still stayed with her.

We continued dating, and at some point of the relationship I realized she lost touch with her hobbies, she writes and sings. I always used to ask her, and I realized that she needs sadness to actually get creative. At some point, the guy she went out on a date with tells her he wants her to meet him and record her singing for a project he has. I did not like the idea and suggested her not to do it because it would effect me.

 Days pass, she was using her phone and she had this guy talking to her on Snapchat. While she tells me she doesn't talk to the guy or anything. Days/weeks pass, and she tells me I made her lose an opportunity by telling her not to record with the guy. I had no words for the comment, and suggested that I do not want to be the one to hold her back, I'm actually trying to do the opposite whatever the case. 

Different shit happened, until I had to leave the country because my mother had cancer. While I was taking care of my mum, I flirted just that once with this other girl who isn't in any of the countries. She saw it and broke it off.

What I did was wrong and I do feel shitty about it. But the shittiest thing, is the ex is ignoring me completely. After I got back, we talked and we're going to meet in two days time. When she just stayed silent and stopped replying to my texts. We are in the same uni, so I do get some anxiety of just seeing her randomly, I mean what do I do? I can't imagine ignoring her, I mean, I stayed with her through thick and thin, and wanted to be with her, I'm a realist, I believe as long as there is communication and no mind games, relationships will work. Just got to be adults about it.

I have sent her texts, long texts with no avail of a reply. As if, we never existed. I've stopped now, because I don't think she's a good person anymore. My view is changing, making me feel like I might have not really known her after all. I tried being real and Abit optimistic with the relationship, which is why I stayed in it. I wanted her to spread her wings and do what she wants. ( Was asking her to not record for a uni project for the guy she went out on a date with wrong?) .

Whatever the case, I saw a small video of her on Instagram through a friends story and I just couldn't take it, did not even attend my classes, just stayed home drowning my sorrows with some whiskey and cigarettes.

I know that time will heal everything. I just feel like I fucked up, with someone who meant something to me. And it's the saddest shit that this person is ignoring me blatantly.
How would you deal with this situation?
And am I that much of an asshole? 
Am I insane to still want something ?

Well, what I'm really, really good at and what I love doing is spending a week or two learning as much as I possibly can about a topic and then moving on to something else. At first I thought this was me trying to 'find my passion' but it's not that I learn and then decide I don't like doing things I learned to do, it's just that my passion is constantly exploring new ideas.

Where to start. My fianc√© and I have been together 6 years. She has 2 kids from a previous relationship. We have a daughter together that is my entire world. Her kids call me dad (and I am). They don‚Äôt know their father cause he is a deadbeat piece of shit. Their dad isn‚Äôt in the picture. For all intents and purposes. I have 3 kids. 

We are under a great deal of stress. I bought 5 acres of land 2 months ago so we could build a house. I am a truck driver and have been out for a month and a half. Our plan was that I would be out frequently to pay off the debt in a few months instead of a few years.

On top of that, we moved in to my parents apartment on their land so that we could save the extra money to pay the land off quickly with only $100 rent plus electricity, water, Internet, etc... 

So a month ago, before we moved in to the ‚Äúapartment‚Äù, she cheated. As far as I know, it wasn‚Äôt physical. Her and this guy were talking shit to each other. Nothing specific at all. Just about having a wild night and maybe meeting up. Well, the guys fianc√© went snooping through his phone and sent me the messages. I have never met either one of them. We argued and ended up over the course of a week staying together instead of breaking up. 

So here we are a month later. We are in the new apartment. I just got home from being on the road for 5 weeks. I have spent the last two days cutting down trees, underbrush, etc. 

This is the first time we have seen each other since the problem and I am finding myself getting short with her and not really caring about her opinion or feelings. 

I need some advice on how to get past this. I love her. I just don‚Äôt feel like being very nice. Know what I mean? But I don‚Äôt want to be mean to her after I agreed to try again. I‚Äôm lost. ",05Apr2018,3
156,"My mom caught me smoking weed a few months ago, she gave me a warning and said if i do it again there will be more consequences.. Marijuana is not legal here, but it is decriminalized, and if it was legal, i would be under the age, now I know someones gonna say ‚Äúoh well you shouldn‚Äôt be doing that, you‚Äôre too young‚Äù so if you are, please leave now, its not like i am doing meth. Anyways, she caught me a second time, and grounded me until Christmas, she told me she would move us to another community or school or whatever to keep me from smoking, if i am ever caught again.. So here is the thing, apparently i am doing the most terrible, unholy, ungodly thing by smoking cannabis, even a part of my family thinks i am going to like sell it to my cousins, i feel like an outcast, i just wanna smoke weed in peace, i literally do not even smoke it with anybody except by myself and i plan on smoking it in the future. So why do i have consequences? If i am going to continue doing it, why punish me, why take all my stuff away for this stupid reason? Marijuana is the least of people‚Äôs worries, i think alcohol is an epidemic, and causes way more deaths, and cigarettes, literally cancer in a stick, causing cancer everywhere, people are losing lives this very moment, due to cigarettes, so why worry about your ‚Äúpoor‚Äù teenager using marijuana, which is apparently the ‚Äúgateway drug‚Äù ",05Apr2018,2
157,"Overheard my dad talking to his best friend. I heard him say that he‚Äôs going to get the house back in his

He also asked my mom money for the other day, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that big of a deal because money been low lately.

160,"My roommates (I live with a couple, there are 3 of us total living in the apartment) bought a french bulldog puppy  about 4 months ago and have made absolutely no effort to house break him. There is no walking schedule to get him to start going to the bathroom outside of our apartment and the dog is still praised when he goes in the house in a pen that they have set up with newspapers. The house constantly stinks, the dog has completely taken over the shared living/kitchen. Sometimes the smell is so bad that I literally gag. The last couple days the dog has had stomach problems leading to regular diarrhoea accidents, some of which was cleaned and then simply placed in our trash bin to continue stinking up the apartment. It is almost 11am and he still hasn't been taken outside for his morning walk, despite his continued stomach problems. (They apparently plan to take him to the vet later to find out why he's sick)

It is a two-bedroom apartment and I pay 50% of the rent. They had discussed getting a dog at some point but they ""surprised"" me with the dog one day when I came home from work in what now seems like a way to avoid discussing paying more rent or some kind of deposit. I like dogs and supported it in theory but our landlord does not allow pets so there has been no pet deposit paid and having a dog that is not allowed puts me at risk of losing my living space. Not to mention I am now paying for the dog to stink up the apartment. 

What should I do? I know I have to talk to them about potty training the dog but can I ask that we recalculate how much rent each of us pays? I think I am far overpaying at 50% of the total rent. I have been living here for 1.5 years and although I found the rent split unfair before, I now find it even more so with the dog added in the mix.

A couple notes:

- We live in a city apartment so we do not have a backyard although there is a park right next to our building.

- We split all bills 3 ways

- I pay 50% of the rent for the smaller of the two bedrooms, a bathroom that is not en-suite and therefore constantly used by their friends and visitors, and 1/3 of the shared living space (now 1/4, including the dog). Their room is larger with an en-suite bathroom, plus the entire living space is basically theirs and the dog's now.

- I took the room over from someone else which is why the rent split was already decided when I moved in. They have been living here for about twice as long as I have. I didn't realize I paid so much more than my roommates until a few months in. 

Please help!! I'm not crazy for thinking I pay too much rent, am I? I feel like I am being taken advantage of and could use some advice for when I speak with them. ",05Apr2018,6

163,"I'm at 24 year old guy.
I've been depressed before (about 3 years ago) but I got help and I've been able to manage it until now. My living arrangements recently changed and now I live alone where before I used to live with my parents.
I don't have many friends at my university. And i'm doing my internship right now. At my internship i don't really interact with alot of people and the ones i do interact with are usually twice my age.
I think i'm falling into a depression from a lack of contact with people. The only person i really talk to anymore is a girl i've met online about 6 months ago. We'll text and talk almost everyday. I've told her some of the things that keep me up at night, including some intimate ones. That said I know that she is dealing with things herself (isn't everyone?). But she hasn't decided to open up about them to me.

A month ago she invited me to visit her in her country. And i've decided to take her up on the invitation. I'm going to visit her in about 2 weeks. I have no idea what to expect from the trip. I have no idea what are her intentions are, is it just to meet up with a friend and hang out or is there more going on. She'll be flirty one moment and then completely shut down the other and it's driving me mad.
As I've said before I've recently discovered i'm falling back into depression. I've already made an apointment with a professional to talk about my problems and see what can be done. But she feels like I'm hiding something or that something is wrong. I really like her and I wouldn't mind trying to start something with her. I feel like unloading my problems on her now would lower my chances but I really feel like I need someone who I can trust to talk to. It also feels likei'd just be a burden to her while she hasn't opened up about anything herself.

I'm sorry for being a bit all over the place with this, i'm not good at writing and English isn't my mother tongue.

164,High school is not being kind to me rn,05Apr2018,2
165,"I woke a few days ago and had an epiphany: I realized that I had spent the past six years using all of my free time to play video games. It got worse when I started earning enough money to build a ridiculous gaming rig. It‚Äôs as if video games taught my brain to seek for the easy reward that comes from achieving virtual goals. This sapped my desire to accomplish real life goals, that come with far greater rewards than anything found in video games.

So I sold my fancy rig and quit video games, cold turkey. What this means is that I now have 140 free hours a month.

171,"My parnter and I just moved in together after being in a LDR for a year. She has these psychotic episodes like a dissociative fugue state, and she will sometimes do things like go outside without dressing, wander across town, then finally ""wake up"" and come back to her senses. She will also do things like bang her head on the wall or cut herself, though that is less often. The episodes are rather rare, but the potential for danger is incredible, because she is depressed and has many suicidal ideations. 

We are currently living with my family. We're both 21. She is on disability, and I'm currently in between jobs and on unemployment. Things are okay right now, but I'm afraid for when I'm working again that she could do something horrible while I am away.

What can be done about this? I feel like we need to proof the house for any dangers; knives, razors, etc., and somehow lock the door so that she can't get out but obviously that's preposterous. I'm so scared that something will happen to while I'm not home. I want to keep her safe but I have to work. Ideally I could get something work from home but I don't have any qualifications. I'm just so lost.

I'm still rather young and I haven't gone to school, so I'm not going to be getting a well paying job to afford some kind of caregiver, either... She doesn't even need one 24/7 for daily activities, she just needs someone to watch her to make sure she doesn't have an episode and do major harm to herself.

This has been going on for about 4 months but now I'm pretty sure he still has feelings for a girl he tried to date late last year before anything between us started. 

I talked to him about it before and he claimed it's just friendship but he comments flirty things on her Facebook and basically likes only her ""I want a relationship"" type posts.

We're going to a convention this weekend with a few friends so I'm going to just bury my feelings until afterwards. My plan is to talk to him Monday about us as a whole and to bring up my insecurity when it comes to her. I'm just wondering would it be totally wrong if I gave him the it's me or her ultimatum?

My friend moved an hour away at the beginning of the year due to his dad getting a new job. At the time he was doing no school work and only cared about friends and hanging out, which is also part of why they moved.

 Over this time he supposedly became really depressed because he wasn't ""with his real friends"" (the ones he had there where just ""temporary"" and mean nothing) his parents are pretty strict Catholic which is also a main problem.

 He decided earlier in the year he was going to leave home. So I asked my auntie about everything legal wise (she's one of the main youth something people in the region) so we got everything for him, sorted it out and he left the next week. Late February he said he spoke to his parents and they where letting him leave home, which I called bullshit on immediately. Sure enough his mum messaged the mum of our friend he was going to move it and said she had heard nothing of it and had found out by seeing a message on his phone. Once we found that out the 3 of us (me, our friend/his mum he was going to move to and his gf) all got together and found out he had told us all different stories, had been lying etc.

 All of a sudden on Sunday he messaged saying he had a bus ticket and would be leaving today. At the time I tried telling him he's only thinking about now because all he cares about is leaving and coming back to the school here, because his ""real"" friends are there (even though that group of friends is dead now) according to him and his gf they've sorted it all out and so on. I couldn't be bothered after an hour and just gave in. Late this afternoon he messaged saying he's now at his gfs house and is living there and so on.

 His older brother messaged me about 30 minutes ago asking if we've spoken today and I haven't opened it yet. I've had a falling out with them over this time and everyone I know here, and the only reason I'm still talking to him is because he has something of mine I want back (it was a Christmas present from my parents I left at his house when I stayed the night) I'm not sure what to say to him, if anything. Run away friend told me he's gonna put his family behind him and let things die down first, though he said he's left.

 Should I just leave it, tell him he's here, but safe, that we haven't spoken in ages? Idk...
 

 Also run away just turned 17, that's why he waited till now to leave, since his parents can't call police or anything. And the country is New Zealand if that helps.

176,"Hello hello!

In a nutshell, I applied to two municipal jobs and landed an interview to both. One I interviewed at yesterday, and was told next week Wednesday I would have an answer; the other I have a scheduled 20 min Skype interview for next Thursday(I assume this is a preliminary interview).

So I did reach out to my leasing office regarding the noise level from his apartment. They actually called him and he informed the leasing agent that he plays music 24/7 even when he is not home. I'm sure he knows that it's me who made the complaint because whenever I turn my TV on he silences his apartment as if he's trying to listen for me then blasts his music. I dunno what else to do. The complex sent him an email informing him of my complaint, but so far I'm getting advice to confront him directly. The only issue with that is he seems pretty rude. When he was talking to the leasing agent on the phone I was present at the time. He was very argumentative and offended that someone had even complained.

195,"So let's start with some background info.
I work in a kitchen as a supervisor. I have a chef above me who manages that kitchen and an executive chef who manages the whole property. Below me I have (from highest to lowest rank) cook 3, cook 2, and cook 1 employees. I'm having an issue with a cook 1 who started back in November. So she hasn't been there super long. She isn't really super experienced in the kitchen which is okay because she is low man on the totem pole so we don't ask crazy difficult things of her. The basis of her job comes down to putting frozen things on a pan and baking them, putting things in bowls or on plates, or basic recipes. 

She is constantly late for work and on her phone while on the job. She takes far too many smoke breaks at inconvenient times. Lately she has been moving so slow that all the other cooks have to finish their tasks and then rush to help her get things baked on time. (Frozen things where you just put it on a pan and bake it; literally) it takes her 3x as long to do these simple tasks. Yesterday I sent her home after receiving orders from my boss to do so. Apparently she left in tears. I've known for a while that she doesn't like me and she shows it at work by disrespecting me and not following orders. That doesn't bother me really as much as the work gets done efficiently. She no called no showed at work today and told my boss it was because of me and said some things that I don't find accurate or true. She will be on temporary suspension from her absences and tardiness. But when she comes back something needs to be done to resolve this situation. I just don't know what. I was apparently too friendly at first with her now I'm being too distant. She also doesn't like the fact that I'm younger than her but im also her supervisor. I'm just lost. Please help. I'm not a mean person and it hurts my heart that she feels this way.",05Apr2018,2

197,"For starters then I've got [avoidant personality disorder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoidant_personality_disorder) . Read the summary on the top if you don't know it. 




There's this girl I'm going to class with me (we're studying social science abroad) who I'm really into. Here's some points:


* I am known for being shy and not talkative in the class 


* we don't talk face to face 


* she seem silent/introverted herself 


* an interesting thing: the one time I've seen her at a bar, when my classmates all went together, her friend randomly asked me if I shouldn't go up and get some more to drink. So I went, and there she went up to me and asked what I was ordering. I was so surprised and shy (not to mention that I'm inexperienced with going to bars and alcohol in general) that I said it was x drink that my friend recommended me, and then I acted shy and went away. 


* nothing happens afterwards and for a long time 


* I see her in the street walking in the direction of me at night. She says hi, and I said something intangible and quickly went my way. Later that night I wrote an apology to her and said I hoped she has a nice evening, to which she said I shouldn't think of it and she hoped the same. She continued the chat and asked were I lived because she keep seeing me around. After I told her, she said that she was living in the same street as where I train (I do a shit ton of strength training there and martial arts elsewhere). 


* next day she approached me at the library with the same friend that asked me to go up to the bar. She, the girl I'm interested in, asked me about a certain book that the teachers recommended - if I could remember the name. I said yes and smiled, gave her the name and then went my way.


* nothing happens for a while until one day where I saw her interested in an event which I was genuinely interested in myself. I asked her on social media that I was interested in going to it but I wasn't sure if you needed to sign up some where. Yea, it was rather awkward. So I got even more ""aloof"" towards her after asking that. 


* She didn't show up to the event, but wrote to me the day after asking how it was and the fact that she and her friend forgot time and showed up later, and then the place was filled (which it was, I could hardly find a place). Then she asked me what subjects I've chosen for the next seminars and how it was going with it. I had a vacation there, so she said she hoped I enjoyed it. 


Nothing have happened afterwards. However when I look at her she looks down at the floor. When she bikes by me, she smiles and says nothing. 



So I think she's just feeling sorry for me since I'm so shy and awkward. That's why she's nice and asking me. She's the most nice, beautiful and smart girl I've ever seen so she could easily find a more confident, attractive and wealthy guy. ",05Apr2018,2

201,"Studied English in college with no real plan and because I liked it. Made no new friends because I had plenty come to the same college as me.

202,"Alright, I hope this is the right place to ask, because I'm in need of some clear-headed guidance. I'm a 25 year old uni student. My father is 60 and owns a big bar that he has had for 20+ years along with a partner. This is a long, drama-filled story so I'll have to provide some background.

He got into a 5-man partnership about 16 years ago because things were ugly financially. We live in a country that is in a a bad financial state, too. The new endeavor was extremely successful, but over the years it suffered from the crisis and struggled to stay alive. We have a significant amount of debt to public services/fines and the landlord (remember this), but since there is a small amount of profit, the business managed to stay afloat by dramatically lowering prices and my father keeping a good relationship with the landlord, almost a friendly one. Today, only my father and one of the partners are still there -my father owns 52% of the business- and here's where the story begins: that partner is an extremely deranged and dangerous person. He's been getting drunk and verbally attacking my father and staff for the last 5-6 years. In fact, I used to work there for a few years, and he physically threatened me during a disagreement after I took a stand for my father, which lead to my resignation. You might ask, why we've kept the partnership, but we're really tight financially (no savings and living in a rented house) by just trying to stay afloat, plus we're a family of 4 with my brother still at school. Now I know this is biased, but my father is a very calm, non confrontational person who always made compromises with his partner and put his ego aside every day for those 6 years. 

Push came to shove and now things are even uglier. It all started when the partner stopped leaving money to pay the rent (they are responsible for income on alternating weeks, and every Sunday, they leave some money in the register to pay bills) and the landlord had to inquire. Based on their good relationship, the landlord stated he'd be patient, assuring my father that he wanted to keep renting to him because he trusted him. He told him he would begin a motion for eviction but not go through with it, so as to push the other partner to pay rent. That further derailed him and he started calling my father a thief and insulting him to his friends, even to the point where he almost attacked my father. Even though it's *him* who has used money to fund his other business, unfortunately, because of the wobbly legal standing of the business due to debts, we can't prove it and we're too weak financially to sue. The back-and-forth between lawyers began, and we found out the guy *sold his house* to try and make a deal to throw us out. We still had the trust and preference of the landlord -who saw his deranged behavior and was afraid- and my father began talks with other interest partners to make a counter-deal. Unfortunately, a past debt somehow arrived in the hands of the landlord, and he was mad at my father, telling him that he didn't trust him any more and eviction would begin in 5 days.

I'm sorry for the long intro, but I still left a lot of details out to prevent this from becoming an essay. We're all devastated. It's the first time I've seen my father tear up, and I can understand. He's given all his life and endured so much just to lose his business at the last minute because of *one* past mistake, to a dishonest and abusive man. I'm not going to say that my father's choices were always 100% legal, but he always tried his best to repay his debts while keeping the business afloat. If we get evicted, we're left with about 4000$ and bad credit. My father is too old to work in labor, my mother's current job doesn't bring much, and I'll have to ditch my studies once and for all.

Company A offered me a job and I accepted the job since it was my top choice. Unfortunately there was a discrepancy in my background check and I was sent an adverse letter which tells me there was a discrepancy and I have 5 days to explain my discrepancy. I did that but since I was unsure if I was going to get the offer, I accepted another offer from Company B.

205,"Hi there,

I'm in a unique situation.

I'll give you my background for some context. I'm 18 years old and have always had an interest in computers. When I was 13 I picked up coding and loved it and did it a lot. This 'ember' for coding went all the way until a few months ago only a few months after I had started my apprenticeship with a somewhat large financial firm as an apprentice software developer. This apprenticeship lasts for two years and aims to train and qualify me to be a software developer (and pay me while doing it, yay :D ). My problem is I've lost this spark and don't find myself programming in my spare time anymore and I've noticed compared to other apprentices and other people my age, I'm just not as good at programming as they are, and I have little motivation to improve. Over the past couple of years I found myself more interested in politics and reading and commenting on that. Even joining a (unnamed for opinions sake) party. I also have GCSEs in English(Lit and lang), Maths, Science, Statistics, Computer Science. Level 3 BTEC Distintion in IT (all Cs D: ) I also have D*D*D* in IT level 4 (best grade possible) and a C in a-level core maths. I've been recently thinking about going to uni after I finish my two years as an apprentice. The money won't be a problem, will it be possible to get into uni with these qualifications and do you think this is a good move for me?

213,"**TL;DR: Have basically no obligations until I start uni in October. Wondering whether to take a job that seems promising but would require me to do 100 hours a month, look for a different job or just not work altogether.**

I had my last day of school ever about two weeks ago. (Yay!) I'll have some very important final exams during the next few months, but other than that, I don't have any obligations until uni starts in October.

I've never had a real job. Before you judge me for it, the labour laws where I live are pretty strict which means that most places don't hire minors and those who do pay horribly because minimum wage doesn't apply to minors. So no one I know has worked before they turned 18. I turned 18 in August last year, so I've been planning to work during the summer.

Yesterday I had a job interview which was semi-successful. They wanted me to do some trial work to see how talented I am with what I'll do, but I think that's their standard procedure so it's not necessarily a bad sign. I'm quite interested in this job, my potential employers seemed super nice, I like the location and the work itself doesn't seem that boring or repetitive. The main problem is that they'd want me to work about 100 hours a month up until October since my training would otherwise take up too much time for me to be profitable for them.

The majority of my friends just want to enjoy their summer instead of working since, to be honest, unless we get stupidly rich at some point we won't have this much free time until our retirement. I'm at a loss what to do because I think the experience would really help me with getting a job in the future and I could really use the money when I'll start university, but at the same time spending my entire summer working and heading off to uni right after seems kind of horrible.

Assuming they'll offer me a job after I complete the trial work, should I take it? Should I look for a job that lets me work fewer hours but might be less enjoyable? Or should I do neither of those and just enjoy my summer?",05Apr2018,2

217,"So this is a really long story and I‚Äôm using a throwaway account but I hope you guys can hear me out because I‚Äôm super on edge and don‚Äôt know what to do. 

A little backstory: my bf and I have been dating for a bit over 4 months now. I‚Äôve basically moved in with him (about a month ago) just for convenience sake and also because it seemed like a natural course of action. He gave me his spare apartment key so I could come and go without him needing to be there. 

Tuesday night (4/3) my boyfriend‚Äôs roommate asked me and my bf to come meet him in the living room for a talk as he had a ‚Äúbig problem.‚Äù He proceeded to tell us that he‚Äôs missing a bit over a grand ($1,000 for anyone who doesn‚Äôt know) in cash. My bf and I immediately try to assure him it wasn‚Äôt us and ask if there‚Äôs anything we can do. He says he‚Äôs going to comb through his room again so we go our separate ways. 

About an hour later he calls us into his room and shows us his money count. The last time he counted it was 4/1 (Sunday/Easter) and showed us how much he was out. He then told us that he keeps the money in his safe (more like a lockbox) and that he keeps the keys to it right next to the safe. I‚Äôm sitting there thinking what an absolute idiot, but he‚Äôs not the brightest person to begin with. So my boyfriend and I start to come up with possible solutions and tell him he should talk to the apartment management, make a list of all the people he‚Äôs had over in the time frame, and to file a police report/call the cops. He says he doesn‚Äôt really want to get the cops involved and he doesn‚Äôt know what to do so eventually we repeat our suggestions, wish him luck, and go to bed. 

Last night, (4/4) he comes home just after my bf and I had gotten into bed to go to sleep, knocks on the door, and asks us to come out to talk. He then proceeds to explain that he can‚Äôt think of any other solution than that it was either me, my boyfriend, or their other roommate who is MIA half the time. He then assures my boyfriend that he doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs him but is really suspicious of me and thinks I did it. 

Now, I can definitely understand why he would come to that conclusion and why he has his suspicions. I came into his life only a few months ago and got a key to the apartment. I‚Äôm alone in the apartment quite a bit and he doesn‚Äôt know me from Adam. That‚Äôs all fine and good but then things escalate. 

I tell him that I‚Äôm innocent, that he can look through my bank account, my belongings, my dorm, car, etc. He takes me up on the bank account part and I show him my checking and savings account history. He is not satisfied by this but doesn‚Äôt want to search my things and then tells my bf that he isn‚Äôt comfortable with me living there or having a key. It eventually comes to the point where I give him my key because he and my bf have come to an impasse. 

He then calls the cops. An officer comes out and politely takes all of our statements. She says an investigator will follow up either by phone or in person. After getting my statement, she leaves. I go to bed shaking and completely spooked. 

So basically, I‚Äôm asking for advice because I‚Äôm on edge. I‚Äôm probably a prime suspect but I know that I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. Is there anything else I can do? How can I clear my name? Can I be arrested for this even if I didn‚Äôt do it?

222,"Just a little backstory: So, I‚Äôve been with a certain retail chain since I was 18 and it‚Äôll officially be 5 years with them in October. I‚Äôve worked a lot of positions and I have moved up a lot, and I am currently a department supervisor making decent money for someone my age. I am in college and will be receiving my bachelors this winter. Previously, I expected to stay in the retail business as I have spoken with our district manager and was told I would be promoted to a assistant manager/store manager position at that point. However, I have recently been less and less enthused with my job and the prospect of doing this for any more time than I‚Äôd have to. 

I happened to come across a job listing for a legal assistant/receptionist position at a local law firm and I applied mostly just to see if there would be any interest. Well, there was and they called me in for an interview and really liked me. So much in fact they offered me the job on the spot. The hours are 10x better than what I work now. No weekends, no holiday work, paid days when the courthouses are closed and a Christmas bonus. This also works for me because I plan now to move into more of an office job once out of college so I would like the experience. 

I accepted the job even though I‚Äôll be making approximately $2 less an hour because I think I‚Äôll be happier and I can afford to do that right now. Something I am majorly nervous about is quitting. A good part of the reason I am leaving is because of my boss. There are times where she is funny and pleasant, but there are times where she has made me cry and just felt like an idiot really unnecessarily. Her actions would really stress me out because I never knew what I was going to have to deal with that day at work. So much so that during the holidays my hair started falling out and I was getting these stomachaches that were incapacitating. I went to the doctor and there was nothing wrong, I truly believe it was stress. 

Essentially, I‚Äôm just not sure if I made the right decision. The new job is less money, but I think it might be worth it. Should I go forward with the new job? Is it too late to change my mind? I‚Äôve never really had to leave a job before so I‚Äôm just very unsure about the whole thing.

224,"I am SO sorry in advance for the length of this post. It's obviously a long story that has haunted me for a while.

TLDR: manager got me pregnant and erased all responsibility after I confronted him. Is it my moral obligation to tell his live-in partner about what happened? I don't think so, but I'm looking for people in similar situations (regardless of position) who chose to tell or not tell and whether or not they regret that.

I used to work as a hostess at a restaurant. I was the youngest staff member there and suffered through an exceptionally bad manager the first year of my employment. When he was eventually fired, we were all really thrilled, but also very apprehensive about who the next manager was going to be. When we finally met the new guy, we were incredibly relieved.  Dave was young, in his early 30s; funny, charming, super sarcastic, hard-working, laid-back. The staff was already like a family and he fit in great.

Over the course of the next few months we all got closer and we‚Äôd regularly spend a few hours at the bar after close, drinking and bonding. In all honesty Dave was a fantastic manager: rather than micromanaging, he‚Äôd work alongside us and give good advice and direction. He was also there for any personal issues staff would have (drama levels get high in the service industry).

At the time I was in a pretty emotionally abusive relationship and it was taking its toll on me. My boyfriend was an alcoholic and I won‚Äôt go into detail but it was a pretty toxic relationship. He really was a lovely person underneath all the trauma he was bad at articulating, but it wasn‚Äôt a good relationship. I didn‚Äôt have anyone to talk about it with. I ended up spilling to Dave about everything during a smoke break and he confessed he was feeling the same way about his partner of 7 years. They‚Äôd been living together but had separated. According to him, she was career-driven, traditional, bland, unappreciative of his efforts. It felt nice to have someone understand what it was like to be in a thankless relationship. 

What I didn‚Äôt know was that his girlfriend‚Äôs mother had been dying from cancer, which is why she‚Äôd been unavailable to him. 

He also started randomly texting me. Just friendly stuff, not flirting ‚Äì sarcastic exchanges and banter that started off work-related. And whenever I came into work he‚Äôd always try and set aside meals for me. If he heard me telling a coworker I was pretty tired he‚Äôd make me sit down; he‚Äôd pay for any food I bought; he‚Äôd bring me candy from the corner store. He was SUPER friendly and I did not think anything of it but looking back I think I was starting to depend on that kind of validation, at least on a subconscious level.

At one point we were all inside drinking after hours till dawn, and as I was coming back from the bathroom Dave kissed me. He was insanely drunk. In shock, I immediately left and went home. He texted me the next day asking to meet so we could talk about it, and apologized profusely. I just wanted to forget about it so I told him it was fine and just not to let it happen again.

Over the next few weeks my relationship kind of imploded ‚Äì boyfriend‚Äôs drinking got a lot worse to the point where damage was irreparable and I ended things. I was inconsolable and absolutely devastated. My coworkers made a point to take me out and to have me forget about the ex, and Dave was always there, always sitting next to me, always offering me comfort and advice and laughter.

I can‚Äôt explain to you how this happened, because I still regret it. I also cannot stress to you just how deep of a depression I was in. I was alienated from most of my friends due to a really busy schedule (an 8-4 on the weekdays, and then restaurant work after as well as on the weekends), I wasn‚Äôt speaking to my family, and I was feeling incredibly low about my self-esteem.

He offered to help me with my taxes, my finances, advice. He was 10 years older and I think he enjoyed that he had the life experience on me.

We ended up sleeping together on several occasions, after some of the coworker bonding nights I mentioned. I don‚Äôt know why I assumed he‚Äôd ended things with his girlfriend. He never spoke about her to anyone anymore. And to my kind of broken mind, his presence was like a drug: we were super sexually compatible, and he always wanted me. I kind of felt like I was being manipulated ‚Äì but honestly didn‚Äôt care. It felt like a lifeline and I grabbed it.

That month, I was super emotional, which was weird from the somewhat disconnected, apathetic state I‚Äôd been in for the few months before that, and my period came late. It happens. I took a pregnancy test. 

I was pregnant.

I broke down and sought out counselling, which was basically just hour after hour of me sobbing on a wonderful therapist‚Äôs couch as she comforted me and talked to me about my choices. I‚Äôve always wanted to be a mother but obviously was in no place to bring up a child, so I decided for an abortion. 

I‚Äôd planned on taking a solo trip to Spain for two weeks to clear my head, and unfortunately the surgery was happening in the middle of that trip. So I waved $700 goodbye. I was incredibly broke, mind you, so the financial stress of that was just on top of everything else. He insisted on paying half. He never did.

I didn‚Äôt know whether or not I should tell Dave, and in the end I did, a few days before the surgery was scheduled.

He was supportive, at first ‚Äì he hugged me, said I was going to be OK. He offered to be there for the surgery after saying that he definitely didn‚Äôt want a baby. And then he said something about his girlfriend and her mother passing away recently ‚Äì that life was hectic for him as well and this was a lot or something ‚Äì and that‚Äôs when I realized I‚Äôd been played. Not entirely unknowingly. I didn‚Äôt feel brave enough to confront him. He knew what he‚Äôd been doing, and I think the worst part of it was that so did I.

He said he‚Äôd be there, but I knew he wouldn‚Äôt be, and in the end I went through it alone. It was a traumatic procedure and I was a mess for weeks afterward. I held onto a lot of resentment from him ‚Äì he ended up texting me later that day at 2 saying that he had a work meeting at 5 and wouldn‚Äôt be able to offer any kind of support. The surgery had been at 8 AM and I‚Äôd been lying in my bed, dizzy with morphine and pain, completely alone.

Dave asked if he could come by after work. He didn‚Äôt, saying it got busy at work. Unassuming coworkers sent me ‚Äòfunny‚Äô videos of him getting drunk at the bar. I spent the rest of the day sleeping, and the day after that as well. Every day he promised to see me and every day he cancelled. 

It was definitely unhealthy of me to have relied on him to some subconscious degree in the past, as sparing as it was, but the sudden deprival and the icing out was awful. I‚Äôd become completely infatuated with this guy based on my obvious need for attention and his predatory manipulation of someone waaay lower down on the corporate rung (and 10 years younger to boot). Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I never, ever, ever thought we‚Äôd end up together, but I certainly didn‚Äôt imagine things ending as they had.

I ended up seeing him four or five days after at a send-off party for some coworkers who were going on a trip to India for a month. He tried cornering me at the party, turning on the old charm with the same excuses, and after making it clear I didn‚Äôt want anything to do with him, I went home after an hour. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only here because I knew you‚Äôd be here,‚Äù he told me, but at that point I knew it was just a lie.

The next day I think, I blew up at him over text, accusing him of not taking any responsibility and for lying to me. He denied some things and justified others with more lies and excuses. Eventually I conceded to three awkward coffee chats. I think I was expecting some kind of remorse or apology, but there wasn‚Äôt anything. We just made small talk.  It was so painful I couldn‚Äôt do it more than twice. I shouldn‚Äôt even have given him the one chance. 

Work was hell over the next few months, because while everyone else remained charmed by this guy, I felt like I was seeing through a fa√ßade. I felt utterly used. And I couldn‚Äôt talk to anyone about it.

Finally I quit. I ended up reconnecting with my best friend and my family, and while I was filling her in on all of this during a super emotional conversation, she brought up this question:

‚ÄúAre you ever going to tell his girlfriend?‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt think so. I don‚Äôt want to revisit all these feelings and I certainly wouldn‚Äôt derive any kind of pleasure from telling his partner, who he‚Äôs living with again. But do I have a moral obligation to? I still see him every now and again, since I've quit, and he‚Äôs started exhibiting the same kind of flirtatious, overly friendly behaviour with one of the girls who replaced me. 

I should just keep trying to let it go, right? Not my monkeys, not my circus. Curious if any of you have any life experience that supports/negates this POV.",05Apr2018,6

Not sure how to title this but I‚Äôm considering to apply to transfer to schools a bit far from my current area also some are out of state.

Anyhow, chances are slim I may get into these schools but it could happen. Personally, I kind of want to venture out from my home. Not going to go into it deeply but my parents are Asian (not East Asian but). Why I mention this is because they want me to adhere to my cultural expectations which...I don‚Äôt know how long I can keep up. I feel overall guilty about the entire situation but like I said another long story there.

There‚Äôs a good chance I‚Äôm going to face a big backlash and if I somehow do get into a good university. No matter how good the school may be, they won‚Äôt let me go. Even if the school is a couple hours up north in state.

I was hoping to find anyone who may face this same predicament or that could offer me advice on how to establish myself if I am let go of financially and emotionally. A friend of mine mentioned how I could take out a loan, apply for scholarships and basically just save up before I apply for transfer.

Right now, all my fees are being waved so currently I‚Äôm attending my community college for free (woo hoo!!). Also, there‚Äôs is a lump sum that I am owed for my previous tuition fees (it‚Äôs shown as credit on my account) if I am able to request a refund I could put that into a new savings account I open for myself as well.

**Family/Social Life:** Both are completely non-existent, tbh.   
Attractiveness: I honestly have no clue, but I'd imagine that I'm more attractive than repulsive. I sometimes post my picture on rateme threads on 4chan and I average out to be a 7/10 (which I know is on the higher end but I still don't feel right about it for whatever reason). I'm pretty short which definitely puts at dent in this. My hygiene is fine.  
Personality: I'm often described as nice or smart, but compliments never feel genuine to me. I personally would describe myself as even-tempered, reserved, or bland. I rarely feel comfortable in conversation. I typically spend around 3 out 7 days a week just feeling completely depressed. I'm not diagnosed but I'm fairly certain I have inattentive ADHD (with some pretty bad rejection-sensitive dysphoria).   
**Professional Life:**  
School: I'm very interested in learning, but I've always performed poorly in school. I did well on tests, but never did homework. I've completely failed the majority of high-school because of truancy. I am currently not enrolled in school. I will get my GED as soon as I am legally able.  
Work: I currently work with animals. I believe the most realistic career choice for me is to become a paramedic, but honestly I feel I could do whatever (which is because of both my easygoing nature and general apathy). My dream-job would be an astronaut.  
**Personal Life:**  
Diet/Fitness: I'm 5'4""/164cm, 135lbs/60kg, and have a lower BFP. I'm in pretty good shape. If anything, I am a little skinny-fat but I know how to change that. My exercise routine consists of pretty basic exercises which you could do at home (e.g. push-ups, crunches). I'm vegan for ethical and environmental reasons. I eat pretty healthily but I do have a bad habit of spending any extra cash I have on junk food.   
Hobbies/Interests: I am very interested in science which always feels pretentious to admit. My favorite genre would be science-fiction, but I could go for anything if it's written-well. I am currently reading Sandman by Neil Gaiman and playing Star Wars: KotOR 2. ",05Apr2018,2

237,"Backstory:  I was passed up for a promotion at work.  They hired the son of the previous boss- despite the fact I have 15 more years experience and he's pretty much the worst human. (It's a specialized field in which I have a Master's.  Please don't tell me to leave my job- it's not an option I'd have to move out of state to find another.)  Anyway because the new boss doesn't know anything everyone on staff keeps coming to me with questions or asking for guidance since I should have been the obvious pick.  I would make more work for myself if I didn't help them- but I am not in charge here and I'm not paid to run this place. It's disheartening and tough and I'm starting to dread coming here.

Now my real question:  I am exhausted.  I can feel myself burning out so bad.  I need time off and I have plenty of vacation time but not sure what to do. My options are:

1.  I can either take off and stay home to focus on trying to piece my brain back together after almost a year of abuse at this company.  This would save money and I can work on projects around the house I've been putting off. Or sleep. Or contemplate what life would be like if I just ran away from my job forever...
2.  I can go away on a real vacation- which I've never done in my life.  I am overwhelmed just thinking about the idea of how to plan this- what is relaxing even like? Where do people go to relax? Would this just end up being wasted on me because I might sleep for 14 hours every damn day?

So i'm a uni student studying IT and have now been since 2016. I have not completed the first half of the year successfully.....ever. Every time for different reasons but thats still 5 failed attempts in the meantime.

**Round 1:** I didn't get good enough grades in HighSchool meaning i couldn't go straight into uni. I had to do a extra course at uni to 'get me there'. 6 months wasted IMO

**Round 2:** Too lazy in the subjects i was good in and just didn't manage to keep up with all the other subjects. Failed again.  

**Round 3:** Moved back to Austria. Was not accepted into the uni i wanted to go to but did get accepted into another uni but only for the next semester. 6 months wasted...  
  
**Round 4:** I came, I tried, i failed.... After last time where i knew i was too lazy, i thought id really try this time. Complete failure. Not a single subject passed. Language wasn't the problem since German is technically my mother language.   
  
**Round 5:** Currently in progress and not going well. 3 weeks in and one class already failed (I know. I'm a natural at this...). Maths is already way beyond me. Programming i know how to do. That part is easy and i always enjoyed that part in the past but i need ALL subjects passed to move on...  

So now i'm considering if there is even a point. on one hand if i dont go to uni, i'll be pretty limited. On the other hand, im not achieving anything there anyway....

239,"Hey guys, just kind of venting here so feel free to ignore or whatever, but advice would be appreciated

I have so many daunting options to choose from for my ""life's path"" this year, I just don't know what to do. I have bad anxiety, and it has held me back for about 7 years now, and I've done almost nothing with my life in that time.

I'm supposed to be moving into a place with my girlfriend halfway through or towards the end of the year, which is awesome, but that massively depends on whether I accept an offer to go to college. I applied to four colleges and only got into one mediocre one, which I was kind of devastated about, and it's for a subject I'm not sure I want to do in the first place. It's just that I'm 24, and I feel like I'm at the point where I kind of have to make a do or die decision, so I panicked and picked something that seemed safe that I could do, but now it doesn't even seem safe at all.

I kind of want to maybe go to a community college for something to do with computers, since that seems more future proof, but there's like 20 different computer related degrees, and I don't know which one is the right one, or if I'm smart enough to do computers. 

Additionally, I've had zero job experience, never worked a day in my life, and I feel like if I go to college and graduate age 28 or 29 with no job experience, I'm absolutely done for. No one is going to want to hire me. I already look incredibly unattractive to employers, as some people my age have been working for 6 or more years by now, and I've done nothing due to crippling anxiety. I also don't think I could physically manage attending both school and doing a part time job, I think I would just break down very quickly. 

The only good thing here is that I might be getting a place with my girlfriend, but that totally depends on accepting this college offer, or getting a job. I have no money, and my mother has agreed to pay the rent for our place, but I need to go to college, or else it's not happening. But I still don't really want to do this subject, and I feel like I'm settling for significantly less by going to this not-so-great college. 

And to add to the problems, I was supposed to be getting help through a local mental health clinic employment program to help me find a job - they would have basically held my hand through the process until I was working, including making sure I don't have to do an interview, or don't have to do it alone, because I have never done an interview, and I CANNOT do one whatsoever. 

The problem with that is that it's local, and I'll be moving to a city about two and a half hours away, and because we're supposed to be getting the apartment within the next 4 or 5 months, there's no point in me continuing with the employment program if I'm only going to be able to work locally for 2 or 3 months - if any employer would even want to hire me for that long.

So the only alternative I'm left with is finding a job in the city. But I won't have that support net, and will need to do an interview. Plus, I won't have the employment support worker to make sure I get a non public facing job - i.e I'll have to actually interact with the public, and I just cannot do it. I've heard the stories from people I know, and I'm aware people are absolutely awful. If anyone shouts at me, or insults me, or gives me any grief at all, I will break down and cry on the spot. Some friend told me to hold it in and cry later, but I'm physically incapable of doing that. Once on a plane, a man sitting behind me took an aggressive tone towards me for 2 minutes, and I cried for about 2 hours afterwards. He kept trying to apologise, but I was gone, and absolutely hysterical. 

I feel so pathetic. Anxiety has turned me into a quarter of a human being. I can't sleep properly, I can hardly bring myself to think about anything serious for 2 seconds without shutting down, or breaking down. I just don't know what to do.

243,"So I'm at the airport and I'm loading my stuff onto the table before it goes through the scanner. I don't realize the girl behind me puts a bin on the edge of the table. I put my suitcase on the table, it bounces her bin off, which has her laptop in it.

I apologize and say over and over that I'm so sorry. Her friend follows me through the line snarking about how it was a new laptop, etc. I say, ""I'm so sorry, but I don't know what you want me to do.""

The girls then find me at my terminal, and the laptop girl confronts me. Not screaming or anything, just telling me that I wasn't very nice, and I should have asked how the laptop was‚Äìbasically telling me that I hadn't been apologetic enough in the security line even though she said she appreciated my apology. 

I was not my best self and responded saying again that I was so sorry, but I didn't know what she wanted me to do about it. I told her we were both at fault, she should have waited for me to load all my stuff, and I should have been more careful. She left me with a ""I hope you can live with this."" or something along those lines.

Here are my thoughts: I am VERY sorry that happened to her laptop, but we were BOTH at fault. She should have waited for me to get done loading up, she shouldn't have put her laptop on the edge, I should have been more cautious when putting my suitcase up. In this situation I don't feel like I was financially responsible because it was all a messy accident that wasn't completely my fault. And how does someone else get to decide how sorry you are? I really keep trying to think if the roles were reversed, I would have blamed myself for not waiting and putting my laptop in a compromised spot while being partially frustrated with the person responsible.

What's the correct protocol in this situation? I'm not sure what else I would have done differently other than be more dramatically sorry initially to avoid further confrontation.

My grandfather passed away last night, and I found out about it this morning. He had been battling cancer for over a year. To keep a long story short, my immediate family including myself did not have a close relationship with my grandfather for nearly 2 years due to decisions he had made. Essentially, he remarried about 4 years ago and over time, he stopped communicating with his children and grandchildren. My family truly believes his new wife drove a wedge between him and us, and he chose her. 

The last time I spoke to him was when I visited him in the hospital over a year ago and he made it clear he didn‚Äôt want my mother around him which hurt me deeply at the time. I made the decision shortly after that visit to stop communications with him. I had put up with his new wife for 3 years, and I had reached my limit with him and her so I made what I felt was the best decision for myself. 

When I found out he had passed, I felt nothing. No emotion, no crying, and no words to really say. I was very close to my grandfather for 23 years of my life but like I stated above, I cut him out of my life due to being hurt by him and how he treated my immediate family.

254,"I have a 5 year military contract with the marine corps, I've completed 4 years, and get out in October. For a few months after I realized I only had a year left, I was excited and generally happy to have fulfilled my commitment, and becoming a civilian again. But for some reason even though I have 7 months left, over the past 2 months, I've grown this considerable dread over every minute I have to wake up and show up for work. 

I spent a year and a half in college before joining the military, I needed a change in my life, and chose the extreme. I'd always planned on doing an enlistment with the military, because most of my role models, fiction or otherwise had been in the military, and I wanted that legend and prestige behind whoever I become when I got older. So it was a sensible choice, and it can open a lot of doors for me later in life.

I could never say I regret wearing the uniform, or that I have nothing less than the utmost respect for anyone who serves their country. But the military has never been for me, and I've spent the last 4 years, just powering through all the bullshit that comes with being junior enlisted, promotion to higher ranks means nothing as you still get treated like a child and berated for the stupidest shit. If anyone fucks up, everybody is considered fucked up. Everyone seems like just the dumbest human beings on the planet, with basically the intellectual capabilities of lab rats. Macho bullshit, no amount of compassion or understanding, everyone seems to have that old ""let's bomb the fuck out of them"" mentality.

As of now, I have so many other things I want to fucking do, and this place is holding me back, I sat in my car this morning in the parking lot at work smoking a cigarette just wondering if I shouldn't just burn all my shit, and fucking take off. I've been doing the same shit for 4 years, seeing the same people every fucking day, driving the same route to work, doing the same work like a fucking robot, unable to have a decent conversation with anyone about anything other than the military, drinking or getting laid I feel like a prisoner wanting to escape prison with only one day remaining on his sentence, but I just need something to fucking change.

I used to take leave to get a break, but there's no fucking change. I have 40 days of leave stacked up, so I could take time off, but I'm saving my leave to go terminal, and have a good two months on the outside with a paycheck as I do job interviews and prepare for college.

It seems like I have no time to do anything I want to do, and the minutia, and tedious nature of my daily life just makes me want to blow my fucking brains out. I got a short story published once, and it was the best feeling of my life, and as much as I'd love to write there's not a moment in the day when I can have a solid train of thought. I went on this website called freecodecamp and started learning programing wanting to start a website, I started the website, and have no time to maintain it or turning it into what I want, or have enough time to better my programming knowledge. I have 90 credits, and all I need is one more year of school, but I don't even have time to finish that.

I feel so grateful for having a family, friends that I love and love me, the occasional lay, and have a solid foundation to bounce off from in the future. I can see the light at the tunnel, being so close to the end, but I feel completely and utterly miserable every single day. There's this pit of sadness and dread that hits me every morning and continues every minute of the day until I go to sleep. I feel like I'm wasting so much time working as much as I do, and being where I am. I'm starting to hate everyone around me, even though it's not their fault and most of them are decent people. I feel like I'm trapped by this thing, and there's nothing I can do but live with that empty, and lonely fucking feeling. I have no desire or drive to do anything anymore, I can barely sleep, and the only peace I get is when I smoke a cigarette at 3 in the morning when everyone else is asleep. I want to talk to someone, but I'm not even sure what to say.

Dennis from it's always sunny called it his god hole, I don't believe in god either, but I feel so fucking numb, and sad all the damn time. No one knows it, cause I flash a smile, laugh at their jokes, and always seem so charismatic and charming, but I don't think I remember what even being happy feels like.

Sorry for the long post, I feel scatter brained, and don't even know if this makes any sense. Hope you're all having a good week.",05Apr2018,3

257,"Hey guys. 

Long story short I (27M) recently got out of an LDR (it was kind of unexpected, she dumped me.) but anyway. I‚Äôve been doing pretty good on getting over that and staying positive. She ended it two weeks ago.

My plan with my ex was for me to try to get as close to her as possible but my job only allowed me to currently get to a location that is still 3 hours from her. She ultimately didn‚Äôt think it could be done, so we parted ways.

The moving bit wasn‚Äôt always about my relationship as this transfer offers better hours and pay and would get me out of my small town so here‚Äôs the thing - I‚Äôve decided to still do it.

I‚Äôve been so excited for weeks now knowing I‚Äôve been strong enough to still make this decision regardless of what‚Äôs been going on with my ex and I know it will potentially offer me all kinds of new opportunities but - today I finalized the transfer, I leave at the end of May and for some reason ever since the acceptance of the offer I‚Äôve felt absolutely anxiety stricken and sick to my stomach. I guess maybe I didn‚Äôt expect it all to fall into place so fast?

I‚Äôve left my hometown and my family before and always wound up pretty lonely so I think I‚Äôm just scared of falling back into old habits. I need some reassurance from someone who understands anxiety or has moved away from family and friends before that everything will be okay.

This new job is about 5.5 hours away from home, and about 2 hours from some cousins if I really needed any help so it‚Äôs not an insane move but still a lot for me. Moving from a population of 20,000 to one of 250,000...and I‚Äôm a guy who‚Äôs grown up in tiny towns forever. I don‚Äôt know anyone in this new city.

My brain is freaking out telling me I‚Äôve made a mistake or rash decision while still grieving my ex even though rationally I know that‚Äôs not true. I know this job and move to a bigger area could be great for a person like me. If I don‚Äôt get out of this down i just rot here and never amount to much.

Any tips on how to cope with all of this and making the best of the move? I‚Äôm extremely introverted so I‚Äôve been trying to make a few friends online from the area to potentially meet up with once I get down there. Work will take up a lot of my time so at least I know I‚Äôll be surrounded by people most of the day. I just don‚Äôt want to sink back into old habits and be a reclusive in my apartment once I settle in there because it‚Äôll only make things worse. Easier said than done though. ",05Apr2018,2
258,"So, there is a particular RN program that I have applied for, and have been in regular contact with an admissions specialist. (All applicants do this, they walk you through every step.)

The last time I talked to mine was in January. After that conversation, I emailed him in February and March, in addition to calls, in which I left messages to follow up. Zero response.

I honestly forgot for a brief moment until my friend told me that she had gotten accepted into the program. I told her my situation of having not heard from my POC, and somehow never being able to reach anyone at the main number. She asked her POC about me, who then talked to mine. It was after that conversation that he called and emailed me. 

I found it during this call that he had never received my last transcript. I checked my email, and I definitely requested it be sent back in January from the school in question. I called said school, and they found the request, and confirmed that they never sent it. They are sending it now. 

I do realize that it was my responsibility to ensure that the school fulfilled my request. 

At the same time, I have been trying to make contact with my admissions rep ever since I requested the transcript. If he had returned any of my calls or emails over the past 3 months, then we would have caught this sooner and rectified it. 

I am obviously frustrated both with myself and him. I do not want to overreact. 

Is the lack of response on his part something worth trying to report to a higher up? I realize I also dropped the ball by not following up with the school we needed the transcript from, so I‚Äôm not sure I have any standing. 

Could I reasonably request to proceed with the application/admissions process, (interviews, etc) while they process that last transcript? Normally the transcript evaluation has to be done first. Everything else is in place. 

Is there anything else I should consider? 

Thank you in advance. ",05Apr2018,2
259,"Hello Reddit,

So I'm gonna try to cut a long story short. My dad grew up in Afghanistan and earned a degree as an Computer Engineer but moved to the US where his degree wasn't recognized. He went to school here again and got his degree in CE here again. (This was maybe 20 years ago.) We moved to Minnesota where my dad got a job working for Seagate and we were making decent money. Then in 2007 he got laid off and we moved to CA. When we moved here my dad was like I'm going to just get a job to earn some money while I look into finding another. So he got a job working at the gas station, and ever since then my dad has been unmotivated to find work for some reason. I honestly have no idea why considering he hates his current job. I'm not here to make excuses for him I honestly have no idea why he never changed jobs and it's not my business to ask him. I am currently going to school for BS in Accounting and my dad wants to work for me when I graduate but that's in a couple years if everything goes right.

We live in a ghetto so his job is dangerous. He has seen a lot of stuff and yesterday he witnessed something horrible (that he won't share) that has completely motivated him to get another job. I know it's almost impossible for him to get a job as an engineer since he has a 10 year gap in his resume and I'm not sure putting 10 years experience at a gas station is any better than leaving it blank. I am just looking for any entry level job that my dad can get so he can get away from his current job.",05Apr2018,2
260,"Hi fellow world citizens.

I've been working in an agency for about 2 years and in the recent months I got a promotion that has me sharing an office with my supervisor.
Since I am not English native speaker and I have only been her for 7 years so I am very  aware of my accent. I am not ashamed of it but if it wasn't around I wouldn't really cry about it.
Family and friends and a couple of SO I've had over the last few years ignore my accent or have told me they really like it. 
My boss on the other hand is a low key racist, saying things like ""he is from Iran, he was raised different, he was raised wrong "" and ""if people weren't born here they should get out"".
She has, for the most part, been nice to me, since she knows I'm a US citizen and because when she says jump I ask how high.
We talk a lot, I require a lot of assistance to do my job as I didn't have any proper training and she also loves to discuss her life experiences with me. 
I don't mind a little of chit chat at the office but recently she started saying things like ""you have a really bad accent"" ""I don't understand what you're saying because of your accent"" or ""it's because where you're from I don't understand what you're saying""
Unfortunately this doesn't feel like feedback or constructive criticism, she doesn't tell me what I said wrong or how to fix it, she just says I speak wrong and continues with whatever next topic she'd like to discuss.
And this is driving me crazy, I have started to speak less and less around her and even away from her I have shut down from most social activities like parties or get togethers because I feel I sound stupid or uneducated or just bad. I know it's probably not the case but as she repeatedly says it... Well it's kinda getting to me.

I don't want to quit since I know this job is a good opportunity for me and might turn into something bigger with time but I also don't want to confront her about it since I've seen her be very vindictive against people she disagree with going as far as fire them under the excuse of ""lacking work performance"" even though they were some of the best employees this agency has ever had. 

So I feel like I'm between a rock and a hard place. I'm at a loss.

Any suggestions? ",05Apr2018,9

262,"For as long as I can remember, I have always been fascinated with the thought of women dying, or being killed. In fact, I can distinctly recall having these thoughts dating back to elementary school. Of course, back then there was no sexual arousal present in myself (at least that I could identify). This aspect of myself has followed me to this day. Before I matured, I didn't think much of it. But when I hit puberty, I began to feel ashamed. In fact, one might say I was in a bit of denial. I fantasized about it, sure. But I never admitted to myself what I was. In fact, I find it hard to admit it to myself now. Beginning to write this was hard for me, and still is as I continue to do so. I'm not crazy. I'm not a psychopath. I have no other apparent psychological disorders or dysfunctions. I'm just a normal and decent guy with, for whatever reason, an adnormal sexual interest. I would never actually harm anyone, I would never act out these fantasies in real life, and I respect women. I was planning on taking this aspect of my sexuality with me to the grave, until I met my current girlfriend.

She and I have been together for four years now. It has been great, and I love her with all of my heart. About a year and a half ago, after finding some porn pertaining to my darker interests in my browser history (rookie mistake), I was forced to come clean. It took every ounce of courage I had to be completely honest with her, because I first had to be completely honest with myself for the first time ever. I had to apply labels to myself that made me feel subhuman. I told her exactly what my deepest and darkest sexual fantasies were. At that time, I felt exposed, I feared that she would break up with me, and I feared that other people would find out.

But to my surprise, she accepted it. She told me that she understood that it what I was ""in to"" was beyond my control, and it seemed as if it didn't bother her in the slightest. She even told me she would, and she does, endulge me in my fantasies in bed (plays dead). She even says that she enjoys it, and jokes that it makes her job easy. Might I add, she isn't crazy either, haha.

It has felt great to have a partner that is willing to do that for me. It feels as though a huge weight has been lifted from me, and I can finally fully sexually express myself. However, I still feel, on a moral level, ashamed. What would help me is some advice. Is it healthy for my girlfriend to endulge me in this way? What are your thoughts?",05Apr2018,0

I was really nervous because I know if I would let her down she'd tell my friends and colleagues ( we work at the same place). She was going really fast and it made me even more nervous.

Short story: I am 25 and I live in Northern Indiana. I teach high school science and I have been doing that for 3 years. I am married and have 2 dogs. We moved into a house that we both really enjoy and is nice, but I have recently been struggling with whether or not I will be happy here. I love nature and there are so many beautiful places in the U.S. We are unsure whether or not to make it work here or do a crazy move somewhere else we think would be really cool. It would require buying and selling across states, quitting and getting 2 jobs, and so on. 

Long story: Read the short story in addition to this. The house we have is small but it is a great spot. It is on the lake and we have some trees surrounding us and it is at the end of a cul de sac so we don't have neighbors everywhere. My parents are minutes away and we are wanting kids so we moved here thinking it would be great for that. The issue is Northern Indiana does not have much going for it. Not much in terms of interesting cultural activities, restaurants, bookstores, game stores, wineries, hiking trails, night life, and so on. I can't help but think maybe this is not the place for me. It has a low cost of living and there are some nice things around. However, it sure as hell isn't Boulder, Colorado or Portland, Oregon.

281,"Hello, before I get started I just wanted to say that I thank anyone who helps me and gives me any piece of advice, also, this is a very long post but the only way anyone can understand where I'm coming from is if I describe all of the most important details that I can.

I'm 18 years old, I live with my mom and stepfather, my mom and dad divorced when I was 10 and I grew up with my mom, occasionally seeing my father. I grew up in the same neighborhood from the day I was born until I was 13 and just finished 8th grade. I was a pretty good kid, never had problems with anyone, I had good relationships with my mom and siblings. 

I moved from and urban areas to a more suburban area a few months before I started high school. My first year of high school was tough, everyone in this school was very cliquey, and I have a bit of social anxiety and I don't make friends too easily so the first few months were hard for me being in a new school, new people and new environment. I felt alone for most of the first year.

A few months after I started 9th grade I got curious to try marijuana and made friends with the wrong kind of people. I lied to my parents about my whereabouts and who I was with so I could go out and smoke with my new ""friends"", my parents thought I was just hanging out with friends and doing what normal 9th graders do, play video games and be outside. 

This is where the troubles for me started happening. About 3 months after I started to smoke and drink, my mom caught me in a lie and that was the day I'll never forget, she threw objects at me, she pushed me, she cursed at me, she threatened me and called me names. I was in a little corner of the room, scared shitless, not knowing what was gonna happen to me. After this happened it was hard to gain back trust for about a year, I smoked only occasionally after the incident and drank here and there, stealing bottles of liquor and beer from my own house. I also had such a big curiosity to try more than just weed and alcohol, but I stole oxycodone numerous times from family members, Adderall and other countleds prescrption and non prescription drugs. 

Again, I got caught doing these things, and I was only a sophomore in high school. I still haven't made any real friends, I had not too great of grades and felt I wasn't good enough or smart enough. I had no motivation. I lost a lot of trust in my mom, with smelling weed on me, finding my bowl, smoking in the bathroom late at night, she couldn't trust me for shit. And I didn't care. Eventually, I came across Dextromethorphan, which is over the counter cough syrup which can get you high in high quantities. It's a dissociation drug. I've been caught stealing medicine from a store, arrested for it, and put on probation, all in sophomore year. I have stolen tons upon tons of it and drank more syrup than you could imagine. Why? Because I liked the feeling of dissociation and I still don't know why.

I have ended up in pyschiatric hospitals 3 times and I've been admitted to a rehab facility. The first time my mom took me there was for smoking weed and having fights with her and drinking. Another time I took 600mg of Benadryl, completely lost my mind and it wasn't to kill myself, it was to get high. In Junior year I snuck out of my house at midnight and rode my bike 2 miles on a dark and rainy night to drink alcohol with my friend (who was actually the closest person to me at the time) and drank 7 shots, and passed out and blackedout on the side of the road, which again they accused me of trying to kill myself when I wasn't. I was admitted to a rehab after the alcohol incident. I wasn't addicted, and I was dependsnt on anything.

All of this happened in a mere 3 year from freshman year to junior year. Senior year of high school was my better year, but still with communicatin problems with my mom, poor grades and no motivation. However I found a friend group, found a greater interest in cars and met my girlfriend who I've been dating for 1¬Ω years now. 

But my problem is this - after I graduated high school I decided community college is the best thing for me. My family and extended family is very judgemental, they will talk behind your back, act fake, and will judge anything that you do that seems abnormal to them, they're very close minded people. My grades weren't good enough to get into most colleges either and I didn't feel like going to a trade school for auto mechanics as I didn't want to go far from home.

I completed my first semester of college (full time). I failed all but one class, that one class I got a D in. I tried the best I could but I still have no motivation. I feel like a failure. Now I'm in my second semester and i only went to my 5 classes for the first 2 weeks of school. After that I felt I couldn't take the difficulty of it, the stress and the pressure put on me. I have no major and have no idea what to do in the future. I stopped going to my classes. Now Im 2 months into the semester and it's almost over and I cut every single class. The one bad part is that nobody knows this except for me. I'm scared to tell anyone, I fear my very loving and understanding and supportive girlfriend will break up with me. My mom would put me down with harsh words instead of trying to help me, and I'd be kicked out. I'm lost.

I work a part time job and make around $300 a week. I have a leased car that I'm about to go over my mileage on by a LOT, and my girlfriend is here with A's and B's and getting into good colleges (she's one year younger than me). I feel like I set myself up for failure the day I moved and I'm stuck. I have nobody to talk to, no goal for myself and no motivation to try anymore.

 I also was using Cough Syrup (DXM) from most of 2016 to part of 2017, almost one year but have quit. I see my girlfriend almost every day and most of my time is spent with her, she also has problems of her own with herself and family. Any help as to what could give me the ability to not see this negatively will really help me to achieve my goal to succeed. I feel like I'm someone nobody could look up to, people always think  I don't care, I'm lazy. But i do care and I'm not lazy, I'm just sad, unmotivated and I feel trapped and lost every single day.",05Apr2018,2

284,"So, I'm a few months from turning 30, and it's really killing me inside to think about how little I've moved forward in my life, and how there's basically nothing on the horizon for me.

After high school, I got a bottom of the barrel retail job and started taking classes at the local community college. I didn't have a plan in mind, because I didn't know what I wanted to do, career-wise. Nothing ever felt like a sensible fit for me. I ended up spending about five years bouncing around through community college, from major to major, because nothing stuck. I was ready to drop out of school altogether, then I realized I had a strong passion for working with video content, so I enrolled in a trade school for that kind of thing and finished up there with a certificate.

But, turns out I wasn't capable of getting myself into that industry after graduation. You kind of have to ""know"" someone, it seems, and as far as I can tell, opportunities are limited as it is, based on where I live, so that dream is pretty much dead. And while I wouldn't necessarily be against returning to school, I still can't come up with a major to pursue that I feel would lead to a sensible career for myself.

Meanwhile, I continued working my bottom of the barrel retail job for a total of 7 years. I hated it, I was miserable, I was perpetually the very bottom of the totem pole, I felt like I was constantly underappreciated and overlooked despite trying to be the best employee I could. Then the place I worked at closed down, and I had to find a new job, which led me to my current job I've been at for a couple years, which... is basically another bottom of the barrel retail gig. And while the environment feels better, I'm once again running into the same problems, where I do my best, but no one cares, and everyone else gets exactly what they want and I just get dumped everything else on.

Never mind the fact that I hate retail/ customer service, in general. I hate it, and I have no interest whatsoever in moving up towards management or into the corporate stuff. None whatsoever. I'm so burnt out on this, and I'm also frustrated because I'm evidently not capable of anything more with my life. I mean, what can I really do, here? Quit my job, go find another bottom tier retail job that's equally not fulfilling, and then grow frustrated when I eventually go overlooked there as well? What's the point?

For the last couple of years, I've also turned my passion for video into a hobby, by making a dumb little YouTube channel. Since then, I've made hundreds of videos, and it's been a nice little outlet and a distraction, but... I'm really starting to feel stagnant there, as well. I don't feel I'm improving, I don't feel I'm making ""good"" content, I've not gotten any audience whatsoever in the two years I've been doing this. Don't get me wrong, I never foolishly thought I could become some kind of famous YTer that could make a living doing this, but I expected I would at least hone my skills and be able to make stuff that I felt proud of and happy about, and maybe get at least a teeny tiny little niche audience. But nope. Even when I love something and pour all of my free time into it, trying to learn and get better at it, I'm still a failure.

One of my coworkers, we just hired him about six months ago. He's a good kid, in his very early 20s. And the other day, he had just gotten into telling me some stuff about his background, and he talked about how he was miserable at his job for a long time, he found this opportunity to work at the place I do and applied, and got it, and then he moved from another state here for this job, his girlfriend came with him, he was able to afford an apartment, and he said it seemed like it all just felt right, and that everything came together for him. And I nodded and smiled while he told me his story, but inside, it was eating me up, because all I could think about is how nothing ever ""comes together"" for me. I either never see ""opportunities"" to begin with, or I find them but fail to springboard from them.

I've run into some people I went to grade school/ high school with, over the last couple of years, and I always feel so ashamed, because they have stuff going on in their lives, they have solid careers, they're married, they have something that keeps them moving forward, something that makes them feel proud and confident in who they are. What do I have? I'm almost 30, I have a job that a well-behaved high schooler could perform, I make crummy YT videos that no one watches, I can't even afford to move out of my parent's house... And all I can do is wonder what the heck is so wrong with me that I can't make anything happen in my life. Why am I so incompetent? Why am I so inept?

At this point in my life, I feel... well, I feel completely empty. I no longer have any dreams or ambitions. I can't even fathom any kind of light at the end of my tunnel, so to speak. It just feels like this is all there is for me. This is it. I just don't even know what to do anymore. What can I do?",05Apr2018,1

288,"yesterday i had a flight back home, and while waiting to board saw this very attractive woman..

i didn't think much of it, until about 30 minutes later when i'm in the airplane and waiting for everyone else to get in their seats.. this girl actually ended up having her seat right next to me!

We were both on a flight to the same location, but was only a connector flight to a different state however, so we live in different states.

Turned out were are both the same age (late 20's) as well! After about 30 minutes, i asked her about her trip.. and then just like 20 minutes into the conversation she asked me something like;

""So are you looking to stay where you're at?"", and i thought she was referring to where i worked, but was actually referring to where i live..

then a few minutes later she asked ""so do you have a girlfriend back home?"", and i said no, and asked her and she is single as well.

She begun asking about my interests, seemed interested and attracted in my unique (to her) hobbies of hiking alone, writing poetry, being self-taught on guitar etc.

As the flight was ending, she asked ""do you have facebook?"", and i just gave her my number instead.

Man i've never seen anything like this; from my perspective, asking those two questions about if i'm single and willing to move, sounds like she felt a strong attraction to me and was wondering if i'd ever move to live with her..

Those are very bold questions for someone to ask so soon after talking. 

We've been texting since then, but i'm curious why she would ask these kinds of bold questions?",05Apr2018,2
290,"Hi, thanks for reading! To preface, I absolutely love my job, and my boss is a wonderful guy who I would consider a friend. We co-run a very small high end boutique, where he is the owner and I am the manager. Up until now, we've been able to balance the hours of the shop with the technical side of the business pretty well, but business has been booming, and the next logical step is to hire another employee. 

The thing is- I'm not sure how to express my preferences to my boss without sounding ungrateful. See, he prefers to not work on the weekends, and so I usually end up working all day every day Thursday - Sunday. If there's something important I need time off for, he'll never turn me down to cover, but I feel guilty doing that. So I miss out on a LOT. I am involved in many communities in town, including music, science, art, dancing, etc. And with my current schedule, it's very difficult to attend as many events as I would like.

My boss is...different than that. He goes to the shop, and he goes home. He is not social, and sometimes does hike, but only goes by himself. Which is fine! But I've never quite understood why he wants weekends off when you can pretty much do nothing any day of the week. Meanwhile, all the events I would love to attend conflict with work, without fail. So when he brought up a new hire, I was ecstatic! I immediately responded that I thought it was a great idea, that someone to take some evenings and weekends would be perfect.

He replied that a new person couldn't be expected to work weekends, at least right away, since that's the busiest time. Which I get. They'd need thorough training, which I'm happy to provide. But I'm getting nervous that I will end up stuck with weekends going forward. The last time my boss was in, he grabbed the resume of a girl he was considering hiring last time....but didn't, because she couldn't work weekends. 

My boss and I get along well, and are very similar in a lot of ways, but communication is sometimes an issue. He can be a little neurotic and take things personally, while I get unsure of myself and stumble through ideas. I'm hoping for a professional, kind way of phrasing that my expectations for a new hire are that they will, eventually, take over weekends that neither of us who have been at the company for over a year want to work. My boss knows that I am busy on the weekends, but raises an eyebrow at the fact that it does occasionally involve drinking (he's in recovery) so I don't want to make it sound like I'm just some demanding party girl. I'd never go to work hungover or anything, so when I work the next morning I almost always just stay home. 

I know there are loads of students looking for an evening/weekend job, so I'm hoping to push him in that direction. He has said that my happiness in this situation is the most important thing to him so Reddit, what is a kind, professional, but firmly clear way to express my expectations on the new hire's schedule?

292,"I've been battling a deep depression for several years now. It has sapped my energy and zest for life. I found myself watching TV, playing video games, not working, and not doing much else. I'm tired of living this way and have been implementing small changes (like a morning routine and mindfulness) to try and break out of this toxic rut I've been in. Now that I'm pulling myself out of this deep pit, I'm looking at what positive changes I can make in my life to find more satisfaction. 

I know to some degree what things make me happy and what kind of life sounds ideal to me after a lot of time thinking about it, but for some reason, I have no idea how to take **practical steps** to make these things a reality. That's where this post comes in. I'm hoping others can help me to see what tangible steps I can take to get me to a life I'd desire.

Here are the things I want and enjoy:

- I am a singer and my dream life involves going to lots of concerts, festivals, and potentially performing at venues (though I'm incredibly shy and uncomfortable with the performance aspect). Heaven to me is being at a concert.

- I am a shy extrovert, so I would like to put myself in a position to be more social and to build more fulfilling relationships.

- I find zero interest in being indoors. All of my favorite activities involve being outdoors in a laid-back, casual setting like a bonfire, a concert, a bbq, etc. I don't really know how to create these environments for myself though, especially when I've been as lazy and socially anxious as I have been lately. I'm pretty isolated and don't have a lot of friends at the moment. Plus I'm scared to host events because I am so worried about people enjoying themselves or thinking I'm weird/boring/etc. 

- I want to start preparing meals. I enjoy cooking but I tend to see it as a chore, especially when I know I could be doing something more immediately stimulating like watching a show or playing a game.

- I want to learn to be grateful. I've found that a lot of my unhappiness boils down to a constant state of comparison that eats at my self-esteem. I am always looking for a way to be ""happier"" or ""better,"" which serves me well in some cases, but ultimately can be a big problem when it comes to enjoying where I am already.

- I want to learn to handle the physiological feelings I get when I have a negative thought or emotion. Usually, I can handle the thoughts themselves, but the sensations in my body overwhelm me and result in panic.

- I want to be kinder and warmer to my fiance; to treat him as my teammate instead of an enemy when I'm feeling bad, to respect him, and to enjoy my time with him.

- I'd like to start exercising to take better care of my body when it comes to health, but I absolutely hate doing it. Have always hated physical exercise for some reason, even in elementary school. Practically failed gym class, lol.

- I'd like to take care of myself when it comes to how I look. One big thing I've given up on is doing my hair and makeup, but not doing it has made me feel pretty bad about myself.

- And last but not least, I'd like to start seeing the world as a positive place again. I'd like to learn to trust myself, other people, and ultimately God again and to see things through a less cynical and pessimistic light.

So as you can see, I have some goals, but they're all pretty **large and vague**. I don't know how exactly to implement them. I also struggle with attention issues and executive functioning, which makes it difficult for me to stick to a schedule. 

**TL;DR** I am pulling myself out of depression. Above is a vague list of my goals, but I am having a hard time finding ways to actually implement them in my real life. Can you help me figure out how to make these goals a reality?",05Apr2018,2
293,"(This is a vent/advice thingy)

THE VENTING PART:
Hey Reddit, 
I have been thinking about my future for a while now and everytime I do the outcome is grim. Not because I think I'll be broke or anything, but rather that I can't escape the 9-5 life. I'm 19 years old and studying IT. My dream would be to not have to work (which I have been told is not possible). Now I will admit that I'm pretty lazy, but that is not what makes it impossible for me to work. It is rather that I can't deal with doing the same thing for extended periods of time. In my early school carreer I had been slacking and skipping. Which worked fine in the start, I was smart enough to breeze through my first few years of school. However my grades started to drop after a while. So I went at it, and found out that it fucking sucks. I have no idea how you people can keep this up.

Every single day I wake up and I instantly want to blow my brains out. I sit there for hours waiting for the moment I get my freedom back. Only to do it all over again the next day. Every single day is the same, I have completely lost any sense of myself. I don't enjoy doing anything even on my ""free"" days. Because now even my free days are all starting to look the same. I feel like my freedom is just an illusion. I have read a few stories of people just leaving everything behind and seeing how it goes. And I'm just sitting here wondering how these people didn't end up under a bridge in a tent.

THE ADVICE PART:
So tell me reddit. How do I leave everything behind? What should I do so I can just work somewhere for a few months and just go somwhere else when I get bored? I will add to this that I have no interest in getting married and having kids or any of that jazz. I don't feel strongly about anyone I know. I used to have friends, but they just come and go. My family is alright but I don't feel very strongly about any of them. My parents won't be too suprised if they don't hear from me for a while if I do leave (I do intend on telling them if I leave).
I should also add that I live in west europe and my english speaking skills are one of the few things I pride myself on. My favorite places to go to for a while would be Asia and the US.
Oh and one last thing... Should I finish my IT study? I know it would be a huge benefit, but I feel like jumping off a building everytime I see one.",05Apr2018,2

I recently moved towns for university. The university I'm at now is great, I find the courses interesting and the teachers inspiring. 

BUT THE TOWN, GUYS. 

It's really not that bad, and I don't mean to sound dramatic or spoiled at all, as I'm very grateful to be where I am and for all the opportunities I've been given, but I just have a hard time seeing myself spending the next 3 years of my life here. 

The city I moved here from was incredible, but I was after a change of scenery. Now that I have it, I'm realizing that the city is really where I want to be. Outside of school, I feel like there's nothing for me here, which makes the thought of house-hunting and committing to a lease for the upcoming year a little tough.

I've definitely considered the fact that maybe if I got more involved in things (my hobbies) outSIDE of school that my view of the place may change and I may come to feel a lot more comfortable here, but I also wonder if maybe I'm doing myself a disservice by not spending this period of my life in the place where i feel the most ""ME"". 

So I ask ya, am I being irrational entertaining the idea of transferring from a great university to another decent one just so I can live out my dream of being a young adult in the city?

300,"16 - male - high school sophomore

This is a problem I, and everyone I know, has noticed I‚Äôve had since my memory started. Never actually had an ADHD test, though. I‚Äôm going to try to list out various experiences I‚Äôve had, just to make sure I‚Äôm not just wrong like everyone tells me I am. Sorry for the wall of text.

One of the earliest examples were sports I tried when I was much younger, in elementary school. Taekwondo class, I was staring out the window the entire time and I learned absolutely nothing. When I played basketball or soccer, I remember scoring ‚Äúown goals‚Äù in both. Even running off the field in the middle of a game - I had a complete and utter lack of awareness. After my experiences with these sports, I didn't pick them up again. It‚Äôs not like I was physically unathletic, I just didn‚Äôt have the mental capacity to play these sports. These early experiences were obvious red flags for ADHD from a long time ago.

Nowadays the only sport I do is cross country/track, and even then I have difficulty getting in the right frame of mind (although it is much easier since what you have to think about - running forward - is less nuanced than playing a team sport like soccer or basketball)
As for grades it wasn't a problem until I started high school when I started to get many more B's than A's and I was chastised constantly. I go to a high-performing high school and until recently my parents expected me to go to a T20 college. I have trouble staying organized, and I forget small details when a teacher is explaining a lesson. This leads to worse grades (remember that one little thing that was mentioned briefly in class that you didn't hear? Yeah, there were 7 questions about topic on the test. Fuck you!) I‚Äôve asked around, none of my friends seemed to have this problem - it‚Äôs always a straightforward process of taking notes and studying, and their hard work is rewarded while mine isn‚Äôt. My parents get pissed whenever the quarterly report card comes out. It‚Äôs always a cycle every 3 months of getting upset, attempting to remedy the problem, and then failing.

I frequently miss appointments. My mom needs to pick me up from track practice during most weekdays, and I often used to forget to call to let her know that practice had ended. One time she even went as far to (much to my embarrassment) walk into the school, drag me outside, and yell at me repeatedly in the car for ruining her entire schedule due to having to pick up my siblings from X after school activity. I don‚Äôt blame her for doing that. I‚Äôm often the cause of her problems and I feel terrible, but there‚Äôs always that insurmountable ‚Äúmental hill‚Äù to climb that prevents me from fixing the problem.

My family laughs at me when I'm sitting with them at dinner and they're having a discussion and I ask a clarifying question, and then it turns out they already mentioned X detail previously and I wasn't listening because my ""head is in the clouds"". They refuse to repeat it for me. This happens a lot in general, needing to have comments repeated for me because I spaced out the first time they were mentioned.

One time I was trying to assemble a stool, and for some reason, I kept trying and failing to drill in screws - I just couldn‚Äôt do it somehow. I kept trying the same incorrect action over and over again. It was like mental masturbation because for some reason the screw just wouldn‚Äôt go even after I tried again and again and again for twenty minutes. My dad came over and got extremely angry (My parents are generally kind people and great parents but they‚Äôve let me down in this regard). He ended up doing it and it came in really easily. I got yelled at, because this was ‚Äúsomething anybody, even someone stupid, should be able to do‚Äù and I couldn‚Äôt do it.

My parents both had difficult childhoods, had to overcome big obstacles in their lives to become successful, and they chalk up the way I act to being lazy and spoiled and not having the drive to try harder. The thing is, I DO have the drive to try harder, but when I sit down to do work my brain is so cloudy that I can't help but procrastinate with whatever (digital or otherwise) distraction is available at my fingertips. I can't get more than 10 minutes of work done at once. My brother, for example, is very lazy but excels at sports and is perfectly capable of organizing his thought process - he just refuses to believe he needs to get good grades. I understand that I need to get good grades. My parents seem to think our problems are one and the same. He has the ‚Äúregular‚Äù form of laziness that they think I have.

My parents, specifically my mom, refuse to get an ADHD test because ‚Äúwe would‚Äôve known by now if I had ADHD‚Äù and ‚ÄúI could be way worse off‚Äù because I‚Äôm ‚Äúsmart‚Äù. I suppose I could understand why they think that way because I don‚Äôt really have the well-known ‚Äúhyperactive‚Äù part of ADHD, but that being said, there is a subtype - Predominantly Inattentive - that I appear to have. I‚Äôm afraid to talk to them again out of fear of getting yelled at. They‚Äôve already warned me against making ‚Äúexcuses‚Äù for my issues.

I‚Äôm livid. I‚Äôm sick of being treated badly all the time. I need somebody to talk to, explain my problem. Will I have to wait until college (haha‚Ä¶probably a worse college than I should have gone to had my ADHD been treated) to get access to meds/therapy? I really don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel dumb having to post about this on Reddit but honestly idk what other solution there is.

TL;DR: many obvious signs of ADHD as listed above, yet my parents won't get me tested. What should I do?

I wad not able to get an internship mostly on my part for not trying to hard to get one and I will be looking for a full time job this month in the accounting field hopefully.

My questions are to figure out what further education I should seek and what certifications I should aim for first as well as what type of work I should be looking for. I have asked a handful of professors and career services at my university and no one seems to be able to give me clear answers so I thought I would ask the internet for advice as well.

311,"Long back story, but short form is: 2 years ago I asked my husband to move out and filed for divorce due to his cheating etc.
He very shortly after died from cancer (of which I was unaware, so much I didn't know about that man).
Of course his family turned on me. Blood is thicker than water and all.  
Well, yesterday I received from his sister by mail: a death certificate from 1990 of someone I have never heard of, and that person's parent's marriage certificate. ???????? The short note she included said: found this in ***'s things.
What the heck?  I don't know these people, why would I want their marriage and death certificates, and why did my late husband have these items in his possession?????
I think I'll try to track down actual family of the person who died in 1990 and send it on to them.
Question is, should I even reply to the ex sister in law?",05Apr2018,1

313,"I have a somewhat odd work setup. I work away from the main office at a location on a college campus where I manage student volunteers with a nonprofit program. Recently during the spring break I visited a program at another campus to see how they manage things there. While there, we were discussing some challenges of the work we do and I expressed some of my frustration with some aspects of the work. For example, how the students I manage were complaining how I‚Äôm ‚Äúnever in my office‚Äù, when I was out of the office for three days one week for a series of meetings and trainings at the main office, and the nature of this work doesn‚Äôt actually require them to interact with me every day. Also, a large part of my role involves me having to travel around the city. They just want to be able to come in whenever without first making sure I‚Äôm actually in the office. I also expressed some frustration with the lack of communication I have experienced recently. This was all in the context of me sharing my challenges in order to find out how they handle similar situations in their program.

Anyway, today I had my usual weekly check in call with my direct supervisor and she said that some of my colleagues had come to her and said that what I said made them ‚Äúuncomfortable‚Äù and that they think I don‚Äôt like my work or the students I manage. My supervisor told me this in the context of ‚ÄúI wanted you to know that people are saying this‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt get the sense that I was actually in trouble but it was still so upsetting. I just about started crying in the meeting. I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for a long time (am in the treatment process now) and it hurt to hear that my efforts to succeed despite that are going unobserved. Moreover, it hurts to think I can‚Äôt trust the people I work with. My job is already so lonely and now I can‚Äôt even talk to my colleagues about my stresses and challenges? 

It‚Äôs just so discouraging. I don‚Äôt want to quit this job. The salary is decent and the benefits are good, and I do believe in the work. I feel like such a failure. I agreed to a two year commitment when I started this job and it hasn‚Äôt even been one year yet. I just want to run away and hide forever.",05Apr2018,1

318,"Hello.

I'm unhappy, and I have been for quite awhile.

To keep things brief, I work at an outbound callcenter in a growing city. I spend the day cold calling prospects and setting meetings for sales representatives.

I took this job because I wanted to move to a thriving city, I wanted to be near my friends, and I wanted a sustainable income. 

I've been here for a year and a half and I just don't think I can take it anymore. Every time I dial out, I give a silent prayer that my call will go unanswered. I spend Sunday nights dreading the week ahead of me. I lose sleep over not making my numbers. 

I went to school to write - not that it's evident here - and subsequently took a nice marketing job in an sparsely populated state in a small town. I gave it up to come here and live my life as a young person after almost two years of career growth, body transformation, and maturation.

Now I'm here - I have great friends, a wonderful girlfriend, and a variety of new hobbies. But this position makes me fundamentally unhappy.

I can't figure out if I'm being unreasonable - if I should just put my head down and grind, grateful for the life I've built - or if I should seek something more. It's been difficult applying for jobs and scheduling interviews on my schedule. 

I have a large sum of savings (a few years salary) available to me. I have side projects that could, with solid work, generate revenue. I have the support of my wonderful girlfriend - but I'm afraid of what leaving will do for me in terms of locking down future positions should my ""dreams"" fail.

The saving grace of this place has been my coworkers, who have become close friends to me. Today I was told by my superior that I needed to cut communication with them at work and fall in line, which I understand. However, without the ability to talk with them, I feel my time here is meaningless, and that I'm wasting away in this cubicle, and a position I regularly lie about to strangers for fear of humiliation. 

I would like whatever advice there is to receive, and I appreciate the input from anyone who cares to provide it.

Thanks. ",05Apr2018,1

I have also had random negative thoughts as well as suicidal ones daily. She says that Remeron isn't doing anything to remedy these depressive symptoms or anxiety and she convinced me to save up to see a psychiatrist. My dad gets his insurance through his job, and his job doesn't cover mental health care, so I am considered self-pay everywhere I go. The psychiatrist I used to see before my insurance changed had a self-pay rate of $225 for the initial visit. I just got a job and I don't think I can afford this seeing how I have to pay my rent from now on and my food expenses. I tried calling another office, but they kept me on hold forever.  The next one's rate was $275 and all of these are due at the time of service. My parents would wring my neck and cause me more stress if I went to a mental hospital again. I have no idea what to do. I'll try calling offices near my hometown to see what their rates are. I feel overwhelmed by all of this and just want to get the help I need. I feel very unstable and I am lost.

325,"i'm literally asking for a friend bc i'm out of state and i have no real idea how to help:/ but anyways. my best friend who i love more than anything (let's call her emma) decided this summer to take a year off from college to deal with drinking problems/depression and returned home to live with her parents in their guest house because that was the only option financially. she has had a lot of ups a downs since i've been bffs with her (since we were 14, we're 21 now), and went to rehab for alcohol for the first time this summer and has relapsed a few times since she got out but is currently stable enough to keep two jobs and is hanging in there. just dealing with that would be manageable, but, her mother, father, and older sister are all alcoholics (of varying functionality) who drink all day long (and completely in denial) and deflect everything on to her in this really weird way that ive witnessed countless times. like when I was home this summer her mom will call us at 2pm with a slurred voice asking where emma is and if shes drunk when were like just going to yoga or watching movies or something lol. Then her mother will ask her to go out and buy them a bottle of wine even though Emma is newly sober. her father confessed a few months back that he had an addiction to painkillers for her entire life (supposedly no one in the family knew) and started treatment and tapering down w/ suboxone. since then, he has not been working, (btw they are both great artists and thats their only jobs, their art is acclaimed and sells well but still like lower middle-upper lower class) and her mother works but not a lot, and her older sister has bi polar and although she is very gifted and could work, she refuses to get a job and her parents are afraid to push her so she remains entirely dependent on them. now, emma is working two jobs and giving all of the money to her mother (which then goes to sister, father. Her father doesnt even know that emma is supporting the family and probably would get really defensive about it. its just like a mess. bc she came home to heal herself and now she is locked in as a caretaker of three adults who actually are the source of her deepest issues who have never even apologized for big things that have happened in the past (which i wont go into). my suggestion was to get a family therapist, i know of a great one in the area who takes her insurance, but i'm not sure if she could get her fam to follow through and be honest. my other solution was to cut them off completely, which is personally what i would do if placed in this position. and i even know of a great/inexpensive roommate for her in town. but i know that the family's relationship dynamic is extremely extremely codependent and toxic and manipulative and insane so there is no way she will do that even though i know that would be best for her. But I know there must be other ways, I just cant really think of them. also they don't have any other close friends or family members who would help which sucks. sorry if this is long and doesnt make sense im just v desperate to get her out of this situation and I can‚Äôt even support her on a daily basis bc I‚Äôm 500 miles away.",05Apr2018,1
326,"Tl;dr Casually dated a girl for a few months before making it official, but the night we were officially together she slept with another guy. We took a few steps back, tried to be casual, but fell in love again, but is now dating someone else. Despite this, she says she still loves me and has been having an affair on this guy with me literally since she started dating him. Should I tell him?

Ok, so let me preface this by saying I hate myself; The actions I have taken in the recent months have definitively made me a bad person, so if you want to give me shit for being weak, or just an idiot for letting this girl do what she does, go right ahead.

That said, this all started a year ago. I met and started casually seeing this girl and we hit it off like nothing else. Don't even really need to exagerate, but we simply just worked perfectly together. Soon enough, we both fell for one another, and on the night of her 21st birthday she told me exactly how she felt, that she wanted to be with me officially, that she really liked me. I wholeheartedly agreed and we were a couple...for all of a few hours. That night, she went to the bars while I went to a party (I was not 21 yet so couldn't go with her.) Soon enough I get a call from her roommate frantically asking if she was with me; turns out she had gone home with another guy at the bars after getting blackout drunk. I was shocked; she was a very innocent girl; I was her first despite her being well into college, not a slut by any means. That said, my heart was broken, and our relationship was over before it ever really got off the ground.

Despite this, all of our feelings were still there, despite me being deeply hurt. Overtime, we got close again, and took another shot at just being casual. We started dating but never put a label on it. I was afraid to bring up the matter of being official even after I forgave her for cheating so we stayed ""FWB"" for lack of a better title. This was apparently a mistake though.

After months had passed, we were both in love but were too hesitant to confess it to each other. Just recently though, some other guy took a liking to her and asked her out. She ended up humoring him and going on a date because after all, we weren't official, and long story short he really liked her and asked her to be his girlfriend offically. She accepted, only telling me about all this well after the fact. 

After learning what she'd done, i did my best to understand, agreed we'd just have to be friends now, but after a long talk I told her everything. That I loved her, that she always meant so much to me, and she seemed immediately looked like she had made some mistake. She kissed me that night.

From there, she confessed that she loved me too, that everything I felt she felt, but having just started a relationship with this new guy she felt she needed to let me go and move forward with him. What she did next is why I'm here.

Since then, she has consistently told me she loves me and had hooked up with me 10-15 times over the past few months, all while dating him. I loved the girl, I truly did, so I was hoping it would just take time for her to realize she needed to break up with him. But she never did... 

This girl cheated on me and broke my heart. Now she's doing the same to some other guy. I know I should never talk to her again, but I'm not exaggerating when I say this girl is my closest friend and a lover I've had for well over a year. As much as i hate her for what she's done, I love her.

This has gone too far though... I've told her she's using me, I've told her that she needs to break up with him for no other reason that just make things right. We're beyond dating ourselves, I don't think I could ever trust her after this, but I need help......I don't think she'll ever tell him. This girl is manipulating us both... I know how to contact the guy...Should I tell him what's been happening and just put an end to this horrible mess?",05Apr2018,0

For the past six months, I've been living at home with my parents. I lost my job a month ago (a part-time job that was advertised as full-time when I was hired - they fired me after I inquired about it). I was there for a month and unemployed for four months before that. 

I have a bachelor's degree and I can't find or get a full-time job at all. For the past two years, the only jobs I've been able to get are part-time gigs where I'm always the oldest person there, and in order to make rent, I would have to get at least two at the same time.

 If you're wondering: I majored in theatre. That's what I want to do with my life ultimately, but it's one of the most uncertain careers. I get denied from service and food jobs because I don't have serving experience, and I get denied from retail because I don't have retail experience. When I do get an interview, the question of ""So what's up with this degree in theatre"" always comes up, and I have to constantly pretend I've given up on my dream because they won't hire someone who doesn't want to work their way up through the company. I don't have money to go back to school to get a degree in anything else. 

I've been trying for a full-time ANYTHING, but everything keeps coming back negative. I'm either overqualified because I have a college degree or underqualified because I don't have enough skills or experience - even with almost 4 years of customer service and 1 year of sales under my belt. The only way I've been making any form of money is by Doordashing as often as possible.

334,"I've started studying Architecture at a semi reputable local university in 2010. Went through many issues that saw me dropping out almost entirely but still taking classes, trying to get by. My GPA was all the way down to 1.2/4.0 from all the failed/barely passed classes at one point.

Things got better after 5 years of dark clouds, got rid of the things that were holding me down and fixed my health. Family issues have been non existent for the past 3 years as well. Last 2 years I've been taking many old and new classes to be done with this university/city and move on, start a new page, but with all the joint effort of me and my professors I could barely get my GPA over 2.0/4.0 to be able to graduate. Who knew it would be so hard to fix all those barely passed classes that I didn't attend more than twice.

Right now I'm looking to study abroad and get a masters degree with solid grades to have something to show other than my failed undergrad years and to pursue my dreams (of being successful on my own and leaving this country). But, as it happens with 2.13 GPA I cannot find a school abroad to take me seriously.

**(TL;DR)**What are my options with such a low GPA but with dedication and motivation to do as much as I can? I've been putting a lot of effort and time into fixing everything internally and externally and I have been succeeding in the past 2.5 years at a very good rate, but I don't know what my next step should/could be. I've secured funding for any Masters degree I would get accepted to so that's one obstacle down, but I cannot find a school to take me seriously. This country is not good for me (had to live in many different ones till my University years) and I have the opportunity to get out, but I feel rather stuck.

Any advice would be great. I want to pursue a Masters in Urban Planning. My IELTS score is close to perfect and I have a pretty flattering reference letter from my last term design studio professor.

Thanks in advance!

Things im considering are;

- Try to arrange an interview and go in person, although I'm not sure if this is even possible with a GPA that falls way below the requirements.

- Create a website for myself to portray my best work (in and out of school) in an online portfolio.

- Do a Masters in Architecture at any low tier institution (if I can get into one) and use my fresh grades there to get a Masters in Urban Planning from a reputable university.

The only school I've completed is elementary school, I wasn't able to finish the high school because of financial reasons and since then I've tried multiple sorts of jobs, that includes ""salesman"", manual worker etc. The last one I did was helping electricians - pretty much carrying heavy stuff all day, what got me to quit was that I wasn't making nearly enough to be able to pay for the rent and bills. Currently I'm living with my mother and her husband, but they're most likely getting divorced very soon and I have to decide if I'm going to move with her or on my own. Moving on my own is my long term goal that was always hard to achieve. The kind of work that I'm able to get won't pay for it but living with my mother, splitting the bill should be possible.

340,"Me [19F] and my boyfriend [19M] are going through a rough patch mostly because of his mental illnesses (and also his bad company) and I'm very conflicted whether I should stay or leave.

We've known each other for 5 years now. Four years as very close friends and one dating. I always tryed to be supportive but it was uncomparably easier when we weren't dating. Now that his bad decisions actually directly affect my life too I find myself irationally annoyed when he does something totally irresponsible (skips school ALL the time, misses tests, drinks excessively at inappropriate times, is on phone all day because he hardly gathers motivation to do anything else, or is hanging around guys that are known to abuse drugs). All this affects me badly, I worry A LOT about those things, I fight urge to cry 75% of times when he's with that company. At this point it was necessary for me to seek psychologist too (But waiting line is approx. 360 days)

Nevertheless, i love that guy. When he's well he's more than I could EVER wish for. He's the best.

So my question here is - In ~ 3 months he will (hopefully:S) finish IT school he hates so much and might later actually study something that he enjoys. Also he'd be moving in with me (in 6months) in another city (~1h away with a car) so that would mean leaving his 'friends' behind. - He admited they are bad company but still hangs around with them. So should I stay in hopes of better times ... or end relationship? I blame his company for 95% of troubles we are having, but I just might be delusional and it's actually bipolar and depression causing this -meaning that even if he moves in with me nothing will/can really change and that this relationship is doomed to fail anyway.

Additional request, if I decide to stay - what can I do for him to help him? Especially when he fucks things up. I find it extremely hard to be supportive, because I want him so so much to learn from his mistakes. Plus I find it impossible to support him when he's absoultely ignoring life problems that are approaching. If I'm not constantly nagging him to do something for school he just doesn't do it till the very last day or even then not. When he 'surprisingly' fails he is even more depressed. Help :(

343,"So when we first started dating my bf would see his friends sometimes but now he never contacts his own friends. Also when we first started dating, whenever I would be like ‚ÄúI am going to do X‚Äù he would respond with something like ‚Äúoh well I guess I am not invited‚Äù so now I always invite him out of politeness

But whenever I make plans to hang out with friends and I invite him he never says no or and never has his own plans.

I am starting to feel like an event planner for my bf and I would like be able  to see friends without him once in a while.

Am I wrong to want to not invite him and how do I address this without hurting his feelings?

344,"Title basically says it all. I could add that the guy in question briefly dated a good friend of mine, and might still have feelings for her. She‚Äôs the one who broke it off, almost immediately after they started seeing each other, and I know for a fact that he took it pretty hard. 

As the title indicates, we also aren‚Äôt classmates, and he has his own group of friends he‚Äôd want to celebrate his birthday with. I don‚Äôt want to intrude upon that, but I don‚Äôt want to simply shoot him a casual ‚ÄúHappy Birthday!‚Äù text either. 

So I‚Äôm having trouble figuring out what would be appropriate and what wouldn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt want to let on anything about my feelings for him at the moment, but I don‚Äôt want to seem uncaring and cold either. Especially because he shares his birthday with a classmate of his who is also my friend, and who I‚Äôm planning on gifting something to. I don‚Äôt want him to feel left out. 

He is also a pretty big gamer and a nerd. 

Some advice would be appreciated as to how I should proceed in this situation... Basically, what can I do for him that will show him I care, but that wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äútoo much‚Äù for just a casual friend to do? ",05Apr2018,1

I met a girl the yesterday after texting her nonstop for a few days. We get along pretty well and bonded over the fact that were moving to the same area in Cali at the same time. She's naturally rebellious and talked about how girls hated her because she could chill with the popular guys. However, there are a few things about her that are slightly unsettling.

1. She has a lot of close guy friends. More close guy friends than close female friends.

2. She bragged about how she doesn't care if people ask her what its like to have a dead sibling. Proceeded to say ""I just tell them what its like pretty much like a normal topic in a conversation"". 

3. She didn't check her phone (except for her mom's phone call) when I spent an hour with her. However, I can text her at anytime and get a response right away.

4. She seemed adamant about helping my family move and the two of us hanging out in Cali.

Edit: We've never met in person until yesterday. No way she has a crush on me. She just told me she went to meet up with a guy friend who she texts a lot.

354,"Hello, and thank you for reading.

I work in a retail yard in a lumber mill.
I was hired about 7 years ago to work retail, which I still am officially in the retail position.


Over the years I have obviously had responsibilities added to my position; for all intents and purposes my official title is still retail yard associate or ""retail specialist.""

Over the past year my employer has taken to adding a variety of oddball responsibilities to my work load and most of them I do not mind performing as they are not far out of my job description...

However, he has been getting me to rent out properties he owns to tenants. At first I was not completely against the idea; he recognized my interpersonal skills, confidence and skills with the internet, advertising (I run our social media as well) and habit of asking appropriate questions about subjects I am not sure on.

Now, for all intents and purposes, on top of my regular daily yard/mill/social media/home show/procurement responsibilities he has me going to one of our tenants/calling her multiple times a day to secure her very late rent. He has me processing evictions, dealing with online dispute resolution centers, personally communicating with the tenant and essentially harassing her day in and day out (albeit deservedly). He takes me away on a very regular basis from my normal and additive duties to confront this situation, of his privately owned property, and it takes a lot of time, energy and productivity away from my regular, described work load. I deal with government orientated paperwork, I keep track of the entire on-going process and it's becoming quite taxing and effecting me mentally and my work...

He is the sort of person who would find me... dispensable were I to approach him about shedding myself of this particular added responsibility which I believe should not be mine. I was hired to sell wood and I was under the impression after these years I would continue to move in that direction and learn more about the company, market and path I would like to try and follow...

I am not sure how I can appropriately (I use this word in correlation to understand who he is as a person and employer, as they are not separate entities) approach him and tell him this is not a responsibility I want, am interested in and that is negatively effecting me without him viewing me as unreliable, problematic and unappreciative of his perceived... Trust. 

To be quite frank, I believe he needs a personal assistant for his personal life and errands and it's not what I came here to do.

How can I make him understand and moreover, am I in the wrong?

Thank you for any input or advice.",05Apr2018,1

One night I got off work from A and went to B to pick up the girlfriend (we share a car right now). The new GM there sits me down for an impromptu interview and it sounds like I've got it. We're just waiting on one of my old managers from B to get back and I'll talk to him. Cool so far.

Fast forward to a few days ago I call up there and they seem sketchy about it now. The old manager says the new GM got a ""bad reference"" from one of A's managers. Confused, I call A and they haven't heard anything from B. The old manager says he'll call to ""get the full story"".

I believe Restaurant A's management. One of my buddies that is a manager at A told me you can only ask if said employee was terminated or not and if they're eligible for rehire. Any recourse or advice as to what I could do here? I'm still picking up shifts at A, which is another sign they like what I'm doing.

FYI I recently lost a lot of weight and am proud to say I look completely normal now, which also means I have never dated anyone in the past. Back to the girl. We just have casual streaks on snapchat and out of the bloom she sends me a snap chat saying ‚ÄúI love u‚Äù. Being super surprised I didn‚Äôt know what to say so I just asked ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù For her to respond with ‚ÄúI am so high rn‚Äù(didn‚Äôt look high on weed, but doubt she uses any other substance). I don‚Äôt say anything and some time goes on and she says it a second time and I ignore it. Finally I decide to ask if she meant it over Snapchat(weird thing about this is we have classes together but rarely ever speak). She says she doesn‚Äôt remember but insisted I told her. After saying nvm and that it didn‚Äôt matter I didn‚Äôt respond anymore. 5 min goes by and I get a text from my friend saying I gotta to respond because. So now I am like damn she is getting my friends involved in this? Anyway I don‚Äôt respond to her. About a week goes she snaps me That she meant what she said. As of now let me say I do think this girl is very physically attractive, but getting some background about her personality from my friends, she is kinda known for having bfs often and that all of them recommended I don‚Äôt go for it. Anyway at the time I didn‚Äôt know this and I said I liked her a lot aswell. More time Goes by and she asked to hangout I decide at first to say yes Then I canceled the plans because I realized this this person won‚Äôt positively benefit my life(trust me on this I dont feel like explaining why, but it‚Äôs the right choice). Second time she asks to make plans I bluntly tell her ""sorry if i led u on, but i am not looking to start anything"" she responds with alright. The reason I am typing this is not weather I should ask her out or not because I don‚Äôt want to be with this person. I just am uneasy because I don‚Äôt know if she really meant it and actually liked me or she is just finding that other meaningless bf that will last for 2 weeks. a trusted I know person described and told me that she is ‚Äúin love with the idea of love‚Äù

We've both made some (quite pathetic) attempts to message each other. I really want to finally send her an essay-like message saying how I feel about what she did. I'm just scared that she would share the text with her boyfriend or other people. Im currently on spring break and we wont be seeing eachother at school for a bit.

Something else to consider is that we only have like a 3 month relationship lifespan from here as she‚Äôs moving away then.

So firstly she complained to me about this ex that was harassing her, she also said that they had only been in a relationship for 2 months and that she hadn‚Äôt seen him in 8 months, even though she has a photo with him that goes back to like November...
Also I asked her who this guy was on her page out of interest, but I knew it was this ex, instead of saying it was she said it was simply some friend who isn‚Äôt in her friendship group anymore. I had previously looked him to see who was ‚Äòharassing her‚Äô but didn‚Äôt let her know this because it was slightly embarrassing to do that, so that‚Äôs how I knew who he was before I asked her.

Then recently she said she was on the road being driven back from somewhere, but sent me a screenshot of something from her phone and it showed she was connected to WiFi? And her snap maps showed her at home like 10 minutes prior to her sending me that...

I don't consider myself dumb, but i struggle with academics test taking specificly, always did my homework, and did well on papers could pass a test to save my life though.

I do care a lot about her, but the first few days after fighting I honestly became kind of annoying and I insisted a lot so we could talk, initiating our conversations.

Now she's texting me like everyday and then usually ends up ignoring me. She isn't being rude or anything, but she is not being friendly at all and she says stuff that just feels passive-agressive. I don't get what she wants and to be honest it can be kind of hurtful when she just drops the conversation like that.

The things that annoys me the most is that she always makes it sound like everything is my responsibility, that I should be the one trying to solve our situation and whenever I say something about her she just says I'm overthinking stuff.

I do care a lot about her but I'm considering telling her that I just don't see us working anything out if she keeps up those ""things won't be as before"" kind of comments all the time and generally acting like that.

I get things take time, but I liked her because she was nice, caring and a fun person to hang out with. Now she's not really acting like that at all and I've already said that I'm sorry and that I value our friendship more than our fight, but it's like she doesn't care.

I feel like telling her that I just don't see us as friends if she's not acting like one and that I just don't want anything right now if she's gonna act like that. Is that too mean, too harsh, too early to say?

I know it can be rude, but fuck, the last couple of days have been amazing and I don't really want this thing to keep spoiling my good mood.",05Apr2018,2
372,"I work at a supermarket here in Australia and sometimes, when I am still working on my aisle, the captain sends me someone to help out. Occasionally, I am rescued by this particular colleague. I am usually very grateful for the help, and I am usually on the verge of cramping, but unfortunately this assistance has come with some unwanted sexual conversation, and it is getting weirder by the minute. 

It started a few months ago when he started asking me, in a casual way, when I was getting married. It is a running joke with a couple of the other people on the side, so I laughed it off. However, then he kept asking whether I had a girlfriend, whenever I would work with him. I said I didn't, but then he randomly said ""do you know any Afghan girls?"" I am Afghan-Australian, but alas, I said no. 

Pretty much every time he would see me, he would be almost begging for me to find him an Afghan girl, when alas, I don't actually know any. I am Australian by trade. He is actually from India, so I thought he must be trying to find and marry someone to stick around permanently. So I gulped and I let it go.

However, today the conversation was really explicit, way more so than usual. He asked me whether I liked brown girls or white girls. I said that I have never really thought about it. He said ""I like both. So long as they have a vagina, I like them"". He then asked me what my favourite colour is, and I passionately said ""blue"". ""Ah, so you must like blue films then"". I said ""what are you talking about"" and he said that Asian people call porn videos 'blue films'. When I tried to dodge a question, by playing dumb, he appears to get genuinely upset, saying ""you know these things, you're just lying.""

He has also started touching me. Not in a sexual way, but for example, he squeezed both of my shoulder blades, and I had what I assume was an instinctual urge to spin around and kick him, which would have been remarkably ninja, but thought better of it.

I am a 5'8 200 pound man with comprehensive body hair, and he is talking about heterosexuality, so I don't know what his motivations are. I don't really know what sort of action can be taken without burdening the captain, in having to create a plan that separates us, for example. I know how stressed they are already.

Problem is, it‚Äôs a dangerous medication (increases chance of blood clots) and has additional negative effects on men (it is a synthetic female hormone if I recall correctly. Taking it once obliterates my ability to perform sexually for one to two weeks). So I rarely take this medication, only if my weight shows signs of dipping below 150.

I‚Äôve been going to the gym consistently for over a year now, drinking a mass gainer along with it. I‚Äôve been seeing results, and it‚Äôs been helping.

I‚Äôve heard not eating enough will affect your ability to lift more at the gym).

As it stands now, marijuana is not legal here unless I am on my death bed (New Jersey). Even if it were, my job would never allow me to use it, plus I don‚Äôt like the high marijuana gives anyway. 

I‚Äôve talked to my doctor several times, I‚Äôve been tested for everything to see why I don‚Äôt eat enough: AIDS, thyroid issues, etc. Nothing. She says it‚Äôs either this dangerous medication megestrol, weed if it were legal for me, or just eat more somehow.

Then again at the same time I had something in mind on what we can do just for some reason I can‚Äôt get myself to ask if they want to. It‚Äôs almost as if I am waiting for them to ask. Another thing. I think I just solved my own advise and I should just ask to do one thing and just go with the flow on what our next activity would be. I think not sure 100 percent tho that I might have a slight fear of boredom and it can be worse if I am bored with someone else. ,05Apr2018,1
383,"Hello all,

I am here to ask for advice on my relationship with my girlfriend of ten months. She is absolutely gorgeous, but there are some problems with her; my family does not like her, she can be a total bitch sometimes, and she gets upset easily. One issue really sticks out for me though, this being that I'm busy a lot of the time, and can't really talk/be with her all the time. I play Varsity Lacrosse, need to study all the time, trying to get into a god college, and my  parents are super strict. She always complains about me not being enough for her, not paying attention to her enough. The worst part is that she told me that she is getting ""bored""; and she says it does not feel like it is a relationship anymore. Her and I live about 20-25 mins apart. I love her very dearly, but she cannot seem to understand that some other things need to come before her at this point in time. We often get into fights about it (not physical fights, but over text), and it puts me into a funk, which causes my performance at sports and school to go down, as I ""have"" to focus on her so that she does not ""fade out"" on me (as she has done to past exes). What do I do? Do I put everything else before her and let her be everything in my life and let my future suffer? I'm so confused at this point in time and I really don't know where to go with this situation. Thank you in advance for any person willing to help a young kid in a trying time.",05Apr2018,1
384,"I'm an 18 year old that has been recently been into cars, been about a year or so.  Beginning of summer, I hyped myself up about wanting to learn manual. My plan was to look on craigslist and buy a cheap ~$1000 car to practice on. but since that still cost money and didn't really have anybody to teach me, I slowed myself down.  Been really wanting to learn again.  Should I go ahead with my plan of buying a cheap car and self teaching or what? 

Some details:

* I'm most likely paying for everything

* My parents think its useless since I already have a crappy car to drive me around so they don't really support it (not really mine, it's my dad's)

* working a minimum wage job, with paycheck that comes out to ~$600 ish",05Apr2018,1
