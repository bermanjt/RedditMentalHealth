0,"Help. My older brother has us under a regime in our own household. We can't make noise before certain times and even when he is awake he rages, yells and breaks things if we make noise. A good example is the vacuum -- we can't even vacuum the house because he goes ballistic if it turns on. Another example is doing dishes, we can barely do them because the noise ticks him off.

The ultimate example, and this one is crazy, is the clock in the living room. My freak brother actually removed the batteries from the clock and threw them away to get rid of the ticking noise. His room (more like a dungeon as he never leaves the house) is down the hallway from the clock.

He controls the house. None of us can do anything against him for fear of retaliation or angering him. We mostly avoid him, the last few days when I've seen him I've ignored him and walked past. That's how bad it is. This is not a normal family, we might be the most dysfunctional family on the planet.

Just now my younger brother was on Xbox with friends and my psychotic brother kicked his door open and screamed at him louder than I've ever heard him scream, all because my younger brother was talking on the mic. Can you believe that?

Other little things set him off that aren't noise related, I could go on and on about it. We are fairly sure he has Asperger's as he went to therapy many years ago and he has the other symptoms in addition to the sensitivity to sound I described. He is insane and we can't do anything. We all live in fear in this house, like mice scurrying in the shadows trying to be as quiet as possible. 

I can't believe it has come to this point. He is 21 and should be out on his own but refuses to move out and abuses my parent's kindness to live basically rent free. He's not working and is in college online so he NEVER LEAVES the house. It is actually hell living here.",24Sep2018,9
1,"This is a throwaway just in case. So I recently moved in to my boyfriends place, everything is great I love him he loves me yay etc etc. But i absolutely cannot stand one of his dogs. I know I know, ""how can you possibly hate a sweet little dog"" no, this thing is satan incarnate. I work with dogs, I have for 2 years, and I've never met a dog more stupid than her. At nearly 5 years old she isnt properly potty trained and cant hold it while shes in a crate and were at work. She pisses all over my things, makes giant messes I have to clean, screams bloody murder if she sees a small dog or cat, cries constantly in her crate, i could go on. And you'd think, well, get a dog trainer right? Well here's the kicker. My boyfriend is a dog trainer. Shes a shelter dog and was abused, and honestly I could totally see why. He caters to her every whim, coddles her, and doesnt punish her when she does something bad. Hes just like ""aw poor you, your life is so hard"" meanwhile his other, older, better dog has to sit in a crate for most of the day because he cant deal with her obnoxious crying when shes in the crate. Not to mention I have a cat that I've raised from a kitten for 7 years (hes currently staying at a friend of mine's house until we get a home, and leave the apartment) and I'll be damned if I let her hurt a hair on his head. At this point I want to lay down an ultimatum because the dog is dangerous and mentally unstable. Once she sees something and wants to get it, you cant get her mind off it. Some advice would be great cause I dont know how much longer I can deal with her. ",24Sep2018,1

Throwaway account and long post if any of you read all the way through know that I am very grateful for you. 

   
 

I reported my co-worker for the following events: Upon meeting him he was friendly yet flirty and I tried to convey to him that I wasn't interested. He asked me out to coffee and I dodged the question saying that I am very busy with school blah blah blah. Every shift we worked together (I work part-time so it was around once a week) he would go out of his way to come into my department and try to talk to me. I found this to be unsettling because his department is no where near mine and he had no business being there. 

I had done my best to not get to know this guy and I felt like I had succeeded. One day at work he sits next to me on my break and basically hints that he wants me to move in with him because he needed a roommate. I told him I wasn't interested and got up and walked away. At this point we had only been working together for a few months and I had maybe had like 4 conversations with him

Fast forward a few months and he begins confronting me about not answering his texts. I gave him every excuse from being busy to not being much of a texter but he still didn’t get the hint. 

This August we had a work party and I was standing with my managers listening to a guest speaker on stage. The guy comes up behind me, grabs me and kisses me. I shoot him a dirty look and ignore him for the rest of the night. I thought my managers didn’t see him kiss me but I found out today one of them did but she thought it was consensual so she didn’t say anything. 

I avoided him for the next month and ignored him when he spoke to me. This week he cornered me in my department and told me that he had spoken to one of my co-workers about me and he said that he “wouldn’t touch me with a ten-foot pole”. I know this is not true because I know the co-worker very well and he would never say anything bad about anyone and he said it was last week but he was in a different province last week and he had said that it happened at work. I confronted him over text for the kiss and the lie about my co-worker and I have him admit to both so I have some proof. 

I wrote a 10 page report on everything he has done to me and submitted it to human resources only to be told the best they can do is tell him to leave me alone.

What should/can I do here? ",24Sep2018,1
3,"For a while now my friend has been controlled by her mom. This week in particular she was planning on coming to see me at my college and stay overnight. A few days before though her mom texts her asking what she wants to do this weekend and she proceeds telling her that she has plans to go into town. Her mom texts her that she (the daughter) must call her later. Later that day she calls her mom and they talk. After the call she calls me crying that she isn't able to go because her mom won't let her go. Now what confuses me is why the mother is so controlling to her daughter. Now her daughter is 18 and a freshman at college. She has her own job, pays for her own car, and insurance but for her to say that she can't go blows my mind. Like as I see it shes an adult and should be able to make her own decisions when it comes to her day to day life. She even goes further to call her daughter on the day that she was supposed to go to visit me in a drunken rage and demand for a picture to make sure that she is there. I just don't know what to do, like I try to support her but nothing makes a difference because her mom is in her head. She even has said that due to her mom she is going to drop out of college because of the stress she has received from her mother. Anyone know what to do?",24Sep2018,2
4,"Background: 
My sister and I have the same biological parents. When we were both still a couple of years old our biological father left/was made to leave (that is still unclear). We have been told he was physically and emotionally abusive to our mother and us, stole things, took drugs etc. 
He left our lives 25+ years ago, never sent any support money, birthday or Christmas gifts or general correspondence. He has lived in his birth country since then (not our country). Approximately 10 years ago he found my sister and I on social media  and made contact. I and my sister have spoken to him on and off since then. 
My mother hates him and is still angry. My sister has said she has always been curious about who he is. I an completely indifferent to him, I don't hate him or particularly want/need to know him.

The situation I need help with:
Recently my sister has decided that she thinks it would help her to meet him. she wants to do it on her terms, so her plan is to travel to his birth country with her partner for a holiday and take a day to meet him.
My sister has told our mother, did not take it well at all, telling my sister she didn't have her blessing to go and stormed out of my sister's house in hyaterics.
Our mother has said she doesn't understand why, my sister wants to go, says things like ""clearly I wasn't enough"", ""maybe I shouldn't have bothered"" and ""why is she hurting us all like this"". At the moment my mother is refusing to speak with her about anything until Sister ""makes it right"" by breaking off contact with our biological father.

6,"I have pretty severe, chronic depression and anxiety that doesn't respond to treatment. 

I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do, if there is anything to do.

I've been in and out of therapy for many years. Seen doctors. Tried and retried many meds. I don't like weed. I can't afford to be more forgetful either.

I'm disabled and not able to work or do fun things.  I have pervasive sleep related neurological problems and the depression and anxiety definitely don't help with my long sleeping time, zero lack of energy and mental fog. No money bc I can't work. Feels physically painful to just be awake.

I'm not very social. I just kind of prefer to be alone. It's exhausting, painful and too hard to pretend to be normal and positive enough to socialize. 

My social skills are fine, but I feel like I just don't want to. 

Family isn't great. Not supportive and loving. They have their own (big) problems. 

I have zero interest in hobbies, no money with which to do them and no energy for them. 

I'm pretty much just hanging out and taking care of my dog and parrot as best as I can, which is pretty depressing too bc I wish I could do more for them and feel guilty.

Therapy isn't something I'm doing currently bc I can't keep up with appointments. I can't wake up and can't afford to keep paying missed appointment fees. 

My disabilities aren't well managed bc there just isn't treatment for them. I have been compliant with my doctors. 

Seems like I do everything I can but things never turn out well. 

I'm just so tired of it all. I'm not suicidal, I have to take care of my dog and parrot. They're the only good things in my life. But that's it. 

I don't want attention or pity. I just want some kind of answer of something to try bc it feels like I've tried everything and nothing works. I don't know what's left.",24Sep2018,3

Just to be clear, we are not close friends, I've just been talking to her after I asked her out. She rejected me, but said we could be friends, so we've been talking in a friendly way for a little bit. Like I said, she usually takes around maybe a week or so to reply, but now it's been about two weeks. I noticed her snapscore has gone up since then, but that's happened before and she still eventually replied to me. This is longer though, do you think I'm overreacting?

10,"Hey guys,
I am now at the end phase of my studies to be a high school teacher in my country. The pay would be okay etc. but the thing is: It depresses me. Like heavily since the start of my studies. Back then I was too chicken to quit and now I still am. My parents paid me throughout the years. They insisted on it. I always had some practice in teaching and I am doing more than okay in those regards.

At the start of this year, I randomly applied for the luls at a school of journalism with some texts of mine. Kind of like a hail mary to start the life I always dreamt of but was too much of a coward to pursue. If I didn't get in, I was ready to fill up a bath tub and end it with a knife. 

They accept like 5 out of 1000 applicants every year. I got accepted. Great. I want to do this. Big contra: It would be at the other side of my country and my Asian parents will fucking kill me when I tell them that this investment of them is basically burnt money. My father has an insane temper, can get really angry without hurting people physically, but it gets really wild. My mother is softer in those regards but I got plenty of abuse from her, too. Don't get me wrong: I am definitely the asshole in this situation even though I am just a mental mess and want to have a fulfilled life. I am insanely scared to tell them. And I am a male in my mid-20s for God's sake.

I've been a social worker now for about 18 months and I'm on my 5th job since graduating. The problem is I really don't like any of the work that I'm doing. I thought I would eventually find a position that I love. I experience extreme anxiety and stress about work. I don't enjoy what I do on a daily basis. Right now I'm working as a counselor and I hate it. I panic when clients come to see me. I actually feel numb when at work and I worry that I've lost my ability to empathize with my clients. I'm embarrassed and ashamed to admit this, since I spent 5 years and a lot of money studying social work. I think I want out of the field, but I don't want to make any rash decisions. I also don't even know how to go about it. I have 2 car payments, a mortgage, and a wedding coming up in a few months. How could I afford to go back to school and what would I even study?

16,"So, a little set up for my living situation- I am a 20 year old F college student and my roommate is in her early 30's, F, and not a student. We live pretty separate lives. Our apartment is set up in a way that we each have our own rooms and bathroom and really only have to share the entrance/kitchen. We are not close but have chatted a couple of times, but I tend to keep to myself since I am quite introverted. Now, we have been living together for a couple of months and our rooms are connected. I can hear her crying (pretty intense sobs/wails) almost every night. This happens often weekly and has been going on more recently. I don't know much about her but I know she has friends since I have seen her bring multiple people over. She seems like a very nice but possibly insecure lady, she often apologizes for messes that seem minor to me. She even once mentioned ""I know I cry a lot, I'm sorry"" and I told her that it was no problem. I want to explain myself because I know that reaction sounds rather uncaring and rude. I am a very introverted, non-confrontational person who prefers to mind my own business. Also her age and alternative lifestyle (she's quite spiritual and a bit of a hippy) makes me feel even further disconnected from her as if I can't just talk to her like any other girl my age. I can't imagine one day knocking on her door and offering a shoulder to cry on because that honestly makes me very uncomfortable. I guess I'm writing this because I just feel awkward. I feel like a bad person because some nights I think ""I cry sometimes, and I'm never hollering. Why does she need to be like this so loud and so late in the evening?"" I know that sounds rude, but it can get exhausting being around it. I don't want to step on any toes but I wish it could stop. Any advice? Thanks for letting me vent &lt;3",24Sep2018,1

21,"I moved from another country into an American boarding school in early September. My parents are abnormally attached to me - a background in a country where living indoors basically 24/7 is a necessity being the reason why. Over this month, school life and socialization have both taken much of my free time; roommates that watch movies until late at night have taken much of my sleep.

My parents were in fact aware of my hours, and repeatedly asked me to leave the room instead of burrowing in it to make friends and connections. However, this time that I spend outside, they penalize me for not using to call them. It does not matter how many times a day I call them - be it once or twice, be it for half an hour or a whole hour or two; they’re never satisfied. I can be as friendly and forgiving as I possibly could, and my mother stills spends the weekends indoors crying and I do not have the faintest idea of how I could possibly remedy it. It is my fault, they both tell me, for forgetting them.

There are days when I don’t call - I can’t, for a reason or another. Or I call without being particularly happy due to the day having been bad. Or I have mostly bad news. Or my phone has low battery life. Any of these cause huge one-sided discussion about how poorly I treat them due to never making any efforts to call them with a prim and proper attitude and environment. Locked inside with a roommate blasting EDM? My fault. I can clearly look for somewhere else that’s quieter (even though I can’t leave the room later than 21, when I am free to call them most often). If I say otherwise, I’m lying. Bad Wi-Fi connection that makes FaceTime not work properly/a bad signal that makes the call fail? My fault. I only don’t find a better location because I haven’t looked hard enough.

Over these arguments, they have given me a week to “become the son they knew again” or else they’re cancelling this endeavor next leave. I am desperate and don’t know what to do. I’ve come to the conclusion that I should call them every day 5 to 6 times for an hour, but that is going to cause my social death and probably cause me to lose most of my studying or extracurricular time. This “storm tactic” is not sustainable over two years of school.

26,"Recently, I have been vary disheartened when it comes to doing my homework for college. I have no issue showing up to lectures and my internship. But there is just something about my homework that just makes me feel extremely upset. I start to feel completely unhappy with being in school and having to do this kind of work. I don't know what it is about it that upsets me this much but it does. This isn't a new development either ever since high school I have had moments where I feel like I should be doing something else with my life than sitting down for hours struggling with homework. I find often that when I have these feelings I think about other directions I could take with my life. Which normally consist of wishing that I could just work and start building a life for my self already. I don't think that I am lazy by any stretch of the imagination in fact I get a great satisfaction out of doing more physical forms of work (as apposed to school work) and I have ever since I was young. I used to do a lot of physical labor when I was younger and would derive a great deal of satisfaction from a job well done even if it took hours and tons of effort but rarely do I get this same feeling from school. There is just something about the lifestyle which I find draining and unsatisfactory. What I'm getting at is should I give up trying to complete school and find some work that I find fulfilling and can use to start building a life? I'm not looking for anything amazing or inspiring when it comes to work. Just something simple that I can take pride in after putting in an honest hard days work and something that pays enough to start a life on my own. There are other factors influencing me as far as this decision goes; my parents and family's opinion's, though they have always been very understanding of me I am still worried what they might think. My girlfriend, I care about her a lot and above all else (call me old fashion or whatever you like) I want to be able to provide a good life for her some day if it gets to that point. I just really want to be able to make her happy, she means a lot to me. She's in school right now as well and also works so its not like I'm the only one of us with any money or stuff like that but still a large part of me still feel like I should be able to make a substantial living of my own. In all honesty, I don't care much about money for myself, I live relatively inexpensively. I just want the people I care deeply about who ever that may be in my future to live a happy and comfortable life free of poverty and struggle. Basically, I want to be able to provide a good life for a hypothetical future that really is a dream of mine. Forgive me If this got derailed a bit. This issue is very personal for me and it is something which I have thought about for the past couple years on and off, whenever I become substantially disheartened with school. Any kind of input on this would be greatly appreciated. I'm not looking for anything that would immediately solve this issue for me. Just another opinion other than my own on this matter would be greatly appreciated. I've tried a number of times to articulate this point to those around me in the hopes of their input, but something always falls short in expressing just how serious this issue is for me and how much it would mean to me to hear a strait answer from them.

28,"Hey All,

First time posting, so apologies if I break any rules. Please let me know and I will fix.

I'm a recent MBA grad who has moved states due to my wife's postdoc. My long-term career goal is to hopefully get into the video game industry within product or marketing management. I currently have one standing offer and will be hopefully hearing back from another position shortly. Neither are related to gaming, but both should pay a similar amount and are roles where I think I would learn a great deal in the marketing and product management realm.

I am at a bit of a crossroads and unsure what is the best path to take. I am hoping I can get some opinions on what some people think may help accelerate me forward to where I want to be.

The two positions are:

1. **Associate Brand Manager - Life Sciences Company**

Pros:

* Great job title which I hope will allow me to make a lateral position title transfer after gaining some experience at the company
* I would be working under the director who has been with the company for some time and would be a good mentor
* I would be pioneering branding within an organization that has not traditionally done anything with it

Cons:

* Contract position (6 months, no benefits for first 3 months, though the position has existed for several years. High likelihood it will continue on past 6 months, and could be permanent once budgeting becomes fixed)
* Sciences and B2B (no retail) - not the most relevant to the gaming world where it is largely B2C and retail based
* Company name is huge in the sciences but unsure if it has the same brand equity to everyday people compared to other job

1. **Senior Specialist - Product Management - Office Supplies Company**

Pros:

* Strong brand recognition to the everyday person
* Increasingly B2B with contracts, but has roots in retail and still maintains that branch so I would get some experience there
* Also has the opportunity to work on some new branding initiatives caused by recent changes within the company
* Full-time position with benefits right from the start
* I met a lot of the team during the interviews and my manager seems like she would be a great mentor as well

Cons:

* Job title is a step lower in hierarchy - I would need to move up to match the other role
* Still not extremely relevant to the end goal of video game products
* It may end up being a specialist role rather than senior specialist role due to my lack of experience
* Potential for growth may be higher due to the fact it is not a contract position

I guess overall I am mainly looking for thoughts on what position may allow me to move forward faster to the place where I want to be. Should I be shooting for better titles or should I be shooting to get closer to the type of industry I want to be in?

Thanks in advance for any insights you can provide!",24Sep2018,3

32,"I've been studying web design/development at a community college for a few years, so I know html, css, js, jquery, bootstrap, and a bit of php and wordpress. I had one paid summer internship when I made fliers and a website for a landscaping company. My client my happy with the website, but I wasn't. Since they weren't interested in buying their own domain and host, I ended up making a Weebly site for them. Kinda felt like a waste of talent and no real work besides the fliers. The pros are the money and experience; cons are that it doesn't count towards my degree due to its length and it's not really resume/portfolio material. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have another internship opportunity with a company that sells Life Insurance. It's similar to the previous, but they're more into eCommerce/sales: things that I have no interest or knowledge in. Also they want me to use Wix and Click Funnels, both of which are template builders like Weebly. 

Pros

* paid
* possible resume material  

Cons

* no school credit due to length (so I'll have to take a substitute class only available 2nd semester)
* tight schedule (unlike the previous, this'll be during the school year, I have a job, and have to share vehicles which'll make it difficult to travel)
* future employers might not see this or the other internship as eligible experience

Honestly I don't want it, I just want to focus on school, but they seem really desperate for somebody and the money can go towards my savings. I don't want to waste their and my time since I don't have expertise in eCommerce/sales; I think they could find better, but I'd feel guilty and selfish turning it down.

33,"I live with my boyfriend and our two lifelong friends who are a married couple. My roomate, B, has a brother, K, who has been on our couch for about 2 weeks now. K is a friend of mine as well, but we do have a history and I am uncomfortable being around him daily. He is also a recovering alcoholic and will no doubt be homeless if we kicked him out of our house. 
He showed up 2 weeks ago pretty much blacked out. He didn't ask to crash here, he just snuck into our garage and B found him in the middle of the night. He has been here since. 
The reason I think it has been able to go on this long is because B is totally noncofrontational, especially to his brother. Which I know K knows, so he's playing it to his advantage because B can't say no. 
So far K has helped buy groceries, given B some money (around $100), helped me clean the house, and has generally stayed sober to the best of our knowledge. Which is why this is so hard for me. I know he's doing better and has had a tough life, but I still feel like he's overstayed his welcome and I don't want him here. My boyfriend and B's wife both agree. 
I dont need any legal advice, it's not extreme, just sort of the best way to approach kicking someone to the curb. Or maybe even ways to help him find a halfway house. I'm just sort of desperate. ",24Sep2018,2

35,"Hello everyone, 

I am just looking for some advice on how to clear my mind from negative thoughts. So, I’ll start with some back story. So, I broke up with my girlfriend of almost two years back in May of this year. We continued to see each other here and there until early July, from then until early this month there was some occasional texting. When we met, we were in college and we started our relationship living together. Not because we liked each other so much that we thought it was a good idea, but more because we were both having difficulty finding housing for the following school year and it got to a point where it made more sense to just move in together with my friends. So, our almost two years felt like four years, we had two dogs, eventually moved into an apartment of our own, and it was like our own little family. We broke up a few times, she was talking to other guys behind my back. And now that’s it’s been sometime where I’ve had time to go out and meet people just to help with the emotions, I still think about her. Sometimes I think about how I miss the dogs and her and other times I think about all of the bad things, like her seeing other people and it just makes me mad all over again. I try to remind occupied. I work forty hours a week and off work I am in the gym training. I’m waiting to get a ship date for Air Force basic training and I’m always making weekend plans with friends. But even with all of that going on, the though of her, whether good or bad, always seems to find its way into my busy mind. I know it’s relatively recent and I may not stop thinking about her completely, but I just wanted some advice on maybe anything more that I can do it help it. For the most part, I always hold back on texting her no matter how intense the thought of missing her is. She’s always been the one to reach out first. Thank you an advance. ",24Sep2018,1

41,"Hey, so I have a friend who has recently got out of a toxic relationship that was very off and on again. Like she kept breaking up with him but then going back to him. Now she says she's over him and I think she mostly is. However, she's just had a recent idea to get him to fall in love with her to try and teach him a lesson. Like she claims she feels nothing for him, and I hope that's true but this idea makes me think otherwise. 

So my question is, how do I convince her not to do this? Like she's managed to avoid him for a week or two now but after he begged her to come back she had a chat with him yesterday. I fear that if she spends more time with him, they'll argue and he'll make her feel worthless and like shit again.

I've already tried suggesting she'd be wasting her time but she sees all the time she'd put into it all as worth it if he learns something from this and feels the way he's made her feel. I've also tried to convince her that maybe this means she isn't moving on fast enough but she rejects that idea. So I'm not sure what more I can say. Any advice would probably be useful.",24Sep2018,1

43,"I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for about four years. He's a phenomenal human being - kind, loving, caring, endlessly patient. He always puts my needs first. This guy really, really loves me. We've talked about marriage and children. I love his family and they love me. And yet, I feel like we wouldn't be compatible in the long run. We don't have many interests in common. We've built many bridges to come together as people from different cultures and different races. In the end though, I want more out of life and my career than he does in his. He will never put career first, he says, while I would love for him to use that big brain of his and do something with it. Start a business? (He has a business degree) Go back to school to get his Masters? Literally anything other than what he's doing now, which is work at a delivery company. He's 30. There's nothing wrong with that, it's a good honest living, but I know it's less than he's capable of. I'm currently in school finishing up a degree in economics. I'm 26. I've had struggles with my mental health (still do). Some days are good, and others are bad. He's been there for me every step of the way. Held me while I sobbed, made me food, cleaned my room etc. He's a saint. It's this one little thing that's stopping me from committing. I want to go on to graduate work. I'm ambitious. I've told him all of my hopes and dreams. He's not ambitious, and doesn't have any dreams beyond getting married to me, having kids, and living a happy life. His career is simply not that important to him. 

Here's where I'm torn: is this a breaking point? Should it be? He's perfect in every other way except this. I love him, I care about him, and I'm afraid that I will never find someone as wonderful and accepting as he is. I just don't think that my future self, whatever she's doing, is going to be satisfied or fulfilled in a relationship with him. It's come to a point where to continue on in the relationship means giving my tacit consent for our future together. So I have to decide now.

I need advice. What should I do? How do I go about making a decision?

44,"So I'm a teenager and I know this will sound super edgy and annoying but sometimes I feel very stressed out and just mentally unwell. Usually I have a good handle on my mental health and I can get myself out of bouts of sadness or so called ""depression."" But there are times when I can't. This past weekend I've felt really, really bad. I went to a party on Friday night (my first one) and needless to say it kinda screwed me up mentally. I'll probably work through it and be fine but as for right now, I feel very vulnerable. I haven't stopped feeling stressed and anxious since Friday night. The past two nights of sleep have been terrible and I wake up feeling stressed about nothing in general. I feel lonely and confused and just am in a generally bad state. I've never felt this way before either so I'm at a loss at how to deal with it. I've been thinking over and over again at how much I could benefit from a therapist. I dont need to see one daily or even every month but it would be nice to be able to see one in times like these. Or when exam season comes around or when I'm having family struggles. It would be great to have a lifeline to go to whenever I can't deal with things. I think everyone can benefit from seeing a therapist, even if they feel mentally perfect. Its just a good thing for everyone. Just like how we go to the doctor for checkups, it's a smart thing to go to a therapist for checkups too. But my problem is that I dont have money to do so. Like I said, I'm a teenager. My parents certainly dont and I probably wont have money to spare for a therapist for years to come (with saving for post secondary and everything theres no way). I'd be fine with just an online one too. I just want someone relatively professional to be able to talk to whenever I have issues. I talk to my friends as often as possible but they have their own issues and I want to be able to talk to someone without them feeling the obligation to comfort me. I want a professional opinion, someone who can actually help me work through my problems and get to the root of them instead of just distracting me from them. But I have no money or means to do that?? Does anyone have any advice they can give me? I'm a very self aware and emotional person. I'm super in touch with myself but I just would benefit from having some help from time to time. Where can I get this??",24Sep2018,4

53,"Firstly, I want to apologize for any incoherence, I am writing this on my phone and I am agitated. I [20F] have been in a relationship with the man who I believed to be the man of my dreams, but lately I am unsure about this. We have been in a committed somewhat long distance relationship for nearly two years now. I am his first girlfriend and sexual partner although he is not my first boyfriend l, he is the only person I have ever had sexual relations with. We met online and for the first year of our relationship things went very well, unfortunately this last year things have become rather rocky. It started with stalking from a past romantic interest of his who pretended to be a different girl he was interested in high school. Later he contacted her because of me after he expressed wanting to fix things between them seeing as they live in the same area and this issue was causing great stress to him. After contacting her he later told me that he loved her and it honestly broke my heart, but I did what I could to move past it after he told me that was his depression speaking. That incident made me feel extremely insecure and I began feeling uncomfortable with the idea of him being around women, which had never been an issue before in this or any other relationship of mine. I will admit that it may have been an irrational fear. 

Shortly after this event, I found out I was seven weeks pregnant. Due to irregular periods and two methods of birth control used by us, I never realized that I was pregnant. I told him shortly after I found out because I had admitted myself to a psychiatric care facility due to suicidal thoughts I was having and a history of previous suicide attempts and depression. Immediately after telling him he accused me of lying to him about the pregnancy and it angered me that he would accuse me of this after having been told of how cheating had destroyed my family as a young teen. (I need to add that this was now the second pregnancy that had occurred between us because the previous year I had a spontaneous abortion and I did not know of the pregnancy until I took myself to the ER) That same night he threatened me with killing himself should I decide to keep it and raise it or place it for adoption after I told him I did not feel comfortable terminating the pregnancy. I have no problem with other people choosing abortion but it is not what I want to choose. He later threatened me with this same thing again twice more within the next few days but that same night that I told him, he told me that if I kept it he would sue me for sole custody and never allow me to see our hypothetical child. 

It was an error of mine but I forgave him for his comments after he apologized for this. It was a week or so after this that his stalker, who had harrassed me until I was on the brink of suicide when I discovered I was pregnant, found out I was expecting after I told her that the stress she was causing me was making me physically ill and she was endangering not only my well being but also that of the fetus due to a medical condition I have. She stopped harassing us for over a week and things were going okay for the first time in weeks until she told their mutual friends about the pregnancy using screenshots of our conversation. Later that week, my boyfriend told all of his friends who had recently met me that it was all a lie and one of them accused me of being a horrible girlfriend and a liar. That day I lost it because I had been at home with the worst morning sickness until that point. I showed her proof of the pregnancy and my boyfriend's promise to support me no matter what and she apologized to me. She was the product of a similar situation and was outraged that my boyfriend would do this and to this date she has been extremely supportive. 

This brings me back to this week. After weeks of research on every possible outcome of the situation and available resources to me, I know deep in my heart that I do not wish to abort. I know that it would likely stop me from finishing my bachelor's and prerequisites for medical school for now at least but I do not feel comfortable terminating. I would rather work full time and raise it or place it for adoption than terminate and I expressed this to him. I have given him options because I wish to include him in this decision but he has now threatened me again with killing himself because of me and my ""stupid weakness"". He has told me that he hates and will always resent this child and I should I keep it. I have told him I am willing to do anything including not suing for child support should he choose to waive his parental rights. I have tried reasoning with him but he has accused me of abuse time and time again this week because I told him I don't want to abort. He has accused me of being manipulative and horrible because I told him that I would abort should I feel  comfortable making this decision and now I do not feel comfortable. He has gone so far as to tell me that his mother, who was supportive of me when I told her I wished to choose adoption or raising it, also hates me and thinks that I am an idiot for what I am considering. I do not know if I believe him because she once accused me of being a manipulative girlfriend when I discussed my insecurities with him and that same night she told me that she supported me not choosing abortion because she was once in this same situation.

 I just am so extremely uncertain about this pregnancy and this relationship. I fell in love with what seemed like the perfect, most kindhearted, and loving man but he has become unrecognizable. We have/had plans on moving in together in a year and a half but I am so unsure. On top of things related to the pregnancy, he has taken to yelling at me when I am upset and calling me foolish for many things including not immediately reporting sexual harrassment at my school. That is a completely separate incident and that night he told me it would be my fault should I ever be sexually assaulted. Two nights ago he confessed that he was fearful he is becoming a ""rude asshole"" like his father, who his mother divorced two and a half decades ago because of extreme anger issues. Lately I have witnessed those same issues in my boyfriend and it terrifies me. I feel betrayed and fearful that he may actually commit suicide should I not terminate and I know for a fact that I am not comfortable doing so at this moment at least. I do not know what to do. Please help. ",24Sep2018,2

55,"My friend (of sorts) is a sophomore in high school, while I am currently a freshman in college. Over the past few months, she has implied that she loved me through texts (asked me if have feelings for anyone, inviting me to a winter school festival to ride the ferris wheel with her, questioning whether I was going to get married after she found out I worked in catering). I have denied her advances numerous times, stating that I am depressed myself, and that I was focusing on improving my life rather than finding love.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to this, she talked about how she had felt that everyone hated her for being annoying, how her parents were gonna yell at her for her grades, and how she had no friends to talk to at school. I knew that there was very little I could do, and that talking to her was not likely a good idea, so I always directed her to the school's social workers and counselors, but she would deny the help every time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today, she had sent me a very long text talking about the usual topics: bad grades, feeling alone, her parents being angry with her, her lack of beauty, etc. I did the usual, talked about potential resources, and that to improve her life she needed to make difficult choices (like therapy). But in that text, she said that she liked me in a somewhat vague manner. I decided not to address this immediately, but she later pointed it out. I responded by saying that I didn't feel the same way, that there was an age gap, that what she was doing was dangerous, and that she needed to turn to the right people for support. 

&amp;#x200B;

After that, she said that she was fine and that she can be sad sometimes but that she'll get over it. The last text she sent me was ""thanks for being nice"". I'm not sure if I am being overprotective, but I am extremely worried that she is going to do something drastic. I am planning contact a teacher who had her last year about this. Here's the draft so far:

Hello \[TEACHER NAME\],

I'm not sure if you remember me, but this is \[ME\], I attended your Music Appreciation class during freshman year and your Choir 1 during senior year. I am contacting you regarding a student you had last year. Her first name is \[NAME\] and her last name is \[NAME\], I believe. I need your advice on what I should do, but first I need to provide some background information:

\- She had first approached me on the day of the \[OTHER SCHOOL\] concert to talk to me, and on the bus ride there, she had expressed that she hated feeling outcasted in her family, where she is the only daughter alongside 5 other brothers.

\- She constantly feels that her classmates find her annoying and clingy. This includes her previous boyfriend, who was also in her choir class last year.

\- To my knowledge, she has very few friends, but she is in a club revolving around dance.

\- She has Ds in two classes and has told me that school is a major source of stress for her.

\- Throughout the summer, she had contacted me on occasion through texts. After graduation, I had tried to cut ties with her due to my going to college, but I still wanted her to have some way of support, so I directed her to \[SOCIAL WORKER\], the counselors, and suggested talking to a therapist.

In addition to this, very recently she had also confessed that she had romantic feels for me, to which I had responded, stating that I do not feel the same way towards her, that there is a sizable age gap between us, and that she should turn to better sources of support. I am worried that she is depressed and I don't know who to turn to.

Included are the texts she had sent to me today. Please help.

59,Even though I’m 20 I still live with my mom and dad I took two years off after Highschool and worked to save up some money. My college is 5 hours away from my house and I’ll be going next week.

61,"I will probably delete this in a few days, but I wanted your advice. Today, my dad let me borrow his phone to get the new Fortnite skin for Galaxy Note 9 owners. When I was going on his phone I saw a Kik message from a woman and the message said ""Missing you."" Nothing too crazy.

But I got curious and looked at a few other messages, making sure I didn't open the unread conversation. They are all women that he talks to on IMVU, an online chatroom that he plays in his mancave. He liked to people using pictures of food I made saying he is a great cook, and talks about f-ing them and sends erotic IMVU pics. 

My parents have been married happily for about 27 years now, and as a young adult I have no clue what to do. I don't want to just out him, but he needs a reality check. I have no clue how my mom will take it. All I know is she was engaged to another man before my dad and she ended it after he cheated.

I get a slight suspicion she knows, and my sister and I have been confident that he has been unfaithful. I just need advice and time to calm down.",24Sep2018,3

Today I just spend like 100 bucks on some books.

I believe them but I feel so conflicted...

I just can't help but feel guilty like I'm wasting money even though I have plenty of cash left over. I feel like I'm being rude to my parents even though they are fine with it...

this isn't even the first scenario. before her there was a girl i met during orchestra and we started talking a lot. one night i asked her to go to a bad movie with me so we could just laugh and make fun of it. it was fun at the time but after that night she never texted me back and doesn't talk to me anymore. is it my personality? my looks? why are so many people doing this to me? my self esteem is practically zero at this point. any advice appreciated.

67,"Today, I woke up at 10:00AM and ate breakfast and just chilled for a little bit. From 11:00AM to 7:00PM, I was playing video games, only taking breaks for lunch (which wasn't even really lunch, there was no bread to make a sandwich, so I just ate 3 graham crackers smeared with peanut butter and a cookie and a half) and dinner (which once again, wasn't that substantial, but it was definitely more substantial than lunch). This is how I spend every single day I don't have to leave my house, and I hate it. So many things suffer from it, such as:

- I don't spend a lot of time with my mom and dad. Whenever I leave the game room, they always talk about how they'd like to see me more and it always hurts. I want to, but I also want to play video games. Sometimes they'll ask me if I want to go along with them somewhere, and the answer is always no because of the video games. They usually come to the game room and knock on the door to talk to me, and they always start talking to me, but we never really ""talk"" because they always want to let me talk to whoever I'm talking to. It makes me feel really bad. Hopefully, I'll be able to bring gaming and my family together in the future sometimes, because a new Mario party game is coming out and my family likes to play those together, but that's not really a good solution. I'd still end up playing games for as long as I do, probably this time, just with my family for a small fraction of the time.

- I push back my schoolwork until the last minute on Sunday, making me tired on Monday, which makes me tired on Tuesday, etc… This one really sucks. It doesn't really affect my grades, but it does affect the way I feel and my overall quality of life.

- I don't have anything to talk about with people, really. I'm kinda cooped up in a room all day, so it's not like I ""did anything this weekend"" or have anything interesting to talk about regarding myself, although I do find ways to make conversation about other things.

- I genuinely feel sick. I don't know if it's my eating habits (I'm sure it doesn't help) or just the fact that life is less enjoyable when I reflect on the fact that I played video games all day, but something makes me feel really bad.

If anyone has any advice, it would be much appreciated. I posted something similar to this a while ago, but the responses I got didn't really help, I feel. I do enjoy gaming and talking to my friends online, I think it's a really fun pastime and I don't want to quit completely, but I definitely do need to cut back, and I don't know how. Also, I'm gonna comment some solutions that I/others came up with that didn't work for me. Thank you for reading this all if you did, I appreciate you immensely.",24Sep2018,3
68,"I've been struggling over the last few days with my relationship with a person I considered myself close with. I've been in a friendship for over 4 years with my friend that's been a bit of a struggle; they suffer from schizoaffective disorder and early on in our friendship her only brother passed away. I tried to be understandable with their issues and have been patient with them, hoping that after a few years they would naturally get out of their shell and want to make genuine effort into life. However there's always been issues with communication; I always had to set up plans for us to do something, often having to text them multiple times to get a simple confirmation despite the fact that we'd talk and agree upon things beforehand. As well I had a crush on them and would constantly have to regulate my feelings and temperament around them while being completely honest, I was always transparent to them but I truly did care about them as a friend, however I always had to force myself to look the other way whenever their mental issues came into play such as the lack of communication or them getting drunk in public and embarrassing us.


   The last year and a half have been a difficult time, mainly on myself for what I was going through and how I was handling life. My grandmother who I was close with died and I enter and exited a highly dramatic relationship all within the same month. When it was time for the funeral I asked if they could make it but I never got a direct answer, their mother had to inform me that my friend couldn't attend as they hadn't been to a service since their brother died and it could possibly cause them to have a mental breakdown. I was disappointed they couldn't show up when they would always say they'd be there if I truly needed them, on top of that I was extremely hurt when I we had to attend a funeral for a friend I had introduced to them six months prior and they were gung ho about being despite the fact I'd known them for 3 years and they weren't there for me. I was beginning to catch them in lies about not wanting to be around; they cancelled on a movie day saying they were in a dark place in their mind, however another friend showed me a text conversation where my friend said they didn't want to deal with me. The most hurtful thing was how they intergrated into my friendship circle and I began to feel phased out, they began to make plans without involving me  which I was supportive of but I could tell they just jived well with them in comparison and felt left behind. At the same time I was slowly being kicked out of my friend group as they were getting tired of my problems and how it affected them, my best friend would talk about me behind my back and discuss my mental health and therapy without referring or asking about it to me first which left me feeling betrayed and that I was becoming a gossip topic amongst my friends when I'm not around.



All of the issues cultivated in me committing suicide and ending up in a mental hospital over the summer, I was done with life and didn't want to keep losing people that I cared about. My friend did reach out and suggested we take a break, they reached out a few weeks later wanting to talk about things but I was so bitter and resentful I couldn't speak with them without breaking into a fit. I decided to communicate with them by writing a letter to them, explaining how I felt and how their issues had plaguing our friendship and how exhausted I felt. It took about two months to hear from them but we finally talked about it. They were hurt by what they said but understand where I was coming from. I told them despite my anger and resentment I wanted to work things out with them and tried to ask for a compromise, when we got to the barebones it finally came to light that they themselves resented me. While their feelings have been amplified over the last year or so due to my issues they always considered me a draining and exhausting experience, only playing around to not hurt my feelings and not wanting to add to my problems. They resented me for my kindness and how much trust I give them on top of the presents and effort I gave them. In order for our friendship to continue I have to get my issues handled but they won't change anything themselves on their end, they won't guarantee any respectful amount of communication or to see me on a somewhat regular basis. They flat out said ""once you get your shit together you can deal with me being a shitty friend, it won't matter if I come through. You'll say fuck it and do the things you want to do, me not being there won't effect your decisions"".


While I initially felt positive about our talk I became broken up by what was said. My ""best friend"" phoned in our entire friendship because they felt pity over me, and I have to do all the work to make them feel comfortable and keep their presence but they won't even lift a finger to change or accommodate me. I feel like I'm in a mindfuck, I honestly don't know what's real and what's not anymore and I just feel like killing myself. I haven't been perfect throughout this friendship, I can be obnoxious and annoying, plus admittedly I've been difficult to be around the last year. Still I genuinely cared for my friend and all the times we've spent together, they played an important part of my life the last four years to the point where they and their family where a part of my college graduation. I want to make this work so badly because I want them in my life and don't want all this time I spent with them to be in vain, but essentially they're telling me ""you need to get your shit together for yourself, but you need to expect nothing from me and be happy with what you get"" and I know for a fact that they are making genuine effort with my former circle, so why I do have to get the short end of the stick when I've been so loyal and worked so hard for them? I don't know what to do.",24Sep2018,3

72,"So I hit the gym once it opens, and so does this other guy, middle aged dude, he always uses the cables and only does purely cable workouts. On back days, when I do seated cable rows the guy always put his water bottle near the top of my feet, and when i'm doing my sets the guy comes in and gets the water bottle drinks and puts it back towards the top of my feet in the midsts of my sets. I find it not only incredibly distracting but disrespectful to me as well. 

I've already snapped at him as nicely as I could, ""PLEASE put your water bottle somewhere else, it's really distracting."" 

Then he said ""what? you mean this? ok"" and he moved it to the lat pulldown machine and he doesn't even use that either. 

After that day he still continues to put it on equipment he's not even using. Even the equipment i'm using still. 

It's hard to explain without actually being there... It's like someone putting a towel on equipment he's not even going to use, or on equipment that someone is using, and like using it to wipe himself then putting it back. 

What would you guys do? I'm thinking about telling him again that it's disrespectful and that he's not even using the equipment... I'm also thinking about pissing him off too and occupying the cables every day. It doesn't make any sense why he can't just leave his water bottle on the floor.

74,"I share an apartment with a few girls. Am not close with them, but we make small talk and generally get along.



Once I was walking from the bathroom to my room because I forgot to get my showering slippers. I only had on a long t-shirt and undies as I had already undressed and didn’t feel like putting on pants just for the four-second walk to my bedroom. The shirt was long enough to cover my ass so I didn’t think it was a big deal if anyone even noticed. 



Two girls are having a conversation in the living room and I hear one of them whisper, kind of loudly and meanly, “is she wearing pants?” And the other says “no” and changes the subject. 


I wouldn’t be so bothered except this isn’t the first time something like this has happened. Once the same girl complained (again badly whispering) about me not doing my dishes - they weren’t even my dishes in the sink - to the girl whose dishes they actually were - while I was doing my work about 8 ft away.

75,"*Please excuse my grammar or sentence structuring, my brain is beyond foggy.*

*This is difficult to put into words. Please bear with me. So, I'm a female, in my early 20's. I was a fairly active person, never really drank or did substances.*

For for the last year and a half I have been going through so much testing and trying multiple medications that did nothing for me. I have had no luck with medications and when doctors found anything slightly abnormal from previous tests eg. CT scans, ultra sounds, colonoscopies, they just waved it off.. The doctors in the beginning of it all had tested me for gluten, dairy intolerance kinds of things. They all came back great. They were constantly taking blood and testing to see how my organs were functioning. They told me everything looked good. Near Christmas they thought maybe my thyroid was out of whack and had me take hypothyroid meds at a low dose.. which only made me worse. They dropped the thyroid idea and for months just kept doing tests. At the beginning ish of this year they then wondered if it was IBS but my symptoms don't quite match.. foods don't really have anything to do with how I am feeling. My older sister brought to my attention the condition known as Lupus. I mentioned it to the doctors, but they were so attached to the idea of IBS, they dropped it. I dont get a butterfly rash on my face so apparently that means I cant have it which isnt entirely true. The doctors have now basically said because we cant find anything we think you should see a counselor/therapist. After all these tests and nearly a year of not being healthy or able enough to work I might have to TRY to work. I am living at my parents again because I have no income. My parents, especially my dad, are frustrated with me because the doctors have found nothing for closure. I am going to see a psychiatrist, hopefully they will have answers for my mental health because I know that's a problem. But this isn't all in my head, I know there isn't something right with my body.

I plan on requesting to see a rheumatologist again, but have only been referred to a gastroenterologist. The colonoscopy came back healthy. Seeing that specialist did nothing but clear the table of some ideas the doctors had for diagnoses. I had a CT scan and ultrasound done on my torso and pelvic area. The lymph nodes in my stomach are swollen and apparently are still swelling slowly but the doctors have concluded it's not an alarming size of swelling. I had several tests that came back perfectly fine, dont get me wrong. It was just things that were not out of the ordinary to find.

So in June of last year I started to experience a very uncomfortable pain in my right side. The best I can explain is my kidney/liver. It hurt all the time, especially when leaned right. Like a constant squeezing sharp pain. Didn't matter if I laid down, I always felt this discomfort. The doctor pushed around on my stomach and the pain on my right side nearly brought me to tears. I have a high pain tolerance so this just seemed so wrong right away. The doctor figured it was a kidney infection and prescribed antibiotics. I had a full body hive allergic reaction to those meds and that seemed to ignite a TON of allergies that did not exist before hand. Low and behold it wasnt a kidney infection, I've had this pain since it appeared to me in June of last year. Except now it it comes and goes but the discomfort is always there. I'm just going to try to list symptoms I constantly or most often experience. I do believe some of these are attached to my mental health but definitely not all of them.

Lathargic
Low BP, drops constantly. No matter what I do.
If I stand for a while the blood pools in my legs and feet
Numbness/Tingling in my limbs way too often
Dizziness/Vertigo
Extreme Insomnia
Side pain which has no traveled from my kidney region to my appendix all the way to my right ovary. The pain has now spread over the year and that's just how the pain comes to me.
Rashes/hives nearly everyday
Extreme foggy mind
Memory loss
Lymph nodes in me neck flare up so often
Constipation/Loose bowels, but not all the time.
Body aches/pains, feels like growing pains but just to the extreme, like being hit by a truck
(this has been for years)
Nausea, EVERY DAY
With nausea comes lose of appetite
Headaches to migraines
Raynauds
Regular UTI's/Kidney infections.

I dont fucking know.. My brain feels like it is about to combust trying to recall the past year. I am currently dealing with a kidney infection. I literally had one at the end of June of this year.. just over 2 months ago.. I truly believe something isnt right. I'm getting to the point where I do not care what it is wrong I just want a damn answer. I cant fit everything that has happened or been thought over in this post so if there's a comment where I've already gone over the possibilities, I will go more into detail. I'm just so done, I can't see a future for myself anymore. I hate feeling and being like this and having my family judge me. My older sister feels like she is the only one supporting me out of my massive family. Everyone is just blaming my mental health. My dad constantly jokes, calling me a hypochondriac. I just want an answer or an idea of where to look now. I want to be tested for Lupus and other autoimmune diseases. I have a spirometry test in October for my lungs/respiratory. I had an allergy test, nothing came back from it.. I'm at a breaking point. Please, if you can, I need advice on what the hell to do.

TIA for reading this novel, even if you don't comment. I wish more people could understand how difficult it is to be in this position. Any advice is greatly appreciated. I dont know who to go to anymore for advice.

80,"Stranded while traveling across country in Colorado springs. Wallet was stolen and we kept cash only for the trip unfortunately.  We have very little family and they cannot offer any assistance within their means. Heading back east to stay with family so we can establish ourselves there. We had enough money for the entire trip and nothing else, no savings, credit cards, nothing.
Been sleeping in our vehicle at Walmart since Friday night and of course there's no services over the weekend. I'm sure there's homeless shelters but we aren't trying to stay here. My wife's kids are back where we are heading and she's desperately trying to get there sooner versus later since she hasn't seen them in a very long time while trying to establish herself in Montana. Too expensive to make it and bring her kids our so we're moving back there.
 Any suggestions other than going to a homeless shelter and getting employment. I mean I understand it may come to that but we seriously don't want to be stuck here for weeks looking for a job and waiting on a paycheck. And besides we are riding on fumes as it is so not much of a chance to drive around pounding the streets.
 We got so desperate yesterday we threw a sign up on our car saying we were stranded without any gas in a large Walmart parking lot (yes I know they don't like that) 
One person gave us some a few dollars but we got some bread and peanut butter with it.
Today I decided to try our luck again. 8 hours from early this morning and we got 2$ from one person and a bottle of hot water for our dog from another.
 We have a very nice car, out of state plates and it obviously looks like we're traveling. We aren't panhandlers and I never imagined lowering myself to this level but right now it's the only option I have came up with. Very very embarrassing and humbling.
Today also Walmart staff said we had to go or remove the sign which said ""vet stranded, wallet stolen"", they said we were panhandling which I don't understand because unless they think it's implied soliciting, I don't know.
We explained the situation to them and we obviously don't look like the typical panhandler.
I even asked if I could clean the entire parking lot for a few bucks. No response. No suggestions, just sorry about that.

People weren't even asking us if we were ok or not. Had the hood up on our Subaru as my dad taught me long ago it was the universal sign for distress on the road. No one batted an eye. I figured someone would have at least asked if we needed a jump or something. This has been a real eye opener.

Anyways after Walmart made us take the sign down I got really really desperate and decided to say screw them and walk off their property and stand on the street corner which they do not own. They got visibly pissed about this but I was not on the property.  Standing on the corner holding a sign was the hardest thing I've ever done, I had to swallow every ounce of my pride and felt extremely shameful. 
My wife's also a gulf war vet. Not sure about assistance in that area either.

I know people don't owe us anything, nor should we expect it. But I always help people when I can if I have the ability and it just saddens me people didn't even care enough just to say ""hey man you guys alright, need some water?""

I guess I expect to much from people.
This situation could happen to anyone.

Maybe someone in this subreddit might live near here and know of an agency close by (remember we're on fumes) that might be able to help us.

I did the only thing I knew and took her to the ER today and got her two days dose.
She's been off of it five days and it's wrecked her. It's been hard on me being there for her as well with these withdrawals.

Sorry for the long post as I needed to detail the whole situation. 
Any suggestions would be appreciated.
At this point it would be absolutely heaven to pitch our tent somewhere to stretch out and sleep and just to shower. Man it's the little things I tell ya.

83,"VENT WARNING: Okay, so my school usually starts at 7:15 but i have jazz band as homeroom, so I usually come in and warm up around 6:55. I feel like I don't get enough sleep, my sleep usually is about 10:30-11:00 pm until 5:30. I normally drink coffee or black tea in the morning but I still have the grey bags under my eyes, and I always lose focus, and often fall asleep in class. That is only half of the problem. I also keep getting B- grades, I really want A-'s at least because I plan to attend college. When I ask my teacher, she/he usually just says, to be more optimistic about a topic or to do extra credit. I always get mad when they say this. Why do I have to be more ""optimistic"" about a topic, I never want to get a job in, and is also taught in the least pragmatic or somewhat interesting way? And also what's with those annoying as buzzwords you keep shoving down my throat, open mindset, your imaginary ""technology integration"" with our 40 laptops from 2009 running Windows 7 that the whole entire school has to share , your useless brain breaks that make me fucking dance or some shit. those stupid quotes on the wall... Do you think I am going to change my lifestyle for some godamn laminated piece of paper on the wall?,  I hope I don't sound like I'm just in a ""Teen Rebel""  phase, but It just makes me mad. I've decided that to combat this, I want to do some extra curricular or out of school activities. I've joined the Italian 101 club, and I am learning programming in my free time. But that doesn't stop me from thinking I am just an uncreative person who just does the bare minimum in school. I also believe I am a huge procrastinator, if I have homework to do over the weekend, it won't be done until 10:30 on Sunday night. I'd so much rather take my dog to the park or watch TV instead of doing homework. I always argue to my parents as well about all kinds of things, I don't know why... I just say the absolute stupidest things, and It's like subconscious. I know I will never win, why do I keep trying... PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANNA HEAR VENT: I just feel so useless right now, like I'm stuck in this stupid cycle that will lead me to be a failure if I break. The hardest part about the whole thing is that I convince my self I will do something positive, but always fail to do so. I promise to improvise my own solo in Jazz band, I don't do it.

85,"This is related to my last two posts in my post history. This friend is constantly emotionally draining me. She says things like “ HI IM INVALID!!!! “ and things along that nature. She also has BPD. It’s getting to the point where I don’t even want to talk to her anymore. Even if I say something that’s upsetting me, she’ll think I hate her as a whole.

 I don’t know what to do or say to her anymore. She’s also overly sensitive (even though I mentioned that before and didn’t go into any detail). The reasons why she’s overly sensitive is, she’ll basically see something that’ll mildly upset her, but then go on a whole other level and just rant about it for a good hour or so. Then she’ll make her friends feel guilty, and it ultimately ends up on my shoulders. 

I don’t wanna be rude to her or anything, but this is wearing me out and I just need advice on how to handle this person. Do I block her, unfriend her, or block her messages until I’m mentally ready to talk to her again? ",24Sep2018,1

When the lady scans the textbook she tells you if you owe any other textbook or books and told me I owed an accounting textbook. I was confused because I thought the only book I owed was the social studies one in my room but turns out I supposively don’t own that and I owe an accounting one. The catch is the teacher for the business law class and the accounting class are the same person and when the librarian told me I owed an accounting textbook he asked her how much it was in a smooth way. This shocked me because in my head my thought was “he knows that book is gone”. But let me mention we kept that accounting book in the classroom and on the last day I wasn’t in class when they returned the textboooks.

I'm nearly 35, single female. I make basically a bit over minimum wage...I had a good job once, but anxiety helped me blow that one.

I blame my looks for being single, I'm average looking and guys dont notice me. I think if I had a partner I could get out of my parents house - but is that a bad reason to be looking? I would like someone to spend life with, but I dont believe anyone could love me.

I was like ""Well, this is bait for sure"", so I keep the conversation a bit, telling her that I thought it was bait and that she should send them to MY number instead which she refused to....

Nope, actually got some nudes, then I was like ""These must've been google'd"". Then she calls my number in a video-call, and it was actually legit.

I told her ""Well shit I was never actually sent a nude pack wtf"" and she said ""Your life is sad. We can fuck idk"". Me: :O

96,"Alright, I'm going to start this post by saying two things:

Firstly, I AM NOT ASKING FOR ADVICE ON GETTING THE PROCEDURE DONE!! I have already decided I'm going to get it, and I have my reasons. So please, if you came to this post to try and tell me I should love myself the way I am, I shouldn't get it done, I'd be mutilating myself, blah, blah, blah just save it. It'll be falling on deaf ears. Also if you feel the need to bash anyone who wants to, or has gotten plastic surgery, take that negativity else where. I understand that every one has their own beliefs and opinions, and I respect that. Please respect my beliefs and opinions in this post as well.

Secondly, I am by NO MEANS saying that I would be, or need to ask permission from my boyfriend, or anyone else in this post. 

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, with that out of the way, lets get to the meaty parts of this post.

I am planning on getting labiaplasty (for anyone who doesn't know, generally speaking, it's a procedure where the labia minora - or inner lips- of the vagina are removed) I have decided year ago that I was going to get it done. Basically ever since I found out this procedure existed. Well anyway I've never told anyone about wanting this procedure done, not even my boyfriend. I'm not embarrassed and self couscous to talk about it with anyone. I have never told my boyfriend how much this bothers me and how greatly it impacts my self image. I don't even think he knows that its a area of concern for me, so naturally he doesn't know I'm planning on getting this procedure, he doesn't know I'm in contact with a plastic surgeon, I don't eve know if he knows what a labiaplasty is.

&amp;#x200B;

My concern is whether or not I should talk to him about it before getting it done. I'm sure it would be quite a shock for him to be getting ready to go down on me and then BAM!! New vagina (Not literally, but aesthetically) Also I feel like the fact that we couldn't have sex during the healing process would raise some major red flags, seeing as I have a very high sex drive. I know the fact that I got it done, will come to light at some point, I just don't know if it would be best for it to come out before or after and I wanted opinions on that. ",24Sep2018,1

I’ve decided to go to university, and although it’s been hard I feel good, like I’m putting in effort for something that’s actually beneficial. And I love learning. Due to having depression and anxiety, I’ve been scared up until now to go to school, but am on medication now and finally feel ready.

People have been discouraging though. Friends and family. They tell me I’m wasting my time getting an arts/science bachelor degree, that’s there’s no jobs there, and that if I want to go to school I should just go for a trade for 1 or 2 years. Or I should just not go at all and getting an office or receptionist job if I hate waitressing so much.

Its disappointing because I do want to get a bachelors degree, but a part of me wonders if they’re right. Am I wasting time and money for something that probably won’t get me a high paying job? I’d ideally even want to get a masters after, but I’m not sure if I’ll get good enough grades for that, and that would mean I’d probably be broke for my 30s.

I never graduated high school mainly because I didn’t want to show up and I knew  that I didn’t need a high school diploma to attend community college. So I was going to get my ged, go through college as a history major and become a highschool teacher, which still is my dream. I started attending community college while working part time at a fast food chain and I dropped out of my first semester mostly because of transportation issues. In the time period before the next semester would start I got a car which I’m financing for three years and I signed up for spring classes. Into my second semester I dropped out again I’d say because I was lazy and didn’t want to wake up early. After dropping out once again I decided to get a new job which is part time and go from there. That was April of this year and since then I’ve really not done much. My plan is to go back to school again but really go full throttle at it but I’m not so sure as of late. The reason for this is because about a week ago I finally took the ged Test and I passed with flying colors but I want to move out of my parents house, they don’t mind me but I just feel like I should. This would require a full time job and if I were to get a full time job I would imagine it’d be very difficult to go to school at the same time. My dad and my grandmother have suggested that I apply at the company they work for which is full time and would end up probably netting me around 40,000 a year at the peak. Some motivation for me to go back to school right now is that I now qualify for fasfa since I have a ged and it would help a lot with gas, books, and paying off my car.

I used to work for the family business but have decided to go on my own path and got a job working somewhere else. His family and I have always had a good relationship and I help out with their work when I can - on top of the job I am currently working full-time at.

Just for some background info (feel free to skip to the story)- I’m [M] pretty much, at this point, a virgin, though I did have a girlfriend about a year ago, however, I have been presented with other opportunities. I’m straight, but I’ve had some weird moments that left me scratching my head (especially this one). As far a confidence goes, I have my ups and down (mostly downs, but that’s a whole different story) and I think that’s effected my romantic life a lot seeing as it’s non existent. I tend to overthink stuff so this might all not really be a big deal..

The _incident_

So last night I went to a small party at a friends house and everyone was there I would’ve expected, plus some new people. This particular guy, who I hadn’t seen in a few years, was a mutual friend who brought his girlfriend with him who I’d never met and was really attractive. I didn’t think much of them at first. As the night went on I noticed the guy was coming on to me, however, I thought most of the comments as jokes and shit. We (me and the couple) went out to get drinks and he insisted that I come with them and that I sit next to him in the car. We just talked and he asked me if I was interested on joining a music group or something, then made a few more unusual comments about threesomes and shit like that. Later, I found out that both of them are bi, and then it clicked in my head. Somehow we ended up playing spin the bottle like a bunch of twelve-year-olds, and whenever this guy got the bottle he wanted to keep spinning until the bottle landed on me... After about midnight people were leaving when the girl asked for my snap before semi-jokingly asking to have a threesome with me again. (She sent me nudes today when I was at work)  I slowly realized I kind of liked the attention from that guy and his girlfriend and was seriously thinking about that “offer.” I never felt like this  before so it left me messed up all day. I guess I’m bi or something because I _really_ liked the attention from this guy. I’m all fucked up about this and I’d like some advise. Maybe it’s from a lack of a romantic life and I’m desperate, or some repressed shit just exploded in my mind all at once...

108,"Backstory in bold, asking for advice type directly not in bold

**First I will say I am in a very privileged position so sorry if this sounds whiny.**

**I work a job making pretty good money (I teach at a community college), I'm a 38 year old woman, and I've hated work ever since my parents had me do chores as a little kid. I've never had a dream job, I've never even known ""what I want to be when I grow up"" because I don't associate myself with my work. I've had this job for quite a few years now, but in my teens and 20s I had many jobs. This job I hate a little less than those other ones but I've hated every single one of them.** 

**Work is tiring, I can't stand the alarm clock, my feet are sore from teaching on my feet all day, and I've been feeling depressed since starting the school year.** 

**I've pretty much always felt like this. I've never wanted to go in to work or have a job. I always live for the weekend and vacations. I hate all paid work, the idea that as an adult human being some other adult human being who I don't even know can tell me what to do, where to be, how to dress, how to act, and so on.**

**In my work I try my best not to take it out on my students. I try to educate them as best I can and I put on a smile for work, and am engaged with them as much as I can. It's not their fault and it would be wrong to take it out on them. Actually, I'm even good at it. I get good reviews from both my students and managers. Hell, that part of the job is not the worst. Worse things: meetings, hopes I have to jump through with management and to keep my license, getting yelled at my management (college students often make up stories, and my bosses for some reason always take them as 100% true, yell at me, I tell them it's not true, then we we move on), feeling tired after work, and just the feeling of ""crap, I have to go to work tomorrow or later today and that's going to shoot part or most of the day but I want to finish the home project today (or get more exercise in or finish this level in a video game or something that work ruins).**

**I discovered something about 8 years ago called FIRE (financial independence and retiring early) which is accomplished by saving a lot of your money. My girlfriend and I are DINKS so this makes it much easier to save and the fact that my position pays better than the median also does. That's why I'm in the privileged position.**

**I still can't help but feel like shit about work even though at my current saving rate, retirement is ""only"" about six years away and I've asked many times for advice, but never get anything I find to be good.**

100% of the time I get one or some or all of the following:

""Get a job you like"" - well, I don't like paid work period? This is sadly probably the most tolerable job for me too, especially in terms of the balance between pay and relative enjoyment/lack of pain.

""Start a business, you're not cut out for working for others"" My biggest problem here is I'm addicted to saving money so I can retire early, so if I start a business and it fails or just barely pays the bills, well then I have to put off my retirement until I'm 55 or so (that's when compound interest would have enough time with no new contributions to make me financially independent). 

""Quit your job and take time off for yourself"" I don't want to dip into my savings, because it will delay being free from having to work. 

What are you going to do in retirement? You'll be bored"" No I don't think so. Even just staying at home and doing nothing at all makes me feel so much better than going to work. 

Given it's only about 6 years until I'm done, it seems like the only thing I can do is ""suck it up"" but it still seems so far away. How the hell do I feel not stuck? I daydream about the day I can walk out the door, but I want that day to be now.",24Sep2018,0

A couple weeks ago my girlfriend’s mom’s mom had cancer that came back and ledger her in rough shape for about a week. Naturally she went to go take care of her. She has since got a lot better and is almost completely able to take care of herself. For the longest time I thought that is why she was acting weird. That wasn’t the case. 

Earlier today after I got off work I went to go pick up my girl’s sister (the one that is close to her mom). We coincidentally got on the subject of her mom and how it upset my girlfriend and the other sister. It legitimately make them break down and cry on a daily basis. I mentioned that I thought something “fishy” was going on like cheating... She slipped up and told me that she was but isn’t now but didn’t go into details.

But she has a very bad habit that actually makes me question of friendships at times.

When she is either not in the mood to talk via text, she won't respond at all. Granted, usually last for a day but sometimes it makes me think I did something wrong. So I have to sit her down and talk to her and see what is up, and she apologizes. 

Maybe my fault was saying it is okay, because it isn't anymore. 

It has been a month now. I actually thought our friendship was over because she is blatantly ignoring my texts and calls. Had to talk to her brother and he told me her situation, and it doesn't even seem that bad that she can't talk with me. He had talked to her for me and he tells me that she said I said nothing and that she is dealing with life stuff.

Thing is she seems extremely fine around her brother and since we don't share mutual friends (at least mutual friends that talk with her too), so I don't know if she just not talking with me.

Just asking how to cope for now.

114,"I have a civics class. and in this class there is this girl that sits right across from my group, diagonal from the group of 4 I sit in. Every so often I always see from the corner of my eye her looking at me. Even when I answer a question, she literally looks at me, but when someone else answers something she doesn’t look at them. 

I’m a pretty ugly individual and I never talked to her before so her liking me was out of the question. Plus, if she did, she probably would have started up a conversation by now. 

The only thing I can think of is she hates me.  But I never seen her or had a class with her until this semester.

121,"Please bear with me as this may get long. 

I have recently learned that my 10 year old brother is having suicidal ideation. Now, he had mentioned a few times around the age of 7 that he wanted to end his life and I figured my parents would have gotten him help (I'm out of the house). Apparently this hasn't happened and his thoughts have come back. Today there was a family emergency and during the yelling panic, my brother ran off and hid from everyone. The family was convinced he was a possible danger to himself (this is all news to me). They found him within 20 minutes and he was fine, but obviously shaken. 

I have told my mom that she needs to get him to a therapist or psychiatrist asap for his suicidal thoughts. She agreed, but I honestly don't know if she will follow through. My father is very controlling and my mom pretty much won't do anything unless he agrees and tells her to. He didn't do anything when my brother was 7, and I don't think he has plans for him now. My father is a therapist and so you would think he would have had my brother in treatment since the first time he mentioned wanting to kill himself. No plans are in the works for my brother as far as I know. My mom has said she is keeping a close eye on my brother and is trying to make him feel loved and included, but that's about as far as it is going. 

I also found out today that my mom has been suicidal on an off for most of her life. She has suffered so many horrific things throughout her life so it's not surprising, but it is still alarming to hear. She also told me that another one of my brothers (now out of the house) was also suicidal at a young age. So I'm pretty worried that the rest of my siblings who live at home (3 sisters, 1 other brother) may follow in those steps. None of them show any signs of it as far as I know, but I'm not there to evaluate. I have told my mom to seek professional help for not only my brother, but for herself as well. I'm worried she won't though since my father said she needs to face her fears and avoids talk of therapy as far as I know. My mom and I can only talk about these topics when my father is away and that is not too often.

I personally see a therapist for many reasons (some being childhood family issues) and am going to mention all of this to him as well. In the mean time though, is there anything in particular I should be doing? Is there any way that I can help them? I don't know if there are programs that I should be referring them to, or hotlines for kids with these thoughts? Are there officials I'm supposed to be informing about this? I don't want to cause additional harm to the household or my family members, but I do want them to be helped. I don't think my mom is suicidal anymore but she is reliving a lot of trauma through dreams and flash backs lately due to moving back to her childhood house where abuse flourished. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated. I feel like it is up to me to get them all help as they are apparently not getting it. If there is another sub that would be better suited for this as well, please let me know. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this!",24Sep2018,1
122,"I live in California and both my parents smoke pot. I am not very good at organizing my thoughts. I have the fact that they smoke.

123,"Like the title says, I just need someone to say that I'm going to make it.  


I literally have no one in my life who genuinely cares.  My family seemly only wants me around so I can pay bills and stuff.  I have no friends.  College is going terrible because of how much I have to work to survive.  Nobody supports anything I want to do.  I can't focus on anything.  I can't stand doing any of my hobbies I loved to do in the past.  And, to top it off, I feel like I totally ruined the only thing that made me happy, my ex-girlfriend.


I have nothing to show for in my life.  At 21, I have done pretty much nothing.  I started working in 8th grade, pretty much everyday after school at my parents store, which they pretty much forced me to work at.  This didn't leave me anytime to have friends or do anything fun outside of school.  It hardly allowed me to do my homework on time.  All throughout high school, I literally didn't hangout with anyone outside of school so I never founded any lasting friendships.  I didn't get invited to any parties or anything even though I eventually became the football star at school.  I couldn't land the girl I liked.  At least I had work to look forward to.

College sucks.  I was recruited to play football in college, but I felt it would be best not to because of injuries.  Instead I went for the practical choice of begin forced into a career that my parents thought I'd love.  Nuclear Engineering.  I might have been smart in high school, but that was  before all the head injuries and drugs I used to cope with living.  I can't follow any of it anymore.  But my parents are hell bent that I stick with the classes even though I'm practically failing all of them.  Still, I have no friends. 
 No social skills. No family who wants to actively listen to me.  Oh, at least I have work to look forward to.  

The one time that I ever have felt happy through all of this was when I was dating this girl.  She was a godsend.  Perfect in every way.  She made me forget how miserable my life truly is.  She really cared for me.  She listened and put up with my bullshit more than anyone else.  Just being near her made me the happiest man in the world, even though I knew, and she knew, that outside of our time together, I was miserably depressed.
 
The only problem came was that she had to move away.  When we broke up, it killed me.  No only because I would miss out on begin with this awesome person, but because we would still have some time left to spend with each other before she left for good.  I damn near moved away (ran away) to be with her.  This killed me on the inside.  Going from being the happiest man in the world to crashing down to the nothingness that I came from in an instant.  My life went back to the yelling at home.  The shitty job.  The failures at school. No friends. No family. Nothing.  I crashed hard.  I went back to this dark place that I have been skulking around for so long that I though I was out of.  I didn't want her to leave.  I loved that feeling of bliss; the happiness that I felt around her; this comfort that I've never felt before.  I found who I really was and I didn't want to lose that feeling.  I didn't want to lose myself. 

She was the only person who supported me.  The only person who cared for me.  And now I'm all alone.  Again.  I don't know if I can handle it anymore.  I feel all this potential in me but I have no motivation do do anything.  I don't have anyone to share these feelings with anymore, and no one to ask for guidance.  

I honestly have no idea what to do in my life  anymore.  I've tried to do the things I want to do, but they all have failed: football, new job, actual friends, the girl, moving out, volunteering (I was denied by a bunch of different volunteer groups because I ""don't meet minimum qualifications""), army, starting a band (x2).

Pretty much everything I've tried to do for myself has failed.  I've seen and felt what it is like to be on top of the world, living and loving life.  I want to get to that again.  I don't want to give up on living, but I have no motivation to keep going.  I guess I need someone to help me out.  Say that I'm going to be okay.

Things have been kind of hard for me because I had to put my cat down a few days ago and I had 2 family members die recently. I also have a lot going on on a daily basis because of extracurricular activities. He recently told me that he's been feeling left behind because of how busy I am.

Anyways, earlier we got into a fight on call over something stupid: The Kavanaugh Allegations. We were talking about the Supreme Court and he and I have different political views. I'm more moderate, but a feminist, and he's a republican and doesn't really like feminists and doesn't believe that things are still unequal. He and I got into a huge argument and it ended with him getting pissed and throwing his phone so hard that it cracked the inside despite having a good case on it. He also threw his glasses so hard that they bent and he was yelling at me and blaming me for provoking him.

When he told his dad about his broken phone, he dad warned him that it could his actions could be seen as domestic violence or domestic abuse. That was a huge wakeup call for him, and he apologized and felt horrible for a bit. However, I can't get one thing off my mind.

140,"Ok, so I work at a typical fast casual restaurant. I'm not the perfect employee but I think I land within the realm of the ""usual"" especially among the rest of my coworkers. I culturally don't fit in all that well with my coworkers however, but I'm still respectful essentially.

I have one coworker who will say anything offensive at any point with no regard for just about anything. The big ones that I've lost my cool on them for are making jokes about raping children (and then refusing to stop when prompted), repeated racism against specifically black people including direct use of slurs and most recently, actually attempting to defend Hitler and Nazis. He also routinely gets upset when called out for these things and reacts particularly nasty when it's one of the women in the store calling them every rude name in the book. This is literally the tip of the iceberg too. These are not isolated incidents, this is something that happens routinely every single day. He literally can't go 30 minutes without using some slur or other offensive comment. Some less severe than others. I'm not exaggerating. If anything, I'm making it sound better than it is. 

Every single supervisor that is in the store every single day is aware of this to one length or another and obviously, they all pretty much do nothing. They attempt to keep the peace mostly because obviously, I am not the first person that it has upset.

I finally just completely lost my cool after the whole Nazi thing (all of this unfolded directly in front of a supervisor mind you, including his offensive comment). I was sort of being framed as being in the wrong here for just simply having enough of it. I probably could've handled it better, but it's really not my job to handle it at all. It should've been handled by a supervisor months (or probably years ago).

After it got flipped on me, I asked for a higher superior's contact information with the intent of A. defending my job and B. to handle it once and for all because it's just gone too far.

The problem I'm faced with is either I go back and face the fallout of this chaotic event but just ignore it essentially and hope it works itself out or I go proactive but then I will probably face hostility from my coworkers and superiors for doing something the rest of them obviously have not wanted to do.

What do y'all think? I don't really care about the job but I'd prefer not to have to figure something else out. You know? I think I'm probably screwed either way so should I just follow through and make my last move one to teach this dude a lesson?

I can barely walk, and I’ll never be able to without a double hip replacement. I also don’t have insurance because I’m an idiot and I let things get really bad after I left my job. BTW I’m in Massachusetts.

144,"Hi all, long time reader of reddit, but first time poster.

&amp;#x200B;

For two years now, I have been questioning why I chose IT as a career. I myself don't remember when I actually decided to pursue it. It first dawned on me during my first co-op job, about a year into post secondary school. I started as a Help Desk Technician for a company in Vancouver. The first few weeks were actually okay, I seemed to catch on well, and did pretty well for myself. It was actually a one year term with the company, but after a month, I found myself to really despise waking up and going in to work. At first I thought it was normal, but I slowly realized I was often bored, uninspired, and just plain uninterested i the work I was doing. I didn't really get along with any of my co-workers, I found them to be very different people from me. I found this was the case at school too. Who knows, maybe that should have been my first clue?  After about 3 months, I told them I wasn't going to do the full year term with them, and I just finished one fall term with them. I went back to school and did another years worth of courses.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, I found another IT Support job, doing similar work. I actually liked this one for much longer, and stayed with them for almost 2 years. However, the latter half of those two years was really painful. I would literally wake up every day and just go through the motions... it was like I was a robot or something. Don't get me wrong, the money was actually pretty good (I was only 20 years old and living with my 'rents still), but something was off. I went home everyday feeling unfulfilled and unhappy. I really only got happy on Friday, when it was time for the weekend. I still continued down this path though, because I thought it was only one area of IT (support), and my end goal was to do something like security or database administration. The position only actually ended because I ended up getting laid off, something to do with the owners of said company wanting to cut down on IT expenses. I don't really believe that though, it was probably me just not doing enough in my role. Did I want to do more? Yes, but again, I wasn't really motivated to do much of anything.

&amp;#x200B;

After that job, I started looking for other similar jobs. I thought maybe it would be different working for a place I really wanted to work for. I finally found a job with a fantastic company (I won't say the name for personal reasons), but it is a great company. The pay is MUCH better than the previous company and growth opportunities are plentiful. I started about 4 weeks ago and I already find my self wondering if I made another mistake. This time I can't even find one thing wrong with the company, or my co-workers. Only thing I find is myself dreading to go into work the next day. Every night. I can't picture myself moving up in the IT industry or even liking any area of specialization, which was once my goal. It's kind of hard to work hard at something when you don't even know what you want.

&amp;#x200B;

I've come to the realization that I will never truly be passionate about IT, but it's something I've done now for three years, and just recently graduated from my degree program. What do you guys all think? Am I just a complainer who refuses to put any work and effort into things, or is this a prime example of someone who just chose the wrong career path? The only reason I ask the internet is that I have no idea what I would do if I did actually quit IT and start something else. If I knew what I wanted, I would have done it probably one or two years ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions, thoughts, ideas are welcome. Just really stuck and unsure of what to do next.",24Sep2018,1
145,"I am a senior in high school who is decently sociable, but can also hold up at times. Essentially I met this girl in 9th grade and was immediately enthralled with her. Throughout the next two years we became closer and closer: the ultimate platonic friends. I slowly was increasing in my feelings for her but it was obvious they were not being reciprocated.  During the end of my first quarter of junior year we had a huge falling out, admittedly my fault. She ceased all communication and we had not spoke. I’m several months. Fast forward a bit and we are in a school trip to Costa Rica. A few of the people on the trip, 3 girls and 3 guys myself included get into a hot tub. Like middle schoolers a game of spin the bottle commenced. A few round in the bottle lands on me and the girl and there was a definite pause of hostility and awkwardness. We kissed anyway to get it over with and due to certain hotel restrictions the night came to an early close.  In the next few days me and the girl started talking again as if nothing had ever happened. Non surprisingly however when we got back to the states she continued ignoring me.  I personally felt that I was over the girl but now I don’t know. She is talking to another guy which sucks but hey everyone has to move on. Any advice on how to get over her?",24Sep2018,2

She literally hasn't told *anyone* about this, I was the first to know. She didn't tell her parents when it happened because she didn't know what really happened. I've asked her to tell her parents or someone but she doesn't want them worrying. She is one of those girls who won't give up, so trying to get her to tell someone won't work.

I wouldn't miss the school and I'd homeschool through online academies. I already have a friend from here that's also homeschooled, and I could ask him for advice, but he's from Britain, so I can only talk to him after 3 pm my time.

So I need to ask, what can I do? I know that I want this, but I'm really nervous since I already took exams for this year, and there's two major tests coming up in October and November; I'm worried that I won't have motivation to continue after a few sessions; I might destroy my social life and finally my parents are quite conservative and I don't think they'd accept this.

151,"Hi, kinda late at night post. I’m not sure where to start. 

I’m not sure what I’m feeling. I know anxiety is bunched up in it because I know how anxiety feels but this feels like a whole lot more. I think I know about what but I may be wrong to be honest, I don’t even know what to think.. 

Okay so this might be long. Gonna try to shorten it as much as possible. I’m a male 19 years old. I have been abused by my parents for such a long time. For the longest time I had a combination of mental illnesses. Depression was one of them. I dealt with them about a year ago. I mean, I’m so fucking proud of myself, I’ve accomplished so much. 

About a month ago-1.5 months I started the process of enlisting in the Marines. It’s something I’ve always wanted but at the time it wasn’t possible. I already have my ship date but I’m trying to get out as soon as possible (still living with my parents) every Monday I’m supposed to be ready to ship out at an hour notice, just in case a spot opens up. 

Anyway, idfk what I’m feeling. My life is finally good and I’m happy or at least I think I am? But yeah I don’t know how to describe it. I tired watching Netflix and for like 2 hours I was able to forget about the feeling but it was still in the back of my mind. Right now I’m really sleepy but again, that stupid feeling is there. 

I know anxiety is one of the feelings but I’m not sure what I’m anxious about. ",24Sep2018,1

156,"My mother is 55 and she's sort of been on retirement island for awhile. she talks a lot about being bored, she lives in a pretty isolated place without neighbors, but within driving distance to a small city if you have the motivation. She thinks her skills are out of date, but I'm not even suggesting she try to do complex excel spreadsheets or graphic design, she can use office just fine outside of that, she understands the internet/how to find information and how to do things, she's a quick learner. she's very artistic and does some really interesting paintings - nothing 'deep,' but nice impressionist pieces. i think she just feels intimidated going back out and deal with people. She's always been a loner, and i get some of that from her, but i think she partially is that way because people disappoint her and often have smug, petty or discriminatory ways of looking at the world. she's been through a lot in life and came out really nice, she just cant sympathize with people who are nasty. 

I think she'd be great doing volunteer work. She always says she wants to, but then recoils on it. I know she cares a lot about others. she's been really frustrated with the way the world is going so she started donating to TLDEF and to her state ACLU. I think it's hard to see things get worse, and it makes it hard to want to put boots to the ground but I think doing service volunteer work is a great way to keep yours and others spirits up. There's certainly places to volunteer in the city nearby, the stakes are low as a volunteer also (even though I think she surpasses low stakes). She's very sharp and a good planner, good with talking to people if she can muster up the energy to care, which I imagine she could if it's with people who came to help others. 

Have any of you been in this situation or similar of trying to get a parent motivated? This isn't to shame her at all, I just get concerned she's unhappy and listless and frustrated, by her own admission. I suppose next time I'm around, I could look up a place to volunteer and go with her. I don't want to force this on her, but she's also expressed interest MANY times in the past. This could also just go for anything, not just volunteering. I don't think she particularly wants to go back to having the capital-A, capital-B, A Boss and doesn't really need to. ",24Sep2018,1

158,"Hi, I started my Master’s program for animation and it’s week 3 of classes. They originally scheduled me for 3 courses but I registered for 4 since I was accustomed to taking 3 art classes a semester in my undergrad (one of my classes right now is a lecture class with no homework). But this extra class I registered for is SO time-consuming. It’s a very technical class and usually when a professor says “spend 6 hours on homework”, it takes me at least 10 hours if I try to do a good job. I don’t understand anything in this class and I’m not scheduled to take it until next semester.

These past weekends I spent the entire weekend on this one class. By the time I can work on my other homework, I’m rushing to finish my other class homeworks the night before it’s due and the quality is garbage. I want to do well in my other classes. I’m thinking of switching my major anyway. But I feel like a failure because I can’t keep up with the work and I keep telling myself I need to just tough it out and work harder and faster. But I can’t do this every week.

I slept 2-4 hours a night last week and didn’t eat much just because I don’t have time to get food (don’t have food in my dorm; haven’t had time to grocery shop). I’m starting to get back/shoulder pain that I normally get after drawing for a while. But I can’t stop or take breaks because I need every minute of time I can get just to finish a homework with a quality that will give me just a passing grade. I’m not even a perfectionist, I just want to get it done. I mean I was literally working on this homework ALL weekend. I thrive on being busy but this seems excessive.

I just feel stupid because I can’t figure it out and I can’t keep up with my work. I feel like I just need to get better but I can’t. Should I drop the class and take it next semester like I was supposed to? I feel like I should, but maybe things will click with me later on and I’ll get faster? I dunno. I feel like I’m falling apart because I also don’t know if I’m in the right major and this semester might end up being a waste of my time and money anyway. Thanks for reading.",24Sep2018,1

Back story....
      I'm 21f living with my parents at home. I work 2 jobs, take night classes for nursing, and pay for rent ($300 a month) for staying with my parents. I pay for my all of my car expenses as well, my car is leased the dealership does free maintenance for the duration of the lease. I also help out with my younger siblings. I'm beginning to feel more and more like a parent to my siblings then an independent person. I cancel plans because I have to take them to appointments, in charge of going to school events. Making sure they have clothes, school supplies and so on. My mother pays me back when it comes to me buying stuff for them. Which I don't mind, I wish I didn't have to do it but it's not like I'm losing money. My dad on the other hand doesn't think I should be paid back because it's my choice to spend the money. Recently we've had a death in the family and so I had to watch over everything while they were gone to out things in order. My dad constantly tells me I need to move out and leave, he's been saying since I was 18. 

My BF mother has offered her place to me and mentioned I can take classes over eastern if I want. That they would cost the same. I worry about getting a job over there, plus I just want to be more independent. I also wouldn't need to necessarily need to bring any of my furniture. I.E. bed, bookcase, night stand, etc. Since she has a guest room and stuff. If I moved with her I feel like I would have to rent a storage space for my things

I was not happy about it, and asked why she had to come so close to me and look at my phone. Mum got angry at me for even asking that, grabbed my controller and slammed it into the ground - breaking it. I ignored what she was saying momentarily to check on the controller (Its a scuf, so worth upwards of $200 AUD), as I was doing that she kept grabbing me to get my attention.

I decided that I was not going to talk to him (too emotional, and will probably start crying) so I got up and tried to walk away. Dad was standing in my way, and kept blocking me from leaving - I walked to the side of him, when he decided to push me onto my bed. I was now even more determined to leave,  but he was still there, stood in my way and pushing me back. I finally snapped and screamed 'Get the fuck off me!' while pushing him back away from me. This is the first time I have sworn infront of my parents. He was visibly angry and lunged at me, but mum got in the way and kept him back away from me until he cooled down and left.

I end up going to their other ER branch. They monitor me and actually give me medication which helped some. Fast forward a couple days (today), i go to the ER to get  a perscription refill. Fast forward a another couple of hours and im back in thr ER... I want to get an MRI done to make sure nothing is wrong with my veins. I constantly feel like my heart is being strained. They refuse to treat me and the doctor says ""you have a problem"".

I then drive home and i feel like my heart is going to burst. I have a bunch of sharp pains in my heart and back... EMS arrives and says my blood pressure is 185/?.  Im currently waiting to be seen.

178,"Hello, to start off, I want to say I'm a 21 year old male who attends college and is currently working part time during school. Im about 5'8"" and weigh around 160 lbs (never can put on weight due to high metabolism) and believe to be in pretty good shape. I rarely have fast food (once a week or every other week) and typically eat healthier foods from Costco for lunch or dinner. (Breakfast is Quaker oatmeal with peanut butter every week day and eggs or no breakfast on weekends) Recently, my gf has been worrying I am not eating enough vegetables or fruits and that I should go to the gym more often. (I used to go everyday for a few months but with late night classes and work, I've been slacking the last 2-3 weeks). I get frustrated with these conversations cause I believe my body is doing just well and I don't ever complain about being tired or feeling terrible. She comes from a family of only organic food and healthy foods only. (Brown rice and quinoa, peppers and nuts for snacks, salads are a meal with little dressing and just a lil portion of protein, etc.) but my question is, should I be concerned with my health even at the age of 21? I feel like it is to soon to be worrying. P.S. I have never done drugs, smoked, and rarely drink alcohol, (once every two months if that) ",24Sep2018,1
179,"Long story short, about 5 years ago, during the first semester of my junior year of college, I suffered a traumatic brain injury.

Instead of taking the time off that I needed, I tried to power through, and ended up badly failing school. I've kept trying to go back, but I keep flunking out.

I used to be smart. I used to be able to do things successfully. I used to feed good about myself. But now I just feel shitty all the time. I looked at my college transcripts for the first time in ages and book down crying. So many D's and F's, and I don't know what to do to turn it around. I'm really close to graduating, and I've sunk so much money into this that I just want to finish, but it's like I can't, and my parents are mad at me for taking so long to finish, but also get mad at me when I talk about not finishing school.

181,"So I moved from my grandparents house to my dad's house in a different state 5 months ago. My grandparents were paying for my treatment, but got sick about a year ago. They have been broke themselves and not able to pay for it. Due to this sickness they have sent me to live with my dad, who is even more broke. I will go through my options I have already tried I have already tried. For context, I called around and the cheapest removal for braces in my city, and the surrounding ones is 800$


Medicaid- my state does not cover braces. I am on Medicaid already.


Parents/family- I have no family members with 800 that can be spent on this. I have begged aunts, uncles, my parents, my grandparents, my great cousin willy, you name them. I have already begged them


School- I spoke with my school counselor and she told me the school is not offering any sort of services for this. She offered clothes, food, academic supplies, but she said the school district couldn't help with this.


Home removal- Seriously considering this. If I broke off some enamel on my teeth, that would be covered by Medicaid, and if I was successful without damage, than my whole problem would be solved.


Honestly this is just a last ditch effort, if anyone has some idea I haven't thought of I would really love the advice.

182,"I don't often post and I am not in the best state of mind right now, so I apologize if this is super disorganized. This happened today and I am still very upset and confused and I need an outside perspective. Throwaway because I don't want things like this associated with my main account.

Tonight I went over to a friend's dorm (let's call then Jane) on a whim, mainly because I wanted to buy stuff from their roommate, and I figured we hadn't hung out in a few days, so we might as well eat dinner together or something. Since the roommate wasn't there we began to talk about mundane things, like friends and crushes, etc. Jane also showed me this [lesbian alignment chart](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/342/353/7a4.jpg)  that they found. (Sorry for shit formatting)

We laugh and joke and I immediately identified with one of them, so I said something like ""ah that's me, except I'm not gay lol."" She joked around some more and was like ""nah man you gay,"" so I just remember rolling with it and saying ""yeah maybe I am lol""; banter like that. Believe it or not, this is relevant later. (For context, we are both women and Jane is bisexual I think). She then excitedly talked about her development with her crush (who is a boy). She showed me their facebook messages and such. She gushed about how adorable he is, etc, and I, thinking it was cute, agreed. Jane told me that unfortunately their crush has a girlfriend living in another state, so I jokingly said something along the lines of, ""whatever dude, doesn't matter still would smash"". I then went on a tangent about something related to this, in a similarly unfunny manner.

Fast forward to later and we were getting into more serious stuff. I mention an experience where an acquaintance of mine asked me if I was gay after I rejected them. I asked Jane if I gave off the vibe that I was gay, which, to my surprise, she said yes. She said my denial makes me sound gay, (which I kind of understand), but she also said I sounded homophobic. I was quite shocked and a little hurt to hear both of these things, but I was feeling comfortable around her so I began to overshare. I come forward to her and told her that I am, in fact, actually kind of gay. In hindsight it was an idiotic thing to say in an attempt to set the record straight (lol), because I probably sounded like I was grasping at straws, like using the ""I have gay friends"" card, etc). 
Time passes and we seem to be winding down, but I was still unsettled. I asked her if I said anything in particular that made her think I was being homophobic, and they say something like ""It was just your whole attitude... like the whole, 'nuh-uh I'm not gay' thing. I just... I don't know man it's your attitude."" 

Shortly afterwards she seemed to shut down, and said she had a lot of writing to do. I took that as a window to leave, and since we finished our dinner I offered to go downstairs with her to throw out our leftover food. This was when I think they snapped. From what I can remember they said something like:

""First you invite yourself to eat in my room, you sexualize my friendship, and then you say a bunch of homophobic stuff...God. I am really busy, I have so much work to do."" 

They looked really pissed off and fed up with me, and I just started tearing up and saying I was sorry. They notice this and put their head in their hands and start apologizing, but I was too far gone at this point and started crying some more. They said something along the lines of, ""sorry, I am just being a bitch right now, don't hate yourself over this"", and kept saying how they were super stressed about this writing they had to do. But I didn't know how to react so I just kept saying it wasn't their fault. I wanted to go, so I started to get my stuff together to leave, and I said I'd talk to them later. 

In any case, I feel ashamed, angry, and confused. I am really embarrassed that I came out to this person at the the worst possible time, while at the same giving them the impression I hate gay people (I do not). I definitely handled this situation horribly. But at the same time, I am a bit pissed at them, as I feel like they were being oversensitive and projecting their stress onto me. I am conflicted and I need some help, or at least someone to talk to. I am unsure how to move on and talk to them. 

tl;dr: I pissed off a friend by accident and now I think they hate me.",24Sep2018,1

I had a horrible childhood, because of a traumatic incident my mother was unable to handle having emotions. So she decided to get rid of them. My whole life I thought I had to prove myself to her so she would love me again. But she was obsessed with beauty. Cut and styled her hair, always had makeup, the works. And so my logic was, to get her to love me, I must become beautiful. Didn't happen. For a fucking long time. I was bullied mercilessly. But, after highschool, I got way more attractive. I could say a 7.8/10. I moved immediately after highschool so I started out fresh in a new city with no friends or anyone to talk to. The only person who cared enough to see me was my incredible boyfriend. He kept me sane and gave me love, he makes me so happy.

189,"On Friday night I went to a party with my sorority sisters. I’m a new member so I hardly knew anyone there. I don’t remember drinking much. In fact, I remember trying not to drink more than one small drink, as I wanted to be able to drive myself home. I remember talking to this guy, and then I woke up in the bed of this house missing a few articles of clothing... I won’t go into detail but in addition to the worst hangover I’ve ever had and could possibly imagine (which lasted late into that afternoon) I felt sore and uncomfortable.. 

The past two days I’ve pieced some bits together and my sisters said this guy had given another a pill (willingly) so they knew he had roofies. They said he took me into the bedroom but everything seemed consensual. I tried confronting him about it and he told me that he had a girlfriend and he wouldn’t do that, and that I should consider how I could hurt people in his life with an accusation like that. 

My sisters are telling me that I should let it go and that we all make some bad decisions we are drunk. They know his girlfriend and are telling me how hurt she’d be of she knew... one of them is trying to run for their fraternity sweetheart and says that with how close me and her are, if I made a big deal out of this it could ruin her chances. 

Even though I don’t remember anything part of me feels really wrong about this and ashamed. And I’m afraid I’m going to run into him again. Reporting this or bringing it up doesn’t seem like an option. I feel uncomfortable and kind of hurt by this all and don’t know how to feel safer or handle this without effecting other people. I can’t tell my parents.

How do I handle this in a way that won’t hurt others? I don’t know if I can just sweep this under the rug. I know it was consensual because my sisters said they witnessed me being okay with him, but the fact that I don’t remember is making me feel... just bad. He won’t talk to me about it anymore. And I feel upset because if he did give me a pill without my consent, I feel taken advantage of. ",24Sep2018,1

Theres this girl that tries to actively get together with my longterm boyfriend. Sends selfies, leg pics, text him all the time also late at night. I have suspicious he cheated on me with her.

I never met this girl. Until today. My bf and I were travelling and we met her in the subway. We were together for about 15mins. I noticed a few things; she avoided any eye contact with me. Only said a simple hi. She stood way to close to my bf. She stared at him with this smile and her eyes light up when she looks at him. I did not give her bitch stares or anything. My face was bland with no expressions.

My bf just looked calm. Acting quite normal, cracking jokes with her and me, he pulled me into the conversation when I didn't say much for some time. However he is always touchy and now he only gave a small kiss. I guess the worst thing is his introduction. Normally he says this is ***my name*** , my girlfriend. Now he said, this is ***my name***and did NOT say I was his gf. I mean, she knows I am his girlfriend because he has a couple photo on his messenger app - in which he contacts her - but still.

She didnt really look like his type, but i guess guys cheat with whatever girl gives them attention.

192,"Bit of a weird one.

So, I asked my hair stylist for a white blond balayage at my last cut. She quoted 130 for it, no problem. I have medium brown hair so was pretty sure it would actually go ginger after bleaching. I asked if she was sure it would go to white blonde in one session. She said yes.

Paid 30 deposit, had a dye test, returned two weeks later for the transformation (which I’d been incredibly excited about as I don’t do anything interesting with my hair ever).

I’m in there for three hours in total. My hair was bleached and toned.
As soon as I step out of the sink I can see that my hair is not white. As it’s being blow dried, it dries to a mousy brown. The balayage is good. The colour is not white.

I’m reassured that it just needs another going over. I’m kind of disappointed that the colour is a let down.
I go to pay. I’m charged full price. I’m told to book for an appt in six weeks so we can go over again.

I was really stupid to not say anything, I know. But I have three issues and don’t know what to do.

- I was quoted 130 for white blonde balayage. I was charged 130 for medium brown balayage.

- She said she could achieve white blonde in one session. I need to go again in 6 weeks (don’t really understand why it needs to be six weeks to get it lightened again either)

- Pretty sure she’s going to charge me again but don’t know for certain. That’s my biggest concern. If she doesn’t charge me again to get white blonde I’ll be totally happy.

What should I do? And what should I do if she does go to charge me again? I’m not really sure what the etiquette is. She’s a brilliant stylist but I kind of feel like I’ve been duped.

I can’t even create conflict at a restaurant, so with my hair stylist seems impossible to me.",24Sep2018,2

I couldn't leave a person in that position so I started to help her process her thoughts and emotions. However we started to become closer and started to kiss. At this point she realised that's it, time to end the relationship with her boyfriend. A week after they broke up we started to do the deed. 2 weeks after they broke up the ex boyfriend turns up announced, and sneaks into the house at 9am on a Sunday via a spare key she forgot he had. Finding us two asleep in bed. This really made her wake up and realise the issues she has, and that the ex boyfriend actually cares.

I give her a few days to process her thoughts and tell her my position on how i feel. Which she understands and agrees to just be friends till her mind is sorted, and the fact she doesn't want a relationship immediately after a 7 year relationship. However we Whatsapp video call in the evening later on, and already shes clearly displaying she doesn't just want to be friends.

I contact her again and she says shes never getting back with him again, and just wants us to be friends because she doesn't want a immediate relationship. We then hang out after work the next day, and shes holding onto me and kissing me again. And admits she likes me.

I never expected her to jump into my arms straight away and totally get her point of not wanting a relationship straight away after a 7 year relationship. But something keeps telling me to not let go and to keep on the path I'm on. I don't know what to do, all I know is that it's putting me in a pretty bad mental position in my mind, because one minute i'm clearly show she likes me, but then the next it seems like i'm not good enough and there's no future....

He respects no authority and doesn't care about himself or others. He has a record with the local RCMP already. The principal of this school has already mentioned he has been in similar situations at this school and may not be a good fit.

Okay. So a few days ago my son was at the bus stop to come home from school. This other boy was antagonizing multiple kids. Telling them to fuck themselves and their family etc. One kid had enough and told him to fuck himself right back. The kid in question proceeded to throw him against the fence and punch him repeatedly. Another student broke the fight up. After that he turned his attention to my son, who also told him yo fuck off. This kid then punched him in the head and pushed him around before getting on the bus. After getting on the bus he sat next to my son and whispered in his ear, ""I am going to get off the bus and kick your ass"". He then proceeded to tell other kids what his intent was, hoping to put on a show. True to his word he got off the bus with my son and began pushing and punching him. My kid tried to play it cool and just walk away bit This kid followed him. Near my home there is a steep hill. As my son approached the hill the other kid grabbed him by the back pack and tossed him down the hill. He then slid down the hill behind him and began beating on him again. This was about 40 feet from my front door. My son got away and made it to the door and went inside. The other kid stood outside and began tossing rocks at my door, chipping the paint in several places. My son opened the door to yell him yo stop and leave him alone. When he did this the other kid slammed into the door throwing my kid back and then entered my home. He said to my son,""what are you going to do now that no one is around?"". He grabbed my son and threw him against the way and punched him again. My son was able to break away and made it to the kitchen where he grabbed a knife. The other kid said there is no way you are going to use that and continued to advance. My son had to point the blade at him and told him ""try me"". At this point the kid left and my son called me in tears.

I contacted the RCMP right away and they came and took a statement. They told me this kid is on their radar and because he is over 12 pressing charges is an option.

I (28m broke college jobless student with aspergers) is in a writing group for the past 13 months (Aug 2017) which was ran by a nice lady who recently stepped down (last monday). It is a novel critique writing group where we bring multiple printed out copies of our chapters every week and we read them out loud and get feedback. In January I met a new member who writes screenplays for a TV show on Netflix. Smart guy (Ill call him Christopher). He and I exchanged emails and I send him the chapter I am brining each week before group at his recommendation so he can have more time to write notes. He gives me good feedback and I thought he was a good friend.  


Flash forward to last week. The group leader was moving for a new job so she has to step down. I was the only person to volunteer to continue the group. Another guy who only started coming since April (Ill call him Dawg) said to me he didnt feel he could commit to take over, even though he thought about it. I told him after group that I would make him and Christopher (who wasn't there because of an undisclosed something that came up) my ""deputies"". Basically the guys who could run the group if I ever had to miss it because I was sick. He was totally fine with it. After our meeting I say my goodbyes and walk out the diner and message Christopher through the email app on my phone. I tell him what happened and basically he emails me back the next morning and says this (copy and pasted but edited to replace real names with aliases)...""**Hey dude, Wanted to ask you, would you be open to Dawg taking over the group? If I’m being blunt with you, I think right now you’re wayyyy too unfocused to be the leader. You may well develop into a fine group leader some day, but right now you have some learning to do (i.e. not talking during feedback, not going off topic, etc. which you’ve gotten better with BTW). Do you care as long as the person taking over the group isn’t Guppy? (lol)**.""  


His last email from Thursday morning when I told him I didnt trust Jason to lead the group and told him to try and give me a chance: You’re being really stubborn. No one takes you seriously enough as the leader to even show up Monday. Who from the current list of attendees do you think is going to show? If you really do want the group to continue, you’ll let someone else take the lead. But good luck with all that.  
Yes I personally agree with him. I am also very busy and cant even afford to pay the [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) $15 membership fee. But I felt compelled to take it over because the lady who runs the group was talking about cancelling it. In addition I hate Guppy who is this older sci-fi author who hasnt been to group since end of August (we took labor day monday off) but he gets offended when you give him feedback. I fear if Guppy gets the group then it will really suck and be ruined. I wanted to save the group. Now as this correspondance went on throught the day Tuesday I find out Dawg has messaged Christopher and the lady who ran the group (Ill call her Carmen) and they both agreed to want to take over the group. I messaged him on meetup and he back pedaled and said he was sorry. Now I find out this morning he has started a new meetup writers group on Monday nights meeting at the exact same time only 15 miles east at another Ihop. I guess it's closer to where he lives but damn.

  
So I panic this morning. I email Carmen and let her know the meetup people havent contacted me back yet about switching over the group. I email Christopher

203,"Truth be told I am surprised they managed to stay together for as long as they did, but I didn't think it would be this ugly. My mom's an alcoholic and this year it has been without a doubt the worst for her. She had to leave her job because it was too much, she got fired from another, where they basically stole all her contacts, her mother is ill. So she has been drinking heavily

My dad has his mental issues, basically from years of stubbornness and keeping things to himself. Today my mom had been drinking for 2 days straight and went to work drunk. My dad didn't like it and hit her. Thats probably the final straw. Dad said that there is no hope left, she will never change. 

I don't know whats gonna happen to Mom, she makes average wage, have no clue where she is suppose to go or move. Her mother, my grandmother, is staying with us and I don't know what's gonna happen to her, is she gonna stay, move in with my mom, don't know. 

None of this helps on the fact that both my parents are having a mid life crisis, talking about their past and their regrets. My mom is going through a menopause which is making her way more emotional. My dad basically told me he can't live with being separated, basically that he doesn't want to live. On top of that, I feel like there are financial problems involved, because some specific bills are being unpaid, but my father won't talk about it because its his job to bring the money, I should worry about my studies.

Asking her about her school life or material items and then saying how she has something better. Moreover, she continues to outsmart anything we say. When we first met this couple we thought they would be a good fit to be another couple we hang out with, and so this was not the impression we got at first. My girlfriend and I are peaceful, kind hearted people who rarely compare our selves to others. We just enjoy life  everything that we do and don’t understand why this girl is constantly doing this. Not saying we’re perfect, but have a hard time understanding why this girl has to constantly tell us what she has or how she is better. I concluded maybe she is insecure about herself or maybe another reason. We randomly see the couple and they try to add us on social media. Has something similar happened to you or are you familiar with this type of behavior? What’s the best thing to do about this? We just have a bad taste whenever we hear about them. ",24Sep2018,2
205,"(Sorry for my bad English) 
 I spent the last year fighting to get my grades up so I could enter college I wanted, I did great and here I am ! My parents are happy with me for the first time in years, that’s a great isn’t it !?

In the beginning of the year I was really money focused, I wanted to be one of those young millionaires you see on the internet, driving their Lamborghinis in Cali, unfortunately my business failed after a good start. No problem, it happens!

Trying to make money is emotionless, so after my business failed in the beginning of the summer I started investing on spending time with my friends. It was a great, we would all just chill, watch Tarantino movies, smoke weed... it was a fucking good summer.

Im realizing for the first time that life is all about being with other humans and having meaning full relationships, and of course, enjoying our selves.
Yesterday it was a clear night in my city and coming home late I realized that we are so fucking small in the universe, I was looking at the moon and at the stars and I was trying to understand, why does college matters so much in our lives, why is money the ultimate goal, why will I need to give 100% in college so I can get a good job where I will have no time to enjoy myself?!? 

Im also kind of shy, but I have good looks, I would have no problem getting girls, but for some reason I just spend money on luxury escorts and have robotic emotionless sex. I’m going on my first date in years next Friday, sex is not what’s on the table, I just want to go eat with another female human being, know about her, talk about movies, music and deep philosophical shit and then go for a long drive with no particular destiny. I just want to have an experience ya know.. 
 
Life is just too short to hang with fake people and stay at home, and we are too small to care so much about everything else besides the experiences we have.
We all need good relationships, good sex and good times... college and all that is just acting, it’s important, but life is not about that.

I know I was supposed to ask for advice, sorry, but I ended up ranting about life. I think I gave myself advice by writing this, so if I can help some young heads that’s good enough for me.

I graduated this summer with a degree in a very competitive but freelance and fickle industry, I’ve had a few jobs within the industry however nowhere near stable or frequent enough for me to do this full time. 
I have a part time job (20 hours), that I’ve had since I was 17 and I enjoy however it’s in a totally unrelated field, it’s always been known to myself, family, friends and colleagues even that I would be leaving the job as soon as I got a stable job in my field. When studying I was so excited and looking constantly to the future, thinking that when I graduated I would go into the industry and have (hopefully) a few long jobs and go from there, however I guess as life it, that hasn’t happened. 
Although this is totally normal for people in my field, I can’t help but feel totally embarrassed that I’m in my early 20’s and haven’t moved out or have a whiff of a full time, stable job to be able to do so, my parents understand and haven’t pressured me in anyway but I’m finding it so difficult to not feel like a complete failure in life and I’m really regretting doing my degree in what I have, it can’t be applied really to any other field which is annoying and it’s not a typical academic subject either. 
My family is starting a business and I’m involved, however so far it’s been very quiet and so that’s adding to the feelings of failure and worry about what I’m going to do in my future, I feel like I’m letting everyone down as I’m the eldest of my siblings.

227,"I am 25 years old and struggling whether to finally drop out of my degree program. 

I completed an advanced 3 year college diploma over 4 years ago. It was enough to get a job and currently I'm making over $40K per year. There is still room for growth and increased salary with this diploma in my small town. 

After graduating I decided I wanted to upgrade to a 4 year degree. While working I started taking distance classes online; at first I did 3 classes/semester, then the next year 2, then 1... 

Last year I failed a class because of a family emergency. This cut off my student aid and I had to pay $3000 in tuition using my line of credit - which I haven't been able to pay down, it has snowballed out of control. (Fun fact: I also have to pay back $200/month of student loans while paying this tuition) I was able to pass both classes last year but was had seriously considered dropping out before even starting. 

This summer I had signed up for a class but my work demands skyrocketed and I had to drop the class midway through the semester... I was out about $500 in tuition. So this year I picked 2 electives to take this semester and I'm already breaking down. I only realized yesterday that I am out of my league with one of them and had to drop... it is too late for full refunds and I am stuck paying $500 for this class. 

There is one class I am left taking and honestly I don't see why I am doing this to myself... I am behind in the class already because I was struggling in the other one! I'm considering dropping it too and slowly pay off the $1000 owing for the semester.

On one hand I can't bear to think about dropping out. I am 7 classes away from graduating, leaving now would mean risking increasing the requirements as my original graduation requirements won't apply. This would open opportunities for higher level jobs in the future or allow me to transition to a large city. 

But I'm also tired. I can't stand using every weekend to study and do assignments. I get home from work and I want to spend quality time with my husband, I want to play with my dogs, I want to watch my shows! I've been a student for 7 damn years with 3 more to go! I can't spend money on anything because of the tuition/loans and I can't go anywhere or do anything because there are assignments and exams!

230,"I’m only 16, but I have absolutely no motivation or desire to do anything. In my freshman year of high school I was forced to drop out due to chronic migraines. My missing school led to me developing pretty severe anxiety, and unfortunately this went hand in hand with my eventual depression. I felt like an absolute failure. I had always been excessively praised as the “perfect student” my entire life, but all of the sudden I could barely even pass a class. That same year I went to therapists, psychiatrists, neurologists, you name it. I was only offered medicine that caused me to gain weight, making me feel even worse. I now attend online school and take no medicine, but things are just out of reach for me. Every night I lay awake thinking of all the school work I have in store, and how I’ll have to do it alone in my empty house. I lost all of my friends when I left public school, and my family is so busy that I only see them for a couple hours. When I do school I know that it’s not hard, but I can barely even get through a multiple choice quiz without wanting to throw my computer away. My fear of failure is the only thing that stops me from quitting, but I spend hours just staring at the work rather than forcing myself to do it. And if I can’t succeed in school, I decided to get a job. I also got the job in an attempt to make my parents proud of me again, and it worked.

232,"My parents got divorced when I was in middle school, bringing me into depression. I got over that and afterward I was in highschool and doing well. My weighted gpa was a 4.13, counting freshman year and half of sophomore year. My father married the women he cheated on my mother with. End of winter break, beginning of my 4th semester in high school, my dad forces my sister and i to move in with his new wife (on the other side of the entire city) because they got married, despite us begging him to let us be with our mom and us telling him how it'd affect us.

We decide we want to continue going to the same school, despite the lack of a convenient source of transportation. Everyday we'd have to leave the house by 5:40 a.m. to make it on time to the bus stop a mile away from where we lived, which then took us to the light rail station, where we'd ride the light rail across the entire city to our next bus, which dropped us off at school (about a 2 hour and 15-30 min trip). This goes on every school day, except the Friday's we're with our mom, from January till May. Between this time period, i fall deep into depression, despite being very motivated in the beginning (which was working, until my mental state destroyed everything). I began to fail all my classes. 

I was so tired of how i felt. I was extremely stressed (being in all honors and AP) and yet i also had no willpower whatsoever to get any work done. At first it was just homework, but then it was in class too. I kept telling myself different ways i could actually catch up in my classes, but never took the initiative to start these plans. I then just gave up completely due to lack of willpower and energy. There were days where id come home and go straight to bed (like around 5:45 p.m. because the ride back home was long too) and then fall asleep until the next morning, around the time I'd have to leave by. Everyday in class i just began to sleep. It was too hard to focus on school work. I was exhausted.

My entire life was smooth sailing as I'd lived in the same house since birth (until now bat least) and I'd always done well in school. My family has never been particularly poor because of my father, so I never had much of a hard time, so this lifestyle was especially a punch to the gut. It got so bad for me, I eventually gave up even on my hygiene. I'd go to school 3 days in a row wearing the same clothes. 

The custody that my parents have (dad has us 70% and mom has us 30%) worked before we moved, because they lived so close to each other, but because of the distance after moving it became just a horrible experience in general. It was extremely horrible, especially since living with my father was just so bad (i really dont like his wife btw). I'd be with my dad from Friday to Thursday one week and then Sunday to Thursday the next (meaning one week I'd only be at my mom's house for one day) which was torture. Finally in early May of this year, i just couldn't find the will to pack my bags and go back to my dads. So i gave up. The last time i tried to stay without his permission he called the cops, but for some unknown reason, this time he hadn't. 

It's been 5 months since then and I've decided to drop out of school. I tried going back to my old school but my dad unenrolled me after I told him. If my mom tries to do it again i wouldn't be surprised if he unenrolled me again, so I haven't told her to try. There's a test I can take that will give me a certificate that is equivalent to a high school diploma. I've decided this is a better route than moving back in with him and going to a majority white school, which id be extremely uncomfortable in (my entire life ive gone to very diverse schools because of the diverse area i lived in) or just  a worse school than my former school in general. I figured i wouldn't be able to handle honors and AP classes because of my mental state while living with my dad, so what was the point. If i was gonna graduate high school without doing anything beyond the minimum then why wait and instead just get the equivalent now. I got this plan from a cousin who has started community college this fall. I plan to get the equivalency, get a job, work until next fall semester, and enroll into a community college. 

At first i was motivated but now i feel extremely stressed, while lacking the will and energy to work towards my goal, just like i did at my dad's. In the beginning, when researching the test i found that I should be easily able to pass each part. I'm what some people would call ""gifted"" so I've always done well academically. I'm no genius, but things have always come pretty easily for me (for example, i passed an AP test, despite getting a D- in the actual class in 2nd semester). But right now I'm scared that I'll fail the test that's a whole month away. I even bought a book to study for it but, I lost all my previously found motivation. Thinking about the test scares me and stresses me out, but yet again, it feels like i literally can't make myself study for it. I feel horrible and honestly suicidal. The only thing keeping me happy at all is my girlfriend. I've recently unfriended some friends I'd had for a long time due to how disgustingly ignorant and racist they were. I feel extremely alone and scared and stressed. I used to take all honors and AP classes and yet i feel now is the hardest my life's ever been even though, I'm pretty much doing nothing at home. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I was on the road to a good college. Im a black student who did extremely well in all of my classes. I strived to take the hardest classes and now that route seems impossible. I don't know what will become of me. I've made this plan and while i still plan to go through with it, I'm scared. I don't feel prepared for college and I don't think I'll feel prepared a year from now either. I don't even know why im making this post. I guess i want to know if it makes sense that i feel this way or if maybe im just being lazy or something. Id appreciate if anyone just comments their thoughts, even if negative (if anyone even reads this whole thing). Anyways, thanks. 

p.s. sorry if some of this doesn't make sense.

TL:DR
My Dad fucked up my life and my great record at school. I've fallen into a severe depression and have become unmotivated. Scared, stressed, and lonely, i don't know what to do with myself anymore or what will become of me.

233,"A little background info: My girlfriend and I have been together for about 2 and a half years. Our relationship has had its ups and downs but it's been mostly smooth sailing. I graduated high school this past spring, while she is in the middle of her senior year.

So with that out of the way, let me explain.

Recently, we haven't been able to spend as much time together as we wished or we're used to. Part of this is because of different schedules; I'm working on executing my plan for the next couple years (aka going off to college) but also trying to balance my time with her and other friends. Here's the issue: right now, I don't feel like she's fueling my progress right now. She isn't holding me back but she isn't really pushing me forward either, and I think it's just because we're in two completely different positions in life right now. Something we discussed relatively early in the relationship is that if we're experiencing long term stagnation (like I am), we have to reevaluate.

I think I'm in a position where I need to be totally focused on me, my college plan has been mostly the same since I started high school and it didn't take any relationship into consideration. (I mean, I'm going from the South to New York. A pretty big jump to make, bringing another person along can make it a little bit harder.)

I don't think any break up we do will be permanent but I don't think it'll be over super quickly, there's a lot we both have to figure out on our own I think.",24Sep2018,1
234,"I seriously need advice. I have lived in new England my entire life. As much as I love Boston I am sick of the snow and the fucking roads!!! (Seriously whoever was in charge of setting up the roadways is a dummy). I left my previous job earlier this year after it was taken over by a new private equity firm that hired the wrong operations manager and the company is now tanking. I really thought I would be there until I retired but such is life. I took a job that pays me close to 100K in Boston after that. I hated it at first but as of late it's been good. Good pay, I travel around the city most of the day, its stressful with the traffic but has been much better recently. Sometimes I even take my motorcycle in and just record on my gopro all day. 

Earlier in the year I had some things happen and got really depressed and just lost my way for a little bit (nothing outrageous just not myself for a while). I got back on track and decided, you know what, I need to go to Arizona, cheap property, way less taxes, less stressful culture NORMAL FUCKING ROADS. I pay 2k/month for rent (still an hour outside Boston) and it just doesnt seem worth it!

So here's the condensed issue. I make about 100K right now. I am not happy here, I am 28, if I dont go now I never will (please dont hit me with the ""you cant run from your problems"" generic line, it's annoying I just dont want to live in new england) In looking for jobs I found one for 50K to start. Literally cutting my income in half. I'm 28 am I making a mistake by leaving?

Even with the money I'll save on rent and taxes/cost of living it will hurt. Any older people out there who could let me know their experiences/advice would be appreciated.",24Sep2018,4

241,"So my dad found my vape 2 days ago and he flipped out big time.

And then he told me he is going to stop paying for college if I keep doing it? So not only is he just completely disregarding my say in the matter and forcing me to do what HE thinks is right, even though I am an adult now, he is now manipulating my personal decisions because he knows if he threatens to take away college tuition I will do whatever he wants. He also told me as soon as I get home I have to hand it to him “no excuses.” Am I missing something here? This seems really over the top, I may be his son by I do not feel like the way he is going about this is okay.

242,"So my girlfriend of 7 months has some obscure kinks.

Basically she likes to be dressed as a baby and humiliated. Whilst I understand it's her thing I'm not so into it and she keeps wanting me to do it to her. 

Not only that but she tells me about the things that she's done in the past with other people and it's something I really don't want to hear. She tells me about all the degenerate things she's done which, whilst probably hot to do, is something that makes me feel uncomfortable knowing what she's done. 

She even sent me pictures of her with another guy in a room holding a chain (before we got together). Am I being stupid or is this something you shouldn't be telling or showing somebody in a new relationship? I have told her this too (that I don't want to see or hear that she's done with other people).

It's hard for me to commit my feelings towards her with these things floating around my head. We hardly ever have sex because our sexual interests don't match. Maybe I'm just being immature and commitment phobic. I found a note in her room with her name, address and phone number on with a message underneath it saying something along the lines of how much of a slut she is yada yada yada. 

I just don't know how to process this information. She's been with people who have posted this stuff online (consensually) and she's definitely done some worse things that she hasn't told me about. 

What do you think? Am I just being stupid or is this something anybody else would find off-putting? Thank you.",24Sep2018,7
243,"Hi Reddit, I need a lot of help.

I broke up with my SO yesterday.

We had plans to get married. We’ve been together for two years. When I told my mother about him, she initially was happy but then flipped the switch and said she wouldn’t accept our union and wouldn’t come to our wedding. Not because he’s a bad person, or some sort of loser, mainly because he’s not Muslim and he has two tattoo sleeves.

A little background on my mom: she’s a single mom and raised me and my siblings with much difficulty. Our father left our family leaving her with a deep distrust of men (which I ended up growing up with too) and she spent her entire life working all these jobs to make sure we all were raised Properly and had everything we needed. And we did. She worked so much in fact that she is now in very bad health.

Now a little background on my SO. He’s a really nice person. Truly. He’s an engineer and makes a 6 figure salary as do I. We have a puppy together and we do everything together. He’s my best friend. I must say, we never had a crazy “spark” or that chemistry everyone always talks about. He’s dorky, socially awkward and very laid back. 

But over the months of dating him I got to truly see what kind of person he is, how he stops is car to give a homeless person a 20, or how he covers our dog’s ears when he says a bad word. He’s not a bad person.

But my mother doesn’t want our marriage to happen. She stopped speaking to me completely which really wrecked my mental health because me and my mom are very, very close. She has never acted this way towards me. We were fighting every single day and I was crying every day to the point where the swelling in my eyes just hasn’t ever been able to go down. I can’t imagine a wedding if my mom isn’t there. I don’t want one that way.

And I started thinking, what if she’s right? What if he’s too socially awkward for me, not manly enough, etc. what if I listen to my mom and I find someone who’s more outgoing, who dresses better? Maybe I’ll find that spark with someone else that we never had? And so, his flaws began to magnify.

So I broke it off this weekend. But now, I feel miserable. I’ve never felt so empty. I feel like a horrible human being for doing this to him and to myself. I miss him beyond words because I didn’t just lose a lover I lost my best friend. The person I got excited just to see on a Friday night to watch Netflix and eat pizza. The person I wanted to go everywhere with and do everything with.

I’m sad, lonely and heartbroken. This is my first break up, so I don’t know how I should be feeling. I wouldn’t be feeling this way if I wasn’t in love with him, right? Everyone has flaws. And his aren’t fatal. And I regret it now because he’s texting me telling me he hopes I’m happy and that I gave him the best two years of his life.


TL;DR- did my family manipulate my thoughts and make me break up with the love of my life?",24Sep2018,1
244,"Alright I'm going to try to give some background before asking for advice, I'm 20 years old and my brother is 30 and married, my mom owned a store so she gave it to him so he could open up his business there, went from graphic design to renting wedding dresses, over the years he worked there, I was in high school so no way I could have helped him or anything but after that, I had a lot of free time but he never asked me to work with him or anything, he has a second job where he teaches graphic design, he could have let me sit at the store while he's at his second job and do whatever I could do but nah, the store is owned by my mom's but I can't work there because he prefers hiring his wife over me and even gets pissed sometimes if we visit him at the store which is close to our house lol.

Hell, he offered me to go study graphic design where he works, I obviously said yes then he changes his mind and is like ""nah I'll just teach you at the house so you don't have to meet the assholes there"" which never happened lol, so I ended up getting a job at the mall, I worked there for 6 months while he was buying his wedding dresses from another country, I helped send him stuff and handled some things while he was absent. So, I started getting sick of my job because of some reasons, I told him about it and my parents too, he agrees with me that I should quit and says when he comes back he'll open up the store and I can rent wedding dresses there lmfao.

So he comes back, asks me to help him clean the store which was fucking hard to do and we had to move some furniture he didn't need so that was a pain in the ass, when we were cleaning up store he tells me he'll let me work at the store and help his wife and he'll give me a salary and I'm like sure whatever. Nope, it's been 2 months since they opened and only him and his wife work there and what's fucking annoying is that, his wife's sister sits there all the time but he nevers asks me to come to the store EVEN THOUGH ITS MY MOMS.

My parents are annoyed by this but they wont confront him cause he says he'll leave to stay in another country for a while and then we'll deal with it, the supermarket I used to work at wont give me a second chance after I quit which is fucking stupid and I've been searching for a job ever since, I got fucking pissed when his wife suggested to me to go and search for a job at some stores, LIKE FUCK OFF, what do you think I'm doing? You shouldn't even be there, I should be priority to work at our store because it's my mom's store, it's funny my mom is pissed about it but wont say a fucking thing, don't really blame her though, she has a heart disease so I wouldn't want her to get angry.

It doesn't stop here, before he got married, he never gave a fucking shit about our house even though he earned a lot cause he has his own business you know, he NEVER helped my mom with anything, NEVER paid for bills meanwhile I was getting paid 200$ a month and I paid internet bills every month, I bought gifts for my parents when I got my first check, I always was ashamed to ask my parents to give me money for something but he gets paid a shit ton and never paid any bills and always blames my parents for shit but hey he shows up with his wife to live with us and suddenly starts spending money on food so he could eat with her and never share anything.

246,"I'm sure this will get buried and maybe I'm just grasping at straws, but here goes:

&amp;#x200B;

Let me start by saying we got the cat back safe and sound... but under suspicious circumstances.

So I'm currently dating the love of my life (**GF**), but she has a very vindictive, borderline sociopath of an ex husband (**XH**). They're currently separated and in the process of the divorce (but I've got an ex wife of my own so we balance out). She travels a lot for work so our relationship is often semi-long distance. She's been staying with me for a few weeks now (commuting between Virginia and Georgia periodically for work).

So basically within the last few days, maybe a week, her ex has been on this kick trying to get her back (and then getting really mad and abusive when she doesn't go for it). Then yesterday morning, her roommate (**RM**) in GA calls her to say she can't find her cat anywhere. RM got concerned when he didn't come down for breakfast with her cat because the 2 cats do everything together. She's torn the apartment to pieces searching and is 100% positive there's no way he could have gotten outside. They live on the 3rd floor and this cat never ever goes outside. If he somehow does get out, he sits by the door and cries until someone lets him in. He's needy and lazy and not prone to wandering off. Anyway, GF and I were at least 10+ hours away, there was very little we could do, but she texted her ex to ask if he had the cat. He denied it, but almost IMMEDIATELY started flooding her with suspiciously optimistic texts about how everything is 100% okay and that she shouldn't even worry because ""I KNOW I can find him"" (the cat hates him btw). He claimed to have printed up posters and put them all over town but RM went searching all around the neighborhood and didn't see a single sign anywhere. Meanwhile, hours and hours later, XH sends GF a picture of the ""flier"" and it looks like a hastily thrown together pdf file he took a picture of off his computer screen. Cut to this morning, someone texts XH saying the found the cat in a garage and then saw the flier and noticed the resemblance. Now I've never particularly liked XH (I've known him as long as GF has because GF was my best friend for the past 10 years before she was GF), but I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. GF and RM are convinced XH came over during a brief but perfect window of opportunity while she was out of the house the night before, and set this whole thing up so he can be the hero. So I just want to know what everyone else thinks? Is there any way to find out the truth?

&amp;#x200B;

There's a few other suspicious details as well. The things that really stick out to me were:

\-XH still has key to apartment because he ""lost her car keys and had to get copies made""

\-XH knew when RM would be out of the house and that GF was out of town

\-Person that ""found"" the cat has suspiciously similar name to XH (it seriously may as well be Andy/Randy)

\-No one but XH has spoken with this person

\-The distance where he was ""found"" is just too far for an old cat, set in his ways, to suddenly decide to go exploring

\-How did cat get out of apartment, all the way downstairs, about half a mile away, and into someone else's garage?

\-XH was very very **uncharacteristically** optimistic that he would definitely find the cat. Like, instantly. Seriously the guys a raging dick. He tries to make everything GF's fault and screams his head off at her at every tiny little mistake. She apologizes for everything and I try to make her understand that she doesn't need to do that with me. So this sudden burst of positivity from XH about a very unsure situation is just plain weird.

&amp;#x200B;

So again, I like to give benefit of the doubt but I need some outside opinions. Is this something I should look into, or just be grateful that GF has her cat back?

&amp;#x200B;

PS, she's changing the lock as soon as she gets home.",24Sep2018,9

268,"Hello all, 

So essentially the other night, I matched with someone on a dating app. I thought it was legit. They wanted to Skype and do a video call and immediately it turned sexual. I don’t know why I didn’t think to just stop right away but I continued and did what she asked me to do. Which was show my genitals and whatnot. Well after a couple minutes “she” starts playing what she’s recorded. And then proceeds to threaten to post it online on Facebook and Instagram and send it to all my friends unless I pay $600. So my dumbass pay for them to delete it. And the delete it, but only to say while it’s in their trash bin, thAt for $800 more they’ll permanently delete it. Well I was pissed at that point so I said nah and blocked them and went to sleep. I’ve been having nightmares all night and watching my social media, because they said they’d make a fake account and post it under my name. Idk what to do now cuz I’m seriously panicking and stuff.

When she saw me she asked in the front of them to dress modestly right now - it was not an immodest dress but that’s what an average female would wear in my country and I always wear like that and she never complained before - so I was very embarrassed and angry, I tried to keep her calm but without success. Anyway, I did what she asked me for and I everyone was looking at me, and I kept silent. 15 mins later, one of my relatives asked me to go for a drink and unfortunately I said “no thanks, I wish I’m with my friends today” so they start to gossip about me loudly so I left them. Today they decided to hangout but they didn’t invite me. Plus, I was planning to travel with them but I guess I’m going to stay. 

I know I did a mistake. But when I said my complaint I didn’t mean to hurt her. I just said it because I hated to be humiliated. If I was with my friends no-one would ever humiliate me like that. I don’t want to lose them, at the same time I have a pride.

I just graduated with my bachelors, and I'm trying to plan the next step. I'm exhausted from working all the time and taking night classes. I've done some research online and I see that some places offer a MSW online. I've never trusted online schooling too much. Is this a scam? How do they monitor you?

285,"A friend, or I suppose it's 'friends' because it's always [us] and [we], essentially told me not to talk to them unless I had something specific to talk about. I simply messaged a ""Good Morning"" message to them earlier today which I do for any conversation of any sort.

They mentioned that small talk is too distracting to them, that they would rather hold longer conversation of substance. That I don't need to keep in touch with them so much to assure our friendship. That is a sentiment I could fully stand behind in any, normal, friendship. I'm like that with a number of other friends.

My issue with these two friends in particular is that they have made claims in the past that I don't make enough effort to show that I care for them or our friendship when I stop messaging even the ""Good morning"" messages because there isn't anything substantial I have to talk about for a period. At one point there was an argument because they were bored at work and I wasn't responding to their messages because I was both busy myself and didn't have anything more than small talk to offer.

I've been told that if I really cared about them I would want to talk with them no matter how small. But yet now even the passing ""Hope you've been doing okay."" is a bother because it isn't deep heart bearing conversation.

I'm generally the kind of person who can go for weeks without talking with friends beyond a quick hey. We have our own lives, I respect that.

I can't do that with them. They get angry I didn't ""make the effort"" with them. They don't make an effort on their end but it always falls on me. This is not the first time this exact point was reached and I've tried so many roads and it always leads to some kind of argument.

289,"I posted this on r/sex and they didn't seem to like my post very much and gave very little input so I'm asking you guys over here. This is almost the same text that I posted on r/sex. 

&amp;nbsp;

You see, I seem to be a bit of a late bloomer. I'll be 24 next week and I'm still a virgin. I've been thinking about it hiring a sex worker lately and I have quiet the number of arguments that I'm going to present to you to complement and help me decide whether this is a good or bad idea.

&amp;nbsp;

First and most importantly to me: The moral argument. 

Prostitution is fully legal and regulated where I live. However, a woman working in a brothel might not be fully content with what she's doing. I've seen a few documentaries and heard a few stories about the girls that do this kind of work. These are stories that range from ""*She couldn't pay the bills and thought this was the only way to get some cash*"" to ""*Her parents sold her to the traffickers that brought her over to work.*""

And I couldn't allow myself to even think about using these women for sex, it would feel like legit rape. I'm sure there are many women who actually love sex work and do it on their own accord, but what are the chances that I find one of those?

I'm also inclined to think that most women value their bodies and intimacy and would only resort to sex work if they absolutely *have* to. (Am I wrong in this assumption?)

So yeah, just because she goes there to work everyday doesn't mean this is the way she would like things to be. 

&amp;nbsp;

And then there's the emotional argument: I've always imagined having my first kiss, my first time with someone special. On a night that I wouldn't forget till the end of my life. Though I know most of you are going to tell me the first time always sucks but I'm also willing to bet you still remember your first time very well. Having my first kiss and my first sex with a woman whose real name I don't even know is quite honestly not the way I had imagined I would end up.

&amp;nbsp;

But then there's an argument for it: I've heard from people who have done this that when they've had sex for the first time, they don't immediately feel like a different person, but they slowly realize that they feel more confident and comfortable around other women. They told me that once you've done it you don't think about it very often anymore and it becomes easier to focus on the other person's personality and on trying to form a connection with them. In other words, you stop being desperate for sex, which makes you more attractive.

&amp;nbsp;

So I don't know. What do you think?",24Sep2018,5

I've suggested getting a professional to house-train it, as my folks obviously have no clue what they've gotten themselves into. They just balked at the idea.


They refuse to read information about raising a puppy and shut down any advice I find on the internet. Meanwhile they think raising a dog is literally the same as raising a baby. I'm no expert myself, but I'm pretty sure raising a pup is quite different from raising a child. A puppy don't understand things the way humans do, but they still treat it like a human.


They get frustrated when the dog keeps peeing on the carpet, but refuse to listen when I tell them how to make it stop.
They have no control over the pup and flat out told me they refuse to let me help out with actual verifiable advice. 


They have pulled this shit before a few years ago when they came home with a parrot, and I'm starting to see the cycle repeat again. They sent the parrot away after just three weeks when they discovered that a bird won't stop screaming and shitting everywhere by just ignoring it until they've had enough.
They refuse to listen to advice, and keep treating the dog as if it was a human and if I don't do something soon, they'll just send it away.

300,"Hello Reddit. I'll try to keep this as short as possible. 
I'm in my second year of college but I'm technically a transfer due to having college credits from a program in high school. I thought changing my major from computer science would help... but it didn't. I will admit that I'm really scared and not sure what I should prioritize. 


**College and Majors:** 

I went into college thinking computer science would help get me into game development. It was something I attempted in the past via gamemaker and I had a few, detailed game design ideas. It didn't help that the classes went fast and I was slow to understand how coding worked. After 2 semesters, I decided a change was needed. I could do this as a hobby, if I wanted to do it at all. I talked to a career counselor and I guess I thought a finance related career could help. I'm taking those classes now and I'm very unsure about what I want. I've failed one class and dropped another all in my first year of college; I'm not off to a great start. 

**Why I Can't Leave College:**

My family is making me stay here. Even after I asked to take a semester off to just work, they told me no and claimed that would be silly to not take advantage of my ""headstart"". I have no assets to my name, meaning no job, no car, no license and only a permit. I'm pretty pathetic for an ""adult"" but if anyone else was in my situation, I wouldn't think or say that about them. If I leave college, I'll have to find a way to leave my home. I want to leave anyways due to the restrictions, control and how much I can't be myself there.


**Emotions:**

I thought my self hate, mortality-centric thoughts and general unhappiness were just attributed to teenage hormones. In all honesty though, it still might be. Even if I've had friends online who have stated it might be depression, I still don't want to discredit people who actually have it. I can't go to therapy, no matter how cheap, because I don't have money and my family finding out would be... pretty bad. They'll suggest religion and, in addition, they're the ones who are taking half the weight of the loans. Another expense would anger them.


**Money Issues:**


I don't have any assets, income, means of transportation or savings. I have used loans for almost half of my first year's expenses and, after losing a scholarship due to poor grades, about 80% of my tuition and expenses this year. I know changing majors would ruin me financially as well as my family and that dropping out would mean finding a job and a place immediately. I can get a job (due to having an associate's) but it would be my first job, which I think might impact my ability to get hired. 


**TL;DR:**


I am overall just a bit scared. I know I need a change but I've never been this bad at school and lost...ever. I knew it would be a change but I thought college would be a good one. I have no money and no idea what to do. Any advice would help, really. ",24Sep2018,1

306,"I just got home from my “bachelorette” from hell. Im seriously considering kicking my MOH out of my wedding and out of my life. 

As a little backstory: my MOH has been having a LOT of personal issues for the past several months as far as abusing alcohol goes. Her behavior has been insanely different from how I’ve known her for the last 7 years we have been friends (she’s 22, I’m almost 24) 
She lies to me, her boyfriend, and her family. Shes stood me up multiple times and ignores me when I try to reach and gets defensive. She’s been getting drunk at school and work and about three weeks ago totaled her car and got arrested for DUI. 

I was there for her and made sure she knew that I was there to help her and have forgiven the things she’s done because I know it’s not like her. Anything to do with the wedding or anything was completely on the back burner. None of that mattered, she could have died, I was just happy she was still here and that she didn’t take away someone else’s life. 

She already had our cabin for this weekend booked and paid for and she told me she still wanted to go and her parents thought it would hopefully be good for her to get away and de-stress. The first two days were fine, we did some shopping and went out to eat, bought boots for my upcoming wedding and all and all it was going fine. 
Last night was our last night and she had been acting strange all day, she was sleeping a lot, she wouldn’t talk to me and when she did her words were slurred and she didn’t make much since (I had a 6 pack of beer but no liquor around). 
Basically by the end of the night something snapped inside of her and she was throwing glasses at me, locking me outside, throwing my things around, calling me names, and saying horrible things about my relationship. She ruined half of the clothes I packed by pouring things on them and throwing them outside. At one point she pushed me against the wall and put her hands around my throat. 
I ended up calling her parents in the middle of the night in tears and telling them something bad had happened and I couldn’t stay through the night. They ended up driving up while I forced myself to stay there because I didn’t want to leave her alone while she was in this condition even though every part of my body wanted to run. I was scared. 
By the time they got there she had woke up and had no idea what had happened and was trying to say I was the one who was doing all those things to her. 

I feel like this is the straw breaking the camels back. She may or may not remember the things she did or said to me but I do, and I don’t know that I can forgive her this time. I want her to get help and to get better but I feel like for me...my best interest is to cut her off. I don’t want her anywhere near me or my wedding and my FH agrees, he’s seen enough of it and knows how much she’s put me through and can only forgive so much. 

I guess I just need some advice. I love her and wish her the best but I have to do what’s best for me too, right? Right now I have her number blocked. I don’t know who she is anymore and can’t picture her standing beside me on the most important day of my life anymore.

310,"tl;dr: Owner of a local coffee shop leaves her infant in a stroller outside of her business? Should I be concerned, or stop being so nervous and mind my own business?

Thanks!!!

\------

Occasionally the owner of a local coffee shop brings her infant to  work and places it in the hallway outside of her business. Really, it's [on the skyway/skywalk/skybridge, so outside of the actual building](https://imgur.com/a/Yfes3HG).

The first time I walked past the stroller on my way to work, I looked in, thinking ""I'm  sure this is just an empty stroller, and there's no way there's a baby inside  of it... HOLY CRAP! THERE'S A BABY!!!"" I walked around the corner expecting to find some woman with a diaper  bag ordering a coffee, but were no customers.

I looked at the woman  behind the counter and said with concern ""Um, there's an infant in a  stroller out here!""  
She looked up and said ""Yep.""  
Awkward pause - ""Um... is it yours?""  
""Yes, it's mine.""  
""Uh, ok, I just want to make sure it's taken care of...""  
""It is."" 

 Since then, I've seen her bring the baby to work about 1-3 times a week. 

&amp;#x200B;

# My major concerns:

* Mother brings her infant to work and leaves it in an open place accessible by the public
* Low visibility between mother and infant (view blocked by counter, portable wall - [see photos](https://imgur.com/a/Yfes3HG))
* Only one person working at a time, so mother may be distracted/unable to respond to infant if dealing with customers
* The hallway is used by the public, and has a lot of foot traffic
* The coffee shop is on the skyway, located between the downtown bus station, and court-mandated drug/alcohol resources (testing, therapy, etc)

# Additional info:

* I think the baby was born early summer (June?), and the first I saw it in the hallway was August
* The woman is the co-owner of the coffee shop (with her husband), so she's not just an employee that I could report to her manager
* I'm unsure if there are possible food/health code violations if caring for an infant, then serving food

# What do I do?

* Who do I report the situation to? Police? Child Protective Services? The Health Department?

313,"I am 99% sure the answers I receive here will most likely be “you’re crazy, leave him” but I need to talk this one out.

I’ve (26/F) been living with my partner (27/M) for the last year, I entered this relationship fully aware of his mental health and past relationship history, I didn’t enter this shit blind. The day we moved into together I found out that the reason he had such sporadic contact with his son was that he once hit his ex. He assured me that it happened once and that afterwards, he took anger management classes, attended counselling and that the event had destroyed his life, he wanted nothing more than to become a better person. This happened over 5 years ago and I found it difficult to reconcile the image I had of him with a guy who hits women so I accepted he had changed.

He’s got pretty awful depression and I’m now in the situation where we have “fights” on these occasions, I’ll have committed some awful crime (didn’t wash dishes, didn’t take out recycling) and instantly he hates me, I’m the worst person ever and ruining his life. I’m boring as we never do anything even though his anxiety prevents him from wanting to attend anything social. My life has gone from being pretty full to being his carer. I have lost most of my friends as I don’t go out anymore. If I do go out then I’m spending my free time without him which is also something he finds upsetting. If I don’t go out then I’m boring and have no pals. These fights haven’t ended in violence but he has thrown away my purse, poured cold water over me and smashed my phone. During these “fights” he doesn’t look like himself and talks like another person. This morning he walked around our home pretending he was a famous comedian and like all famous comedians, planning on killing himself. He painted pictures of this and also one of me and a traumatic incident from my childhood.

So, I should leave right? He’s mentally unstable but I worry that if I leave him he has nothing and will kill himself. I’m also not in a great financial situation at the moment and I can’t stay with family or friends as I’ve lost them all over the previous year. If I stay what do I do? He regularly misses doctors appointments and has been threatening to come off his medication on the days he feels fine. Meanwhile I’ve found myself in a pretty grim mental health state as well. If I leave our apartment I have nowhere to go and I’ll have to pay rent on it as well as losing the deposit.

TLDR partner is unwell and destroying my mental health but I care about him more than I should and also can’t afford to leave. I’m an idiot but I don’t know what steps i need to take.

I asked out a girl this week and got a yes. I had hit it off with her before, and we were in a few clubs together at university. I set up a coffee date and got kind of a mixed answer, but I went along anyway. The ""date"" was fantastic. We had a really great conversation that wasn't awkward at all, and I was able to be myself and share my interests without feeling fake. The only thing was that it didn't feel like a date. We really just hung out. I decided to text her a few hours later saying that I had a really good time and asking her if she'd be up for a real date.

She gave me the age-old message of ""I really enjoy your company but I'd rather stay friends"". Well, that sucks. I thought we shared a lot of interests, and we got along well. Now I'm feeling shitty about this and college in general. I think I was trying to find someone to date to help me stop feeling so lonely. I found a girl who I really liked, and who I thought liked me, and I thought it would help things. At the moment I'm feeling pretty damn lonely at school. It's a large workload and I don't have many friends. I'm pretty shy and reserved, with some social anxiety. I have some people I text and talk to sure, but I don't have a group of people to hang out with, and I eat alone most of the time. I have little to no motivation to do my work. I know I'm depressed. It's not all bad. I'm in a couple of really cool clubs, and one of them has a family-type bond going on. Guess what, that girl is in this group. And I feel like I'm an outcast in it. I make a lot of jokes that fall flat and I feel like they don't like me as much as the other freshman who have joined. Now I have to see her all the time there, and I’m pretty sure she’s into one of the other guys there.

I don't know what I'm going to do, but I'm sick of feeling second-rate. I know I'm feeling sorry for myself, but I don't know how to not be. I have shit to do but guess what, it isn't getting done.

Fast forward to present time, he attempted to contact me on FB messenger asking if I got remarried (I assume because I changed my last name on FB so only people who I want to contact me has my obscure last name). He is able to find me on FB because we used FB when we were dating and were friends on there so my posts are probably still on his wall. He was attempting to contact me every few years, telling me I’ve gotten more beautiful as I’ve gotten older, etc. I blocked him on FB entirely now. Today he requested my friendship on IG and it got me fired up. My IG is private. There are no mutual friends of ours that I am following on IG so he had to do some digging to find me.

324,"My husband’s ex girlfriend, who he was with for about 18 years (during which time they lived together), has told him out of the blue that she believes he owes her about $3-$4K from when he lived with her 5 years ago during a six month period. 

It is true that she carried him mostly during the last six months because he was starting a new profession and still getting traction. He was always hustling for work (he has hustle), and tried to cost as little as possible - starved himself. He did contribute to groceries with paychecks and food stamps, and gave her all money the he could. I know him to not be a spender. During their relationship, he fully professionally painted the interior of their home, refinished the floor, installed drip irrigation in tne yard, bought expensive furnishings, art, tech, and housewares. All with his labor and money. There were long periods when he was the sole breadwinner so she could focus on making art. All he took when he left was clothes and personal items. He left everything with her.

During the past five years, they have remained tenuous friends. But, he was unaware that she believed he owed her money. I asked before we got married to be absolutely sure, and he was certain they were square. He does truly want peace with her, and if he had believed he owed her, he would have squared up. He had a few other people to get square with, and did at that time.

Her contention was that all the work on the house, all the things purchased by him were done as a couple, and don’t offset her carrying him during the last six months. She believes he owes her rent, utilities, food costs, and is angry that he didn’t give 30 days notice before moving out. She believes he was hiding money from her. The facts seem to be that he had a good week that enabled him to put together enough to put a deposit on a place to live. He gave her two weeks notice, but as soon as he gave notice, the situation became unbearable. He had to leave immediately and find places to sleep for two weeks.

He wants peace with her, but feels he’s given her more than enough over the years. He told her firmly but politely no twice already. She is being very aggressive and unkind. Her view of the situation really demonizes him. Even though he’s not keen on a friendship, he doesn’t want an enemy. He just wants it to be over and the drama to end. But he has guilt, because he is just that way. He wants it all to just be okay. Telling her no is not something that was acceptable, so he feels like he’s in trouble. So,  there is conflict in him.

I don’t want to give her money, but we are partners, and I want to be open to his emotional needs too. I told him that I am open to it on the condition that she provide not just itemization, but evidence of what is owed. I believe that giving her money will not fix anything with her. She resents that he finally got his shit together, started taking care of himself, got much better work, got married, and is a step father. He wouldn’t “do it for her.” Well, he did it for himself, while I gave him some assists when he got discouraged and relentlessly cheered from the sidelines.

328,"So throwaway for personal reasons:

I'm not sure what to do - this takes place in the United States in the state of New Jersey. It is in regard to my family and more specifically to my brother.

My older brother has been diagnosed with Mental Illness -Schizo-effective disorder. He hasn't really admitted to hearing voices or any other things however has spun up an elaborate story in regard to famous people he knows. How he was kept from certain things that he's remembering now. etc.

These things are not true and he's been suffering this disorder which really didn't come to light until about 5 or so years ago. He's been in and out of mental hospitals in this time.

The main issue is - he doesn't acknowledge his illness - he thinks he has PTSD - the other issue is because of his illness he's incredibly intense and can give off an aura of threatening - his main outlet is through Anger, people need to listen to him, if you're not listening or disagree it's an issue.

Due to the fact this has happened for a good part of his life, his employment history is poor and he's having times even getting a job at a fast food joint. This constant rejection is also having a negative effect. 

He lives with an elderly parent whom is having an issue with the stress and abuse, we moved them both there (they've lived together previously) because we thought we'd be moving them to a better place, and while the place is nice since they're both very poor (I assist in keeping their head above water) getting around without a car or transportation is also a very big issue.

My concern is this - I'm trying to start a life with a woman whom has taken this all in somewhat good stride (won't say there haven't been issues) and I don't know what to do for the future. My parent is old and barely able to take care of themselves and adding a person with issues is not helping that situation. My family has their own issues where basically all relationships are toxic in one way or another and it seems like we all have our issues.

He gets something from the government but it wouldn't be enough to support himself in even the cheapest of places in the United States - I don't want to commit him, I just want the best for him but he needs help and support I cannot provide and honestly I'm in no way shape financially to support both my brother and try to create a family of my own. This causes me a lot of stress because while he can be abusive to me, there are times where it's like there is a moment of clarity and he realizes and he's sorry. I know more than often it's the illness. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know of any support groups or assistance groups in New Jersey that can assist with some sort of situation like this? Mental health care in this country sucks (like everywhere else) and I fear that eventually things just get to a point where things are really bad.

335,"So, just so you can get a better view of the situation, I'm a teenage girl- 14 to be exact. What means I'm going to high school next year. Primary and middle schools are, like together in my country so I'm generally in primary currently. Also we have the same people in all of the classes. 
The thing.
I have this friend. Let's name her Vee (not her real name, it's just easier). I've known her for about 4 years because we go to school together but she's been in 'my class' for a year. Before- we only had PE together. I almost never talked to her and if I'm being honest, I disliked her. Well now I see Vee everyday and we talk everyday and it's all great but our relationship is kind of weird. About 2 years ago she started to kinda annoy me on purpose? It was all funny but I was always a little mad at her, not for long though. But once, she annoyed me to this point I yelled 'f*ck you' at her(I was 12 and innocent so yeah, it is quite a lot). I don't know what happened but with some reason she thought I hated her. And we would joke about it anyway. When she changed classed or whatever you'd call it, she would STILL joke about it. Anyway almost everyone thinks we hate each other, I remember when a teacher once asked me if she bullied me or something lol. But we have a really good relationship honestly. She still is annoying and we laugh all the time- literally but I guess that's just how it is. But you know, I really love her. To make it clear- it's obviously platonic love. Some examples? I would do anything just to walk home with her. I literally got so happy when she messaged me although she just wanted some school stuff. I kind of am getting jealous of her bestie. I mean I have my 'bestie' too but we really aren't that close anymore. I'm just obsessed. Also the thing is that I'm ready to go to a different high school just to go to the same as her. Seriously, I know how dumb it sounds but it's not my fault I am like this. Also lately I feel some weird things, I feel like I'm gonna miss her so much when we go to different high schools and that we won't keep in touch, agh! Listening to sad music and crying doesn't help it. I don't even know if it just anxiety and I'm gonna get over her right away but it sucks. She's freaking hilarious and she kind of feels... trustworthy? Its just everyone I know seems at least a little fake (even myself) and she is just how she is. I mean you basically can't, not like her. Some other example, just because she messaged me yesterday, I was texting her instead of studying, knowing of the two exams we were supposed to have. And the last thing that bothers me the most- she doesn't know about any of this. She thinks I think of her as an acquaintance. She thinks I don't like her. I wish I could just tell her this shit but she would think i'm a creep so it's a no from me😂 I hope someone can help though. If I forgot to mention something important just ask, I would appreciate all the help I can get and sorry for my english! ",24Sep2018,8
337,"Hi Reddit.  Throwaway account chimin' in here, cause let's just say I'm not proud of my ""sleepy sloth man"" tendencies. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a freshman in college and I have no idea how to work hard. Bit of backstory: My parents divorced when I was five, and from then on I was raised by my single mom - I was spoiled to death. Never had chores asides from the occasional ""Pick up your video games, they're all over the living room."" I never tried hard in school. Middle school was when I began to procrastinate - I was consistently placed into lower classes not because I didn't do the work well - I just rarely did it on time. The procrastination got worse and worse through high school; as each semester drew to a close I would repeat the all too familiar ritual of haphazardly blazing through tens of unfinished assignments in order to snatch a passing grade. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got my first job at a Walgreens as a Customer Service Associate when I was a sophomore in HS. That was a joke though, my best friend worked there too. Sure I put tags up and stocked shelves, but I was mostly just goofin' off with my friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

Two years later, during the summer in-between senior year of HS and freshman year of college, I got a job as a busboy at a steakhouse. This turned out to be one of the hardest things I'd done in my life - I was struggling to cope with the nonstop franticness, the constantly being on my feet, on the look out, awaiting direction. I worked there for a little over two months, and was very eager to give my two weeks notice. I did not handle my time there well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Somewhere along the lines I got it into my head that I can't do anything right, so I shouldn't even bother trying to do anything.. Logically, I can denounce this, because it's ridiculous. But I'm a perfectionist, and I more often than not discourage myself from doing anything, because if I can't do it perfectly, then what's the point? This baggage has proved to be very detrimental to my ability to be productive, as over the last two years I've grown apathetic and weak-willed, my motivation has been drained. On top of all of this I also have your classic teenage depression, angst, and all the existential crises that accompany it. Fearing death and questioning life doesn't help me get my homework done...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at a point in my life where I need to take it into my hands. Prior, I've gotten away with passively sliding by, and I've grown so accustomed to sloth like habits and mindsets. I'm two weeks into college (music college, mind you (my classes aren't even that difficult)), and I'm already proving to be a disaster. I rarely leave my dorm asides for classes and eating at the caf, and I'm already behind in most of my classes homework-wise. What do I do in my dorm, you ask? Stress eat boxes and boxes of Life cereal while watching Community on Hulu. Three seasons in a week - it's like I don't want to actually experience college, so I just watch a show about it instead. I think I'm scared of hard work, for some reason? Scared of committing to something. It's like I don't believe in myself, I don't have faith that I'm capable of doing it. And so I don't do it. My emotion and logic are at a war: Logically, I acknowledge that I will get no where near where I want to be in my life if I don't start working hard. Emotionally, I want to sleep all day and never leave my dorm and binge watch Community.

So, I have what some would call, chronic, unrelenting, f--- my life, insomnia. It comes and goes, but when it comes, it sticks around like a hungry stray cat. I have tried EVERYTHING my friends and Dr. Google have recommended: melatonin, lavender oil, chamomile tea, warm bath, soothing music, counting backward from 100, exercise (but not right before bed,) keeping a regular schedule, avoiding caffeine, everything short whacking myself over the head with a brick. The only thing that's ever helped is sleeping pills. Years ago I took a prescription that I can't recall the name of, and more recently I took Tamazepam. Tamazepam didn't always help, but sometimes it did if I took a double dose.

&amp;#x200B;

My current doctor(s) won't prescribe anything. They both say that dependence on pills is a bad idea and it's better to find a natural remedy, then proceed to list all the things I've already tried. One doctor actually said ""Have you tried turning the lights off and laying down?"" Thanks doc, you're a genius. I need to sleep a good 6-7 hours, at least 3-4 times a week to feel normal and functional. For the last few weeks I've been lucky if I fall asleep at all most nights and when I do, I'm super lucky to get 3 or 4 hours. I understand that dependence on pills isn't healthy, but I feel like if I could get my sleep under control then I would have the capacity to deal with the cause. 

&amp;#x200B;

Though not a doctor, I'm 99.98% sure the cause is anxiety combined with the fact that I think too much and can't turn my brain off, which leads to anxiety. Circle back and repeat. I know that I don't have sleep apnea (I don't even snore or breath  loudly in sleep) and I don't wake up frequently; once I fall good and asleep I stay asleep until my alarm wakes me. Unfortunately, the time that I fall asleep (if at all) and the time my alarm rings are way too close together.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone offer advice on how to (legally) get sleeping pills?",24Sep2018,1
339,"Our Company had a celebration to where I (20) was attending. I drunked eventually to much and the son of my boss (19) too. We had a great time laughing drinking talking. After time passed we were both drunk and cold that we decided to go home together. Our way home was similar so we walked along. He was holding my hand the entire time and we cuddled too even in front of the boss. His son dont work at pur company but he is there sometimes to help out. He didnt want me to walk alone the 2 minutes I had ahead so we discussed for like 10 minutes straight So I decided to follow his path. There was a bench nearby we sat and talked again it was so cold. Just to stop his body from trembling I sat on his lap in the riding position to comfort him. We talked about things like his hair color, and blabla but out of the context from the conversation we began to kiss and I was grinding my lower body against his and I thought okay it was JUST a kiss + thats all. Nothing to worry about but then he started rubbing my clit And that is how it began. He entered a finger in there and he wanted to take me on the bench but I didn't want anyone who passed by to see what we were going to do. So I followed him to a field nearby and bended over the fence and he was taking me from behind telling me he intends to put it out before he came but little did he know I did math. 1. I don't take birth control (luckly I'm not pregnant) I am always freaking loud when I have sex cause I feel it and need to express what I feel and I didn't care to wake up the whole neighbourhood with my moans. I took his dick in my mouth but it dindt work so we were going back to businesses and he thrusted faster, the louder I was. After some time passed  It was so cold for me that I told him to stop midway. He did and that's the thing. I feel sorry that he didn't cum at all. We just continued our talk and walk. While walking he was still fingering me. But we had to say goodbye so we parted our ways. Thats it. 


What should I do.

1. Telling him that I'm sorry for him not to cum because of me and eventually try again secretly? (Friends with benefits)
2. Sending him a picture on Snapchat that I had drawn to get back at normal friendship terms hoping that the fire will spark again in some time in the future? (Good friends with in sometime mayyybe a happy end)
3. Telling myself that it was just a one night stand and forget about it? 
4. Just kiss him the next time I see him.

I was thinking what's the game is about.. I must know cause Iam scared to get attached to him I didn't date for my entire life because I'm afraid of that what comes after. The pain the tears the hearbreak.  I just need to know it now. I can separate such thing's as lust, friendship, love and professionalism from each other. But I need to know early to prepare my emotion for what is coming.

The thing is my boss sees me like his own daughter like all other youngsters in our company he call us kids. He cares for us and help us. So even though when I'm eventually dating his son I don't think it would interfere with my work cause the son is not someone who would tell his farther to fire me because he hates me. So that's not something to worry about.

Please let me know what you think about this after reading the whole story and tell me what y'all thinking After reading the title again. I need advice it's the first time for me to do such a slutty thing.",24Sep2018,1
340,"I've been trying to slowly lose contact with a group of ""friends"" but my actions and feelings keep contradicting my thoughts... It was and probably still would be fun hanging out with them, but so many times I have felt like they don't really like or need me. I felt really replaceable and unnecessary to their group.

But I always keep getting back to them and when they invite me, I feel like I would, if possible, immediately agree to go or hang out.

What would be the best way to actually know what I truly want? If I keep hanging out with them only because of a kind of attachment to them, would it actually bring me happiness? Or if I do want to fade out of the group, how do I stop feeling sad when I'm not invited or even how do I stop thinking about them?",24Sep2018,5

343,"Some context: I’m 18 and in sixth form college. At the beginning of August I took a part time job at a large international retailer. They pay every two weeks. 

When I started working there, I should have been sent a payroll ID and a till passcode. I received neither, and only got my payroll ID when I got my first payslip, which should have had about 21 hours worth of wages on it. It had nothing. I asked Manager A about this, and he said he’d look into it, and that I should get paid soon.

A few days pass, and Manager A texts back saying that my owed wages were going to be rolled over to the next payday in 2 weeks time. He confirmed that I would definitely get paid then. This was inconvenient, but I didn’t want to kick up a fuss since I’d only just got the job a couple of weeks ago, so I said it was fine.

The next payday comes, and I do get paid, but only for the hours I’d done since getting my first payslip. I spoke to Manager A again, who seemed confused, said he’d look into it again. 

Several days later, during work, Manager B asks me to add up how many hours I’d done before getting my first payslip. I did so, and she sent the amount to to Manager A. He is shocked at the amount of hours, and after some back and forth it transpires that he’d misunderstood the severity of the situation - he’d been under the impression that I had been paid, but was just missing a little bit of the money (I’m not sure where he got this idea). I was then assured that they would roll the money over to the next payday. 

Another couple of days pass, bringing me to today, when I was called in so Manager A could basically tell me that Head Office wasn’t going to sort the situation out. Apparently, they were saying that I shouldn’t have been working without a payroll ID - even though they didn’t send me one - and that therefore they weren’t going to pay me for the hours I’d done prior to having one. I was also told that them sorting through my schedules and figuring out what they owe me would take months (even though I’d already done it in 15 minutes tops). 

Manager A has proposed that, for the next several pay periods, he will subtly book in phantom shifts for me, where I don’t have to come in but will still get paid. This means that it will take several weeks to accumulate the value of the work I haven’t been paid for. He is fully aware that he’s going behind the company’s back to do this. 

The issue is, he’s leaving at the end of this week, so there’s a potential continuity issue with the unofficial phantom shifts arrangement, because the new manager won’t know about them. I’m planning on asking Manager A  to put the arrangement in writing, so that the new manager will be aware of it.

I’ve got a really bad feeling that I’m not going to get paid at all. What I’m owed is quite a substantial amount of money to me, and given how many different excuses I’ve been given and how much of a shambles the whole affair has been, I’m not feeling at all confident that another issue isn’t going to come up. The problem is, I can’t really quit, because then there is basically zero chance of me getting paid. 

I’ve spoken to my colleagues, and some of them have had similar issues, but nothing on the same scale as what’s going on here. I’m feeling very trapped. How should I proceed?",24Sep2018,1
345,"Hi there,

I am currently a computer science and math major with a minor in electrical engineering. I recently was offered the opportunity to apply for a paid, with housing, meals, and travel fully paid for biomedical eng. research internship, which I’m half positive that I can still apply for even though my major doesn’t exactly line up. However, I’m starting to wonder why I never did biomedical engineering other than my school doesn’t offer it (though I had the opportunity to pick from many other schools). I’m wondering if I should change my minor to biology in order to hopefully work on my graduate degree in Biomedical Informatics, or if it doesn’t matter that much. I’m already in my 3/5 years and I’m pretty sure if I wanted to get my bio minor it would either set me back or make life harder. I’m not really sure where I’m going after I graduate but I’m very interested in biology and data science, and I also figure biomedical informatics would be personally fulfilling because I’d be helping people.

346,I just started my sophmore year of highschool and my parents are just being douchebags towards me and my mother especially is always in a terrible mood. They arent supporting me at all and if i am literally sick im forced to go to school and bear through the day whilst throwing up or anything else. They seem to have no trust in me and dont take my word at all. For instance if i want to stay home from school i have to have literal proof of me being sick so i need something like a picture of puke and it gets me really mad that my parents act like this towards me. It is not like i do bad in school i am a A-B student and i do well. I am also punished for the most stupid things such as trying to change their minds on something (i want to be able to have to not go to bed when they say. I think i can manage my time well enough) and if i try to have a civil conversation or debate with them im shot down and if i say anything else im grounded. It makes me avoid them as much as possible and i just want to know how can i get them to have more trust in me and how can i get them to change their minds on something?

349,"Hi, I‘m a 15 yr old high school student from Germany. I‘m living together with my parents and my little 10 yr old sister. My sister is not very clever. To be honest, this is her 2nd year at the middle school and she’s one of the worst in her class. Actually, they almost even kicked her from school last year. She never does her homework, she gets bad grates all the time and she‘s 24/7 on her stupid phone doing god knows what. My parents already lost the hope that she’s gonna be something later. To help her to get better at school, I‘m helping her with her homework etc. 

Today I helped her with her math homework. I started to explain everything to her but like always she never listened to me. She just kept ignoring me while looking on her phone. Then she’s like „Uhh, I don’t understand. You can’t explain it bla bla bla“. That‘s her method: She always acts like I‘m not explaining it to her, she tells my parents I didn’t help her and then they blame for her grades. How would you feel when you try to help someone but he/she keeps try to get you in trouble? Anyways, this time I was sick of this. I got angry and I slapped her. It was the first time for a while that I slapped her and it felt wrong .I told her I‘m worried about her future and she needs to do something. My sister started to cry

Seconds later my father came in. He almost destroyed everything near him. My controllers, my TV, my books etc. Then he told me „You‘re not getting anything this birthday.“ (My birthday is two days). I‘m ok with that, but I‘m sad and depressed at the moment. I‘m crying in my room alone since an hour. Am I a bad brother? Did I overreact? Am I now completely unimportant in the eyes of my parents? How should I talk to them?

I‘m thankful for every answer...

So my friend recently moved into a new apartment. To keep a long story short, we had just gone out shopping and came back to a weird string tied to her door. Now where she lives is basically a condominium complex where you have to have keys to get in the building initially, and then keys to your own door to your particular condominium. So whoever did this would have to be someone who lives there or knows someone who does. 

On her door, there is the letter for her particular unit towards the top. There was a blue string tied to this letter and then wrapped around the door knob. We’ve asked people what it could mean but no one knows, but it does make everyone uneasy. Should she be worried? Any advice or insight as to what that string could be?

So I'm from the UK and plan on moving to Berlin next June to attend a coding school for a few months then hopefully find work and stay in the city. Unfortunate politics aside, I'm wondering whether I should start converting my money in increments from £ to € early. 

The Brexit result in March may or may not completely tank the value of the pound (it's dropped in recent years to the Euro already) and this would completely destroy all my plans if it came to pass. I'm saving about £10k total and have just under £4k in savings so far. The hassle I guess is that I would have thousands of Euros in cash stashed in the house.

What would you do?",24Sep2018,1
359,"Long story short, my parents went with our neighbour's recommendation for a builder to do a joint loft conversion with said neighbour. Our reasoning was this neighbour is an electrician and would have some decent contacts in construction, and that he would also be able to do the wiring. We found out once the building work started that our neighbour and this builder are school friends. This is what has happened so far: 

1. The builders aren't following the structural engineer's and architect's plans, and have skimped on some beams intended for supporting the roof
2. The builders have cut corners in other structures intended for support 
3. The builders have attempted to double charge for several items as the project expanded from a loft conversion to a whole house renovation 
4. The builder has invited his own building site inspector to attend the the project, but this has been delayed as work has gone ahead. (We could have invited our own but he has reassured us this guy is going to visit) 
5. Our neighbour's costs for the electric work keeps rising from the original price he quoted, which we found higher than what other electricians would charge (but we kept quiet to give him the benefit of the doubt)

The best case scenario is we are overcharged for a loft that stays upright with no construction flaws. The worst is that we are charged an astronomical amount for a roof that collapses on us as we sleep. We've lost any trust we've had in someone living next to us, which is shitty.

I have a man in my life who has been my best friend outside of my sister for over 7 years, and for 4 years of that he has been my boyfriend. I love him with everything i am, and even thinking about not having him in my life legitimately makes me feel like my life would be empty, because having him in my life as a best friend and part of my family, is something i have decided is a life fact for me. Its how I want to live my life, with him as a important part of me.

However, I am the kind of person who needs to be alone to know that I'm truly growing into who I am, to know I am me, and of my own creation, to reach my own heights in the genetics and synthetic biology career labs, and just as a person, to be the best and change the world. I have to do it for me, and I have to do it alone. That's what strength is, and that's just the environment i need to really strive in my life.

Other information in this that is useful: I struggle to feel real sexual passion toward my boyfriend now, even know I love him to the depths of my soul, and feel so alone, because we are long distance(three states away) and that wont change anytime soon. I know he is deeply unhappy as well, because he truly wants to move in together, and get married, but I don't believe in marriage. I would live with someone, but remain in different bedrooms, to retain who I am, and just we could switch bedrooms if we want to cuddle or else. He is deeply unhappy with the idea of never marrying me, even know he intitally said it was fine as long as he was with me, but I think maybe it wasn't fine :( Its killing him and that breaks my heart. Me not being close, and not wanting to marry due to trauma in my past has just drained who he is, and he is losing himself. I want to help, with his career, his happiness, his relationships with friends and just, everything in his life, but I'm not sure what I can actually do so far away :(

I am faced with having to leave him, just so he doesn't fade into a completely different person :( just to remain myself, so he can be happy... even know he swears that he could never love anyone but me, even if i leave forever.

what can i do :( i want to save him, save us, but i cannot sentence myself to my own death by tying myself down when i need to be growing into who I am meant to be. I realize this is mostly on me too :( I'm not being the girlfriend I need to be, I'm distant, i don't make him feel sexy anymore :( or make him feel secure, because i know i may date other people in my life, i just... :( i cant bear to hurt him, i love him with everything i am...

365,"My fiancé and I decided to become engaged a few months ago (although we've planned a specific engagement day, where we'd thereafter refer to each other as such). In the planning, we wanted to make the announcement to our families special, so we decided to host a secret engagement party under the guise that it's a fall party. 

We told family about the ""fall party"" months ago, all said they'd attend, and then we sent out invitations a couple weeks ago. Immediately my fiancé's family all said yes, of course they'd attend (again, no one knows we're actually engaged and that this is an engagement party). 

My family, however, has ALL declined. They've always been super flaky, at best. I've been falsely accused of prioritizing my fiancé's family more than my own. I don't, they're just WAY more involved with their son, than my family is with me. My family won't be somewhere unless there's something in it for them, or it makes them look good. Like a wedding or my son's birthday party. But anything smaller than that, they don't think it matters. But again, they will tell me I don't try hard enough to be part of the family. My mother has a personality disorder (shoutout to r/raisedbynarcissists), so we have had many issues. So honestly, it didn't surprise me that they'd all decline. In fact, I told my fiancé last night that I could see this happening. 

Their rejection isn't aggressive or violent. It's simply kind of ""Well, I have other things going on, I don't want to go, excuses, blahblahblah."" Just ""Sorry, we can't make it."" Which really means, ""We don't care enough to show up."" 

My sister's birthday is the day before the party, and she literally told me she doesn't want to go because ""that's not how I want to spend my birthday."" 

So here's the thing, if I told them the truth and I said, ""Actually we need you to be there because this is our engagement party,"" they'd be more inclined to attend. But if we don't and they find out what it really was later, I'll be blamed for not telling them. But to me, it shouldn't have to be a huge deal for them to give a shit about being part of my life. I sent you an invitation, so clearly you are a priority to me. Why am I not a priority to you? 

As horrible as they sound, I still love them, and I'd like for them to be part of this. But I also don't want to beg them and reveal our announcement, just to try and coerce them into realizing it's important that they attend.

What should we do? I told my fiancé that maybe I should just move on, it's their loss, and invite a few of my closest friends to attend since there will be more room, and they are super supportive. ",24Sep2018,1

The GF is cheating, sleeping with two other guys, and one of them gave her herpes. She then gave herpes to her boyfriend.

Some back story. I am currently in my mid 30's, When I was 17 I was homeless and dropped out of school for work to survive. I took up cooking jobs and even landed a job running the wheel at a known restaurant downtown. At 21 made some poor choices and ended up homeless in Arizona and after finding a job at a electronic box store I eventually ended up in Pennsylvania another location. Later after progressing a few spots I ended back in the Midwest. I did some more retail stuff and then did some bouncing gigs at clubs and strip clubs. This ended after a night I got shot at and decided to hit up a temp agency. I have also gotten married during this time. My wife has several mental health issues which I will come back to.

My wife isn't able to maintain employment due to her mental health issues. I also cannot afford to put her on my insurance cause I would take home 50-60% less. Every problem just seems to hit me at once, her car has issues and we are down to mine. Mine now is freaking out about the air pressure censors. I had sheriffs show up at my door pounding when I am at work with no idea for what. Its a rough day for me, normally I have a billion concerns and I do my best to stay above the water handling who gets paid and juggling anything that comes my way. its constant work and constant stress. 

The drama at my current work has been hellish as of late, its been so up and down. We hired a new employee near the end of  last year who has been involved romantically with the owner and has caused way too much drama. I have received texts and phone calls regarding their relationship and have asked for it to stop. The owner has done his part but it still happens from time to time. I was looking at new line of work but honestly I am scared. I am the solo income provider and a shitty one at that. In my state I have to go to a place and take a test for my GED. It is hard to take time off to get this done when everyday off hurts so much. I feel like a failure even if I am just surviving and barely that is. My wife's medicine is some what pricey. I tried looking into disability but she can't handle the interviews and breaks down. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do I just risk it and start applying everywhere? I need to make more than I am currently, no doubts about it. I have 8+ years in IT currently, mostly in repair and service. I deal with consultants on a daily basis solving their problems or providing parts or machines. I know a second job could help but I also have responsibilities at home such as making sure she is feed, the animals are taken care of and even my self to take care of. It's like a second job already. I still get up and get my butt to work an hour early each day to make sure everything else is taken care of it hopes it alleviates other problems from rising. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do I just start applying in hopes they over look the lack of a diploma? Is it something my experience in the field can really overcome? 

Is there a field that calls for an experienced IT guy with bouncing and cooking experience?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Homeless at 17, HS Dropout. Made a living as a cook, bouncer, and loads of IT work. Wife is not able to work. I don't make enough to support us. Not sure what options I have. Its okay to be drowning, I just want to get past this never ending survival mode and maybe thrive a little? I can't always be a failure right?",24Sep2018,1
369,"So I fell in love with a coworker who eventually became a really good friend of mine. I moved cities and still can't get over her. I told her how I felt about her, but she has a boyfriend so didn't really tell me if she felt similarly or not. 

It's been almost a year since I last saw her in person. We still text like once a month but I think about her every day. It usually just leaves me feeling sad and depressed. I follow her on instagram and always find myself looking at her profile and seeing what posts she likes, who she follows, etc. I've been depressed for a while now and this is a large contributor to that.

Should I cut ties with her? I don't want to like straight up ignore her if she texts me, but I'm not sure what else I can do. We used to be really good friends and she told me she cares about me, but she doesn't know how much this is affecting my life. ",24Sep2018,2
371,"My fiancé and I decided to become engaged a few months ago (although we've planned a specific engagement day, where we'd thereafter refer to each other as such). In the planning, we wanted to make the announcement to our families special, so we decided to host a secret engagement party under the guise that it's a fall party. 

We told family about the ""fall party"" months ago, all said they'd attend, and then we sent out invitations a couple weeks ago. Immediately my fiancé's family all said yes, of course they'd attend (again, no one knows we're actually engaged and that this is an engagement party). 

My family, however, has ALL declined. They've always been super flaky, at best. I've been falsely accused of prioritizing my fiancé's family more than my own. I don't, they're just WAY more involved with their son, than my family is with me. My family won't be somewhere unless there's something in it for them, or it makes them look good. Like a wedding or my son's birthday party. But anything smaller than that, they don't think it matters. But again, they will tell me I don't try hard enough to be part of the family. My mother has a personality disorder (shoutout to r/raisedbynarcissists), so we have had many issues. So honestly, it didn't surprise me that they'd all decline. In fact, I told my fiancé last night that I could see this happening. 

Their rejection isn't aggressive or violent. It's simply kind of ""Well, I have other things going on, I don't want to go, excuses, blahblahblah."" Just ""Sorry, we can't make it."" Which really means, ""We don't care enough to show up."" 

My sister's birthday is the day before the party, and she literally told me she doesn't want to go because ""that's not how I want to spend my birthday."" 

So here's the thing, if I told them the truth and I said, ""Actually we need you to be there because this is our engagement party,"" they'd be more inclined to attend. But if we don't and they find out what it really was later, I'll be blamed for not telling them. But to me, it shouldn't have to be a huge deal for them to give a shit about being part of my life. I sent you an invitation, so clearly you are a priority to me. Why am I not a priority to you? 

As horrible as they sound, I still love them, and I'd like for them to be part of this. But I also don't want to beg them and reveal our announcement, just to try and coerce them into realizing it's important that they attend.

What should we do? I told my fiancé that maybe I should just move on, it's their loss, and invite a few of my closest friends to attend since there will be more room, and they are super supportive. ",24Sep2018,1

373,"So I'm suppose to be going on a trip mid next week to Negril, Jamaica with my boyfriend and his family for a week. This trip was originally suppose to be for my boyfriend cousin's wedding. However the wedding has been postponed a year do to a close family member falling ill. 

We both just graduated school and have just started working in the last 6 months. I don't really have any money and will be missing a week's worth of work and pay as I don't get vacation as I'm not full time. Currently I live with roommates and not with my boyfriend. I have to live very frugal and month to month just to get by. Money is very tight for me and missing a week of work will hurt me a lot.

We were pretty much pressured into going and had to spend 1700+ for the trip. I had set aside part of a bursary I got in my final year just to be able to pay for the trip. It was money I would have rather put toward my school dept but because we were pressured was unable to. 

I just found out that the chance of it thunderstorming the whole week we are there is about 80% all day each day. So not an ideal way to spend a vacation. Vacations are suppose to be relaxing but this is feeling more stressful then anything.

I've wanted to cancel this trip for the last 2 months because of my final situation  but have been unable to as the family member who booked the trip for us had insisted upon getting insurance which we all said okay to but then decided last minute not to and didn't tell us about it. So even if we do cancel we can't get the money back. The only Silver lining is that because of the wedding being postponed the resort or travel agency ( I'm not sure which) is offering all the guests a full credit for next year.

I'm really not sure what I'm suppose to do. I can't afford this trip but I know if I say I'm not going and I'll take the credit I'll never here the end of it from the people that originally pressured us into signing up for this.",24Sep2018,1

&amp;#x200B;

Last year a lecturer said I was unprofessional

*""This conversation was held in an almost mechanical fashion with Stormclouds giving the shortest possible answers and seeking avoiding making any sort of connection with me.*

*I was concerned with this encounter.  Stormclouds seemed determined avoid any sort of personal connection with the person she was speaking to.  My impression was not of someone who was depressed and had a flat affect, but rather of a person who had made a conscious decision to be as detached and distant as possible.*

*Overall my impression was of a person who consciously avoids displaying empathy and who is willing to make critical and unsubstantiated statements about individuals whom she meets during the course of her training.""*

375,"I made some bad choices and stole from my local target because I’m broke and I didn’t want to pay for the items. One trip I stole a $6 eyebrow kit (I should’ve just not gotten it), next trip command strips, and then the other time a package of 2 9 volt batteries. I think I also took some Neosporin. So I stole maybe $20/25 total worth of merchandise over a 6 month period. I really regret doing it and feel really dumb about stealing such trivial stuff that I could’ve just paid for. 

I have a friend who’s been working at that location and said he could help me get a job there and they pay really well. At first I was all up for it until I remembered that I stole from them several months back.

376,"  3 years ago my mom divorced my dad, whom she had been married to since she was 19. She claims that since she didnt get the chance to sleep around in her 20s, she is now going through her ""wild phase"" post- divorce. This is totally cool and understandable and I dont judge her for sleeping with anyone she feels like (as long as you're being safe like go right ahead!) She's always been mostly open with me when I was growing up about sexuality and I was able to come with her with questions as a kid, which I appreciate. 

  Now, however, it seems like 70% of the things she talks about has to do with sex, and it's a little unsettling. She's been visiting me for a week and she's been telling me about how she goes to fetish sex parties and casually mentions 3-ways she's had with some of her friends. When we are out and about she always makes loud comments about men and women she finds attractive, loud to the point where I'm sure they can hear her. Her ex-bf told her all she thinks about is sex and she thinks that's preposterous- but she does seem to be giving it waaaay more thought (and voicing these thoughts) than normal.  

  It makes me slightly uncomfortable because I really dont want to hear constantly about the people she's slept with or who she might sleep with in the future. It seems to work it's way into every conversation. Should I just grit my teeth and hope she stops talking about it eventually? Or change the subject every time? I'm lost and a little unnerved.

379,"I’m in my 20s and completely friendless! I have had a few girlswant to be friends with me and we’ve hung out a couple of times but the friendships drift off after 1/2 hang outs. I think I’m just really boring and shy and scared to say anything wrong.

When I was younger, I was so outgoing! I was normal, I had friends. Then the ages of about 13-15, I got bullied a lot. My parents refused to allow me to move schools or do anything. This made me develop a depression for the first time in my life and I became withdrawn and sad.
I finally moved schools and when I did, no one in my new school wanted to befriend me. They just wouldn’t talk to me, wouldnt respond to my attempts at friendship, nothing! This went on for a year. 

Then the bullying stopped a little bit, but people would just kind of ignore me. Not try to be my friend, not care. A few people did try to befriend me. 

Then at 18 years old, I joined a group activity class and some adults and everyone bullied me for being so shy and boring. 

I really think the bullying in my younger years led to SO MUCH self doubt and sadness and loss of social confidence that carries on into my 20s. I feel depression over loneliness, sometimes I imagine my entire life without a single friend and it scares me and worries me, and I just hope that I could die in some accident so that I can stop worrying sometimes. If you’re not completely friendless like me, don’t judge me for being depressed over being alone. You don’t know what it’s like to be completely alone unless you are, and lots of really old people suffer deeply from this and commit suicide over it. So you can’t claim that it’s not a big deal, or not something to be depressed over. I’m not depressed all the time I’m actually happy most of the time - it’s just some days really get to me. 


I’m now trying to rebuild my life, I eat really well and nutritiously in fact I use lifesum to track every meal I eat, I drink water, I try to do positive things that will make me happy all the time and try to stay positive. 
I would give anything to be able to speak to people confidently and be funny and outgoing and loveable! Not to be scared to say anything in fear of saying something wrong, and being too boring. I’d give anything to have some people to hang out with.

They don't know I'm lesbian.

I've never been a fan of animes but a friend of mine recommended me this yuri anime called Citrus. I really enjoyed it and I ordered the first 2 volumes of the manga series. Unfortunately, the package arrived when I wasn't home and my mother opened it and looked through the manga. 

I fucked up.

She was angry. Left the room saying she doesn't trust me anymore. I was expecting her to confiscate my manga; she didn't. The rest of the day she treated my absolutely normal, like she forgot about this. She didn't ask me anything else. Everything was... fine.

ACU told him he had to give them proof that he sold the dog. Because I didn't bank with ACU, I (foolishly) signed a makeshift memo saying I took possession of the dog and was aware of the dog bite incident. I was young/dumb and trying to help out a friend without realizing 2nd/3rd order effects.

A few more years have passed and I still want to move to ACU for my primary banking as well as mortgage and insurance. ACU is an outstanding organization.

How should I approach ACU in a manner that will allow me to bank with them while minimizing negative effects on myself and my friend. 

I'm considering the following:
1) Full honesty and apologizing. I'm certainly concerned over any legal aspects of me committing fraud. 
2) Saying I immediately got rid of the dog once I realized the real-world complications. It was 10 years ago...I'm hoping for some degree of statued-of-limitations.

For example, this morning I was getting rid of old clothes and I found a t-shirt that I wanted to turn into something else. I put on music, thought about what I wanted to do with it, sketched it out, and got my sewing kit out. I got on the laptop to change music and got distracted by something which then led to watching a video on Youtube and my initial task and interest was gone.

Things like this has happened countless times in the past. I got into surfing, bought a surfboard and a wetsuit but only went like 2 times out of the year. I wanted to learn an instrument so I bought a ukulele, but never learned to play. I got into yoga, so I started doing yoga every morning for like 4 days and then stopped. I was interested in embroidery, and I got one as a gift but only made one creation. 

Even with things like reading a book - Other than the Harry Potter series, I've never finished a book (other than short stories) from beginning to end. It's hard for me to finish a move as well. Unless I'm at the theatre, I rarely finish a movie on my own.

I tend to catastrophize things in my head and I'm kinda scared I might get there and lose it. I don't even know if someone can give advice on this but how do I keep calm, am I risking re traumatizing myself? Is there a way to even do this without jeopardizing my mental health? My best friend will be there with me but he doesn't know who it was, and I don't want to tell him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to confront them, I want to act as normal as possible. How do I get through the day as safely as possible while constantly interacting with my abuser? Not attending the wedding isn't an option so please don't suggest that. Even typing and thinking about all this is giving me extreme anxiety and I can feel myself spacing out because of it, how the fuck am I gonna get through this day?",24Sep2018,2
404,"So we met on this site for adults... she's working there. It's been 3 months, we are talking everyday for hours, c2c, nothing sexual.

We know our full names, addresses, but no phone numbers...

She's 21, I'm 28

We live in other countries and she's married... :D

We both are from Europe, our countries are close to each other, for me it's 15 hours drive to her place...

She has asian origin and she's really, really beautiful. We are talking about everything, no secrets about our lifes. 

We both agreed that we are like soulmates, we have so many things to talk like never before, also our interests are same.

Last time, I asked her if she could be anywhere right now, what would that place be...
Her answer was - she would like to see and touch me... But after that she was very embarassed on cam.

I don't know what to think about that all.  

I never told her that I love her or something like that (it's crazy), I really respect her marriage and i'm not that guy who steals girls/wifes. 

Althought she's talking about her husband pretty often in bad way...
She even said she feels uncomfortable at home. I can't judge him but from her talking I can say he's a douche. 

I know it's crazy, but what do you think? She says very often that when I'm not online she's very bored. I'm not saying that I want to destoy her marriage, but I don't know how long she will be working there... and I would really love to stay in touch with her for ever as a close friend, but I know she's scared of her husband...",24Sep2018,2
405,"So, just so you can get a better view of the situation, I'm a teenage girl- 14 to be exact. What means I'm going to high school next year. Primary and middle schools are, like together in my country so I'm generally in primary currently. Also we have the same people in all of the classes. 
The thing.
I have this friend. Let's name her Vee (not her real name, it's just easier). I've known her for about 4 years because we go to school together but she's been in 'my class' for a year. Before- we only had PE together. I almost never talked to her and if I'm being honest, I disliked her. Well now I see Vee everyday and we talk everyday and it's all great but our relationship is kind of weird. About 2 years ago she started to kinda annoy me on purpose? It was all funny but I was always a little mad at her, not for long though. But once, she annoyed me to this point I yelled 'f*ck you' at her(I was 12 and innocent so yeah, it is quite a lot). I don't know what happened but with some reason she thought I hated her. And we would joke about it anyway. When she changed classed or whatever you'd call it, she would STILL joke about it. Anyway almost everyone thinks we hate each other, I remember when a teacher once asked me if she bullied me or something lol. But we have a really good relationship honestly. She still is annoying and we laugh all the time- literally but I guess that's just how it is. But you know, I really love her. To make it clear- it's obviously platonic love. Some examples? I would do anything just to walk home with her. I literally got so happy when she messaged me although she just wanted some school stuff. I kind of am getting jealous of her bestie. I mean I have my 'bestie' too but we really aren't that close anymore. I'm just obsessed. Also the thing is that I'm ready to go to a different high school just to go to the same as her. Seriously, I know how dumb it sounds but it's not my fault I am like this. Also lately I feel some weird things, I feel like I'm gonna miss her so much when we go to different high schools and that we won't keep in touch, agh! Listening to sad music and crying doesn't help it. I don't even know if it just anxiety and I'm gonna get over her right away but it sucks. She's freaking hilarious and she kind of feels... trustworthy? Its just everyone I know seems at least a little fake (even myself) and she is just how she is. I mean you basically can't, not like her. Some other example, just because she messaged me yesterday, I was texting her instead of studying, knowing of the two exams we were supposed to have. And the last thing that bothers me the most- she doesn't know about any of this. She thinks I think of her as an acquaintance. She thinks I don't like her. I wish I could just tell her this shit but she would think i'm a creep so it's a no from me😂 I hope someone can help though. If I forgot to mention something important just ask, I would appreciate all the help I can get and sorry for my english! ",24Sep2018,1

407,"Hi guys, thanks for reading. A couple years ago I had a fairly close relationship with a person that I felt was very personal- it was instant attraction, they were very invested in seeking me out and I was very flattered by that because I liked them a lot. We shared a lot of good times for a few months and I believe these were the best days of my life. Not too long after, they got an official significant other and really left me in the dust. We talked sort of after that but it was really awkward like we both knew whatever it was wasn’t there anymore. They also lied to me about a lot of things: some innocent, some not. Anyways, other people are starting to want to seek me out like that again, but the problem is I feel like I’m not attracted to them at all and don’t have that connection like I felt with the person from before. I’m worried it won’t ever happen again but I’m tired of being lonely. Does anyone have any advice regarding finding someone new? I really miss feeling attracted to a person like that. ",24Sep2018,3

410,"My landlord just informed me that a larger apartment in my building is free, and I can move in if I want. My current apartment is 27m2 (290ft2) and 800€/month. The other apartment is 48m2 (516ft2) and 1200€/month. So it’s definitely a lot more expensive but also almost twice the size. My parents said they could support me with 200€/month for the time being (they basically pay each of my sisters’ rent so I think that’s why they’ve offered for me as well).

On my pay alone I’m not sure I could really afford this rent. With my parents support I could. I’m content with my apartment, have been here almost a year but it’s so small that all I can fit in is my bed, two dressers, a dining table and one chair, and even those just barely. The front door is right behind my bed.

In the new apartment I could additionally fit a TV, a couch, a bookshelf, more chairs etc, which means I could actually invite people over for example.

I feel like the smart thing to do would be to stay in the smaller apartment and save money. But then again, I’d probably be saving up so I could live more comfortably later on in life. But I could also be living a lot more comfortably right now.

So – save up for the future or live and enjoy life now?",24Sep2018,1
411,"So to make a long story short, I moved back to my home country in December after living and traveling abroad for the past three years. I’m in my 20s and came back wanting to get a job in my field and start a career. 

Basically the transition has been really rough, just been a really shitty year and taken me a lot longer to find a job than I thought. I don’t have a great relationship with my parents so my friends (a married couple) let me stay with them in January so I could get back on my feet. 

Nine months later, I finally got a job offer last week and I plan on moving out soon, but I want to get them/do something for my friends to say thank you. I just don’t know what to do to show them how grateful I am for what they’ve done for me. I cook for us, clean the house and help out when I can, watch their dog when they’re away and in the past few months that I’ve been working a temp role, I have been able to pay them a small rent, but I would like to do something special for them and need help coming up with ideas. 

I can think of material things to get them like a nice bottle of liquor or things they’ve mentioned they’ve wanted but that doesn’t feel like enough and also I’m just now starting to get on my feet so can’t afford anything too lavish but don’t mind splashing out for them. 

Any ideas?

412,"I met this guy while he was working the NJTransit train. Northeast corridor line works Mondays-Fridays. He does a morning shift (6:59 am train from trenton to NYP) and a night shift(4:30pm NYP to Trenton). He is a conductor for it, meaning he collects the tickets from the passangers he is always in the back cars. He had seen me a bunch of times being a passanger on the train cause he was interested in my cat ear headphones. He would engage in conversations with me and then he finally asked me out on a date. He saw I was sad cause I was going through a bad break up. He took me out to dinner that night, visit to the mall and dropped me off home. He gave me a goodnight kiss on the lips. He shouted right before I went inside asking for my phone number. I didnt think much of it cause he was just nice and stuff. I gave him my number. And about 30 minutes later he texted me saying he had a good day and wanted to see me again. 

&amp;#x200B;

We arranged for a date 2 days later. He offered to take me anywhere I wanted so I picked a really nice resturant. He picked me up from work and he just got off of work. He mentioned he wanted to change clothes before we left. When we got to his house we we smashed. I was sure he would have written it off as just a one night stand and to me as well. Right before I left in the morning he states ""Now that we are dating..."" me being confused he continues ""we are seeing each other now but you can see other people though I wont I am too old for that."" (I am 31 and hes 49) as I button my shirt I nod, he makes sure to kiss me goodbye and I leave.

&amp;#x200B;

I was cool with ""just seeing"",""just casual"",""no comitments"", and etc. Since I recently got out of a terrible break up. I was single for about 4/5 months and hadnt had any sex or anything. Though he since that moment he would call/text me 3 months straight everyday and always wanting to see me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I spent almost every weekend at his place for abour 1-4 days straight. He attended my college graduation formal, my college graduation, drove me to the airport there and back for trips, spent time with his kids, grocery shopping for foods I like, shower together, make breakfast/lunch/dinner, and more.

&amp;#x200B;

After the 3 months he became more distant and started ghosting me alot. I just wanted normal conversations on hows your day or how are you feeling, he would get upset if I message/call. Though when he ghost me for a week or 2 we see each other after, then see each other a day, ghost a week and the pattern continued for some months. When we spend time together it was fine. Doing laundry together, helping me with my homework, helped pay for a textbook, paid dinner for my parents and me on a dinner date, clothes shopping for me, taking me out to very expensive reasturants, picking his kids up from places, seeing both families and friends ... but we are not serious...?

&amp;#x200B;

Last week of July be broke it off cause I reached out just wanting to see him. It was my last week of finals (I had one summer class to complete, I was nervous and scared since it was a hard class.) I went to dentist for the first time in 15 years and they wanted to remove my canine tooth. He texted back saying ""I dont know why you keep calling things were fine but now your making it not fine, you are a good person but seeing is done.""

&amp;#x200B;

His fear of not wanting anything serious is cause his ex wife who he has 2 children with, cheated on him so many times hes not sure if they are his. And the girlfriends after were the typical ""crazy ex"". I was always concerned for him, that everything was a trigger for him of things they have done to him. He would bitch about them everyday, I try my best to listen and be understanding. It felt like it was more of a sympathy tactic that his life was terrible but once I speak he wasnt interested. I felt more like a therapist. But I cared for him and listened to what he had to say. The last girl before me he first started his not serious routine. That only lasted 6 months (he says) and we lasted 5 months.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont want him doing this to someone else. That he dosent see that what hes doing is leading woman on. I was fine if it was casual but hitting me up constantly, wanting to see me, wanting to know everything about me, and so on. If you want to treat it as casual and not serious that you shouldnt treat them that way and expect them not to think otherwise. I feel like he led me on and I dont want him soing this to anyone else. I want to warn people that its not ok. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since then he refuses to tell me anything. That ""Why cant you just accept we are done? Why do you need validation?"" I just expect since we are adults we coild try to talk and work things through and discuss why in his eyes it didnt work.",24Sep2018,1

The bedsheets were hers too so I believe she's not messing with me.

415,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years and we live together. (Both 21) We started dating in college and now he is going to graduate this year. I will graduate the year after. He is going to graduate school for an additional year (At the school we are at) so we will be graduating at the same time. Anyways, he cannot get a high enough score on the GMAT so he cannot get into grad school. I have been pushing him to study every day, I have been doing all the house work, anything and everything that will set him up to be successful on the gmat.

 Despite all of this, he just looks at material and doesn't go above and beyond to really learn. What do I do in this situation?  He wont invest in a prep course and would rather spend money on weed. I really love him and I want to marry him. I feel like something needs to change to get him to be successful. He is very very smart and he is more than capable of passing. What should I do? Me yelling at him doesn't help and anything I say makes him mad. If he can't pass the test he will not be able to stay in our apartment next year, and we will have a long distance relationship. It just hurts me because I feel like he is not trying and it is affecting both of our lives. 

What do I do? Should I shut him out and hope that that will make him actually try? He said whether he passes or not he wants to get food and watch this movie we wanted to watch later. If he fails do I put my foot down and say no to seeing him? We live together at my place but we have separate apartments. ",24Sep2018,1
416,"Basically long story short, I thought I was a smart person in high school mostly because I was shit at everything else, I half-assed my way into barely getting into a small university's history program, I was alright in the first part of my first semester because of a desire to not fail endlessly like in high school, something about essays tripped me up and I stopped doing work entirely, and I barely ended up passing my classes. The second semester I vowed I would be less stupid, but for reasons I can't explain I decided to stay in my room all day instead of going to classes. (I did go outside to eat meals, but I tried to eat at odd hours to avoid running into my dormmates, so I wouldn't have to answer their questions about why I wasn't going to class.) I ended up dropping out halfway through the second semester. On the advice of my parents, when I came back this year, I decided to take only two courses (One of which was online, and both of which were first year courses.) since A: it would prevent me from getting overwhelmed and B: because I can't stay in residence after my first year and I have to take a train from my hometown to the town the university is in.

&amp;#x200B;

Unsurprisingly, I managed to screw up even this tailor-made schedule immediately. I didn't do the online course's first assignments for reasons I can't explain. For some reason this made me want to skip one of my lectures in the other course, which prevented me from learning about a quiz that was happening the next week, and then I couldn't complet ethe quiz because I had forgotten to purchase an account on some online service the prof uses for quizzes.  I still can't bring myself to look at the online course's site (I am now about three weeks behind, and the prof mentioned she doesn't accept assignments more than three days late) and I am only barely paying attention to the lectures in the other course, which I know will bite me in the ass when exams happen, but still don't change my behaviour. When my parents ask about the online course I just invent pretend assignments and say I got them done, and when they ask about quizzes in the other course I just say they haven't started yet. Also, there are a variety of smaller crises that I haven't told my parents about or dealt with because I feel like the big ones should be dealt with first. I had a bad habit of lying to my parents for months in high school and university and then admitting the truth when things were already too late to change, but even though I knew on the day that I started to fall behind that I should have told my parents in order to avoid falling into that habit, I couldn't do it because I am too much of a coward.

420,"Every day I absolutely dread going to school. I have around one or two friends there, and have zero classes with any of them. There is nothing else to look forward to at school. I hate waking up early, I hate homework, I hate not getting my stuff done, I hate having to deal with stupid kids in my class, I have having to remember to bring my violin to school, I hate sitting on my ass for 7 hours and learning dumb shit that I can't force myself to care about.

People always tell me that I'm ""going to be fine,"" or ""going to get through it,"" but it doesn't help, not because I don't believe them, but because I have to suffer through school, and all the bullshit that comes with it until I've ""gotten through it."" I have 8 more months of this hell, then a three month break then another 8 months, rinse and repeat.

It's just so exhausting trying to force myself to care, or to actually do my homework, or to be my positive self, or to do *anything.* I keep on telling myself to suck it up, but I never can, so instead I cope with my dread and hatred of school by distracting myself through Reddit or video games and my grades suffer as a result, fueling the cycle.

My entire life revolves around school, and I hate school. It's even worse knowing that I have two more years of high school after this one, and that after that I probably have 2-4 years of college to suffer through.

And all of this makes me feel like shit, because there are people all over the world who would die for an education like mine. I have all the support in the world, from my loving parents, my counselor, and all my teachers, but I can't get my shit together at all. I hate each and every day, because I have to go to school, and I have no idea how people can cope with it at all.

I feel like I'm stuck in a prison that is my life.

I was trapped on the stairs whilst they were attacking me. (I look after people with learning disabilities). I ended up in A &amp; E. I have continued to work with this person.

A few nights ago a different service user trapped me on the stairs which triggered PTSD (I didn't know it was PTSD at the time). I was really stressed and couldn't get to sleep after work which led me to being seen asleep on the next shift.

I went to the investigation meeting and explained why I made the mistake and it has led to a disciplinary meeting which they said will lead to a final written warning
Now I'm wondering If I want to stay in this job -
- Management have not been supportive and I feel I have been treated unfairly  (giving me unusually high workload and being uncontactable)
- low wages for what I have to deal with
- I have worked overtime most months, work above my job description, have been told I am very thorough and one of the best, have a good relationship with the service users but I made one mistake and now none of that matters.
I know the job role is for me, its just whether this is the right company.

Also for context I knew my mental health was declining so a few days before I made the mistake at work I self referred myself to counselling. A month before I got rid of all my commitments outside of work (volunteering etc) so that I could focus on sleep and reducing my stress . I also told my supervisor how I was feeling.

425,"Backstory: I met this one girl off of a dating website a year ago - we live about an hour away from each other. Our hangouts have had a lot of time between them, as we have only met in person about three times. On the first two, we engaged in a bit of sexual activity (no sex, just foreplay and a blowjob). She doesn't go to school or have any hobbies, and is dealing with extreme bipolar with psychotic episodes.

I'm extremely nervous talking to her. I was texting her once and she told me about how her grandma was in the hospital. Because I was studying my math homework at the time, it took me about five minutes to reply to one of her messages, so she said, ""fuck it you don't care sorry"".

Anyway, she texted me late last night wanting to hang out. I agonized over the decision (I have very severe anxiety), because I had an important test to take at 9:00 this morning. I decide to get back to her at about 11:15, after agonizing over the decision. I thought we'd cuddle or fool around like usual, but she asks me on the way over if there's a place she can get dinner. I suggest two fast food places near me that are open 24 hours per day.

At about 12:15, I tell her that I only wanted to hang out until 1:15 or 1:30, because of my test. She then tells me that she has been looking for a parking spot for 15 minutes and needs to pee really bad. She then explodes on me for telling her that she drove all this way just to hang out for an hour, calling me an asshole. I offer to stay out until 2:30 instead of 1:30 \*several times\*, but to no avail. She then tells me that she doesn't want to be my friend anymore, and then asks if she can come into my house to use the restroom. I tell her that it's irrational for me to let her into my house if she doesn't want to be my friend anymore, to which she says, ""I gave you your first fucking blowjob, you can let me in"". I tell her that there's a 24-hour restaurant nearby that she can use.

She then goes off on a rant about how someone stole her antipsychotic medication from her doorstep and she cannot get it refilled for about two weeks, and she needs someone there to support her, that's why she initiated the hangout. I remind her AGAIN that I can hang out for an hour longer than what I had originally said, but she didn't have it. 

I decide to lock up my house and turn off the lights. She then tells me that I can go outside to the nearby parking lot to say goodbye to her in her car. I thought it was weird, so I ignored her, to which she said, ""guess not"".

An hour later, I was trying to fall asleep. She tells me to send her $20 for the wasted gas and time. She calls me (this was like at 1:45 at this point), and I ignore her call. I also viewed her message without opening it, as I didn't want her to know that I have read it.

\--

In her defense, it was a dick move on my part to drop the ""I only have an hour to hang out"" on her so late. But given her mental state, \*\*I am worried that she will blackmail me or ask for more.\*\*

She will probably wake up at about 3:00PM today, as per usual, and I want to know how I should go about handling this situation.",24Sep2018,1

427,"So I've been seeing this girl for a while now, and i really, really like her. We've met at least once a week for over a month (i think), kissed, and other stuff. 

She slept at my place from Saturday to Sunday. I've been missing her so much since she went home on Sunday and I feel like I'm getting way too attached. She came by my house again today, but for like 10 minutes because she got her drivers license today and was in the area, and it was so dissatisfying to see her go again.

The thing is she's got a bigger social circle than me and doesn't really have a reason to be tooo ""dependent"" on me. I feel like I might come as too needy/attached. 

What can i do to not ruin everything by being the ""too attached guy""?",24Sep2018,3

We've both tried talking to him but don't think he understands how what he did was really messed up. He can be so childish. It happened after we were leaving another friend's birthday and saying goodbye; he did it right in front of me. Also, right after he did it, he jokingly said to me ""I just raped your girlfriend.""

441,"Six months ago I got into a relationship with a co-worker. At the time, I was very emotionally vulnerable, depressed, and overwhelmed with anxiety and she was the only one that’d talk to me about it. Two weeks into the relationship and she started gaslighting and manipulating me. I felt like I mattered when I was with her and she was using that against me. A little bit later into the relationship she completely ghosted me until I had to confront her and ask her if we were still together, which she said we weren’t. A month later she convinced everyone that we work with to berate and yell at me over a simple mistake I made. It got so bad at work that one day I just left my shift and tried to jump off a bridge. 

It’s now around six months later and I’m still having trouble moving on. I realize how abusive she was but every part of me just wants to go back to when we were both happy together. I know I can’t but I just can’t shake that feeling. Is there something that might help me move on?",24Sep2018,2

447,"i logged in on the computer because this is a important issue for me. i meditate and i believe, somehow, in spirituality. but there is something that is always in my mind to push me back: isn't all of our impressions and perceptions just a consequence of an active brain? i mean, all we perceive has a direct connection to the brain. and once the brain ceases, or once the brain's functions are essentially altered, we are unable to find ourselves in the same state. a lot of people say that this drug or that drug is able to make us connect to our higher selves, but all i think when i hear those statements is: this material substance can alter material connections and chemistry in our brains and project a different perspective. and that's about it. i see knowledge in the spiritual literature but i see it through a skeptic, plain, dry way. and it saddens me. MY LOGIC IS: if any damage or alteration to our brain can alterate, simultaniously, our sense of self, then isn't all just directly linked to it? if it's all in our brain (how we can reach certain states of mind using meditation or sensorial techniques like trataka, or drug use) then when the brain ceases, don't we all? isn't this just logical? when the matter of the brain rottens, or turns into ashes, isn't our whole being gone? if not, how? if the brain was the main vehicle for *everything*? if we lose a leg, we are able to live and to pursue our spiritual goals. but if we lose our brain, we're unable to do it. we just cease, but without leaving completely. there is still activity on the matter (our body). there is energy. but if the body is lost, and logically dead, then we're not just unable to have access to our selves or even our consciousness, we just don't exist.

i'm so depressed about my view on things because i value spirituality. i know the path to get rid of my ego, and already was born with a good sense of empathy, that i'm always willing to exercise...i know the possibilities and benefits of meditation, astral projection, substance use, consume of literature....but nothing is able to make me get rid of this mindset. **can someone help me?**

450,"Guys, I need advice on a work situation that is complicated and frustrating. 

I work as an Executive Assistant at a school, but my situation is starting to take a toll on my mental health. 

The first thing that upsets me is that I have no office or desk of my own. I have to sit wherever my boss is sitting (in HIS office) but when he wants to bitch about an employee with someone, or make a phone call, he will send me out of the office, where I will have to sit on the stairs outside. When I've tried to sit in the main office to get my work done, he's pulled me aside and said that he hired me to be HIS assistant and that I should be near him in case he needs me.

My boss has 3 different schools he runs. He will give me a 1-minute warning when he wants me to pack up my stuff and drive to the other school with him. Though I'm in charge of his schedule, he ignores it and makes me apologize on the daily for him not making meetings I have carefully planned. He will also schedule meetings behind my back when he has other meetings on his calendar. Regularly I get emails from people asking me what time a meeting is that HE has set up without telling me, only to find out that he's making me reschedule another meeting. I can be flexible. I can reschedule. But I feel like why even bother having me make appointments for him when he disregards everything I place on his calendar?

A very mouthy woman at our school has the need to ""reply all"" to every email, or send out emails CCing the entire school. Last week my boss talked with her about stopping this. But again on Friday she did it and so my boss emails ME to say ""get me off this email thread"" to which I responded by letting him know I had no control over that but also included a document on email etiquette that we should discuss at the upcoming leadership meeting. When I get to work this morning, he sees another email that he has been CC'd on with the entire school and he says to me, ""Did you get this email? We're going to have 17 responses now"". So I reminded him of my email etiquette document and he interrupts me to talk to someone. So when I repeat myself about creating the email etiquette document, he just ignores me. He simply starts typing away like I wasn't even talking.

A few months ago, the HR director (Fran) had her husband (Lance) come on board as an employee in the Securities department of the school. Fran is in my boss' inner circle because she also deals with the finances of the school. Anyway, so me and Lance had to work on a number of projects together but after a few months, he began to call me on the weekend and on my personal days, and even during Thanksgiving break. He also started to text me while I was at school to remind me that he was watching me on the security cameras. He would text me things like ""Stop playing around, go back to work"". When he texted and tried calling me on my wedding anniversary, I sent him an email the next morning stating I would not be answering calls, texts or emails on my days off. One hour after I sent that email to Lance, he sends me a text. Inside the text is a picture of me he has taken from one of the school security cameras. Along with the picture, he wrote ""Smile"". I felt incredibly creeped out. More than I had with all his creepy behavior, so I made a formal complaint to my boss. I cried when I told my boss because I hadn't realized how much it had bothered me, and I believe in some way I didn't want to say anything for fear of retaliation (from his HR director wife) or be known as the troublemaker. My boss was livid when he found out. He called the school's lawyer and with a statement from one of my co-workers who verified his previous creepy texts to me, I was sure he would lose his job. And I was ok with that happening since I had witnessed very, very inappropriate conversations between him and woman at the school. BUT, instead of firing him, my boss simply asked me if I felt ""unsafe"" in the school. I knew my boss was being very careful with the language he was using because no, I was being honest, I did not ever feel UNSAFE at work. BUT, I felt harassed. And I wrote that in my email, ""I feel harassed"". But because Lance's wife is the head of the HR department, he was not fired. My boss simply said Lance was not to talk to me, not to email me, and not to be in the same office as me at any time. Now, cut to a few months later and my boss has me working with Lance on a number of projects (mostly via email but he does still stop me in the hallway to ask questions). And I hate every. fucking. minute. of. it. I feel angry. And stressed. And completely let down. I made it so clear I did not want anything to do with Lance but now I have to work with him?

And then there are the little things that add up that are making me go mental. 

Like my boss asking for 10-page slideshow presentations 20 minutes before meetings because he ""likes the thrill of working on a deadline"" (his words).

Or him addressing me by my surname instead of my Christian name (not to be too old school here but I am female and he is a man in his mid-50s; I find this behavior very, very bizarre and inappropriate, especially when he does this in front of my coworkers). Or my boss sending me out to get him coffee when he knows I'm about to leave in 5 minutes, and then asking everyone in his office if they want coffee too. Or my boss not doing a damn thing when a family complained to him that their daughter was threatened with rape on a school bus (his excuse was ""they're turning it into a race thing"" since the boy was black and the girl was white; but the boy DID say he would rape the little girl if she did not shut up).

While getting my boss coffee today, I was almost in tears from just feeling so invisible over the past few months that I told the barista that I wanted to quit my job. She said she understood but she said not to; to wait until I had another lined up. But I just don't know if I can wait. I come home every day and cry, or I get angry with my husband because I am so frustrated. My boss wants me to travel with him upstate tomorrow on a train at 7am (""I might need you, buy yourself a ticket"") and I just don't think I can handle being around him anymore. I feel disgusted. I feel like I'm going crazy. I take klonopin every day just so I don't have to feel so bad when I come home. I feel so invisible, but when I try to make my voice heard, I get deafening silence in return.

I want to quit. I want to take out a loan so I can quit tonight and not have to worry about expenses for a few months. Please, please give me some advice. I know people shouldn't quit jobs without having something lined up... but I just think about being on the train with him and his board members tomorrow morning and I feel nauseous. I feel nauseous that I'll be away from home and upstate, feeling invisible all over again. 

Is taking out a loan to save my mental health worth this?

TL;DR: I feel invisible at work. Nobody has taken my harassment complaint seriously. My boss is a douche. Would you quit on the spot and apply for a loan if it saved your sanity?",24Sep2018,1
451,"To make a very long, complicated story short, I am an American who completed college in the UK. During my last semester (this past spring), I met a guy and we connected instantly. It was brief but intense - I've never had a connection like that, and I've had a few long-term, serious relationships. I could list the reasons but trust me when I say I doubt I'll meet someone quite like him again.

It ended very badly due to a lot of factors (I was leaving the UK to work in the US, he was a bit younger and still immature, timing, etc.). He ended up really hurting me, not maliciously I think, but because the situation was so complicated and he was just too immature to deal with it. We initially left things open to reconnecting in a couple years when the timing was better, but our last conversation was heated and I don't know if he would want that anymore. It's been several months since we last spoke and I've moved on. Pretty sure he has a girlfriend now, from what I hear from mutual friends.

Anyway, I'm back working in the US now and enjoying it, for the most part. But I feel a strong, gut pull to move back to the UK. My company has an international presence and it would be relatively easy for me to permanently move to London in a couple years. Culturally, politically, socially, etc., I feel like I relate more to the UK than I do the US, partly because I've spent so much time over there. I LOVED London every time I visited during undergrad, and I know I would be happy there. I imagine my life 20-30 years from now, and raising a family in Britain seems more favorable to me than raising one in the US.

**Here's my question:** I feel like moving back to the UK permanently is the right decision for *me*, but what if my primary motivation isn't actually my best interest, but because I've subconsciously not gotten over this guy and think by moving back, we'll reconnect? What if I move there, reach out to him, he wants nothing to do with me, and I realize the only reason I moved was because I thought we'd have a chance again?

Idk, I feel like that's not the case but this is such a big life decision, I just want it to be for the right reason. And I'm like 90% over this guy, but because of the way things ended, I never got my closure. Memories of him are lurking in my subconscious, and I'm just worried my brain is trying to rationalize those subconscious desires. Am I crazy? Is this normal?

I know I have a couple years to really decide, since my company won't move me until I've been working here for a while. But if I do want to do this, I need to start networking internally now to set myself up for a move in 1-2 years, hence why I'm thinking about this now.

Any advice is appreciated. I guess a further question would be if I even want to reconnect with this guy regardless of moving, since he did really hurt me and handled the situation so, so poorly. Rationally I think most people would say no (""he hurt you, fuck him!"") but emotions aren't always that straightforward.

458,"Yesterday a new guy joined our volunteering place. He seemed really nice but he was *really fucking nervous*. I noticed that he could talk to customers at the till but as soon as I came over and tried to talk to him, he tensed up.

He’s about the about the same age as me - it was likely (social) anxiety/being awkward around girls from what I could tell. And I (hopefully) wasn’t intimidating him, as I get on well with all the other volunteers.

He looked really tense and talked in a really nervous/strained way - like when you’re trying to hide your nerves - and he could barely make eye contact. When I spoke, it was almost like he wasn’t actually listening but scrambling for an immediate reply instead. I’m gonna sound mean for saying this, but it made me feel really nervous and uncomfortable too. I ended up avoiding eye contact because it became unbearable.

461,"To preface this, I’m 15 and play for one of my high school’s sports teams. 

This year has been the start of a new season for me, and already it’s gotten off to a bad start. It started with one person mainly picking one specific other person. I tried talking to the offender, was dismissed. I then talked to the coach, and said offender was talked to. 

It was better for a little while. Then I watched as more and more players start to gang up on the same player as before plus another, who I should mention deals with ADHD. The player with ADHD, who we’ll call Aaron, is barked at (like a dog) on on the ice, mimicking and mocking his mannerisms. He seems to smile through it but I have a suspicion it’s happened on teams before. 

The player who was a target the first time also is still being picked on heavily. My dilemma isn’t that I’m afraid of being a “snitch”, kids who bully others for simply having ADHD are scum. I just have no idea how to talk to the coach without seeming like a kissass and trying to get brownie points for the upcoming captain-choosing elections. ",24Sep2018,3

464,"Tl;dr - I have a narcissistic family member that I’d not like to cut out of my life, but I’d like to hear your tips on effectively speaking to her so she gets the point without feeling offended. 



I have a family member who has strong entitlement and martyr issues. She isn’t damaging things per say, she is just exhausting to be around, and doesn’t seem to pick up on social cues. Or maybe she does and she wants to push buttons, I don’t know. In any case, it’s nothing I want to blow up my family relationships over, I’m simply looking for some tactics or phrases to use to gently shut her down and avoid conflict. 

Example - she is turning 42 this weekend. For her birthday, she announces that she wants to spend several hours on Saturday and Sunday doing various family activities. I will commit to one activity... I’m not sacrificing my whole weekend to her. 

I tell her we will come in Saturday but Sunday is out. She presses about why we can’t come on Sunday and offers to rearrange schedule to accommodate us on both days. I say we’ve got other commitments. She says she told us 3 months in advance about booking this weekend. (She did. It was an FYI that didn’t ask for a response or commitment). 

It’s not like we don’t see her regularly. It’s not like we have a deep relationship to maintain. It’s been like this for years. It’s her personality. The rest of the family hangs out together bc they’re all kind of similar, but I have distanced myself and my nuclear family, and it’s kind of me vs them sometimes. 

Anyway, do any of you have good tips or phrases I can try to use that help me avoid conflict but shut her down gently? ",24Sep2018,1

Maybe it’s because I’m smoking weed all the time. I just don’t feel happy anymore. I’m seeing my therapist tomorrow. I’m thinking of trying to get out of the city for a week, but idk. I’ll just end up being by myself and probably smoking up somewhere. God damn it. I’m pretty high right now. I’m such a mess. God damnit. How can a single 27 year old guy feel so alone in such a highly populated city ",24Sep2018,1
466,I have a BA in Creative Writing and and MA in Conflict Resolution. The issue is the schools I went to were not very good ( for my undergrad I was the only student in the school who studied writing) so as a result I have degrees but in actuality I have almost zero skills. I am 31 and am looking for something I can do long term and don’t want to go back for another 4 year degree. Can anyone recommend a career/skill set I can get into? I can do more schooling if it’s a certification or a short term program. ,24Sep2018,1
467,"I currently work about 60-65 hours on an average work week between both of my jobs (\*\*1:\*\* I'm a head cashier (supervisor) for a major hardware store; \*\*2:\*\* I am an administrator and recruiter for an insurance company). I have been working my ass off at two jobs for about 6 months now, and I am getting burnt out. My attitude has changed, and I am not liking this new person I'm becoming. The reason I picked up two jobs is to pay off my debt faster, and to save up for my wedding next year. I won't be financially stable if I just chose to go back to one job (even if I went back as a head cashier full-time). It is also extremely difficult to move up in the hardware company (I've worked here for 5 years, and nothing has changed), because there's hardly any openings, and when there is, 30+ people apply because they also want to move up.

Well... out on a limb, not expecting to get called back, I applied to be an Assistant General Restaurant Manager at Freddy's (it's a steak-burger joint). I had a phone interview last week, and I got a call today stating that they wanted to invite me back in for a final interview face-to-face tomorrow at 1:30pm. I don't know if I got the job or not, but I feel like my odds are looking pretty good. 

I currently make about $33,000/year working two jobs, but the salary that they would offer me is about $37,000-$40,000 (according to the lady that interviewed me over the phone).

So now, I have a dilemma. 

I am not sure I want to go back to ""fast-food"". I used to work at McDonalds as a cashier back in high school, so I have been out of the food business for a while. 

\* Is it different going back to fast-food as a manager (compared to being a cashier)? If so, how?

\* What are the job responsibilities that would make it different?

\* Is it worth going back to the food industry, if not to only gain the knowledge and experience as an Assistant General Manager?

Any and all advice would be sincerely appreciated!!",24Sep2018,1
468,"I moved away four months ago and I don’t talk to anyone at all. I don’t speak to my friends as often as I used to. They’re too busy or don’t feel the need to talk to me unless I’m doing something for them which I guess they’re not really my friends. Anyways before I moved I was talking to this guy but not in a romantic way I think. We would talk off and on. He would randomly text me every few months. We decided to meet eventually. I liked him though and he knew that because I let him know after we met up a few times. BUT he was very unclear whenever I asked him about how he feels towards me. It was always “yea I like you” I think it was most likely friendly. We were supposed to meet up one last time before I moved however he flaked and said that he was somewhere else last minute. He’s the one who suggested we’d hang out too. The strange thing is he started flaking pretty often after I told him that I liked him. I blocked him afterwards instead of talking to him about it because I was super angry. 

I unblocked and texted him almost a month ago but he didn’t respond at all. I’ve just been thinking about it constantly. I’m not too sure what to do because I realized that I might be obsessed with him??",24Sep2018,1

A lot of people listen to me, are friendly, etc. But I feel like it's harder to get a certain level of dignity and respect from white people. It's not like they're bad to me, though, it's more like it's obvious that when I talk they don't think I'm a person with a ton of worth. It's kind of infuriating. Then it's like a weird cycle. Like, I don't want to talk to them because I get nervous so when I do I feel like I say stupid stuff, then it gives them a reason to actually think I'm not respectable.

470,"Here is my story:

I am currently a pre-med student from an Indian background who has been accepted into a direct entry program into medical school. I have just started my second year of college and am coming to the realization that I no longer want to pursue medicine. I feel like I have been pushed into the career by my parents who are a physician (mom) and software engineer (dad) respectively. For one, I feel that my classes are far too difficult and that I just do not enjoy and cannot take the amount of stress needed to complete them. I know if I put enough energy and dedication into them I could but I feel that at this point those efforts would be for nothing since I am not passionate enough about the career. Furthermore, I find that even when I do put in close to maximum effort I get sub-par results. I do enjoy healthcare, but the more I understand and learn about medical school and becoming a physician, I realize being a physician does not encompass what I love about healthcare enough. For one thing the entire career requires extremely stressful schooling for years and these years are during the primetime of our lives. Second, the cost of medical school is a huge turn off for me: if this is the wrong decision that is an investment that I do not think I could pay back. Next, I hear about the drastic levels of depression among medical students and practicing physicians and also how stressful some patients are to deal with. Lastly, while I do have compassion for people, I feel like there are some patients who you just cannot get through and I feel that by having to always put up a front of kindness and compassion, I am feigning compassion to people rather than being able to be blunt with them, which I think would really take a toll on me as a person. Right now, I am not doing very well in chemistry/math courses (had to withdraw calculus my first semester and got a C+ in intro chem), however I have maintained a 3.5+ GPA. Overall, I am coming to realization that this career is not one I think I could be happy with in the long run and I do not think I want to be slaving over difficult schooling during my youth years and paying 1/2 million dollars for something I will not be happy in. Another aspect I need advice on is breaking this news to my parents, as I feel like they really do not realize that I do not want to be a doctor. They always think I am just being lazy or am frustrated with my classes and always say that I am too deep in my schooling to change, however, I have yet to declare my major. I think they might be disappointed in me so I want to have an alternative to offer them.

As for my interests: I was considering doing a Public Health major and going to do an MBA or MPH after, however, I am unsure about the jobs within this industry, I really enjoy business so I was hoping to possibly do some sort of management/business job within the field of healthcare. Specifically within healthcare, I enjoy sports/fitness/lifestyle and would love to incorporate that into my future career. I was even considering just getting my MD, practicing a bit, and becoming a medical director because right now I am just so much more drawn to the business aspect of healthcare. I am extremely passionate about lifestyle, fitness, and emotional and physical well being as well as diets and methods used to aid in this. I also like having interactions with patients within this demographic, as I find they share passions about sports and lifestyles and are generally a lot more competent about these topics, such as athletes and active adults. In addition, I also love working with children! I am quite extroverted and definitely need patient/people interaction, however, I can dually work alone. I am an extremely strong writer, and many teachers have complimented me in this subject particularly, from grade school into college. As far as academics, I am fairly strong in most subjects, however, math is my weakness and thus math/chem/physics classes are a struggle for me.

As for my hopes: I know this may come across as superficial or asking for too much, but I would really like to make a 6-figure salary, certainly not off the bat, but eventually. I have dreams of traveling and want to be able to live comfortably and happily and be able to take care of my family if I were to decide to have kids. Above all however, I really want to have happiness in my future career, I can certainly tolerate stress if it is to get an outcome I am truly passionate about. This being said, I am definitely someone who values having experiences and living in the moment, and overall, happiness. Please let me know if you guys have any suggestions or paths that you think I should look into. Cannot thank you guys enough if you have read through this, I am feeling really lost and am looking to Reddit for any inspiration I can get.

TLDR: looking for a high paying (6-fig) career involving healthcare/business/fitness/sports+health, am very extroverted, strong public speaker. I value happiness and having experiences in life, but am willing to work hard for a career I am passionate about. Weak in math/chem/physics and was originally pre-med. Any suggestions?",24Sep2018,1
472,"I start intensive CBT tomorrow, it will last up to 16 weeks - 50 minutes per week.  


I suffer depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation - these are long-term: depression for ten years, anxiety possibly all my life but I struggle to identify my emotions (as I'm Autistic) so I can't be sure. My depression is rarely low moods and I'm 'high functioning', but it means I'm on autopilot and if I take a look at my life I end-up in a low mood - I'm deeply unhappy with my life due to issues like unemployment and the impact that has re. not feeling constructive or valuable and also stress of money issues, social isolation as I've no friends or family at all, getting older while not being in a position to move onto the next part of my life that I want to have re. having children, mortgage, etc.   


Therapy can't fix my life so I'm not really sure how it's supposed to help me, I'm hoping it can help me find ways of pulling myself out of low moods and currently I'm struggling with a breakup so hoping therapy can help pull me out of a loop thinking about what happened. I've not had CBT before so not sure how it works or what's involved.   


1. I can Google 'Cognitive Behavioral Therapy' but that doesn't really tell me how it works in practice - can anyone give me any insight into what to expect and what it's potentially going to do for me?

474,"I have a problem with handling how much alcohol I drink at large parties. If I'm not in a seated and ""controlled"" environment where I'm able to eat and drink plenty of water, then I have a habit (at least every three to four months) of binge-drinking without meaning to. This usually results in me blacking out and/or crying in public. This is a huge problem and I'm horribly embarrassed by my behavior. I need to make a major change. 

&amp;#x200B;

While I never intend to get into that state, I find that drinking is a crutch when I feel uncomfortable in social settings. It's not an excuse, but it's a coping mechanism that I've developed over time. It's something I do when I'm not sure how else to entertain myself. I'm not regularly abusive of alcohol. I don't actually drink that often in general. I would love to hear what's worked well for other people when it comes to these types of situations. How do you hold yourself accountable? Do you count your drinks? How do you enjoy a party when you aren't drunk enough to dance, but that's mostly all there is to do? I'd love to hear any advice. Thanks!",24Sep2018,1
475,"This is kind of a long story so prepare yourselves. My mom married my stepdad (we’ll call him Tim) back in 2003 when I was only 8 years old. They had my little sister (we’ll call her Shelby) in 2004. My stepdad built a big house for us to live in. It got 3 feet of water in a ridiculous flood back in 2016 but they still live in it. Their plan has been to fix it up, sell it, and move to the property they have about an hour away. My stepdad has worked in refineries all of his life so he’s made good money to where my mom stays at home and raises my sister and eventually homeschool her. Tim has NEVER made me feel lesser of a daughter than Shelby and I give him all the credit for where I am today at this point in my life. We now work in the same refinery. 

When I was around 11/12 years old, my mom reconnected with an old lover. I’m not sure if they actually “connected” but I remember him coming to our house and them cuddling on the couch. They went back to her bedroom once, though I can only imagine what happened. We even went to his house one time and made him enchiladas. My mom even compared him as the Edward to her Bella (ew, I know). She always told me not to tell Tim. I was young and scared of my mom (because she was a super mean and manipulative woman growing up) so I’ve never mentioned him to Tim. 

Years go by, and my mom has become more hateful and materialistic. Example 1: My biological dad died when I was 14. A few months later, I had a nightmare that I watched him die (which were frequent enough back then that I had to go to counseling). I cried to my mom about the nightmare and she told me I need to stop crying and suck it up. He’s been dead for a few months already so I need to get over it. Example 2: Mom and Tim were going to NYC and left my sister and I behind at a relative’s. My mom tells me that if something happens to them my sister gets the house since Tim is only her biological dad (even though Tim has NEVER treated me any different and would never agree to that). Example 3: I told my mom I wanted to switch majors in college (which I was paying for my own schooling but still lived with them) and she took my car keys away and grounded me. I packed a bag and started walking down the road as I was intending on staying at a friend’s house. My mom gets in her vehicle and starts screaming out the window at me how I’m an ungrateful bitch, she’s disappointed in me (even though I had already made it farther with my education than she ever did and AGAIN, just switching majors. Not quitting) and tons of other horrible names that still hurt my soul remembering. Example 4: I bought her and my dad tickets to go with me and my boyfriend to a concert about a month ago. She sat there the whole 4 hours, taking selfies and photoshopping the shit out of them to where we’re almost unrecognizable. Then proceeded to complain about the bands that she never even saw because she stared at her phone the whole time. These are just my personal examples. There’s hundreds of more stories from Shelby, Tim, and even other relatives. 

Since the flood a couple years ago, my mom does not clean house much. It is an absolute wreck! Any time you walk in the house, you will find her sitting on the couch playing on her laptop. Literally. Every. Time. She makes Shelby take care of all of their animals (they have farm animals and some dogs). She’s always buying stuff and making plans to go places any time Tim is off, which sucks for him because he already has to work a lot and fix the house when he gets home. She also gets extremely angry when he has to work lots of hours to afford all of their bills. She thinks he’s supposed to take off every time she tells him. You can tell Tim is miserable but he does what he has to for his family. 

One more random side note, my mom made Tim delete his Facebook and share one with her because she was constantly accusing him of hooking up with any old female friend that added him. Just a few weeks ago she was pissy because some girl he knew from high school added their joint account. My mom said she was just trying to stalk him to see how he’s been and what he looks like now, then deleted the request. 

So yesterday, I get a text from Shelby. She is now 14 and because she is homeschooled, she is very sheltered. She tells me she caught my mom on Instagram messaging a guy. The guy sent her a vulgar message and then said he loved her. My mom replied with haha and was smiling and typing something else. Maybe it’s not as bad as it seems, but me and Shelby agreed that Tim deserves to know. We’ve talked about my mom a lot for the past 6 months with other family members who point out how manipulative and hateful she is to everyone and thought it was for the best. So Shelby told Tim in secret last night. He asked my mom to see phone. She wouldn’t give it up at first but eventually gave in. Tim walked outside with the phone. My mom followed behind a few minutes later. He walked back inside eventually and shook his head no to Shelby and said he would talk to her later. He wound up not getting a chance to talk to her because he had to go to bed for work. 

So today, Tim finds me at work and immediately asks me what I know about my mom and mystery IG man. I show him the guys profile (pretty easy to find) and we even find his Facebook. The guy lives in another state with no mutual friends in common. Tim was unable to figure out how to get to DM’s yesterday, so I showed him how to do that. We sat there for 2 hours discussing almost everything she has said or done...except the old lover. He told me he doesn’t care about my mom talking to the guy. But that as soon as he gets the house fixed up and sold, him and Shelby are moving to the property and he’s filing for a divorce. I wanted to tell him about the old lover so bad but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. We were at work and it made me tear up just thinking about it. I feel horrible because I should’ve told him a long time ago but 1) I was young and scared 2) I would’ve been the one dealing with the consequences since she’s the one that had custody of me. I feel like now, more than ever, he deserves to know. But at the same time, he’s already thought about divorce recently (I found out during our conversation) and has decided what to do. Also, my mom has no clue Shelby saw those messages, much less we’ve been talking behind her back. Tim felt it best so my mom wouldn’t lash out on Shelby for ratting her out. 

So, do I tell Tim about ex lover? Or keep it a secret since the beginning of the end has already begun? ",24Sep2018,2
476,"So for context, my friend and I are college students - I'm an Accounting major in junior year, and my friend is a Business Leadership and Management major who's a sophomore. 

There was this issue where my friend (we'll call her Amy) was having trouble with school her first semester during freshman year. She was having a hard time in 3/5 of her classes, which is pretty bad since freshman year is usually all introductory courses. Anyhow, she ended up dropping one of her classes, so down to 4 near the end of the semester. At that point in time her grades (all 3 credit classes) were looking at two F's, a B- and a B. That's around a 1.5-1.6 GPA. So Amy was freaking out and she is one of my best friends. 

So I helped her with one of her classes (Critical Writing, which is technically Writing 101), because she had failed 2 out of the 4 papers assigned during the semester. The professor was kind enough to let her resubmit two times after the initial submission. The second time she submitted both papers, I had checked for grammar mistakes and structuring. I did not in any way write her paper. She ended up failing those, too. The third submission, Amy was getting desperate. So I offered to show her what a good paper should look like. I wrote up both papers in about 5 hours and showed her why it was a decent paper compared to what she wrote. It turns out, she ended up submitting my papers as her own and ended up getting B-'s on them (yes, I know... not that great, but I didn't take the class ever at this school). So without my knowledge, she ended up submitting them and getting a B- overall in that class, so her technical GPA was a 2.25. I got over it because I knew she was scared, but it was very underhanded. 

However, the more pressing issue is that I've noticed that Amy requires a lot of help with school. She can't write a decent, college-level paper to save her life in any writing instructional class. She constantly requires help with the most basic things, like learning how to use Excel, learning how to do basic accounting (required for all business majors). I feel like I am the problem here because maybe I am allowing her to be able to get good grades from me because I help her with everything (I do not do her work for her). So much that she has become reliant on me. This worries me to no end. Part of me feels like it's my fault inherently because I'm too nice to not help anyone in need, but the other part of me feels like this is also Amy's fault down to a monetary structure: her dad pays her tuition at the private college we both go to. She has nothing to really be scared of if she fails besides her dad being upset/mad at her, while if I failed, I would owe a lot of money in private and public loans. So she has no sense of urgency, responsibility or risk like many other students. 

Even with that reasoning, I still think that at the end of the day, I really am the problem and I have no idea how to get out of this cycle. 

P.S. - The only reason I help her is because I know what happens to students with bad grades. All your scholarships/grants and financial aid get taken away and it can be a scary thing for a young adult to try to process what to do to fix their problems. Admittedly, I wanted to help my friend avoid this at all costs, but I would never tell someone to copy work or take my work and submit it as theirs.

One hit on me but according to friends of my brother and him that was my fault and I was interested in him not the other way around and the other I followed on Instagram and he just assumed I wanted him? I still don’t get it. One specifically knew me from sixth grade while he was in eighth and I was a pretty weird kid not going to lie but he used what I was like as a sixth grader to define who I was as a freshman which isn’t fair at the point I had obviously changed a lot since then he spread a ton or rumors about how much of a “freak” I was to other people in his grade.

They said I would talk about my brother around them to get their attention but that was never my intent me and my brother are really close so I talk about him a lot with friends regardless of who is around. I try telling my brother and he tells me they are kidding or that I’m overreacting and it’s all in my head due to my anxiety disorder I know what I heard but I can’t make it past the first sentence and he’s already on their side I’ve thought about telling him but he’s confronted minor instances in the past and they all lie to save their own asses and it makes me look like the liar and they say that to others as well knowing fully well what they did. At this point it just makes me really sad they don’t have to like me but their constant teasing and false statements about me hurts me and I constantly feel shame for “embarrassing” my brother.

How do I inform this freaky tech guy that it’s not my responsibility to take out the trash and wash the dishes and sweep?? Why do I even *need* to say this to another adult human?? Why can’t people act normal? 

Help. ",24Sep2018,3
488,"Everything that has been happening recently started around when my dad turned 50. He started going out every night which was never something he would do prior to that. Me, my brother and my mom originally thought it was just a mid-life crisis but now he’s been going out somewhere at least every other night for about half a year. About 3 months after he turned 50 my parents started talking about getting divorced. Just for more context, I’m 15 and my brother is 17. They still haven’t gotten an official divorce as of right now but my dad seems to have a girlfriend now. Anyways my Dad is the least of my worries as my mom is currently having a mental breakdown. She had another mental breakdown probably 2 years ago and she had to check in to a mental hospital since she tried to kill herself. Now she is saying that my dad is hacking her phone, an iPhone by the way, and changing very minor things to attempt to make her go crazy. Whenever me or my brother try to talk to her about this she just says she knows the truth and we just think she’s crazy. Also when we bring it up she usually ends up saying how she’s fed up and just wants to kill herself. With all this going on I’m just scared and confused about what I’m gonna do for at least a little over 2 years before I move out. My dad has just been pissing me off with how he’s acting and I don’t know what to do about my mom. I still love both of them but I just don’t know how to deal with this situation. Any advice would help especially if you’ve been in a similar situation.",24Sep2018,1
489,"Im a junior in highschool, and Im struggling with a girl aha. So let me explain. I had the biggest crush on her for over a year now, a friend of mine told her but she kept it to herself. Last thursday, I was chatting with a friend, lets call her B. B brought up my crush and I told her that Ive liked her for a while. Turns out B is a really good friend of my crush. B asks crush about me and crush said that she wouldve gave me a chance last year, I was uspet because I never made a move, let alone talk to her very often. Friday comes along, crush and B are at a football game, B sends a snap of crush to me and I called her cute. B shows crush and my crush told her to tell me ""talk to me"". I got so happy when she said that. Crush does not have a phone so I can only talk to her irl. I have her for two periods, 2nd and 3rd. How do I approach her? I honestly have no Idea what to say or how to act. I get so nervous around her bc im a bitch, any advice for a shyish teen?",24Sep2018,1
490,"I'm in the US, a second year in college. I'm not buying into the concept of the perfect life, as it is currently.   
Everything seems so surface to me, friendships/work/networking. I think there's not really much point of trying to do anything because there will always be someone who can fake better and end up doing the thing better. Like, what is this that I'm trying to achieve. ",24Sep2018,12
491,"I’m in college and I’ve always been a big worrier. One of my biggest flaws is being indecisive because I always overthink the possible effects of each scenario, and can’t end up making a decision. 

I’m also a perfectionist and so I always take everything I do really seriously and stress myself out even though it’s not a big deal. 
Also in general I just feel like I stress about a lot of unnecessary things like thinking over past conversations and worrying that I was too awkward, etc. 

What are some steps I can take towards just taking things less seriously, not worrying so much, and going with the flow? Thanks. ",24Sep2018,1
492,"Long story short, I've not felt myself lately. I'm not enjoying the same things I once did, and it's starting to isolate me from my friends. More importantly, it's very uncomfortable. To briefly list:

* Leftward shift in political sentiment
* Fall in aggression / enjoying aggressive content
* No strong foundation on which to perceive things; feelings of being lost, disorientated
* Fall in libido

I know this sounds like a meme, but I promise you it's not. I noticed a definite change on the 19th of August (around 5 weeks ago) and my previous mental state is growing more and more difficult to reach. It's really quite terrifying.

As for possible causes: I've stopped exercising near completely (used to go to the gym regularly), changed my diet (as per title), and am socialising more. Is it at all plausible to think that the former two may have influenced my cognition? The conspirator in me thinks it's a fall in testosterone, but I'm not sure. Is this sort of definite shift a normal occurrence? Could I just be growing up?",24Sep2018,0
493,"I'll be going to dinners and parties with my SO (me f27, him m32). They will include his boss, his friends, and his co-workers. I just want to make him look good by being like the hot wife.

I'm half filipina, half polish. Jawline-length black hair. I am ALWAYS compared to Betty Boop. Big eyes, tiny nose, round pouty lips. Skinny, small boobs and small butt. But I love being girly, dresses, makeup, heels..

494,"I need some advice on how I can concentrate more in college. I do the bare minimum to get through my classes and I honestly don't think I'll be a good professional if I continue down this path.
I do get a bit sad at times but I don't think I'm depressed, so I think my mental health is ok besides the fact that I think I'm addicted to videogames, weed, and my phone. 
I do anything possible to avoid studying, I even maintain a good physique because I rather go workout or play basketball rather than hit the books. 
Maybe I just need motivation...",24Sep2018,6
495,"So my friend had this girl in his class and was really good friends with her for the past 6/7 years. I met this guy back in 2012 and we were best friends ever since. He lost his virginity back in 2016 and has called me a virgin ever since he had sex. I got pretty upset about it since it had been going on for 2 years. So this girl he had a crush on never felt the same towards him and told him over a thousand times that it was never gonna work and that she saw him just as a friend. He invited me to a amusement park back in July and his crush was there aswell. After that me and her talked on Facebook for a bit and because he annoyed me so much with his virgin jokes and stuff I decided to bang her because she wanted to. I told him about a month ago and he has blocked me since then. I tried calling him earlier tonight but he hung up as soon as he heard my voice. I don't know how to solve this.. I hope he eventually realises that we both fucked up, but untill then idk what to do.. I want to talk it out but it seems inpossible..",24Sep2018,1
