0,"Let me just start by saying I’m not looking for anyone’s sympathy, but for advice. I guess I should start with how I got here; A couple years ago (I’m 20 now)I started college and was pretty much paying it through grants and loans. Well long story short, a family member passed away and I let it get the best of me. I was depressed pretty much, very distracted from my school work and ended up failing a class or two. I ended up getting put on academic probation and I didn’t even return to campus the next fall. I regret not going back, and now I have student loan bills to worry about and I’m in between jobs. I wanna work in psychology somehow and I want to go back to school, but I don’t know if I screwed myself too far already. I can’t pay for school out of pocket, honestly I feel like my life is crashing before it could start. Luckily, my mom has been kind enough to let me live at her place thank god for her.

1,"I'm in my mid-twenties and I've spent most of my life skating by. I've toiled in poverty and to be honest, my existence so far is just one tragedy after another. But I always lacked the motivation to try and fix it, so the problems just compounded. I don't mean to be overdramatic, but things so far have really sucked. I won't go into detail on all that, but suffice it to say that the biggest reason I've never bothered to achieve anything is that I hate my life so much I'd rather not bother.

Well, that's what I thought before the final nail was hammered into the coffin. My wife, who I've been with for my entire adult life, is ready to leave. I've never been alone before and I literally never even pictured living without her. This was a wake-up call. Saving my marriage is impossible at this point. Although I'm still deeply hurt and in pain over the situation, I've largely come to agree that it's for the best. As a result of this however, I've begun to change. I started working out, cleaning house better, reading more, spending better time with my kids. I've reached out and connected with friends and family, begun a set of lifegoals, and worked on improving my bitter and frankly unbearable personality. I've apologized to the people I've hurt and made a conscious effort to be better to everyone around me. So far it seems to be working. After three months or so I have started to have people comment on the improvements I've made without even knowing I'm making this commitment to a better life. Even my soon-to-be-ex-wife says she's amazed at what I've become. My boss, unprovoked, told me he sees great things in a person he didn't think much of before (he's very direct and straight-forward, which I've always respected). It seems things really are going well.

The problem is that I can only improve myself so much after having dedicated my entire life to fucking it all up. I take full credit for destroying myself with short-sighted decisions and a general distaste for looking towards the future, but I've changed now. I want to be a better man, but I'm afraid I've ruined that possibility. I owe thousands of dollars to the court and I can't afford to pay it. Until I do I can't get a valid driver's license so I can't really go anywhere (I live in a tiny town 20 minutes away from civilization). I've settled into a shitty house that I can't afford to leave. I work at fucking McDonalds despite being a vegan now, but it's the only place close enough to safely drive without risk of getting pulled over. I have no close friends to confide in or bond with. I have absurd student loans so I can't go back to college. I've been with the same woman for nearly a decade and don't know how to get a date/have casual sex. I've got zero roots in my community. I have no savings and I've torched goodwill with anyone who might help in that regard. I've been such a miserable bastard since middle school that no one particularly likes me and my self-esteem is shot. I'm so lazy that I never learned how to do basic things like find a dentist or doctor (not that I could get to one with my illegal vehicle anyway). Honestly, I don't really know how to adult at all. All these problems are compounded by the fact that I have four kids, two of them disabled, and lack any free-time to address these issues. With a family to care for and a lack of transportation, I'd be fucked even without these other issues.

Please Reddit, I want to be a better person. I want to follow my dreams, make a difference in the world, be someone my childhood self would have been proud of it. I feel like I'm actually a different person altogether. But is it too late for me? Have I dug a hole too deep?",01Dec2018,1

5,"Apologies, for this is a long one just feel like there is a lot of details. My longterm girlfriend and I have been renting a house for close to 2 years now. About a week ago we were contacted by her (landlord/lady) and were told she was due to have someone come round to thr property to value it as her ex husband wanted to sell, and she wanted to buy his half out. We were asked to remove or hide anything that might suggest that we live there and if she could get us to be out of the house for when the inspector came round. We were happy enough to oblige, it was a one off and wouldn't really affect things. We're told it would be at the end of the week, I book a few days off work to give the house a full clean and tidy. The day comes up and we hear nothing, no inspector, no landlady, nothing. Over the weekend we finally get a text saying that it would be at the end of the following week, then another text saying it would be at the start of the week. We both happened to be off that day so it suited us, we could take our cats out of the house and stay in a relatives for the time being.         

The night before the inspection our landlady comes to the house and tells us she will RING us 10 minutes before the person comes so we can leave the house. Next morning we wake up to a knock on the door, answer it and it's the inspector thinking we are the owners of the house. Obviously were in a panic, tell her that she will be here soon and we leave almost immediately. The landlord text my girlfriend rather than a quick call and we slept through it. It was earlier than we expected. We speak to the landlord later in the day and she tells us everything went smoothly and nothing to worry about. The next day we find out that she had complained to my girlfriend's parents rather than contact her directly because  she did not get the mortgage and we are to blame...          

Now we are sitting in this house feeling like the walls are closing in and we have to get out of here soon, we still don't know what is going to happen, she is obviously unhappy with us. We were under the impression that she would have stuck to her word and rang us, she was late to the meeting in the end herself so everything felt poorly organised and now it's a lose/lose for both us and her. We don't even know if we are to fully blame but it's how she is putting it across. Should we look for another place? We both know we will be kept out of the loop on what's going on until it's too late and we don't want to become homeless this close to Christmas.

(For some background we have never missed rent, kept real good care of the place and made some improvements that were okay'd with the landlord. The issue is we have no contract for the place and we pay simply by standing order each month.)",01Dec2018,1

17,"I am currently trying to transfer to UC from community college, but my chances are not looking great. Before this year, I never would have dropped a class just because I was struggling in the short term, but in the spring, I decided to drop one online class because it would have hurt my GPA. In the summer, more for reasons of me just slacking off and falling behind, I had to drop two separate summer courses. And then in this fall semester, I ended up dropping two more full-semester courses for similar reasons, both of which were retakes of courses that I had already dropped previously.

Is there a way I can spin this to look justifiable? At the very end of the application, I was thinking of leaving this in the ""additional comments section"":

\&gt;In the summer and fall of this year, I have had to withdraw from a small number of classes due to deficits in time management. Not to excuse this, but to explain this: my father had a change in employment in July, and as a result I have had increased responsibilities surrounding my household.I have spent time in recent months searching for supplemental income, and on a day-to-day basis, I have taken time to chauffeur my three younger siblings, in middle and high school, to and from extracurricular activities, as well as to provide living assistance to my grandmother. Under normal circumstances, my father would have done much of this. Next semester, I fully expect to return to my normal academic rhythm.""

just thought this would be a good place to reach out. I am a 21 year old college student in his final year studying English and Film at a great university. My grades are good and I have made some lovely friendships but lately things aren’t working out so well. I have been diagnosed with depression and since being at uni make lots of silly mistakes (forgetting my keys, losing my wallet a number of times etc). I feel like my perspective on things is very limited and negative, and a lot of the time when I am doing things I don’t feel hugely involved with them. My supposed best friend has turned out to be a real bully (it all feels very high school) and as a result I am spending a lot of time at home. Essentially I have lost a great deal of my confidence and instead of feeling like I have a strong sense of identity preparing to leave uni I just feel, well, a bit lost. I don’t like to complain but any advice would be greatly appreciated from somebody in a similar circumstance (or otherwise) who may be able to offer a fresh perspective.

27,"For simplicity’s sake I’m going to refer to him (M16) as C and her as B (F17). Also, sorry if this is a bit of a long post, but I feel like for actual advice I should try to explain the situation However I’ll try to keep it as brief as possible.

For some context, they had dated around last spring, and ended on bad terms because B cheated on him. Not only that, but C was struggling with a lot of issues (that I’ll mention later), and B only pretended to care about it in front of others, and never made any efforts to help him out. C had a lot of anger towards her until around the start of October, when she apologized for all the shit she’d done (she had been really petty and started a lot of shit with most of our friend group, including me) to C, me, and anyone else B had pissed off.

We all made up, and it’s all been good up until last Sunday. What happened was C, B, a few other friends, and I were at party Saturday night, and the morning after him and I ditched her at a friends house so we could go to C’s house. She isn’t allowed there because C’s family knows about what she did to him. I know it was a shitty thing to do, but B had been getting really annoying the 6ish hours, and him and I both needed a break from her. B ended up spamming my phone asking where I was, and I didn’t want to deal with it so I gave my phone to C’s older sister (21) who proceeded to type multiple paragraphs about why B is such a shitty person, mainly because of C and B’s past relationship, and send it all to B. 

We didn’t see B the next few days, and just assumed she was mad about the whole situation. But this past Wednesday I went to a friends house and B was there. I apologized for what had happened, and she told me that she hadn’t been mad at me in the first place, but had been going through some shit anyways and that’s why she hadn’t been around. I didn’t think much of it and we all had fun for a few hours. (C was not there at the time)

Now, today B spilled what had been going on to me and multiple other people. We were all just sitting around and she started talking about how mad she was at C. The reason: a few weeks ago she had a small house party, and it ended up being B, C and I left at her house. I was extremely drunk, and wondered off to a couch and passed out. When I left them they were laying on her bed. The next morning C told me B gave him multiple blowjobs throughout that night. I didn’t think much of it. But today B said that he had more or less forced her to give him head.

Also, at the party last Saturday they had been cuddling on a bed, but apparently C had been trying to force B to give him a hand job. When we ditched her the next day what he told me was that she wouldn’t leave him alone throughout the night and that he had wanted her to give him some space. 

Now I normally wouldn’t pay much credence to this, because B is the type of person to start shit. What made me believe it was that another girl there had said C had gotten really touchy with her too, and I have seen him get touchy with people before.

Now, I don’t know who’s side to take in this situation. B is a good friend of mine, but C is definitely one of my best friends. Also, he’s been through a lot in life. His parents practically didn’t parent up until last year, and by parenting I mean giving him a curfew. It’s either a result of this, or something else, but he also has severe anxiety issues, especially the social type. Sometimes he’ll just choke up and have to leave if he’s uncomfortable where he is. Last major thing, he struggled with a Xanax addiction last winter, to the point where he doesn’t remember good portions of it (if you don’t know, Xanax can make you black out). He cut it cold turkey in the spring while he was dating her. As I said earlier, B had offered zero support for him, only pretending to in front of people. 

Now I don’t condone what C’s done, but he’s still my friend, and I don’t know who’s side I should take in this. B is trying to get some people to beat up C, and I had to stop them from doing that today by telling them it wasn’t the time or place for that. Anyways, what do?",01Dec2018,1
28,"So I don't really know the right way to talk about this because I'm not sure if it's real or not.

Basically, I have this flashback to a doctor's visit to my pediatrician when I was maybe... Ten-ish? I can't even be sure about the age. I remember it being a routine exam or something, because I didn't get any shots (I guess that's what's traumatizing for kids?). My doctor said something about having to check something because I was getting older and then he inserted his fingers inside me. I remember being uncomfortable, but it was very quick, and I wasn't sure if this was normal. I still don't. He was the only doctor I was seeing at the time, and I was too young to have an OBGYN.

I guess typing this all out, I feel dumb and embarrassed. I haven't told anyone this and don't know if there's any point in even going any further with it. I'm totally at a loss.

29,"I'm a twenty year old dude. I got kicked out of the place I was staying at in Florida back in July, and moved to my birth fathers place the same month. 

I have an eye condition where I can never drive. The place in FL has no public transport outside of some uber drivers. Where I live now (New Hampshire) I have a decent paying part time job that I enjoy, minimal expenses, there's a bus route that isn't great, but decent enough to get me to work, or a few other places I frequent, and uber for the rest.

My friend recently offered me a place to stay where I'd have to pay utilities, and help run a small business, I can probably land a decent job again in FL, but before I'd go I'd save up some money just in case. I know some of my old friends would help me with rides, allow me to get groceries, etc, and I can walk/bike (I do that a lot in NH, and did it a lot in FL)  

Honestly it sounds like I'm better off here in NH, but mentally I'm drained, lonely, and miss my friends. I do not like living with my father. We're not that compatible, he only recently (past 2-3 years) re-entered my life from leaving me in middle school. I know if FL doesn't work out I can come back here, but it's a lot of effort/big changes. 

There's one more factor, a girl. When I lived in FL, at my old job there was a girl, we were best friends, but grew to have feelings for each other, buuut she had a boyfriend so nothing happened until I moved where we ended up doing a lot of stuff over the phone/pictures, stuff that if her boyfriend found out she'd be in deep shit. But we've lost those feelings, and drifted apart because of work, distance, etc. The day I got offered to move back to FL was the same day we decided to just cut ties, and stop any and all communication. 

I need some time before even thinking about running into her again, and I'm not sure how long my friend's offer will stand. I hope to have my financial circumstances squared away by March, but I'm not 100% sure what to do.  ",01Dec2018,1
30,"A couple months ago my brother bought a dog but because he’s in the military (coast guard) he can’t have his dog on base, he also hasn’t been able to find a place near his base that allows him to have a animal. 

His solution to the problem was to have my sister take care of it and drop it off at our house. Apparently  they had secret conversations because nobody knew about it until it already happened. 

Not to make my sister sound bad but she doesn’t have any skills she can make money off of and has no college education to leverage off of. But she’s been working a baby sister job and a seasonal job to take care of herself and the dog. I don’t really agree with her taking in a dog because she should be focusing on getting a real job so she can move out of our house    
for reasons I’m about to tell you now. 

My dad is a little crazy and recently there’s been a bit of beef between him and my sister. He never liked dogs. Over the past couple months he has become more and more aggressive towards the dog. Before all of this happened he got into a car accident that left him an invisible disability that makes it very hard for him to move.  But every time the dog barks (like any normal dog does) he suddenly get a burst a energy. 

It started out with him just yelling at the dog and telling it to get away a from him. But now he doesn’t like having the dog upstairs and forces it to go down stairs and sit in the dark. He usually did this when he was cooking so dog hair wouldn’t get in his food but now it’s every time the dog comes upstairs. 

The dog likes to run upstairs whenever me or my sister comes home. Yesterday when I came home the same oh same oh happens, but this time my dad rushed out of his room and while the dog was trying to run away to go down stairs he tried to kick her. 

I’m not very comfortable living in that house anymore and I really wish there a way I could get the dog out of there. Any advice ",01Dec2018,1

I guess because I was happy with her I didn't pursue any friendships and after the breakup I've realized I'm pretty alone. I have a few acquaintances but no one I'd describe as a friend here at college. I talk to my close high school friends every once in a while but they're at their own schools with their own lives. 

To top it all off I seem to have developed some social anxiety recently. I got invited to a party last night by one of those acquaintances I mentioned earlier. I was excited, I hadn't really been to a party since last semester and I figured this would be a good way to get back out there and get my ex off my mind. Well I got to the party and hung out a bit with the guy who invited me but after a while he went off and I was just kinda standing there. I've never had trouble talking to people before but recently I guess all this shit going on has just shot my self confidence. I sat there on my phone for 10 minutes and ended up just walking home. 

I don't know what to do, I miss her, I miss having friends, I miss feeling confident in myself as a person. I'm fucking miserable here and I don't see any change in sight.",01Dec2018,1

My brother is also applying to the same scholarship, so neither of us knew until today when I checked the website, so now my dad is going to be twice as mad. My dad has literally been on my ass to do this scholarship for a month, and at this point i dont even care about getting the scholarship, I just wanna get this shit over with.

34,"For my whole life, everything productive I have done has been driven by anxiety. Instead of working towards a reward, I was working to not face the negative consequences of failure. For example, I got good grades in university not because I wanted to be an honor roll student and have pride in my accomplishments. but because I was afraid if I didn't do well I would fail and become unemployable. I never skipped a class out of fear of losing points, even if attendance wasn't graded.

While my anxiety has been a major driving factor of my productivity, it is started to seriously take a toll on my life. It is miserable being anxious all of the time. And I manged to push away someone I really cared about because I cannot keep my anxiety under control. I have started seeing a therapist and psychiatrist to get my shit together. I have been prescribed medicine for my anxiety, but I am worried it will impact my productivity. All of my productivity and success in life has been driven by my anxiety. Rewards don't do a thing for me, only fear. How do I switch from a fear based motivation to something more positive and healthy?",01Dec2018,1
35,"Hi everyone, I am dealing with a sticky kind of situation.

My coworker who sits in the cube adjacent to me has a giant Jesus cross thing (the one where his body is stuck on it) and he has it in such a way that whenever I look up from my computer I have to see it.

I have asked him if he would consider placing it differently but he laughed in my face.

Really I would prefer he not bring his religion into the workplace but I would settle for him putting it in a spot where it’s not visible.

Is this something worth approaching HR about? I think the HR Director is a Christian and I’m worried about backlash on me for reporting it, but on the other hand my coworker is creating a very uncomfortable work environment by displaying this religious thing for us to look at.

It’s also pretty gruesome looking just saying... and I know many Christians don’t like people like me (Jewish/atheist).

I appreciated that and was happy to have him as a partner. 

Then things turned to shit. 

I kept messaging him over Facebook to meet up and he kept making up excuses saying he was in Montreal because he “works there”. This went on for a week then i got sick of it and told him I would have to do the project with another student because it was due in two days and I couldn’t risk it since all he does is cancel. He got all pissed and said “well what am i supposed to do” so I told him he’d have to find himself another partner and I was able to find one. I emailed my professor explaining the situation and she never got back to me. 
On the day of the presentation I volunteered to go first and my prof told me no, that she had to speak to me. She then went on to tell me she received an email from my partner saying I screwed him over and that I was the one to cancel all of our meetings which isn’t true. I told her I emailed her and she said “she never saw the email.”
She then sent me to the coordinators office who told me that I’m getting a 0 which brings my grade down from and 80 to a 40. I told her what he said wasn’t true and that I have the Facebook messages to prove that HE was the one who kept cancelling. 
She said that I could have doctored the photos or someone could have hacked his email and that there was no definitive proof I was communicating with him and barely wanted to hear my side. 
She essentially said that I would have to go back to her office Monday and figure out my future semester schedules because I’m behind one semester since I’m now “failing” this course. 
I have no idea what to do. I have the proofs and no one will accept it.

 In the beginning I was sad but I kind of just accepted it and I was feeling a little better the next day. Last night she texted me about how she’s fed up about how certain things were and that I’ll never change and that she’s done. 
I told her that I know where I’ve done right by her in our relationship but that I’ll respect her decision and left it at that.
Here we are today and it’s hit me hard, I couldn’t get her out of my head all day at work and then when I got home I laid in bed and could not stop remembering her or all of our adventures. 
I can’t stop thinking about how if maybe I had done things differently things wouldn’t have ended like this. 
I keep thinking about how December is our favorite time of the year because of the Holidays and both of our birthdays being this month too, mine just being in a few short days away. I can’t cheer myself up. I was so excited to do all kinds of fun winter activities with her this month.
I understand I’ve made my fair share of mistakes, I’m not perfect and maybe I could’ve done better in certain aspects. But I know for a fact I wasn’t a bad person to her, I would do anything to see her smile. I know I would be there for her as much as I could. I was always the most honest and genuine person to her. 
I really believe that if she had communicated and told me what was wrong instead of bottling it up then maybe we could’ve solved the problem together before it became big.

-See all the engineering and IT guys hanging out

-Make some light conversation, but for the most part too much of an autist to talk to someone without my friend also talking to them

Due to a very wet fall and early cold temperatures it is making finishing these jobs borderline impossible to finish.  I have to keep these customers happy as they are a considerable portion of our income.  The stress of trying to finish these jobs is one of the reasons my boss has decided to retire.

About a month or two ago, I [16M] contacted my ex [17F] about how something she may have said to her about me friend was causing fights in my friend group. Turns out, against what she had said in prior post break-up conversations we had, she claims I raped her, which is what I suspected she told her friend. I can’t tell if she’s gaslighting me or seriously believes this, but the time she described was consensual to my knowledge. The conversation ended with her threatening to “tell her story” if I contact her again.

Again, she has also told me I never sexually abused her in a separate conversations and never brought this up before our most recent conversation.

Anyway, I have proof that this is false, but in a deleted text thread. I told my dad about this situation and I’ve expressed how I want to talk to our service provider to get these texts in case she decides to pull anything, but he insists that this is something that should wait until something else happens and gives no legitimate reason as to why he believes this.

I’ve been working two jobs for two years, and they’re menial. The first job I almost got fired from because I was too slow, but I managed to convince them to keep me as something with less responsibility but it’s so repetitive that I’m going nuts. I have no friends there and I’m always trying to book it out of there by the end of the shift.

The other job is working with children, but I can’t get them to listen to me or respect me. My parents keep pushing me to be a teacher, and I’d ideally want to teach high school, but all I hear is complaints from my mother about how high schoolers are through her job with them, and although I can’t remember being terrible as a high schooler, I probably wasn’t all sunshine either. I go to work every day paranoid about dealing with children because I never know how to talk to them in a way that doesn’t insult their intelligence, or doesn’t make them do something unsafe because I don’t anticipate how they’ll twist my words.

I work seven days a week with these two jobs to get the total hours up to what some consider full time, 35. 

I have tried applying elsewhere in the school district and got one interview out of maybe 15 applications, but was denied after.

I want to grow up and have more responsibility, but and the same time I’m scared of it.

59,"So I'm currently a sophomore in college. I'm at a school that is about 30 minutes away from where I grew up, and both my parents went to school here. I was really hoping to go to a school farther away, but due to some family financial stuff during my senior year of high school. I ended up here. Freshman year had some ups and downs but I enjoyed it for the most part. 

This year, however, I really feel stuck. I feel like I'm never going to leave my hometown, and I feel like I haven't found any community in college. I have a bunch of friends, but none of them are really friends with each other so I end up hanging out with people one on one most of the time (which I don't mind at all), and spending a lot of time by myself. My school is known for being socially dead and it's also huge. Now that I'm out of the freshman dorms, I'm finding it really difficult to meet new people. I wish I'd gone to school farther away, but I feel like it's too late to transfer to a different school. 

I'm also insecure about the fact that I've never had a boyfriend, and I've never felt like any guy has been interested in me. Whenever I start to be interested in someone, they usually end up developing a crush on one of my hotter friends. (For example, my best friend and I met this guy at a party a few weeks ago, and the three of us ended up hanging out all night. I felt like he was being especially flirty with me, and I definitely liked him, and I thought that maybe eventually something would happen between us. Long story short, I came back after Thanksgiving break to find that he and my best friend hooked up, and now they're dating. Apparently, he'd ""wanted to fuck her since he first saw her"". It was a huge shock to me, and it just confirmed I'm terrible at interpreting signals from guys. Not to mention feeling like shit since now that they're together he's pretty much stopped talking to me.)  I feel like something's wrong with me or that I'm broken. I don't THINK I'm that terrible looking or weird, but I just feel like I'm struggling so much with meeting new people or flirting or doing ANYTHING to make my social life better. 

I honestly don't know what's wrong with me. Nothing has really changed recently, and I'd always been pretty happy with my social situation and my life, but for the past two or three weeks I've just been so so sad all the time and it feels like I'm trapped in my brain watching my college years go by without doing anything meaningful.

We got into multiple fights over the few few short months after we met, all really ridiculous, and me basically telling her I need time to myself and time to spend with the other people in my life. Every time she'd say she understood and then (stupid me) I'd end up forgiving her. We would fight about once a week for the entire like 3 months we were friends. 

I should also mention, she's extremely dense and immature. I don't know why I wanted to be friends with her at all. 

Like three months ago, we get into another dumb fight and this time I'm done. I was done putting in the effort, always being scared of her and having to walk on eggshells all day everyday. It was a nightmare. So we end it (of course she's not happy), and I walk right out of her life. She doesn't try to contact me again. 

Until today. Basically ignoring everything that happened, she wants to be friends or at least talk again. This was over text. I'm terrified of her harassing me if I say anything stupid and I honestly just don't want to stoop down to her level and be immature about it. How do I say something in a mature and calm way without disturbing anything? Obviously I don't want her back in my life. Should I just not say anything at all? ",01Dec2018,1
67,"(not sure if this is the correct sub)

I broke up with my girlfriend of two years recently. My family absolutely loved her, she was my first everything but I thought I wasn't in love with her and wanted something different so I decided to break it off. I began talking to this girl I secretly liked for awhile and we hit it off well and have tons of the same interests. She's a great person but I have been going back in forth between her and my ex for a little while now. For the sake of clarity, we'll call my ex Sophie and the new girl Rachel.

For about a couple weeks after I broke up with my ex, I was extremely happy being with Rachel and thought I made a great choice. However, thoughts of Sophie began to creep in my mind more and more to the point where I decided to try again with her; I decided to break it off with Rachel for a bit and I told her the situation. She was kind of understanding (cried for awhile and asked me to stay) but said she would only wait one week for me and anything longer than that, she was gone.

Sophie and I tried for about 5 days and I was happy for a little while. The sex was extremely good, i'm very attracted to her body type and I missed being around her. But I was thinking about Rachel when I was with her, so after those few days I told her things weren't going to change. I think i regret doing this. It absolutely kills me to think about someone else being close to her, loving her, and having sex with her. Which is extremely hypocritical of me because Sophie knows that I had sex with Rachel.

I went back to Rachel and things were good. She's fun to be around and very beautiful (more-so than my ex). She is skeptical because she knows I still care about my ex so she needs reassurance that I want her and only her. The issue is, is that now that I'm with her I fucking think about Sophie a lot and I have no idea what to do. I keep going back and forth between these two girls and it is not fair to them at all. I've hurt them both a lot and it makes me feel real shitty but I just don't know what to do. 

Any input at all is appreciated, thank you.

Its not a major crash but no minor one either.
I was on my way back from actually buying another car. Just put a deposit on it and was supposed to pick it up tomorrow. Most of the money came from my parents who loaned me a good deal of money ( just shy of 2k). To help buy a car so i could get to and from work.

My sister is leaving for about a week tomorrow to help a friend move to a different state.

My sister was going to loan her car out to someone else while she was gone. The car is still driveable. Just damaged metal a good deal.

I dont know what to do. Having a frekin panic attack at the moment. I dont want to have to ask my parents to fix the car but I dont see any alternatives. Obviously going to pay whoever back as best as i can but I dont know what to do.

When cop showed up I couldnt find her insurance and mine just has the already totalled car on it. Not sure what to do about that. Probably going to have a hefty ticket as well.

71,"Yeah, guess it's come to this. 

**tl;dr:** Failed almost all of my classes at my first semester of uni after promising to my advisor that I'd pull it together. Now parents + university probably don't have faith in me to continue and I'm not sure how to take things from here. 

I'm attending George Mason University currently and my brain thought it'd be a good idea to bomb my entire first semester due to procrastination and not really 'caring' relative to other priorities in my life. I conceded to the fact that I was screwed too early, I gave up too early as a result &amp; now I'm going to be in a situation where the majority of my grades are well below a 2.0 GPA. 

So what, right? Colleges are forgiving, they'll totally give me a second chance! Yeah, I don't think so:

1. I talked to my academic advisor about the situation in early November (when things were still relatively solvable) &amp; got on probation for next semester after promising to improve my work ethic. You can guess where that went.
2. To add on to the above I decided that instead of going into college Undeclared w/ a normal schedule I'd go full AVT (art major). Don't get me wrong, I like art &amp; that my decision probably would've worked out if I had a good work ethic, but now it's only screwed me even worse. I'm going to have next to no transferrable credits for next semester, probably none as a matter of fact.
3. I wasted $6k of my parents' money on this semester doodling &amp; halfheartedly trying during October. They're well aware of this and my father's heavily considering forcing me into getting a full-time job, any faith in me lost more or less. I had these work ethic problems in high school so I can't really blame him or my mom, it's an 'I told you so' sort of deal there. 

With all that said, I feel like I'm fucked. I wanted to be fending for myself in under two years time with decent art commission work &amp; the rest of my time well occupied studying for an AVT degree, now I'm set back by at minimum 6 months if not more &amp; the best I can draw more or less amounts to [this.](https://i.redd.it/smad6v6piry11.png) Fanantastical thinking to even think any of this was possible, I know - I'm well aware of how much of a dumbass I really am right now, no need to rub it in. So with that said, **what do I do from here if my goal is to still follow my dream job of going into character art (art commissions) &amp; to have stable income within two years? Is it even possible if I fix my work ethic and apply myself? Be honest, I'll take any criticism I can get.**

I really don't want to be forced into working at a Target for a year if I can help it, but if I have to reap what I sowed then I will. Just, help me out guys - what's the best way I can take my life from here? ",01Dec2018,1

My very good friend's (along w/his girlfriend and her kid) apartment lease ended today. He has purchased a house, however, the closing was postponed for a week, so they don't really have any place to go to. I offered them a room at my house for a week that I usually rent out to AirBNB.


However, when I get back home, I see his girlfriend post several racist posts on Facebook geared towards Mexicans. She is far right and anti refugee/alt right circle/etc.

It wasn't a full on rant, but she posted a meme, what my GF (and as do I), consider pretty racist and tasteless. For example, one of the posts: http://i.imgur.com/m8EDbL9.png


My friend's GF does not have a car, so she would be basically staying in my house, alongside my hispanic girlfriend (who has a vacation from work), all day for nearly a week.


This obviously upsets my GF, and I am also obviously not a fan of such a post, especially in this scenario. I know it would make it extremely uncomfortable for my GF to be around someone who believes and posts such things.

&amp;#x200B;

I am in a weird position right now. I recently moved to the Bay area for a tech job and have been at it for around 9 months.  The issue is that my college friends have an opening in their apartment in Santa Ana, CA and I am actually considering because I am very home sick. All of my friends, my gf, and my family are in Socal. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing I am worries about is that I wont have that much luck trying to find a job in LA/OC area. That is the main reason I moved up to NorCal was because I was having a really hard time finding tech jobs down there. I would be leaving a well paid software development job with only 9 months of experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

My original plan was to stay in the bay area until I was 26 or 27 and had enough experience that would allow me to land a job easily in the OC/LA area. I am currently 23 and that seems a lot farther now that it seemed when I accepted the offer. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am starting to sprout roots slowly now and have started to develop a group of friends but I still feel as happy as I could if I was living with my old college friends. The logical part of me tells me that I should wait it out, make money, make more friends, and then work out the logistics of moving back. However, the emotional part is telling me that my heart lies elsewhere.

76,"So, there’s this girl online that I like. I’d consider her a model. She takes professional pictures, has done ad campaigns, has one of the biggest tumblr followings I’ve ever seen as well as having a strong online fandom and presence.

I created a subreddit after noticing a few other people had posted pics of her in random subreddits. I didn’t think anything of it. I’ve seen other subreddits like this and didn’t think it was a big deal. Over the course of the past 2 years it’s grown like a wildfire. There are a lot of people in the reddit. A couple thousand. I’m still the main one that posts. Every like 4 months, somebody else will post something. People comment stuff but if it’s disrespectful I delete it. As a moderator I do what I can to make it a peaceful place. It’s essentially a fan site, just a way to put all the pictures in one place. There is no  malicious intent. 

At one point some guy commented about her plastic surgeries. I didn’t see it as hurtful so I left it. Long story short, she contacted me personally about the post asked me to block the guy and some other stuff. I obliged. We have new rules. Everything seemed fine. Today, she posted a picture naked covered in money. So I shared it in the reddit with the caption “pay for play.” Thought it was clever. (She’s also a sex worker) So she contacts me again mad, going off about how she’s going to tell my job (doubt she knows where I work), wanting the subreddit deleted because it’s slanderous, etc. I had been trying to contact her for months, but she blocked me until she needed to contact me again. The subreddit is not slanderous. At this point we get a comment every 6 posts. And most of those just compliment her. She’s mentioned wanting it deleted because she on occasion catches a negative comment on there (before I can remove it). There’s 4000 people in the sub, I don’t want to let it go. Also I don’t know how to delete the sub. Her pics were posted onto various other subreddits even before I started this subreddit and I’m stuck. She’s all like “I’m going to sue you if necessary.” It’s not that deep. I honestly do love, value and respect her though. That’s why I created the community. She’s a fun loving goofy person and takes nsfw pictures and videos online. 

Feel free to ask for more info.


TLDR or sucked at explaining; I made a subreddit for an internet model without knowing her. It began to take off. She doesn’t like that some posters on there comment negative things. I remove negative comments. She sees the whole thing as slanderous. But it’s not at all. There’s rarely any comments, post titles are very simplistic and often posted by me with one word (because you need a title). She now wants it deleted. And keeps threatening to “tell my job,” and that she has lawyers and will sue me. I honestly respect her as a person though.",01Dec2018,1

I have following problems and I want to resolve them
1. He always wants to know what books I study, what I do, when I study and everything about me. Every time he asks me, I lose my cool and won’t get anything done. He doesn’t even help, with any good books or references or anything, but wants to as much he can about what I do. He always wants to check with my homework.

2. He sabotages me in front of professor. When a professor is teaching something in the class, from a book, he’ll just a question that is there in the next page from what professor is teaching. Most professors don’t even like anyone in the class. This was clear when the following happened: In our mid sem exam, lots of people did a small mistake in a particular exam and I didn’t do it. So he cut marks for my classmate and when he just asked the prof, the prof asked for his paper and gave the marks for him and saying the mistake won’t matter much.

81,"So to start, I'm a senior in high school, but I'm also taking classes at the local university. Being an incredibly lazy student, I haven't taken any foreign language, of which I need 2 years to graduate. However, if I take a course at the local university, one semester's credit there counts for a year at my high school, so I'm taking two consecutive semesters of Spanish. I'm also taking those classes online, but they're still taught by in-house faculty.

Since I'm absolute garbage at Spanish, I got a tutor to help me with learning it, and he's been excellent. A class that started with a mental breakdown is now a guaranteed A.

None of that was helped, however, by the professor teaching the class. We encountered our first issue when the first scheduled exam did not become available (through the online textbook) on time. After the majority of the class emailed her, and waited a few days, we received absolutely no response. Then, I emailed the Chair of the Languages Department of the school about the issue, after which the professor emailed us telling us she was having ""technical difficulties"". Not only did the exam issue happen again for the next exam, another one got completely cancelled because we told her it wasn't open and she didn't have time to extend it before the semester ended, and a paper was cancelled when we reminded her it was due that weekend and she had given us no details on it. The important thing was all those reminders occurred *in person,* because she responded to almost no emails for the entire semester, which is completely unacceptable. Another thing is that for most of the semester, she had no Office Hours, which are scheduled times she is present in an office on campus, so we have a guaranteed time we can find the professor - a policy intended to prevent this very situation. She instead had Office Hours ""scheduled by email"". Obviously you can see the issue there, given she didn't answer them. So she used a loophole in University policy, and then continued to fail to fulfill her job requirements.

So I had to wonder: what's the problem here? Why are *we* the ones having to take responsibility and keep this professor on the ball, and how can she fail to even open Outlook?

This brings me back to my tutor. While he was tutoring me, he was also applying for a job at a local Community College. Turns out my Spanish professor also applied for that same job. Earlier this week, my tutor was informed he unfortunately did not get the job. One of his friends who works at the Community College told him the individual who got the job was a professor at the University and an adjunct at the community college - and my professor is the only person who matches that description.

So obviously my working theory is that my professor expected a job offer from this community college (by the way, did you know Community College professors are paid more than University professors?) and as a result, decided to completely slack off this semester.

So now I'm faced with a choice. Should I go and inform the Community College of my professor's incredibly poor performance, communication, and overall work ethic this semester as she was expecting to leave next semester anyway? I would feel like kind of an asshole, possibly leaving her without a job due to my actions, but I feel that informing her next employer of her actions this semester might be appropriate.

95,"My sister had a housemate and they had a falling out. Long story short, my sister asked her to be cleaner around the house and the housemate (they were best friends) accused her of being racist, telling my sister she wasn't ""the help,"" etc. Their relationship never recovered. 

This prompted everyone to try and find subletters to move out of the house. The other girl they live with sided with my sister and there was no civil discussion further. No one was able to find subletters so my sister is staying, the one tenant is moving away anyways, and the girl my sister had a falling out with is moving in with her girlfriend. 

I'm afraid that since the girl she had a falling out with will know that my sister will be there alone, and she has the keys, that they may try and harm my sister. 

It sounds a little paranoid but I'm mostly worried because this girl went from my sister's best friend of over a year to enemy of her in seemingly a snap. The time my sister asked her to be cleaner she exploded at my sister and got in her face. It was completely out of nowhere. We think she's easily influenced by those around her including her girlfriend, and we don't know where they're going or who they're going to be living with. 

Should I help my sister take any precautionary measures as she lives by herself in a secluded area of my city? The old roommate will still be paying the rent and so she still has rights to enter the house, but maybe we can add an extra layer of protection somehow? Is any of this even worth it?",01Dec2018,1
96,"Hi! I hope this is the right place for this.

Little bit of background:
I'm 18, and graduated high school in August. I do not have my driver's license yet, but I do have my learner's permit. I've had a lot of personal issues that have kept me from getting my license (and that caused me to graduated a few months late), much to my mother's annoyance. I finally received my permit at 17, after a lot of stressful driving lessons. I've always had severe driving anxiety, but it began to lessen, especially after I took a few lessons with a professional. I was on track to get my license, and was actually starting to feel pretty confident!.....until I got a call and was told a friend of mine was killed in an accident. That INSTANTLY sent me back to square one. I wasn't particularly close with her (she had never come to my house or anything), but We bonded through our shared 4 years of high school, and I typically spent lunches with her and other friends. It's been almost two months now since her funeral, and I still haven't been able to drive much. This is becoming a looming issue since I start classes at a community college 10 minutes or so from my house, and I recently snagged a job at the nearby mall. Does anybody have ANY advice/tips/tricks for getting over driving anxiety? Please help!",01Dec2018,1
97,"This year a staff of the school for my universities co-op program worked entirely alone. She is an assistant, by the lead organizer had to go on extended leave so this individual has been organizing all our meetings, interviews, positions and everything essentially alone. I thought today it would be nice to get her a gift to show the appreciation (especially since she only just got hired as a replacement for the regular assistant on mat leave, so she also had to learn while doing it all!). 
Ideally, I would have thought of this a week ago and had our entire group sign a poster card or something, but with classes all but over it feels as though that would be too difficult to manage in the time period. I might still try to get a good few to sign the card. 

So, what's an appropriate but not too cheesy of a gift. If I could bake I'd make cookies but with the time and having moved out that's a bit unreasonable.

My father recently got laid off from his job thanks to a DUI causing him to lose his CDL last year, so he's starting drinking heavily again. I chose not to tell him, and then my mom decided to tell him. We have a long history of brutal arguments, so i've been used to these by now. He drunkenly decided to cancel my phone bill, and decided to try to cancel my brother and my mother's too. He then called me a liar, said he's not doing shit for me anymore, and i told him to ""prove that i'm a fucking liar, you son of a bitch"". He got up, pressed me up against the wall, i pushed him back, he tried swinging at me and i caught the punch and pushed him away.

At this point i use my brother's phone to call my best friend to see if i can find a place to crash for the night, and i end up breaking down, crying on the phone talking to her. I've been in two mental hospitals with two suicide attempts. I don't know if this was the last straw, but every day i pray to whoever the fuck is listening that he crashes because of his drunken rage.

In the past 6 months he has started to message me at least 5 times a day, which I find incredibly annoying as he never has anything to say (it feels like he will say anything to talk to me). I realized that he might be thinking I’m into him, so I started only replying to his messages that were about schoolwork. 

It only got worse though, whenever I’m not in class or leave early, he messages me demanding to know where I am, if I’m with my boyfriend (he knows that I’ve been dating the same guy for 8 years) and asking so many follow up questions like he thinks I’m lying or something.

It made me so uncomfortable this past week that I told him so (I literally said “you’ve been making me uncomfortable”) and he said “I can live with that lol.” 

I hoped that would be the last of it but he messaged me again yesterday asking which faculty holiday parties I was going to, so I finally blocked him.
I was hesitant to do so at first because it’s a tiny faculty and I have a hard time confronting people.

I was already in bed when I saw it was delivered so I figured I'd get it today. Roomie comes down and asks if I ordered something and I said yeah. She said her dog got hold of the package but nothing inside was damaged. Then when she went upstairs, her bf says ""wait the dog did that"" and she said ""no I opened it I thought it was for you"". So not only did I hear her admit it to him, but MY NAME IS ON IT and only the seal is ripped. Anyone know any pitbulls that only rip the seal?? Didn't think so.

108,"Lately, after stumbling across a post of a unfaithful married man bragging about his AF, I've obtained an unhealthy obsession with people who have experienced or who have cheated on their SO. I HATE cheating and I don't know why I torture myself reading about them. After all of this, I hate myself even more and I hate the people that I've read about who have cheated. My throat closes up and my chest gets tight to the point that I can't breathe and I just ... give in to complete hate for life and people.

After reading these posts, I end up crying for hours. I don't know what to do, I've tried blocking myself from anything regarding cheating, but somehow, every single day, I am reminded. The worst thing about this whole situation is that I've never been in a relationship and so therefore I've never been cheated on(although daddy issues may be the heart of it, but I don't think you guys would care to hear about it and I'm not entirely sure if this is the actual source of how angry I feel or if I'm trying to justify my feelings).

How do I get over this? I don't want to feel this way anymore. I'm so tired of it all, of life, of pain - physical and emotional. I can't keep doing this to myself. This is definitely not healthy for me and I'm already struggling with failing health. I wish I'd never read that post.

She refuses stating that the family is in enough trouble with DSS looking to remove her siblings from the house hold and that it’ll make it worse. I then offer her to stay with my family(something we’ve done for other people) and she refuses and refuses saying that she doesn’t want my family to see her like this.

114,"Okay to give some backstory/insight, I've dealt with anxiety for a while. For years it's crept on me until I'm at probably at my worst. I struggle with making eye contact, I tend to panic just being at a store, etc. I also am very insecure and I feel self conscious just by being in public. All of it leads to me feeling and acting awkward and reserved. 

I never actually seen a therapist  because we never could afford it. Also since my parents are the type who believe I can just get over it. The thing is they also sheltered me too. So besides school, I didn't go out with friends or things like that. Due to all of this my anxiety worsened. 

Anyways, (sorry for my rant) I'm now 20 and have done nothing so far. Like no job, no college, nothing. My anxiety and just low self esteem feed into each other. I just felt I couldn't handle a job. However, my parents seem to want me to do something. I want to do something too, like get a job. Not only because of them, but I feel like such a loser just doing nothing. 

The thing is how can I be normal? Like I don't know all of what I want, but for sure I want to be like other people. I do want to talk to people, make friends, be more independent. All the things pepple my age and older are, but I'm not. How can I be confident? How can I be likeable and not annoy people? How can I like myself? 

I tried anxiety forums and they've consoled me, but didn't really help. I can't see a therapist now, and I don't see any free help. I'm gonna apply for jobs soon so I can get things going.

S would build me up and tear me down knowingly and unknowingly. S was my best friend for a long while, we used to be really close. S knew I had feelings for her and she didn’t want to be more than friends with me and I was ok with that as our friendship was one of the best things I had ever had. At the start of this school year I told noticed that we didn’t have any classes together and I told her I didn’t want to grow apart because I knew we weren’t going to talk as much as we used to. She said that would never happen and that I was one of her best friends and she couldn’t imagine not being my friend.

That was late last August and we haven’t talked since. Sometimes I feel like I’m over her and everything she was but then they’re are nights when I can’t stop thinking about her and our history, she was the best friend i has ever had and was the only person I think I genuinely had real feelings for and emotional attachment to. Now there’s a another girl that has feelings for me and she’s one of S’s good friends

I don’t know what to do, should I try and reignite the old friendship with S and try and be more again or should I try and start a relationship with the other girl who I don’t even know if I “like” like that, I don’t want her to get attached to me, only for me to realize that I still harbor old feelings for S and that my heart was never in it

117,"Long story short I've been dealing with horrible depression and other mental issues since my Freshman year of high school (I'm a junior now) and have brought this up to my parents on numerous occasions. They've simply brushed me off every time, chalking it up to ""teenage angst  and mood swings"", and when I mention that I have attempted suicide several times they grow angry at me and claim I have no right to be depressed. This leads to me feeling as if what I'm experiencing is invalid, fake even, and always worsens my mental state for some time. 

I can understand where they're coming from, one would feel like they failed somewhere as a parent if their kid told them they were unhappy and had attempted suicide. I just feel as if in their denial they have failed to understand how dark a place I'm in. I need somebody who can help, a professional most likely, and my parents seem unwilling to help in any way. 

I guess what I'm asking is what I should do about this. My school has counselors but I've honestly never utilized them and feel afraid to. Asking my parents directly to schedule an appointment with a professional is also an option but again, my parents always make me feel like shit when I bring up the topic. 

Even if this is just teenage angst the multiple suicide attempts I've committed is still reason to see a therapist or somebody (I believe anyways). A bit of this is probably unclear because I suck at communicating, I can clarify anything if need be.

Now I am having to co-ordinate work with another co-worker. I get along with most people at work, and have been successful in working as a team with pretty much everyone else in my workplace. Unfortunately this co-worker I now work with is not a team player at all.

They have it in their mind that they are only doing one part of what they have been assigned to do and are refusing to work with me as a team to meet our deadlines.

They are now gossiping about me at work, and trying to steamroll me into doing all the grunt work while they only have to do what they want to do. This person is apparently trashing me to all of my co-workers (according to another co-worker who is concerned about what is happening), but is friendly and buddy-buddy to my face.

We had specific instructions to work on things due in the next couple months, and the co-worker started working ahead. Grumbling when I relayed instructions from the manager (the manager told me to relay those instructions to this person) that they told us to work on the more recent work instead of future dated work. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure how to handle this situation. I've always been willing to help and work with this person. But now that we are directly working together, it's like they are treating me as a subordinate and acting as if I have to do what they tell me to do. And if I don't do what they want me to do, they are going to try and force me to do it.

According to another co-worker, the difficult person I am having the issue with said that they are going to management and they always get what they want. This person has in the past, been given things after they have whined (ie. vacation time during blocked out times when we were short-staffed). They also get envious of people going away on vacation (even if they have vacation already booked). They have a history of entitled behaviour.

He told me that I should probably stay back at home (I lived in the next city) and that he would just come and visit me there while his ex is visiting at the meantime.
""Why I couldn't meet her?"" I asked.
""Because I don't wanna hurt her feelings. I don't want conflicts and I don't wanna get torn in between the both of you,"" he replied.
He later added that he doesn't have feelings for her anymore and that for more than 5 years now, they don't even have sex anymore.
Should I really stay away and let them be?
I really don't want to take my chances against a 15 year+ relationship.
I really don't know what to do anymore...

Thank you for your patience. Would love to hear from you guys.

129,"This is going to be a bit of a long one...

Also this is a throwaway for personal reasons. 

I’ll start this by giving some history. I first met these friends after transferring to a different school in my freshman year of highschool. I was ecstatic about meeting people that I actually clicked with. These friends of mine happened to be drug users, mainly weed, which at the time I thought was pretty cool being 15. Not all of them were as big of smokers as the others, but most smoked on occasion. 

I carried out these friendships for the rest of my highschool career up to now (I’m a senior). Over time I started to realize that maybe these smoking habits were a bit much. I realized most of my friends smoke every single day, multiple times a day. A long with this, some of my friends were getting into stronger drugs like cocaine, xanax, mdma, painkillers. I brushed it off as a casual thing and not a problem at the time. I eventually found out that two of my friends went on a cocaine binge and spent over $800 on cocaine in a night. I tried talking to one of the two about it, we’ll call him Tom, and he said it was a mistake and said he had stopped.  Some of my other friends were still using cocaine every once in a blue moon. 

Along with all this, all of my friends were slackers. Three of my friends didn’t finish highschool (they’re older than me) and most other mainly made it by. This has been very isolating for me as I am a high B and As student. Only two of my friends are going to college and have somewhat of a life plan and the rest just work in the food industry, spending what money they have on frivolous things and weed. They’re terrible at planning, and whenever I get together with them, they only want to drink and smoke. I myself partake sometimes, but I’ve always been good with moderation. The majority of my friends smoke excessive amounts and drink a lot. My friend Tom, drinks every single day, usually more than three beers. 

As of right now, I feel very alone. I’m taking college classes for my senior year and have been very focused on school. This makes it difficult to talk to any of them about it or even get together with them. I’ve wanted to have a serious talk with some of them, but I have a gut feeling that they would blow it off. I don’t have any other good friends and I’m scared to try and make new ones. 

Any advice is appreciated. I apologize for the formatting, I’m on mobile. 

tl;dr 
Long time friends seem to be drug addicts and don’t know how to talk to them about it.

130,"I have a mask which I got from Kenya confiscated by the US wildlife authority at IAD airport. It was shipped there as cargo. The reason for this is due to 5x tiny cowry shells on the item. They claim that I need to pay $245 to get this released.

Has anyone had this issue before? This is their explanation, but it seems to be a rarity that masks such as this are detained, and it's more for endangered items. Is there anything I can do to avoid this fee and obtain it?

Thanks in advance.



1)     As per 50 CFR §14.11, wildlife (including parts and products) must generally be imported through designated ports: https://www.fws.gov/le/designated-ports.html

(There are certain exceptions but the only one that potentially applies to the mask import is #2 below.)

 


2)     As per 50 CFR §14.20, a Designated Port Exception Permit (DPEP) may be issued for the import of wildlife through a non-designated port. Please see general information including a link to the DPEP application: https://www.fws.gov/le/designated-port-exception-permit.html

Please note that applicants are required to write a statement explaining the reason for importing through a non-designated port. The only reason that would apply to the mask import is “to alleviate undue economic hardship.” While the DPEP and inspection fees together total $245, your only option for importing through a designated port at this point would be to hire a Customs broker and have the mask moved under Customs bond to a designated wildlife port for clearance.

My school held parent-teacher conferences about a month ago, and my teacher said he thinks I’d be able to take the AP test. So today I asked him if he thinks I’d be eligible to take it and he said for sure. 

Now this is where I’m kind of lost. My teacher rarely uses the textbook, and I feel as if we aren’t learning (at least my general bio class) enough to be somewhat prepared for the test. My teacher said there is a study guide available for purchase, which I’m going to get ASAP, but I’m kind of stressing out about the situation (even though I literally have 5 months until the test)

when we broke up i was in SHAMBLES. i was completely unraveled and had a suicide attempt. i was out of school for a week. i came back and every one of my friends never talked to me again. i always knew they were weird. i’m not talking about the nerdy kids, or the unknown kids. they were emo types, thought anything offensive was funny and desperate for attention. it never fit my bill, but i’ve always been unique or a “bird” as my mom says. so they fit me best. 

i noticed they were kinda off the hook and distance myself from three of them before the breakup even happened. then it was really just us 3. a guy a girl and my boyfriend. that ended badly and now all 5-6 of them are best of buds. one of my old friends is dating my ex now. i feel horrible for her and pray everyday she ends up okay. 

i watched a youtube vlog today and they were all in it. they’re so weird it’s like watching aliens interact. all the girls are kissing each other and hugging each other and constantly saying how much they love each other over and over on these blogs anyone can see. then they say i’m scared you secretly hate me. it’s extremely insecure. they never stop overtly praising each other. it made me so uncomfortable i got physically nauseas.

i don’t miss them at all. not one bit. they were horrendously selfish friends. i have many many new friends now who love me in a normal healthy way and i feel i have more than enough company. 

it makes me upset because they’re so so not normal. yet they left me because they thought i was crazy. they thought i was the one who made my ex boyfriend abuse me. it feels so embarrassing to be rejected by people that are so undesirable. 

does anyone have any idea why this could have happened? what did i do wrong? why did they treat me this way?

if it changes anything, they actively bully me now. they follow me around, video tape me, laugh and yell shit at me. it doesn’t hurt, i just think it may be notable that they still use so much energy on me

I'm working as a process technician in the semiconductor field doing shift work, meaning 12-hour shifts rotating 3-4 days a week which seems like it would be great for balancing with school since I have 3 or 4 day weekends every week, but it's definitely not working out like I planned. To give you an idea of what my schedule's been like this semester:

* **Mon - Wed: split between classes, research, and studying/homework**
* **Thu: Work 6:30 AM - 6:30 PM**
* **Fri: Classes from 9-11, then work from 12:30 PM - 12:30 AM**
* **Sat: Work from 6:30 AM - 6:30 PM**
* **Sun: Rotates between the same as Sat and having a day off (one week on, one week off).**

146,"Hi guys, I just want to post on here and not in the dating or relationship subreddits cos im not looking for that right now (at least not until I get my life sorted out) 

Anyway, I went for an interview at Starbucks in my area yesterday. It went well, I went to another Starbucks to chill out a bit and charge my phone before commuting back home. I struck up conversation with this young-looking man next to me. It turned out he was 35 but he looked so young. He’s a chef at a restaurant. Anyway that didn’t deter me; I love meeting new people and hearing their stories, it was really fun we talked for a good hour. We both had the same complaints about our schedules not aligning with our friends’, how it’s hard to see people cos everyone is so busy “hustling” in this day and age.  

Me being the personable idiot that I am, at the end of our convo before I left I said hey let’s exchange numbers and we can hang out sometimes. He said sure and took my number in his phone. I wanted to outline that I’m not looking for anything serious and just want friends, cos I got misunderstood by men in the past, so I said it. He said he’s cool with that, in fact he’s going to study in England at Oxford next year (even though he told me he’s studying for his PhD or something now, not not sure). Anyway I said goodbye and left. 

Anyway it’s almost 1 am where I’m living and he just texted me “hey new friend. You hear back from Starbucks?” This seems a bit of a strange text to get from someone new outright, and at this time. I don’t know what this guy’s intentions are, although he seemed nice and normal and decent, unlike some men I’ve met out and about whom seemed unstable or creepy/horny.

I’m hesitant to continue with this tho cos this guy is so much older than I am (I’m 23, he’s 35 like I said). I don’t want to seem rude or mean and ignore him, and I’d look like a right idiot saying I don’t want to talk anymore considering I said we should exchange numbers. So now I’m unsure what to do.

163,"A little over a year ago I attended a party with hopes of seeing a good friend. She’s gorgeous, has a beautiful smile and an incredibly open personality. After more then a few we find ourselves confessing what we’ve probably felt for years, affection for each other. We’re both in committed relationships, with absolutely nothing to gain from taken another step. We’ve been friends, close friends for years with no issues. And now I know it will only cause problems from here on out, especially because the girl I’m dating is well aware of situation,Not to mention someone who I’m willing to love for the rest of my life. I guess what I’m asking is, where do we go from here? Me and my friend plainly speaking. Is it possible to rekindle a friendship, can we get over this and stay good friends? Or does this truly just hang over us something we never solved, making us strangers for the greater good? Is there any situation where we can stay good friends without any suspicion of of anything else?",01Dec2018,1

I'm not proud of it, and I did it because I was horribly depressed and was prone to suicidal attempts but had nowhere to turn to for help. I haven't told any of them this.

But anyways, I'm fumbling around in life trying to get a decent career despite my disposition. Any time I do something that I feel good about, something that I think is an accomplishment that I wanna talk about with people, they either flat-out ignore it or give a one worded answer before quickly changing subjects. 

I don't gloat. I'm not trying to rub it in their faces that I studied for a certification and got it, but I'd like to at least have a little recognition for my efforts.

167,I've been talking to this girl a lot. We've talked on the phone and everything and have had great conversations. We've added each other on facebook. But she keeps saying she's busy?? She says she's trying to get into dental school and has to focus on her studies. But i've asked her out about 20 times and she always has an excuse. What's the deal?,01Dec2018,1
168,"My youngest half brother quite frequently threatens to kill myself and others in various ways, usually stating he'll do something with a knife, most recently simply ""stab you to death"". He has quite a few knives across his room, though not really a ""collection"". Just has them. Others have been like ""Rip your throat out"" or ""cut your dick off and shove it down your throat"". A lot of neck based threats. So maybe I'll invest in a gorget.

My mom is aware of this but does nothing about it. All she'll really ever do is talk. But clearly after several years this hasn't helped at all.

We are both old enough to be kicked out, but despite him not having a job nor looking for one, and not contributing in any way other than playing skyrim all day in the living room and being a dick head making it so nobody else can be in the living room, he doesn't do anything. And also that's not contributing. You can't even cook without him bitching about how the ""scree"" of the stove pisses him off so he turns the TV up a bunch. Usually from the already loud 20 (which he refuses to turn down because ""*sometimes* they whisper"") to 28 or some shit. Which he also blares it if people are having a conversation anywhere but in their bedrooms.

Despite this, my mom lets him stay here under the excuse ""What am I supposed to do? I can't kick him out, it's not fair."". Even though he's literally, and frequently, threatening to actually kill her other kids. He has, in the past, threatened it and then grabbed a kitchen knife, when the conflict started in there.

This particular conflict came about when I told him to stop leaving all the lights on. He argued against that. For some reason. Claiming he did it so people would think there was people here so we don't get robbed. Despite our house not exactly being a ""good target"" at all nor us living in a shifty neighborhood.

However, this excuse is really just laziness because he quite frankly can't be bothered to turn anything off. He turns his room on for the 3 seconds he's in there then leaves it on as he goes to the living room to play skyrim. And various other lights.

But anyway.

I'm not really sure what to do.

From looking at a list of behavioral stuff about people who're psychopathic it's pretty damn much him.

Even the pathological lying. He claims he knows various martial arts that he learned from friends dojos or whatever. And yet, is always at home. He claims he only eats freshly hunted meat. Despite there not being anywhere to hunt around here and coming home with taco bell. He'll leave food out that ONLY he would eat and claim it was someone else. He just lies about EVERYTHING all the time. For no reason. It doesn't make anyone think he's cool, it doesn't spare him any blame since it's obviously him. And when you call him on his lying, in this case ""You do leave all the lights on all the time"" you get ""Shut up before I stab you to death"" as a response. If you try and call him on anything he'll get frustrated and threaten to kill you or himself.

He's 19 or 20, I'm never sure cause I suck at remembering even my own age. So he's too old to be resorting to that and has shown too many signs of being willing to act on it, with him and myself having physically fought multiple times in the past. Though now if he attacked me I'd be fairly helpless since my knee is all fucked up. When we have fought neither of us would use a weapon and normally I would try and pull him to the ground and sit on him until he agreed to chill the fuck out. Though some do start by objects being thrown.

Anyway. I don't feel safe at my own house because of this brat. And I'm not sure what I can do about it.

We're on housing, so the lady who owns our house can kick us out for basically anything. So I'm worried calling the police about anything might not be an option since it might point us out as a problem or something and get us kicked out. Least that's what I seem to recall my mom having said.

We can't ""force"" him into any kind of counseling since he's too old and I especially can't since I'm just an older sibling.

So what can I do short of getting him before he, seemingly inevitably, gets me? Cause I don't exactly wanna stab anybody either. All I do presently is back off and call my mom basically. To which I'm told ""What can I do? I can't do anything about it."" basically.

So is there nothing we can do? Do I have to wait for him to ACTUALLY stab someone, instead of just grabbing or punching them? Or throwing stuff at them? Cause I'd much rather be more proactive than reactive as my mom seems to want to be. Even though she did nothing when he pelted my sister in the leg with a thing of deodorant that left her with a bruise.",01Dec2018,1

170,"First off I know the health effects, this was both a personal test. Currently I have ginr 41 hours and 50 minutes with no sleep.

On my phone, holding it out in front of me, then all of a sudden the phone, my arm, and room would ""reappear"" as if it had vanished in the first place, I couldn't even hear the music until it ""came back"".

171,"I’m not sure where to start or if this is even the right place to be asking this (not sure if I will even have a question by the end) but i think I just need to put down some words and see if there is any response.  

 I’m dyslexic and typing this on a phone so please excuse all of the typos and formatting in advance.

For starters I am a 28 year old guy with nothing to complain about. I have a state job which I enjoy (it is stressful but rewarding work) and I own a small house that is good enough for me.  Different people will define success different ways and I do feel like I have been successful with my life so far.  The problem is I guess that I just feel empty(not sure if that’s what I mean).  I experience joy almost and a daily basis but I don’t feel happy, I feel sad almost as much but I don’t feel depressed.  

3 year ago I had a divorce from a girl that I met in college. We were together for 5 years and married for 1. During that time i was working 3 jobs and struggling to make ends meet while we both spent too much money and we’re living in a condo that was probably too expensive. After we split, i found myself free of a toxic marriage (a different long story), I moved to my home town, found myself a house and a job I could see myself working for the rest of my life as an Enviromental health specialist. All in all it was a good move for me.  

During the week, I volunteer to teach youth shooting sport several nights a week, I have weekly card night with some friends and I have a roommate that is a veteran who is trying very hard to re-adjust to civ life who require a lot of my attention and that hang out with most nights. I live close to my mother who has a nervous system disease that make it hard for her to do a lot to thing so I find myself at her house constantly to help out with small tasks.So when I do have free time to myself after work or on the weekends, it is usually spent trying to get some extra sleep or falling down the rabbit hole that is YouTube.  

I have a busy life but it’s all of my own choice, I put myself where I am today because I want to be here. So why do I feel so lost and everything seem so “empty”.

172,"To start, Ive been working at a university gym for a good 5 years now as a student employee in maintenance.  Seen a lot of people come, go, graduate, whatever.  Pretty quickly I was made supervisor because I know how to do the work.  In all this time of working there Ive never had to deal with drama because, for the most part, everyone in the department is mature enough to solve problems on their own.  The job itself is pretty chill and the other departments let us get away with a lot of shit as long as we get the work done on time.  

&amp;#x200B;

Back in September we hired some new employees.  Some of them I knew from outside of work and one of them, Roommate, has been bugging me for a long time about getting a job.  Well, he got hired and started working.  Immediately things start happening between him and the others.  Little things at first really, but now its a problem.  Rebounding a job onto someone else occasionally, using the phone at inappropriate times, not doing anything when everyone else is clearly busy.  Like, I get it, its a student job, hourly, we can afford to relax a bit, but c'mon.  Anyway, due to the nature of my position I cant be everywhere at once and so Ive missed a lot of whats been going on.  

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently Roommate has just been getting more and more unpleasant to work with.  Being really verbally aggressive with the coworkers,  back talking the big boss, just repeating things the supervisors say back to the other workers, mostly stupid kid things.  Anyway, today a bunch of the others came to me about it and explained that hes mostly been targeting his ""ire"" at one of the female employees for no apparent reason. This needs to stop but I dont know how to go about explaining to the guy without him just completely shutting down.  Ive kinda asked about some of his behavior before in the past but he always gave me some excuse about how hes so competitive.  The guy's a sore loser.  Hates when hes wrong and if pushed too hard he just gets pissed or shuts down, usually both.  If its not a videogame, chances are pretty good he doesnt know anything about it.  If hes not interested in a thing he will fight tooth and claw to not learn it.  Speaking of claw, his nails are like an inch and a half.  He constantly tries to act like hes me, hes not....at all.  If its not math related then it doesnt make sense.  I'm ranting now but im sure you get the point.  I get along with him, but its usually a chore.

182,"Let’s be honest, poor advice. Instead of actually trying to help marriages and relationships, everyone always says “break it off” or “kick him/her to the curb.” They don’t want to help, if they did want to help, they would comment a way to actually solve and help the relationship, unless breaking up was the absolute last resort. No effort is given into most of the comments. 

Most of all redditors aren’t even therapists. Some might be for all I know, but let’s be realistic here. Most of the entire population of reddit are just random people who have emails and passwords. If you aren’t a therapist or councilor, then you don’t have the right to give someone relationship advice because you mostly don’t know what you’re talking about. 

It seems most do these people on reddit haven’t even experienced relationships at all, or if you were dumbed by your boyfriend/girlfriend in a bad way, you use that as your professionalism. I have been in relationships before, I’m not perfect, no one is. I would not talk to someone who’s seeking relationship advice and try to help them the best I can if I’m not a clinical therapist, it’s not something for you to do. Also there’s an entire sub on this app/website that encourages people to cheat on their spouses and give them support, like seriously?

It seems like people have been dumped on here, they then give “advice” through their experience, which is absurd since they just use their own problems as a coping mechanism to reflect on other people’s relationships. 

If I went on this, saying my boyfriend or girlfriend has problems, most people would say just break it up. If you actually wanted to help, you would give solid advice. Why do people even give advice on here if that’s not the case.

183,"TL;DR My dad's a bad husband cheating on my mom. My mom's passive and denial. How do I cope?

Disclaimer: There are three parts to this story from different perspectives

I love my parents. I appreciate how they provided my siblings and I a lot growing up. They're going through a tough time and it's affecting the family. It's mainly because of my dad's fault.

Part1: My dad

My dad cheated on my mom a few years ago. It went on for 5 straight years without her knowing. He worked in another country while we were left back home. What's worse, during that time he had a kid with another woman.

My dad has a tendency to flirt with women younger than him. Sometimes younger than me (ew). Of course my mom was furious when she found out he was cheating. She and my younger sister moved to where my dad was working so she could keep an eye on him.

Until this day, my dad is denying the fact that he's still seeing the other woman. He's still sending money to her because he felt obligated for the kid.

Part2: My older sister

My mom found out through my sister. My sister found out while using my dad's phone because he wanted something fixed. She traced the number and through social media found out who it was. There were photos that contained evidence that my dad was cheating.

My sister tried confronting my dad. He was in denial. She told mom but of course she doesn't believe her. My mom only believed her when she started stalking the woman on social media. Now, my mom keeps ranting to my sister about her problems with my dad and it's stressing her out.

Part 3: My mom

When my dad admitted that he was cheating, she was crying. He tried to say it's over, but my mom wasn't having it. She actually installed a hidden cam in our house in case she was out of town, she would see him once he gets home.

She tried therapy once here in our country. But since she lives with my dad in another country, so she's not comfortable going to therapy there. Most likely because of the language barrier (she's more comfortable speaking in her mother tongue compared to English). She would make excuses too for not going. She would rather rant to my sister, which stresses her out.

Sometimes she would channel her anger to me and my siblings if we do something small ex. not cleaning up after ourselves when she's around.

Oh and another thing: My mom doesn't know that I know. My sister told me what was happening.

I really like this place where I'm working at, but I just received a notice that I'll be let go and the contract ends at the said time frame.

  


I've already applied for other jobs and I might consider applying for unemployment as well since it took me more than a year to get a new job and I'm not confident with my finances right now. The recruiter who had me onboard said that she'll see what she can do but I also know that it's not guaranteed I can get another one immediately after the contract ends. The company unfortunately doesn't have any open positions that I am qualified for (Got a B.S. In Psychology and currently working on my MBA, and my experiences at work are limited to mostly office work and I'm horrible at customer service oriented jobs. I've got minimal experience in recruitment and university testing evaluations).

  


As of now, the tasks that they assigned me are mere filing duties and they are not training me anymore in any additional things that can be complemented with my initial training. It feels so daunting and wasteful of my abilities especially when the feedback that I received are mostly positive from both my supervisor and other co-workers.

  


Do I just hope for the best besides adhering to just filing till my contract ends and continue applying for jobs?

189,"So little backstory. My mom's in prison, serving 16 years. And tomorrow, I'm going to the city that she's incarcerated at, to look at vehicle to buy hopefully, and I asked my friend last week if she could take me to check out the vehicle and  see my mom in prison (hit two birds in one stone) she said yeah she would. 

So yesterday I found out that she's bringing her ""boyfriend"" along now, because she wants me and our other friends to meet him. 

The problem I have is this: I don't really know the guy, and I'm very ""protective"" of my life. I didn't tell them about my mother until we were friends for like, 2 years, give or take. But now that she's bringing this guy along, it seems, outta place I guess? I don't like people knowing about that stuff and now that he's ""tagging"" along, I feel anger I suppose. Just a little bit. 

I feel like, she could have waited a little longer for her to bring this guy along and all that, or for a different time, and she's only been talking to this guy for less than a month. So I'm just, confused at to what I'm feeling. I don't want to visit my mom if he's coming along, which he is anyways, but then my other friend is feeling the same as me. Since I don't know the guy and all that, I'm not really comfortable visiting her. 

If it was just us 4 originally (me, her, our two other friends) then I was fine, Because they all know about my mom. But now I just don't know. 
 I'm having minor panic attacks thinking about the ""awkward"" conversation of ""when do you want to see your mom?"" And me saying ""nah, it's cool"". And then more questions get asked and turns into a problem. 

Am I in the wrong or could it be justified? Thanks. ",01Dec2018,1

I dont mean to be Evasive towards them, but it's really no ones business why I cant make it to one of my shifts if it's a PERSONAL reason.I've worked there 5 years and this is only the second time I wont be able to make a shift.

192,"So I was at the gym today, and there was this girl there. I’ve never seen her there before and it was pretty slow so we kept making eye contact. At first i thought it was just accidental and nothing more. But then eventually she would stare at me more and not look away. Like I was doing seated bicep curls and she walks behind me and we both hold eye contact in the mirror. In my head I’m like okay must be by accident still. 
Next I move on to do some dumbbell shrugs. I’m doing my sets and she’s over in the corner doing some ab workout. I look over towards her and she took her jacket off and is in one of those like sports bras. Whatever must be kinda hot in here. I carry on with my shrugs and after I finish my set and sit down she walks over towards me and leans against the shoulder press machine and just stares at me through the mirror. Literally like 5 feet away from and we’re just holding eye contact. I ended up doing like 4 more sets of shrugs cause I didn’t know what to do so I felt like maybe getting a better pump will help. I’m starting to think it’s not just a coincidence but still not  completely sure. 
Okay so after I finish my 7 sets of shrugs she starts doing Tricep kickbacks on the closest free bench. Whatever that’s normal except she’s doing it like bent over with her ass pointing directly at me. I can’t deny I was mirin alittle but whatever, no big deal. So I move a bench closer to her cause I also need a flat bench to do some tricep overhead presses. 
Okay so where I’m sitting is also directly in front of the mirror so we’re still doing our weird like eye contact thing, and she gets up and sits on the open bench press directly behind me. The bench press faces the opposite way of me. But she sits on it so she can stare directly at me. Like not even kidding I leaned just enough where I could see her eyes in the mirror and they were locked on me. I’m starting to freak out at this point so I just do a few extra sets while I think. 
I’m still not sure if this is all a coincidence or not, but I don’t want to make it weird so I don’t do anything. After like 10 minutes she gets up and starts walking away. But she stops after like 2 steps. Turns around and we make eye contact for a good 3 seconds before she turns around and leaves. So I’ve been trying to process this all day, and still not 100% sure she’s into me or just likes to make eye contact with people in odd ways.  
So I’m either going to talk to her if I see her again or I’m bringing sunglasses with me from now on. ",01Dec2018,1

195,"To give some background - I have recently turned 25. I got good grades in high school and always wanted to be a doctor. However, when i didn’t get into medicine I choice to do anatomy at university for just over a year. 

I eventually decided to drop out of uni and decided to work full time. I got a good job working for a bank, made friends and whilst living at home it gave me a great opportunity to really save up for a house. 

Anyway, last year i was diagnosed with a form of cancer and had to undergo surgery and chemo. But alas i’m doing fine and in remission. I worked for the bank in an admin role for almost 3 years when i just recently got made redundant.

I have decided to go back to uni next year and study nursing. I think i’d make a great nurse and have a real passion for medicine/surgery and cancer nursing. The issue is I feel like i’ve wasted so much time and should have just done this straight out of high school. Although I am appreciative for the life and work experience I have gained and the fact that I have been able to build up my savings. I’ll be fully qualified as a nurse by the time I turn 28. Is that too old? 

Am I doing the right thing by deciding to go back to uni and study nursing? This might mean another 3 years of living at home until i’m 28... any advice for me?

My boyfriend wouldn’t do anything with her because well, it’s his best friend and also because my boyfriend doesn’t find her attractive at all. My boyfriend has a lot of problems with her and tends to rant about her. So I don’t think he’ll cheat on me with her. 
However, his birthday was was just a week and a half ago and some of her actions then has made me really want him to stay away from her.

I got in a small fight with my boyfriend in private before his birthday dinner. It was quickly resolved but I wasn’t really in the mood so I just sat there. I have a resting bitch face so I probably didn’t look happy. She insulted me and said that I’m a crappy girlfriend for killing the mood and said that my boyfriend should get someone who could at least pretend to be happy for him. 
Later that night, she apologized and asked me what happened. I told her a small summary about it and she told me that I should definitely break up with my boyfriend and that I can do so much better. 
For his birthday, she bought him a gift card to this bbq place in our city. I eat a mostly plant based diet so when my bf opened the gift, he was basically like “who am I going to take now?” She volunteered herself. She got upset when he decided to take his dad. 

She wants to stay over at my boyfriend’s place (her fiancé’s place as well), during the day so she can study. My boyfriend works night so he’s there in the day so they’ll be alone a lot.

199,"Hey! So this is gonna sound kinda sad and stupid but I'm trying to figure out what I should do. 

I'm currently a sophomore in college, set to major in History. I go to school in a big city and the problem is that even after three semesters of school I still don't know anyone very well. I have friends, but I don't have people I can depend on to hang out with, so I end up spending most of my time alone. This hasn't been great for my mental health. 

I also have not found much inspiration in what I'm studying. I skip class all the time and put the minimal effort into my studies. Thankfully I've managed to keep my grades up pretty nicely despite this. 

I'm considering transferring to another school, as I'd love a fresh start, but I'm not sure that I should take the risk. I mean, I have a good number of things going for me. I have a few friends like I mentioned, I'm part of a sorority, I have a fun job, and the school that I go to (Boston University) is pretty well ranked and has a good reputation. I'm not miserable here, but I would say that I'm definitely not as happy as I know I could be. 

I also love being outdoors, hiking and climbing and stuff, which is obviously not the easiest thing to do when you live in the middle of Boston. I think if I were to transfer it would be to a school that has better access to the outdoors. 

However, I'm scared that if I transfer nothing will change, and I will just waste more of my life to end up back in the same position. I'm already 20 years old, and I know that's not too old, but I just feel like my wheels are spinning while all of my friends are moving on ahead. 

So, should I: Stay at my respectable university, where I have a few friends and do have some fun but feel mostly lonely and stuck, or should I transfer to a different college and start fresh with the possibility of failure?

If you've actually read this whole thing - thanks for listening. I'd appreciate any advice, really. I'm scared that I'll be in the same position I am now at this time next year, and want change, but I don't know how easy it is to make friends and a new start as a transfer. 

I know this sounds like a stupid question, but transferring seems like a huge decision to make. I wish you could have a trial period for college lol!

203,"A short summary is, i moved to California leaving my job behind to be closer to my mother as shes going thru chemo.

while im living with her and her husband, ive been looking for a job for some time so i can support myself and not depend on them so much. also, the husband has been handling the situation poorly and has annoyed family including my mother. we are still together except my patience has gotten very thin with him.

after 2 months of constantly applying and not getting heard from i miraculously got 3 interviews this week from 3 great businesses. i feel like I did well in the interviews and left them with a great impression wanting to hire me.

one thing that heavily factors in where ill work at is the location. the other is the pay rate.

job 1: furthest away and i have to go across a bridge to get there. its like almost on an island. small company. offers benefits. role is to be an it manager and maintain their website. also take upon special projects from time to time, helping office staff and making sure business IT runs as smooth as possible. they are looking at a 40-50k range. i initially requested 70-80.

job 2: a bit closer but still the same distance. i don't need a bridge to get there. also small company but they are bigger than job 1. the staff here, even the vp is younger. my role would be similar as well as would include social media management. im pretty much to be deferred to to create rules and policies and make decisions on what should be done to help improve things that involve IT or the business as a whole. i requested 60-70, they were looking at 50.

job 3: bigger company than previous 2. mytask is only on IT side. no design ir social media. long drive and traffic would be a nuisance during rush hour but they do have other branches that may be an easier ride. they are looking to fill several positions although theres no guarantee id get the position im interested in. theres plenty of opportunity for growth and company while small has great growth potential. i feel like id be one of the early birds that got a position that would be hard to get in future. also  young crowd, laid back, there were dogs in the office. inlove dogs. position i want pays 50-70k which id be content with. they offer a strong benefits package. my only fear with this one is they will take a while to make a hiring decision and i need something fast. i want to move out asap, but still be there for mom.

so im torn which i should take. i dont feel like what im asking for is greedy but i understand they have budgets. this is California and rent is ridiculous, gas prices are astronomical, and to get aces, you have to drive forever. i love the first 2 jobs because I feel theyd hire sooner than the 3rd, but i just feel lowballed. theyre asking me to do 2 different professions and get paid undermarket value for 1. the locations are an inconvenience but I feel that will be overcome once i live closer. 

what do you suggest?

TLDR: sry for long post. desperate for job so i could move out. got 3 job interviews. all far away. lowballed by 2, but they will make decision before 3rd that i like their financial &amp; benefits package the best.",01Dec2018,1

206,"I’m a 20 yr old male in college who has the girl of his dreams. Or, HAD anyways. She broke up with me the other day over something I’m not proud of and have been trying to hide for quite some time now. Let me start from the beginning.
She and I met in freshman year. I’ll spare you the soppy details, just know I wanted this girl more than anything and I pursued her til she said yes. We were happy for a time. But suddenly I started acting different. 
Before high school, I was picked on and made fun of for how I looked. In the final two years of high school, I lost weight, overhauled my look, and was finally considered good looking. Girls finally liked me. So instead of handling it maturely I let it go to my head. By the time my gf and I met, I was a womanizing asshole with a need for attention. I tried to leave it behind in college, but it crept back up and I didn’t stop it or myself.
I remembered I had posted a pic of myself in a Hamilton dating group on FaceBook before my gf and I had even gotten together, so I checked it. I liked some replies, laughed at some of the stuff that was said, and moved on with my day. Nothing more or less. Then one of the girls DM’d me. This is where I messed up big time. Like an alcohol addiction, after that first drop I couldn’t shake it again. I flirted with her once, and she was interested. Instant hit. I felt great about myself. So I kept going. Then more girls messaged me. Same thing. Then I messaged some girls. Same thing. Suddenly I was talking to and flirting with quite a few other girls while being in a relationship with my gf. I had already told her I loved her. I thought I did too. When I was with her, and I was holding her and keeping her close, I meant it more than anything in my life. But when I was away from her, FB Messenger was there to fulfill other desires. I never got nudes from or sent them to these girls. I never tried to meet up with them. I drew the line there. But I had already crossed the line and I wasn’t even showing remorse. After spending a Christmas break away from her and barely talking to her (as I was too caught up in my other escapades), I saw her at school in January. My heart lept out of my chest. I was ecstatic. And then came the twinge of guilt. I had been without this beautiful creature for so long and I missed her terribly and I had treated her like I had. How could I do that? So I hid it. I didn’t tell her. How could I? I just swept it under the rug and tried my hardest to be a good bf for her and never make those mistakes again. I can honestly say I did not. But I did make other mistakes later.
Flash forward to sophomore year, second semester. We’ve been together a year. It’s March 2018, and she and I had been doing well enough. I was in ATL celebrating my younger sister’s bday with my fam. Suddenly I felt terrible. Boom. Mild food poisoning. My gf and I were supposed to go out to see a theatre performance the next afternoon on a Sunday, but I could tell right then I couldn’t make it. So I texted her from the bathroom, and when the coast was clear, called her. She was very upset, as she should be, that I had to cancel. But then came the line that colored my vision the rest of the weekend. “If this is another situation where you ‘don’t feel good’ and then are fine for church tomorrow, I’m gonna be pissed.” And so I get home and go to sleep trying to clear my body of this terrible feeling. When I wake up, my pastor father says “Sorry son. You have a solo.” I had to go to church. After the solo, I threw up in the church bathroom. While I’m throwing up, my gf texts me and asks how I was and where I am. I remember the night before and don’t want her to be mad at me. So what do I do? I lie. I say “I’m at home babe.” When she logged into our livestream in order to be sure I was telling the truth and saw me singing, she immediately broke up with me. Done. Blocked number and everything. No more us. I was devastated. Especially when I was sick. I broke down in the floor, didn’t move for hours. How could I lose my girlfriend over a tiny lie? I didn’t stop to thin then that even a tiny lie would betray that I could lie about anything. And that’s why she broke up with me. She couldn’t trust me anymore. But I care to her apartment. I was crying. Sobbing. Begging. Promising to be better. And she finally said yes. She took me back. I was so happy you honestly don’t know. I had her back. I would never squander this opportunity again.
And I didn’t. I can honestly say up until this past week, she and I were great. I loved her more and more each day. We talked about marriage a lot. It’s our junior year of college, it’s time to start thinking about those things. I got her a promise ring and everything. Then this past Wednesday, I was checking my grade book online. For the entire semester I’ve checked it and my grades were great. First semester with almost all A’s. But this time, nothing was there. I didn’t know what was going on. (BTW my grades still aren’t there but I’m getting that fixed.) I showed my gf my grades and she was livid. She accused me of not going to class, not doing my work. She accused me of lying all semester to her about everything school related and I was hurt. I thought we were past the whole trust thing. I tell her the truth about everything now. But apparently not. She kicked me out of her apartment and I went to go take care of my grades. I talked to my teachers and found out what I needed to do. I told her everything and she said I could be lying and to just go home (I live with my parents, as we only live 45 minutes from campus). So I drove all the way back home and was depressed the rest of the day. Then she asked for my logon info later that night. I told her sure and gave it to her thinking there wasn’t anything incriminating on there, but there was. You see, I’ve never been original, so my Facebook account had the same login info as my email and grade-book. She did some digging to see if I was lying and she instead found all those messages from years ago between me and those other girls. She called me crying and screaming, and dumped me right there. I saw her the next day after class where she sat in my car with me and yelled at me and screamed and berated me and finally when she was done with her rant I broke down in tears because I couldn’t believe I had lost her. I begged her to see that I’m different now. I was a much more immature and egotistical person back then, and even my own family says I’ve changed a lot since dating her. I pleaded with her to let me get some things in my life sorted out (things we’d talked about like me moving out and my grades and such) and for her to take the time to try to calm down and see if she could possibly trust me again. That was all yesterday. She said ok and we kissed and left it there. I had hope again. Today she’s on a trip with her friends and she’s changed her entire tune. She says she’ll never again trust me and she’s saying horrible things like how maybe I should die and let God start over with me so he might get it right this time. 
I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m crying in my bed as I write this, and I could really use your advice if you have any for me. How can I salvage this situation? I want my gf back, do you think it’s possible? Even if I can’t salvage the relationship, how do I stay in her life?

209,"Hi everyone! 

Going to give you a little background before I get into the problem and where I need advice. 
So, I’ve been friends with two sisters - Annie and Susie - since high school (I’m now 27). Through them, I met a girl named Meredith a few years ago. Meredith is good friends with both sisters and her and I are casual friends, we get coffee once in a while but I wouldn’t consider her a good friend of mine, though she is still very good friends with both Annie and Susie. 
 
Annie recently divorced her husband and they have a child together. They don’t have a great relationship; he doesn’t put a lot of effort into his relationship with their child and he treated her like shit towards the end of their relationship. 

Now, I recently found out, through a mutual friend of all of ours, that Meredith slept with Annie’s (now ex) husband before they were married, but while they were living together (obviously exclusive etc etc). Meredith told our mutual friend when she was drunk and the friend wasn’t sure what to do so she told me. Meredith is still best friends with both sisters and nobody knows that they slept together (besides the two of us) (and now all of you). 

Do I have to tell Annie and Susie? 

At first I adamantly thought I did have to tell them; I’m much better friends wth them than I am with her, and I think in their position I’d want to know. I feel like shit keeping this secret but there’s also some reasons I lean towards not telling them; I don’t want to completely fuck up Annies relationship with her ex since they have a kid together. Additionally (though this is kind of my least concern), it would make things super weird between myself and the mutual friend who told me this secret, since she obviously doesn’t want me to tell anyone. It will also effectively ruin both sisters’ relationship with Meredith. 

I hope this makes sense, it’s hard to explain all the background info of something when everyone is so interconnected. Any advice is appreciated... I’m kind of leaning towards telling them, mostly because I think they deserve the truth and, selfishly because I feel like shit keeping the secret. ",01Dec2018,1

After I received the message I sent it to my family, mom, dad, brother (my mother, her sister) and my mom gave her a call and was told her phone was hacked and it was a fake message. 

After a couple days passed my aunt who I have not seen or talked to for a couple years called me and wanted to go get dinner, I declined because I had a couple tests the next day I needed to study for. 

Now today she called me and asked if I could go get dinner because I took a rain check for last time and I said yeah I would love to! Because she is my aunt and she didn’t do anything wrong because her phone was “hacked”.

Some i got for free (job perks), and some i bought. Anyway, I've got this sweet little whiskey collection, only 6 or 7 bottles in the $50 range, but all stuff that I'm really excited to own. I haven't touched it in months, I'll admit, because it's been giving me heartburn. I've gained weight over the past year, but i was hopeful to drop some pounds one of these days and be able to enjoy my whiskey again. 

Tonight, my boyfriend poured himself a glass of whiskey and accidentally spilled it. I was in the other room, but i came to see what all the fuss was about. I asked him which whiskey he spilled, and he said the name of my favorite one in my collection.  I was slightly disappointed to hear that he was dipping into my favorite bottle and decided to open the cabinet to see how much was left in the bottle. It was pushed to the back of the cabinet behind 2 other bottles, which struck me as unusual because he just used it to pour himself a drink.  It was also mostly gone. About an inch and a half from being empty. Then i decided to look at the other bottles. One by one, I'm taking them down from their cabinet above the fridge, and they're all close to empty. They were also pushed back far enough in the cabinet that i was unable to see how empty they were without taking them down and looking at all of them individually.

I addressed my concern with him immediately. Not only had he drank almost all of these whiskeys that i personally hand-selected, but he seemed to be hiding it at least a little bit. I  mean, i knew that he dipped into them every once in a while, but i also assumed that just like everything else we share, he gets half and i get half.  Whenever i buy a 6pk, he drinks 3 and leaves the other 3 for me.. even if i don't touch them for weeks. If he wants one, he'll always ask me if he can have some of mine. He never takes my share without asking. Same with food. 

He immediately got defensive. He insisted that they were easily replaceable and said he'd buy me more and wondered why we were taking about it at all. He said that we never discussed whether or not we would split these bottles 50/50, and i shouldn't assume that he knew to do it that way.  He said that the reason the one bottle was pushed so far back into the cabinet was because that's where it was when he took it out, and he was simply putting it back where he found it. He said he understands why i might be concerned about alcoholism because his dad has substance abuse issues, but still thought it was useless for us to discuss the extremely low levels of all the bottles. He apologized for drinking so much of all of them but said that he couldn't have had any idea that they meant so much to me. He said that he drank from them periodically over the course of 4 months, which is when i brought home most of the bottles. He said that he drank most of it while i was at work so the opportunity never arose to discuss whether or not I wanted any of the whiskey.  There's no way i would drink more than a bottle of whiskey in a month's time. Especially if it's good whiskey. 

None of this adds up. It feels like he deliberately left a little in each bottle so that if i poured myself some, i would be the one to officially finish the bottles. Also, I've expressed so much excitement about these whiskeys. I feel like there's no way he didn't know that they were special to me. One of them was even a gift from a good customer of mine, and it's nearly gone. And it makes no sense that the bottle he just used is now at the back of the cabinet, with bottles in front of it. There's no way he could have put it there without moving the other bottles out of the way and then moving them back. It's too deliberate. If he panned on replacing any of it, why would he hide the bottle? 

If you read through all of this then you're an angel, and I thank you. Does anyone have experience with alcoholism? Should i be worried, or should i accept his apology, accept his offer to replace the bottles and chill? ",01Dec2018,1
214," i should clarify i am in no was abused, (crazy people lol ) also they where asking me what i wanted i just didn't know so we are going shopping tomorrow K so without too much detail i'm just going in to kinda vent.

Since our breakup however she has 

1) slept with her ex

2) slept with one of my close friends (I'm definitely not talking to him again)

217,"Just yesterday I was fired from my job for what I think are pretty petty reasons. Coming back from my parent's house out of state after Thanksgiving. My bus had to be rescheduled and I missed two shifts. I called my supervisor as early as possible (woke her up, actually) and another manager took my shifts.

I worked this entire week and was told on Thursday that due to having missed work the past weekend I was being terminated. I suspect there were at least some ulterior motives. I was the highest paid manager and was due to begin receiving insurance from the company next month. It's a regional theater, not a national conglomerate, so this sort of thing might make a quantifiable difference to them, I don't know.

What I do know is that one of the shows slated for later this year isn't going to happen. There's no cast and no director attached. Negotiations for the rights fell through, but we continue to lie to customers and pretend as if it will ultimately happen. It won't. At best it might be replaced by another show, but that hasn't been announced or cast yet either.

I probably won't do this, but indulge me- how would you feel as a customer in this situation? Do you think you have the right to know and do you think it would be of interest to local arts reporters? This company already has a reputation for being out of touch and elitist. I'm not feeling very charitable right now and we didn't have contracts or NDA's.",01Dec2018,1
218,"I can admit straight from the get-go that I wasn't prepared to go to college after graduating from HS. I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. Planned on working for a year, getting my head screwed on straight and *then* dipping my toes into the idea of college and everything that comes along with it. Cue in some good ole fashioned familial pressure vs. my non-existent backbone back then though, aaaand I'm off to a University.

Fast forward: Not in Kansas anymore, Toto. We've been jetpacked fresh out a Very Bad Situation **™** at home into the middle of buttfuck nowhere to get us some of that sweet education. Was still kinda reeling from the VBS ™ but not going to use that as an excuse. Anyways: I procrastinate, stress, procrastinate some more and proceed to bomb my entire freshman year in one fell swoop. Excluding maybe one or two classes, both of which being electives. If my GPA was equivalent to money, I wouldn't even be able to buy a piece of gum from one of those crank-and-receive machines in grocery stores - it was that low. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward some more: Back home and in a better headspace. Also in small pit of debt with my transcript locked up in academic limbo until it's paid off. Freaking out but working and saving to pay it off, because even though I still don't really know what I want to do yet, I'm pretty interested in going back to college at some point. But after I've gotten that squared away, what do I do? I mean - aside from taking my basics at community college, what *is* there to do? I doubt my interests would make a very good career choice, but my biggest fear is devoting myself to a job that I realize that I hate or just don't really care about later on down the line after investing who-knows-how-many years to get a degree for it. Should I just put on my big girl boots and get over myself to look into something that'll support me, or should I go after something that I know without a doubt I'd be happy with but would probably leave my future stability up in the air over? Do I really need the transcript from my old university to go someplace else? Should I even be thinking of re-enrolling myself into a college when I don't know what I want to do or should I be googling plane ticket prices while searching for a country to run away to in order to get a fresh start? Canada or Europe? Someone give me a reality check, please.

224,"I'm a fifteen year old girl. My stepdad and mum have been married since I was about one year old. I have always gotten along with my stepdad, he isn't an alcoholic and isn't abusive or neglective or anything like that. 
But today I was looking through his photo album as he recently got a new phone and the most recent picture was presumable cocaine.
It was a few lines of white powder and there was a credit card in the picture. 

I've wondered about this before as my dad, who you might say is a slight alcoholic, had been round once and had shouted abuse at my parents (mainly stepdad) calling him a druggie.
The picture also lines up with the fact that yesterday he asked if I could stay round a friend's as he wanted to have someone over. At the time I thought it wasn't weird and said yes. 

The other instance of this is that once, quite a while ago, I found a white powder on my bed sheets after being at my dad's house on the weekend.
I asked my mum to take a look and for a reason I don't remember, I wasn't in the room when she did. She came out sniffing, said it was nothing, and I forgot all about it.

I had been able to brush off all the past instances but I have anxiety over the picture which practically confirms that at least my stepdad takes drugs. I don't know what to do or if I should mention it and so made this post for some advice.",01Dec2018,1
225,"My son, 12, recently came up with an entire religion-philosophy surrounding Shia Labeouf. He did it semi-jokingly, and has a nice sense of humor. But I want to know if he's potentially taken it a bit too far.

We watched the Shia video Just Do It. My son loved the video, and declared that every now and then we had to watch the video. So we decided to take Shia breaks where we would stop what we were doing and watch a Shia video. Then he decided to create an 8-fold path concerning Shia fashioned after Buddhism. None of this is a joke. Keep reading.

There are 8 very distinct pillars of the Shia way. He has created various ways to honor Shia Labeouf, including calling him the Me-Shia (messiah). Again, I'm not kidding. 

The ways in which we honor the meshia are called The Doings. So named because of the Just DO it video. 

Now listen. I love my son. I love his inventiveness and dedication to an excellent joke. But there are outlines of Shia all over the place that he traced from the computer. He made a shrine in one of my shelves. He taped an outline of Shia to the inside of his jacket. He unzips his jacket and there's Shia. If your child did this, would you laugh, play along, or be concerned? My son's grades are excellent, he's well behaved, and is a kind and generous person. But he has created a religion dedicated to Shia Labeouf.",01Dec2018,1

231,"Let me start with showing you what I’ve been seeing happening around me. 2018 is the year of break ups, here in the Bay Area of Cali. My friend’s boyfriend broke up with her to get with a depressed girl who lives in Canada, a random girl whom he met through League of Legends and felt a bond with (mentioned depressed because she threatened to hurt herself if the boy did not get with her, according to his story). Another friend’s boyfriend left them because he did not want anything serious after 1 year in and wanted to go back to dating short term. Currently another friend is in a toxic relationship where the guy is emotionally and physically abusive while also manipulative. My own ex left me with the excuse that I did not love him after 3 years and dedication and soon was caught going to the gym and a coffee shop with his cheating ex. 

All of these relationships were/are serious and long term, where me and my friends gave a lot, honestly. 

I’m not ready for a relationship, but I toy with the idea by not blocking my heart from my ol’ high school crush. However, i feel like I have him under a microscope now. I immediately back myself up when I see any signs that he could be like any of these men I’ve seen this year or years before. I’ve concluded, I will only end up being with a friend— but even the friend I have feelings for shows signs of lust that scare me away. I don’t lack too much confidence in who I am or how I look, but seeing his openly high standards despite is humble, genuine, and caring personality back me up to an odd level. I admit, I’ve become much more untrusting. I’ve been working on building myself up to gain confidence but the grass is always greener in somebody else’s lake! So my next plan of action is to hear things that can make me believe in love again!

233,"Tonight, my boyfriend went out with his friends to get drinks. He has struggled with alcohol for a while and I asked him to please be conscious about how much he consumed. About three hours later I get a call from him hysterically crying and I immediately get in my car to get him from the bars. I pick him up and he is blacked out, so far gone that nothing makes sense and he is just crying. I get to his parking garage apartment and for no reason he starts screaming at me to shut the fuck up and other nonsense. He slams the car door and storms to his apartment. 

I head home to my roommates and a couple of her friends, we were having a movie night. One hour later my boyfriends comes barging through the door stomps past me and runs up to my room tracking mud all over the carpets. I run upstairs and he is laughing so loud the whole house could here (it’s 3 stories) and screaming at me to get the fuck away from him... and to leave my own house. I left to let him cool down and my roommates are extremely scared and we’re asking if I was okay. I went back upstairs and he had thrown my huge fan across the room denting the wall, broke my bed frame by kicking it and  threw everything on my desk on the ground. At this point I am crying because I have no idea what to do, he never touched me and laid a hand on me but he was so black out drunk and not making sense. At this point I’m so scared and have kindly asked him to leave. 

Two hours later or intense tears he will not leave, he is screaming on and off and acting like someone from an insane asylum. He storms out of my room and goes down stairs to my roommates, talking non sense and yelling at them to look him in the eyes. We finally found a way to get him outside and he is screaming yelling outside. At this point my roommates are scared and we lock the doors so he can’t come back in. My roommates tell me he can’t come to our house for a while and that they were genuinely terrified. I had a full blown panic attack and couldn’t stop crying because I was so traumatized. 

Our relationship is SO wonderful, but when alcohol gets involved it becomes angry and aggressive (on his side). I have been with him for almost four years and love him no matter what, but tonight took it to another level. I have no idea how to handle this situation.

All parties involved are in their mid twenties.

 We’ve all been on several trips together, she comes over to our house all the time and has always been super nice and shown interest in me. Which is why I started crushing on her. 
That, and she has a very attractive personality. 
she tells me all kinds of feel-good shit, compliments and the like. She playfully picks on me and laughs at my shitty dad jokes, makes kinda catty jokes about my girlfriend when I’m around, and when the both of us like the same song, food, etc., she makes a big deal about it.
 I feel like it’s almost flirty sometimes but I kinda doubt it. 
I’ve never been a player, I have NO game whatsoever and my wife is the only serious relationship I’ve ever had. I think that’s why when her friend gives me the compliments and general niceness I get swooned.

She thinks  shes a good mom because she pays for everything far as food etc but the  way she talks to me and the things she does just making my life so  miserable and theres nothing I can do to stop it because Im under her  full control and she could kick me to the streets any time she wants,  would make anyone just want to just end it all. I have family who always  asked me how do I live with her? and she gets offended but everyone  knows how shes just the worse and shes so controlling! She HAS to have  power and rule over everything and everyone and she loves having this  power over me and my life. Im right where she wants me to be. Every day I  have to walk on egg shells around her so I stay locked away in my room  all day just to try to avoid her my life revolves around these 4 walls! I  live in a smallish town its nothing to do and I dont really know  anyone. all I want ever in life and I swear to never ask for anything  again is to be able to get away from here and her. the worse thing of  all  is I am literally stuck here with no options. You could say oh get a  job work your way up but I literally cant even get a job even if I  wanted to. Ive had one before and with how she has things set up if I  work my check will have to go to her basically. I cant drive I have no  credit i have no GED or Highschool Diploma  I literally have nothing or  no way out except for one way. I have been with my s/o long distance for  4 years now he lives all the way on the other side of the  USA...literally on the opposite side of me. He is working a job long  hours to try and save up and basically save me from this life and I am  so grateful for that and him! He lives in California its very expensive  but he has to live there because of his family. l feel so bad that  theres literally nothing I can do to help but all we need is to raise  2-4k and that would be enough to help me get out of here and away from  her! I love her because shes my mom but she is so toxic I would  literally do anything to be away from her. My question is there anything  I could do to raise money myself or any options or subs on reddit to be  pointed to for help do you think if I made a gofundme explaining my  situation people would help? or is there just any advice at all that  could help me out of this situation? I havent had any type of ""life""  since highschool because of her and that was 5 years ago. I just been  stuck in the house in my room hoping one day this will all be over. When  I was in school I did pretty bad far as grades because of just problems  at home which led to her basically making me drop out at 16 and be left  in this situation with no way out. Please if anyone can help me, give  me any advice on how to make money or somewhere I can get help I would  appreciate it sooooo much! I am begging I have tears as I type this. I  hope to get a response! Thank you!",01Dec2018,1

250,"This all starts about three months ago where I got accepted as an engineer for a dream job not to mention the pay isn't half bad. Someone my age (24) generally speaking should not have this job so leaving the position would be asinine. 

Fast forward two month into the job I got the opportunity to start traveling. . A week later I am on a Plane to Seattle, sitting on the tarmac. We are unfortunately delayed and are waiting to take off. While waiting I got a text from my (ex) girlfriend saying that we are done. When I land I call her and she confirms that we are done because she isnt happy with herself and the distance. The weird thing is she asks if we can get back together in the future.... We had been dating for three years and were already doing long distance. I can understand the reason for the breakup but have been unsettled in the manner it was done. 

Ever since I have been traveling and loving my job which has been very rewarding. Over the past week I have attempted to put myself back out there by going out on a few dates ( Yes because of an APP) .  These dates have been the worst of my life. 

I am really questioning if I should be even going out on dates. I dont seem to have great success approaching people at a bar and typically have to go out by myself because I am traveling. Has anyone have had any similair situations or advice on how to handle dating and meeting new people while traveling?

I have been trying to improve myself everyday by going to the gym, listening to audio books, eating healthy. Does anyone have any other suggestions for self improvement?

Her being trans and pre-hormones is important to the thing I'm asking advice for.
My period has been late for three weeks. In this time I've done two pregnancy tests, both negative.
Since my girlfriend isn't comfortable with her body, we don't have penetrative sex, but rather take turns doing handstuff and oral like a lot of lesbian couples.
Since I've been worried about getting/being pregnant I've been ""first"" since I've done the first test.
I'm not on birth control since I thought the risk of getting pregnant was so low that it wasn't worth the hassle. I'm very forgetful and would forget to take the pill everyday anyway.
I've had irregular/late periods since I started getting them, but ai have never been with a biologically male person before so I never really thought about it/counted how late I was before.

255,"When my fiancé and I first met, I distinctly remember thinking to myself that I could see myself falling in love with her, and ultimately I realized she was the love of my life. She’s smart, funny, beautiful, all of that. What’s more, my relationship with her from the beginning has been the best sexual experience I’ve ever had. Being someone who would either shy away from sexual interaction because of my own insecurity or become too attached too quickly if I did end up hooking up with someone, it has seemed like everything with her was so easy and perfect. I have not found a more perfect match for myself and would love to spend the rest of my life with her.

Something she’s always had trouble with is finding a birth control method that works for her. At this point, she’s tried about everything. They all either cause her pain or effect her mood in ways she can’t deal with. About a year and a half ago, she got an IUD implant, and it was a nightmare for her. About every two weeks, she’d get terrible pains that led her to suspect that she had endometriosis. I thought it too closely coincided with her new implant being inserted, so suggested she get it removed before getting any kind if surgery (the only real way to test for endometriosis from what I understand). We’d been having somewhat less sex than we usually would due to her discomfort, but other than that our physical intimacy had not changed. A couple months after she got the implant I suggested making the switch and that we just hold off on sex until then. 

At the beginning of this year, she had it removed and got a Nexplanon insert in her arm. Let me tell you, it was night and day from her life before. She immediately stopped getting her periodic pain and it was such a relief for both of us. We still were not having sex while her hormones balanced out or whatever, but that was the least of my concerns. I was just happy that she was happy again, that she could go to work regularly, and that we could avoid any kind of surgery.

However, since she got this implant it’s not only our sex life that’s stalled. She pretty much doesn’t enjoy any type of physical affection with me at all. I give her hugs and she stiffens up until I let go, she no longer cuddles with me at night (she first moved in with me when I had a twin sized bed so we were forced to sleep basically on top of each other for several months at least), and won’t even kiss me unless I explicitly ask her to. When she does, it’s always a little peck that has no emotion behind it and leaves me feeling like I’ve extorted her somehow.

After about 8 months of this being the dynamic of our relationship, it left me feeling very unfulfilled and unwanted. We had a pretty bad fight about it where I stated my case and tried expressing my feelings, she finally revealed that since the new implant she just has no sex drive whatsoever. She claims this is a side effect of nexplanon for some women (although I haven’t found that to be exactly the case from my own research, but who am I to say), and her best friend actually went through a break up because of a similar issue. She then got every emotional saying that she didn’t want me to leave her, I said that wouldn’t stop me from loving her and staying with her. She was very adamant that it was not me at all, that it was just her hormones, and I believed her.

We made a plan for her to see a doctor to discuss an alternative birth control method, I’d even offered that she just get it removed and I get a vasectomy. Due to a falling out with her parents whose insurance she’s on, we had to wait until she could enroll in benefits at her work. She actually missed the enrollment period  because of her forgetfulness (which I was a little upset with), but realized she still had her insurance card from her parents’ plan and so did not have to talk to them for the information to get an appointment with the doctor. 

At this point, we haven’t had proper sex in over a year (she insisted on having sex with me about twice, but it was pretty much only for my benefit because she felt bad, but it left me feeling really empty about it) or any other kind of loving, fulfilling physical interaction. Last night, I asked when she might make an appointment since she found her insurance card, she said she thinks she wants to keep the nexplanon because it’s the first birth control she’s had that didn’t cause her pain. I can understand that, but pointed out that meant we’d have no sex life for the foreseeable future and if she was really ok with that. She shut down the conversation and said we’d talk about it later.

I’m not sure what to do here. I love her more than anything in my life, and know that I should be there for her in her struggle. However, I cannot ignore the fact that literally need SOME physical expression of love or else I’m going to become seriously depressed. Now that I’m really considering the possibility of us not being physically intimate for the foreseeable future, I’m starting to wonder if I can actually do it for much longer. On one hand I’m so relieved that my true love isn’t in pain any longer, but I still feel like I have needs that must be met for my own physical and emotional fulfillment. She’s suggested having a polyamorous relationship in the past that I wasn’t wholly receptive to. In light of the circumstances, I’d brought it back up again some time ago but she said she didn’t want to have that kind of relationship if she wasn’t participating. That’s fair I suppose, but still kind of feels unfair if she has no plans on changing the variable that’s killing her desire. Where does that leave me?

I’m not sure what advice can be given, but has anyone else has a similar experience? How did you deal with it, how did you talk about it, etc. ",01Dec2018,1
256,"We are thinking of designing a mobile application, in which the main purpose is to digitally live show newly released movies at home, without going to the cinema.

Obviously we would need contracts and legal jurisdictions in place to allow movie companies to live stream their films on our platform, technicalities aside 


How would you, feel towards to a service that allows you to watch newly released films without going to the cinema on the date of release or a few days after.

For this to work, we would employ a system , that checks the users background processes, to ensure that only the app is running and apps critical to the Android framework.

If the user attempts to exit the app, and open any third party apps, the mobile application will notify the user to close the foreign app, if the user does this 3 times, he/she is locked out of the viewing the movie and is not refunded 

Note, that in order for this to work, like a cinema each film has multiple appropriate viewing times.

Case in point if Marvel Studios wishes to make Avengers 4 avaliable at midnight AEST , users can only view the film at that time.

Finally, after the movie is finished all users are locked out until the next period , in which they must pay once again to view the film

Obviously films, cannot be paused or rewinded.

Now the question is piracy, we hypothesize that releasing it countries with low piracy rates would be a good idea, this leaves countries like Russia,China,India out of the equation and ensure financial integrity for all stakeholders.

1. Very bad procrastination and school ethic: I have absolutely no motivation for school or when I get  home from school. I can have 2 weeks to write an essay and no matter what, I WILL write it 3am on the n ight before.I  tried changing my time management schedule many  times and downloading Time Block  apps but  none of those work. I also do play a lot  of video games like CS:GO, but not as much concerning to time.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Just a horrible person overall and immature: In any situation with my  friends, I will usually say something random that has to do with something VERY offensive. Anything from homophobic, islamicphobic, etc etc jokes I will make just  to get  a quick laugh out of  my friends. Everyday I go to school saying to myself ""Just  do not talk and you will be fine"" but  I always break under the urge of making a joke. K I L L    M E.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Video Games: I want  to somehow quit videogames. I know it is not really  reasonable at  all if this is how I want to deal with me wasting my time, and a little bit  of games is not too  bad. I just would like to lose interest in playing CS:GO and games. IDK, I don't even enjoy myself playing the game, it's just a pastime. My other hobbies are listening to music and programming oof.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a young student in IT and lucky to be able to have a job that is related to my education at this age. I work for a company that sends out students to people's homes who need tech support. I mostly get to help elderly people with printer problems and such. I must add that I sometimes make appointments with customers outside of the company to make a bit of extra money.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Last summer I got sent to a near 90 year old lady. Her problem was her awefully slow computer and wanted to do a cleanup. So for cleanups I have a checklist where I run CCleaner, uninstall programs, do virus scans and such. Now, before I start this whole process I warn the customer that this may or may not help depending on the PC, which I did and she understood so I did my thing. When I was done there wasn't much difference in speed so I apologze and advice her a SSD.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Well she was interested in the SSD but was a bit hesitant so she made me do a Skype call with a younger friend of hers to make sure I'm not scamming an old lady out of her money I guess. During which, I get asked how much it will cost. The company I work for doesn't allow us to tinker on hardware so I offered to do it outside of the company. I made a deal with her that she pays for the SSD, and for my services she can pay me whatever she deems it worth, if she decides not to pay me thats fine with me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I recommended her a cheap simple SSD for €50 euro. Installing this thing took way longer than expected. Over the course of IIRC 3 weeks I worked approx 10 hours on it. This was because of different factors such as: I had an appointment short after, the lady had a bunch of other questions so she basically got free tech support out of me and because the computer was so awefully slow. And with slow, I really mean it, this is by far the slowest computer I've laid my hands on, and I've had a fair share of customers.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm finally finished and she did decide to pay me which I really appreciate even though I ended up working for €5 per hour which is a huge discount for her. Only thing she wasn't satisfied with is her email client. She's using Thunderbird but her younger friend insisted I repair her illegal version of Outlook 2010 which didnt work anymore. I have to admit I made use of the lady's forgetfulness to get away because I wasn't getting paid and wasted a lot of my free time on her.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward 6 months later to 2 days ago, I get a phone call from her for the first time since then and she needed help again with her email. I went to her house and it wasn't anything hard. She was logged out of her email account on Thunderbird so I just logged her in again and helped with a few other stuff that I resolved. Only one thing was left, apparantly her younger friend told her to get Outlook again. I sighed and explained to the lady that I would replace the broken version of Outlook 2010 with a new torrented one, which she didnt really understand so she called her friend on Skype and I explained to her what I was going to do, which her friend said it was fine to the lady.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

OK. GOOD. I do my thing, get a torrent, try to get it over with so I can finally leave because I had to be at another customer in an hour. Upon installing I was greeted with an error message. I basically had to uninstall the illegal Office pack and replace it with my version. I tried, but it just wouldnt uninstall. Tried rebooting the PC but the uninstall wizard still wouldn't show up.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I explained this to her and she was fine with it. 2 hours later and I'm getting late for my next appointment she decides she needs a bit more help. I do that real quick and get to payment. She has this sweet old lady vibe that made me feel bad I couldnt get Outlook fixed so I gave her a discount again and only asked for 1 hour pay.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Later in the evening I recieve a text from her friend saying that nothing on her pc works and that internet doesnt work and I need to contact her. So I did and the old lady explained to me its the computer freezing continuously and she said that I need to come in tomorrow to fix it and that she ""paid me to fix it earlier today"" while we didnt even discuss that earlier. I explain to her that I cant do much at this point and I really dont feel like going to her house again just to run CCleaner so I spend the next 2 hours on the phone with her trying to guide her through CCleaner. 2 hours later all is good and the pc freezes a little less now. And ofcourse, old lady tells me her friend finds it odd and unbelievable that I cant install Outlook for her and asks if I have something to say.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Next day today, just before I started writing this, I got a phone call from the younger lady which I didnt pick up. This is the reason why I started writing this too because I'm at an end and dont know what to do. I really feel like lashing out especially after this text that she literally just sent as I'm typing this. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Hello, I would like you to put the pc of Ms. Old Lady back into the previous state because now it doesnt even work anymore !!!!!!! ?? If you cant do this then I would like someone who can!!! You cant possibly leave it behind like this! You even accept money that you dont deserve!!! Sorry but this is not right! Make sure her pc works again!

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly I'm boiling right now. She's acting as if I broke her computer while it ALWAYS has been like this. I even warned them that the SSD may or may not help which they agreed to.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So far I've given her free help and huge discounts and honestly fucking regret taking her in the first place. I'm afraid she will notify the company I work at that this happened which is bad because its against company policy to make appointments without them.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post. I really need advice on what to do in order not to lose my job. I will respond to her later this day, in the meantime I will wait for comments. I'm super frustrated about this going on while its out of my power. I cant fix this and nobody probably can without buying her a brand new computer.",01Dec2018,1

273,"So bit about myself. I'm 24 yrs old male from NYC and graduated with an associates degree in Business Administration in Dec of 2017. Unfortunately due to personal circumstances financially wise I cannot pursue my bachelors for now, maybe down the line. I thought that I'd be able to land a basic entry level office job in any industry, as an administrative assistant/clerical for public, government, private entities. The reality hit me hard when it's been about 13 months and about 7 interviews but no call back. I did one internship for a small accounting office which was mandated by all business majors but that internship was just an internship for experience for basic accounts receivable and accounts payable no job opportunity. I did 2 temp jobs which were basic receptionist duties and simple data entry into word-excel.  

My main interest is working somewhere in human resources/Administrative Assistant or in a hospital as like one of those receptionists who checks you in and you do simple paperwork and filing in which I eventually move up the ladder. What I find really aggravating is the fact that all the jobs I applied for here  in NYC around the Manhattan/Yonkers/White Plains/Queens/Brooklyn area ask for like 5+ yrs of experience and the need of Spanish speaking people. Most jobs that even have median pay that are willing to train in private offices like dental/medical office require Spanish speaking. I applied to hospital administrative jobs but I assume that's usually for medical majors.

What gets me even more down on a daily basis most of my friends and fellow classmates from the same graduating class got great jobs through the influence of their family members(/relatives/friends but my parents have immensely tried to try to get me a job through their customers and no luck. I'm a pretty smart guy, I know for many of you out there may not mean a lot as you're all 10x smarter than me but I graduated with honors with a 3.9 GPA from a community college. My father insists I do some sort of certified course work in the IT-Field, but that's not my interest at all like even though I breezed through my computer info systems and management info systems class with an A+, that's not my forte at all, I can feel it. 

What I am considering is moving somewhere else where there maybe job opportunities available even with the most basic-tier level because NYC has nothing to offer to me and I'm just outta luck. Currently I work at my fathers Dunkin Donuts store while still hunting for a ""better"" job. He insists I get out of the house and go look to find my way in life but I'm very skeptical about it and I don't know much outside of NYC. Since I am of the Islamic Faith, I have to worry about food as the main reason, it's not like the old days where you'd travel and meet someone along the way that'll help you out in the long run. I have no connections anywhere outside of NYC and all my connections here have tried their dam best even my closest friends. So people of the reddit, I'd appreciate any advice on how to look for a job, who to talk to in a different country, particular area on finding a place, job, because I can't just go in blindly and be left out in the streets. Most places I'm considering is **Canada**, (don't how the job market is there with my credentials), and the **U.K** (also don't know how the job market is there with my credentials).

Any advice would be appreciated.",01Dec2018,1
274,"I know her for quite a while, 6 years I think, we met up once last year. Although we're frequently not in touch, sometimes (did text a lot for 2 years or so, no flirting) we talk over text or voice. I'm just nervous because I think she's way out of my league according to myself because she's so gorgeous and pretty and witty, but my friends keep telling me that no girl is out of my league, which I have a hard time buying. It's not like I haven't dated or never had the attention of girls, it's just that none of those were as important as this one to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why am I afraid that she'll gently let me down? because a couple of months back I did want to meet up with her but she said she wasn't feeling well, and I didn't follow up because I thought that was a subtle no. After that she wanted some information about something a month later, I gave it to her and then she was venting and all about the mess she's in (it was pretty silly, even she knows that, I think) and I wasn't in the best of moods because I was under a lot of stress, so I made a snarky (read: sarcastic) comment and she didn't reply.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been thinking about this for a while and I really want to have a shot, but I also don't want to lose her friendship. 

&amp;#x200B;

N.B.: When Apple's Siri was relatively new back in 2013 or some time like that, I asked her to ask Siri ""if she wants to go out on a date with me "" over text and she mistakenly replied ""yeah sure"". and I corrected her saying, ""ask that to Siri dummy"".

275,"Hi all, 

I don't know where to start. All I know is that I fucking hate my job and I'm miserable. I work at a call center through a temp agency. After 4.5 months, it's direct hire. 

I know I won't make it until then. I recently found out that they want me to work Christmas and New Years, but because of the way my contract is written, I won't be able to receive time and a half pay (while everybody else who is direct hire will be). 

I cry on my way to work every day. I'm constantly calling off with bullshit excuses because I can't bear to go in. But I can't quit because I need the money. I literally cannot go a week without money. And I can't make any lower than I make right now or I won't be able to pay my bills either. 

I'm writing this at work right now, shirking my responsibilities because there's no manager here. I know other people have it worse than me and I should be grateful to have a job at least, but I can't stand it. I'm bitter and angry and miserable and it's starting to rub off everywhere else in my life. I can barely clean my apartment after work because when I get home, I'm so emotionally drained. 

All my friends do is listen to me bitch about how I hate my job. And I'm afraid I won't be able to find another job before Christmas and I will have to work the holidays. And I know that sounds entitled, but the holidays and family are very important to me. It's the only time I don't feel so lonely. 

Not only that, but I hate the schedule. I work Saturday through Wednesday and on Tuesday, I work 12-9 (not including drive time to and from), which is when both holidays fall on. 

Guys, what do I do? How do I get out of this. My life is falling apart and I feel utterly powerless to stop it. I feel like I'm a slave to my job and that no matter what I do, I'm screwed because I either stick with something I absolutely hate, or quit and suffer the consequences of having absolutely no money and no savings. My sanity is spiraling down the drain. Help please.  :(",01Dec2018,1

My mother is medically unable to work(and also a very dedicated smoker, which throws a lot of money down the drain). My dad's salary is medium.

Because of the financial situation my parents are in, we've always lived with my grandparents. My grandpa recently passed away, and grandma says can't afford upkeep for a large house). She proposed we sell it and rent 2 different apartaments.

I don't want this, since I think it would be a huge admitance of defeat-grandma and grandpa bought the house of their own efforts and it seems extremely stupid to give up on that just because of my mother's illness and addiction. I am legally entitled to one third of the house, so nobody can sell it without my consent. Grandpa left some land and a rural house that we could sell. We also have a flat that we give for rent that we could also sell-though it means giving up on the monthly income the rent brought us. We only have to make this work for around 3 years, after that I'll start working on basically the combined income of everyone in the household.

I'm a guy from Europe who never been to the USA .

I'm going to turn 16 this winter and I want a tat. (It's legal to get one under 18 where i live). My parents said that they support me and what i want to do with my body. They trust me so they'd let me do it.

My stepsister lives in New York. I  havent seen her for more than 10 years.It  looks like I can visit her this summer with my dad. It'd be by far the most exotic vacation I can ever imagine.

My goal with the tattoo would be to keep those memorable experiences on my body forever. To Always be happy and cheerful whenever I look at that piece of art on my arm.

&amp;#x200B;

**Details:**

* It would be on my left forearm
* Black&amp;Grey-Biomechanical style
* Map representing NY
* Date of the journey
* Marker(pin,pinhead)  at visited places
* Memorable Experiences

I found out about this when I was around 14, turning 15 when i realized i was only attracted to girls that are many grades below me or not even in school yet...

Over the time when i entered puberty I could feel how my urges were getting stronger and I started to hate myself because I grew up hearing nothing but hatred about pedophiles from everywhere, this resulted in me starting to fall into a depression in which I'm still ""stuck"". I started to cut myself and went to a psychiatry for several months and got released again without carrying any benefit from it.

I never really consumed cp but I used to look at nudist-pictures which kind of aroused me but also made my urges to experience the actual act even stronger and I decided to stop. I'm seeing a therapist once a month but that doesnt help me either because i just cant open up about this. There's no way I could keep it a secret from my parents because I know simply talking wont change anything\~ I'd need some other kind of treatment and since im not 18 yet my parents would have to give an OK for me to be able to do these things.

Everytime I think I finally found a way to live with it I get into a situation in which all my senses are turned on again and I cant help myself but look when a little girl in hotpants or shorts walks past me. Im not a creep or pervert but supressing your sexuality and sexual desires for several years just makes you desperate for love and affection. I know this might only cause me to get hated more but I'm thinking about getting a job in a Kindergarten or such. Not to molest any children but to finally feel close to them and just not be alone anymore. My psychologist suspects me to have a borderline personality disorder because of how reliant I am on feeling loved and how fast I can get attached to people and not being able to let go. I know this might not justify my decision to still be around children and spend time with them but to me its just different, I have no other way to put it but as that I just want to be happy for once and be able to enjoy my life.

I think about killing myself every day because everything just keeps building and I'm not sure for how long I can keep going. I wake up with no purpose in my life and everything I want is unreachable and I see time pass, day for day, no change.

&amp;#x200B;

I need ethical advice on supporting myself economically.

I recently signed my contract for the military with a job that has a very long wait time to ship out. I'm not going to disclose any dates or locations of where I ship out or which branch, but it will be sometime late next year. I'm very excited to go and wish the wait wasn't there, however it is and it's the earliest I can ship out(I've bugged my recruiters several times on finding earlier dates). 

&amp;#x200B;

Because of paperwork and multiple physicals I had to leave my full-time job since I had already called out work for 2 1/2 weeks and needed more time. I had been with that company for 11 months. Although I received a 4.9/5.0 for my eval prior to leaving, they won't take me back because they wan't someone to be there long term and progress as a manager.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a part-time job offering 15 hours a week but it's not enough, I had been with this company for 2 1/2 years. I asked for more and they continuously look for shifts in the entire area I'm in. Maybe I'd get an additional 5-10 hrs a week if I'm lucky.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I apply for full-time jobs to support myself knowing that I'm leaving in a little less than a year in order to support myself economically? If yes, what should I say for leaving my past full-time position?

TLDR; signed contract for the military. Wait time to ship out is close to a year. should I get a full-time job or is it unethical knowing that I'm leaving in less than a year?

304,"Hi, I’m new to Reddit and was looking for advice on how to get more from my life.
 
Without going into detail, I had a very difficult time growing up with abuse, homelessness etc. Despite this I worked very hard through school as I was taught that education was the best way to better yourself/earn a good wage. 

I worked hard at my A levels and got into a Russell Group University, finally getting a 2.1 in Psychology. 

Since then, my progress has halted. I work full time but in an unskilled job without any progression opportunities. 
I’ve applied for many better jobs and graduate schemes but have been unsuccessful every time. 

The main pitfall I’m coming across is that every decent job I come across needs extra qualifications which you can’t get funding for or 1-2 years experience in the role, even for entry level positions. 

I don’t have a family which can support me, therefore I can’t afford to intern for free, or pay for extra qualifications.

Should I give up and accept that graduate jobs are made for those with privileged backgrounds, or is there something more I could do that I’m missing?  ",01Dec2018,1
305,"Hello! 

I always try to help people, be nice to people. If anyone is in trouble i try to help them. 

But people take advantage of me and sometimes they make fun of me. It hurts and i don't want/don't know how to be mean to them. 

Sometimes i hate that i am like that, i feel so different from the rest of the world. In social situations i can barley handle myself, i can't speak to a large group of people if we are at a dinner table, i always have to think what i say and sometimes i don't find my words, i feel that they don't care what i have to say, or if i say something they will make fun of me. I feel a bit shy sometimes.

I don't know what to do and i'm a 31 year old man. ",01Dec2018,1
306,"Hi, I need some advice on my current relationship as I feel it is falling apart.

I met my gf 6 months ago. I’m 23 and she’s 25. Her office is close to mine so that’s how we met, at first all was great, few months ago we started fighting a lot over trivial things, then we sat down and had a good convo cuz we are 2 very different people,  but when it comes to relationship we agree on many. Anyways, after the convo everything started going to a good place. But now, we started fighting again, over stupid things, I can’t blame her much because the way she was raised and her current home situation is very very very bad, to the point of her father saying he rather see her dead and things like that. I’ve been working my ass off to be able to afford moving in together to take her away from that fucked up home and I already have a place for us, just need enough to put things inside and general living. I understand she’s always stressed and everything and I try to be there for her, but she’s so cold with me, and rarely show a bit of love even tho I try every day do say nice things, bring little presents and everything, and even help her pay her bills as her business isn’t going very well, but lately I’ve been wondering if we’re right for each other. I’m crazy about her, and she says she also is, and is excited about us moving in together, but I feel her so far away from me and cold that it just makes me wanna give up on these plans. Talking is off the table as I tried it again, and she just came down on my with such aggression I felt guilty for even trying. Idk what else to do. Any advice is very welcome. ",01Dec2018,1
308,"So I live in the middle of the city and my mailbox is tiny. Lately I’ve been getting these super random magazines. Like fashion and kids health. They’re huge, some are wrapped in plastic so they don’t even fit in my mail slot, so they spill out. I have no idea why I’m receiving these, I def. don’t pay for them. Some are really fancy.

I used to mail (return to sender) or fax these back to the publications with “Remove” on it and it used to work. The fax especially worked great bc it would waste their whole ink cartridge. But lately this hasn’t been working. 

I’m sure if I call or email, they *might* remove me from one marketing list and put me on like 5 others.

311,"Long story, so I apologize in advance. 

My 11-year-old daughter has always been . . . well, kind of mean. We moved out of our home state when she was just about to turn 10. Ever since my daughter realized she had a mind of her own and could make choices, she's just flat out never liked me. Btw, her actual father has been absent since she was 2 weeks old. He has a major history of mental illness and suicide in his family (I was young and gullible when I met him).  She always preferred to be with my parents or her aunt. A main motivator for our move was to separate her from her aunt. Her aunt is one of the most toxic people I know. She is constantly drunk, ignores the crap out of her own kids until she just yells at them, cusses up a storm, and is mean to everyone. In fact, a couple months before we moved, her aunt kicked a huge dent in my car door because I wouldn't put her kids, who had active, untreated ringworm, in my car with my kids. She favors her aunt personality-wise and I thought it best to separate them, hoping she was still salvageable. So, fast-forward to this past year since December of last year. My daughter has had a multitude of suicide threats more so than actual attempts. Prior to this, although she's been obstinate and unkind, no real issues since our move. I took her to a crisis stabilization unit for evaluation in early January of this year. They recommended her for out-patient therapy. I took her. She sat and refused to engage. We finally gave up cause it was keeping her and her brother out of school and the only one we could see was half an hour away in good traffic. She has some other issues through out the year; we discuss them and overcome them at home. It seemed promising. 

&amp;#x200B;

Jump to November 8th of this year. I get a message from another parent who's child showed them my daughter's snapchat story. They send me the image of her long suicide note where she's upset due to breaking up with a boy (for the reference, I've repeatedly asked her not to date cause I think it's too young, and we've debated about snapchat endlessly). I talk to her about it as soon as she comes home from school and she says she feels she needs treatment in order to not hurt herself. To the crisis stabilization unit we go. They decided to keep her there and transport her to an inpatient behavioral health facility for acute inpatient care. 

I'll also mention here as well that I have a Masters in Psych and am almost done with my PhD in General Psych. I am currently writing my dissertation (on happiness, which seems like a HA at this moment). I'm a Masters Certified Addictions Professional and a licensed Bio-Psycho-Social Assessor. I worked in a dual diagnosis, mental health and substance abuse, clinic for the last 4 years before we moved. So, I am incredibly familiar with mental health and can appreciate almost any diagnosis from any perspective. I also am a total nerd for positive psychology and spend all my spare time listening to and reading books by Brene Brown, Dacher Keltner, and Barbara Frederickson, and professional positive psychologists like them. I am all about peaceful, harmonious living, as is her step-father. We collect crystals, burn incense, and run an oil diffuser all day - the point is, we're real peace-loving hippies, both raised by old school peace-loving hippies. 

So they send her to an inpatient clinic 3 hours away. She goes in there for suicidal ideation over a boy. She had a friend who had been in a similar facility for three weeks and loved it, so she went in determined to stay for 3 weeks. I take her clothes the 3rd day she is in there, and she asks me about keeping snapchat on her phone, I told her we'll talk about it when she gets home, so she yells that she hates me (after driving a 6 hour round trip to bring her clothes) and to not contact her while she's in there and that she wants to go into foster care. Now my 11 year old has her own phone, her own room with a Roku and 32 inch tv, all the clothes she could want, and has fairly lenient rules. Her and her step-father butt heads because she  loves to argue and is determined to have the last word, whereas I'll just say ""we're not doing this"", and walk away, he'll stand his ground. So, today is her 22nd day in an acute inpatient setting where the normal stay is 7 - 10 days. She managed to get a very lack-luster care coordinator/case worker for the first two weeks of her stay who did so much of nothing that she got fired last week. My daughter then slipped by on no one's case unnoticed for 9, yes count them 9, freaking days. Don't worry, I've reported this facility to all their accreditation agencies. She called me 2 weeks ago and for the first time, nonchalantly said that she told her care coordinator that her step-father hits her. I know this to be extremely untrue, so didn't engage and moved on. She yelled at me about snapchat again and hung up on me. I speak to her again last Friday, when she again, nonchalantly slips in that she told her care coordinator her step-father kicks her. I choose not to engage because I'd rather discuss this over a family therapy session (which I have set up for her after-care) with a mediator in place, due to her propensity to argue and incite issues. Turns out, as I suspected, that she never actually told anyone until yesterday. The clinical director, who I have gone circles with due to her facilities negligence, called me to tell me that she went to talk to my daughter because she continues to refuse to go home and people are just ok with it and it doesn't make sense as to why ""no one can get this kid to go home"". She said that my daughter reported abuse in the home by her step-dad, which her I (her mom) know about and am not doing anything. She even said she doesn't believe it, and generally isn't supposed to but didn't want me to be surprised because she believes they are false claims. 

Child services are welcome in my home. I also have a 7 year old and a 12 week old baby. There is nothing to find. They can talk to teachers, care providers, whomever; there is nothing to unearth. I'm not looking for advice on that. I'm also not looking for advice on her mental health because that's a whole different situation. Here's what I need help figuring out:

When a child that you have loved dearly since before day one, given everything they NEED (I'm an advocate of LESS material items and more experiences), and tried so hard to happily coexist with when it's been years since they've mumbled back an ""I love you"" or reciprocated a hug, turns on you, what do you, as a parent, do? I'll always love her. But right now, I don't like her much. And we have to go back to some kind of normal after this. But how? Any advice? I can give more details if needed. Believe it or not this is a vague summary. ",01Dec2018,1
312,"She was depressed, almost an alcoholic when we began dating. She is schizophrenic, has borderline syndrome, social anxiety and depressions. Before we started dating I saved her 2 times from commiting suicide. I always helped her with her problems, listened to her, helped her to make her life better.

2 months ago she said she loves me so much for saving her life and for making it worth living. It took us 2 years to reach this point, but she was finally happy.

1 month ago she wanted a break, because she feels like she is the only thing in my life that makes me happy, and she feels like she is in a jail, because she feels like I depend on her. That I felt the same for all of our relationship, because I was the only thing that made her happy for multiple years didn't matter.

The break will be over in 5 days and I'm sure that she will break up. I know that I will find a new partner, potentially somebody that's a better human being than her. I know that the relationship wasn't for nothing. I grew as a person.

But one thing kills me right now. I know that she will fuck up her life again. And I know that I won't be able to help her again, because I know that she will leave me as soon as her life gets better again. My pride is not allowing me to get used like this again.

I know that I won't be able to be there for her, when she tries to commit suicide for the third time and this kills me, because I love her. I don't know what to do. Should I offer her to visit me if she feels bad ? Any advice ?",01Dec2018,1

321,"TL;DR schizophrenic friend is having their delusional thoughts encouraged by someone, and I don’t know how to get them to stop doing this. 

I have known this friend for 5 years and we are fairly close. She has schizophrenia, but is very stable on medication. Her only positive symptom that still persists is a long held delusional idea. 

She is fairly open about talking about the disease, but is uncomfortable asking for help beyond really basic things. She used to talk to me about issues she was having. The problems we would discuss were mostly delusional things that I entertained before I knew better.

I had assumed that she stopped talking about them because she no longer had delusional thoughts, but I learned that she does still get those kinds of thoughts and just talks about them with other people. She talks a lot with an acquaintance that I have and I presume that they are pretty good friends. I kind of felt slightly jealous and inquired about their relationship and that’s when I learned that he talks with her a lot about a specific delusion. 

I don’t know if I am just biased against him, but in my opinion he is actively contributing to her delusional ideas in an attempt to “comfort her”. I don’t know if he knows that she is schizophrenic and I don’t know how to ask without revealing that information.  

I’ve tried telling him that what he is doing is more harmful than helpful but he declined to believe me and just accused me of being jealous that she is better friends with him. Again I can’t really give any information to back up what I am saying without revealing personal information that is not appropriate for me to reveal for my friend.

Trying to convince my friend to stop taking to him feels shady especially considering that I am slightly jealous. I don’t really know how to tell her what I think he is doing either because I would lose a lot (all?) of her trust if she interprets my accusation in the context of the delusion.",01Dec2018,1
322,"Background: I have PTSD especially related to romance and dating due to an insane incident from when I was a teenager. I've only dated once more since then (a little over a year ago now), and that sucked too, though it was slightly less bad.

Other Background: I used to not get very much sexual or romantic attention from other people. In fact, most of my friends would talk about me like I was similar to Meg from Family Guy, the whole joking about how gross I am thing. I'd maybe get one or two people interested in me a year, and I'd freak out because of the PTSD, but they'd go away and it was always isolated incidents. Some people would think they were interested in me initially but then when they got to know me they'd be turned off and leave me alone (I probably came off as childlike to them). For the most part, I could assume that no one was romantically interested in me and I could feel comfortable pursuing friendships with them.

Lately, things have been different. I don't know what the hell happened (I'm still not conventionally attractive) and I've spent so much time trying to analyze the circumstances surrounding WHY, but I've realized it's counterproductive and it's just freaking me out more. But basically, I used to be seen as gross and now I'm...not. I went from being Meg from Family Guy and having 1-2 people show interest in me per year to having seven people verbally state interest in me within four months of each other. Going from almost nothing to what I assume is a normal amount of interest feels like a massive increase and it's been a shock.

I'm BETTER at not getting all PTSD'd up when people show interest in me, but it's still really hard and it's getting exhausting. I've noticed that I've started to isolate myself pretty severely, and it's been hurting me.

I should mention that I'm bisexual and nonbinary, so I can't just find people of the same sex to hang out with and assume that romance won't be a problem! I'm actually on hormones and present pretty androgynously to the point where strangers usually can't tell what my birth sex is and I never know whether people think I'm male or female or something else until they say something. I thought being on hormones would mean that only bisexual people would find me attractive, but I've gotten interest from straight people AND gay people, so I really have no way of knowing whether someone's going to 1) find me attractive or 2) think I'm trying to date them.

I want to talk to new people and make friends with them. And yes, sometimes I'm very attracted to those people--but they tend to show interest in me WAY before I'm ready for that interest (and often before I feel ready to tell them about the PTSD), and it freaks me out. It's actually MORE upsetting when I'm attracted to the people who show interest in me. I'm seeing a therapist and I'm working on getting to a point where I DON'T freak out about that stuff, but in the meantime I'm trying to figure out how I can push through this fear hanging over my head and keep interacting with people. I don't know exactly what kind of advice to ask for because I don't know where to start. Maybe some sort of mindset change? Or something I can do when interacting with other people? I have no idea. I just want to stop being isolated and distracted and connect with people again.",01Dec2018,1
323,"So just a disclaimer before people infer things that aren't true:

- not an incel
- not socially inept
- not a neckbeard/unwashed creep/nerd/whatever else
- not just trying to get laid
- 25yo

So... I've been extremely unlucky with women for years now. If I get a date, it doesn't go past the first one even if it went great in 9/10 cases (I usually get ghosted). If it does go beyond that, I inevitably get rejected due to them ""seeing someone else"" that they like more than me. If that doesn't happen, well, they ""don't want a relationship right now"" (the ""...with you"" is inferred, as these girls usually end up ditching me for someone else down the road).

I'm at a loss and I really feel like it's hopeless for me. I'm put together, tall, in shape (work out four times a week), rather good-looking from what I hear (although who really knows), and I think at least *somewhat* funny, interesting and pleasant to be around. That's not me trying to brag, I just feel like at least some girl out there should be willing to date me.

What would you tell a guy like me? It seems I've tried every avenue available for dating, I've gone out of my way to put myself out there for years even though it hasn't seen any results in literally hundreds upon hundreds of attempts.

1) I don't like my Dad very much. We have nothing in common and we have different personalities.

2) We have a history of not getting along.

My Dad and my brother are much closer. When my brother still lived at home, he would always go out with my Dad. My Dad and I just don't have that relationship. I think my Dad is disgruntled by that.

Don't get me wrong, I spend time with him sometimes, but I like to go out alone or with my friends. I don't want to be hanging out with my Dad all the time at 23.

At home, he will barge in my room without knocking and constantly try to spark a conversation when I'm not in the mood and I just want to be left alone.

____________________________________________________________________________

Unlike most people who would ask this I'm asking for homeschooling for myself. I'm a teenager in the middle of high school. I move around a lot due to job opportunities that my parents always get.

My issue is recently, my parents decided to move me back to Malaysia, where I'm from. Public school isn't great here, and since my parents can afford it we decided to go to a private school. It uses the IGCSE British system, even though I previously attended a private American school from 7th to 9th grade and would've taken IB in 11-12th. 

My problem is everything about the school. I'm don't want to be dramatic but people fail classes and move on anyway, teachers are often late or absent, extracurriculars I loved like music programs and Model UN aren't available due to a lack of funding, the school in general is heavily religious, and because of how far away it is and how their schedule works I'm not at home from 7 am to 6 pm. Despite it being a private school, everything about it is exactly how public school is with the exception of the crazy scheduling. I'm sure I sound ungrateful but my parents have excused this school for everything I can't accept purely based on its religiousness.

I haven't made any friends here, I'm behind on the system I never learnt in and I'm miserable. I've learned a lot about how to study using online resources from my older schools and it's simply not an option here. If I can't get access to teachers, or online resources I have at home, participate in extracurriculars, or make friends, what's the point of the school experience? I've stressed this to my parents over and over, but they care that it's religious and refuse to send me to a school that wouldn't be exactly the same. I've always told myself no matter what happens I can at least excel in academics, but because of the amount of time I spend at school doing nothing (due to absent teachers and banned electronics) I can't bring myself to study at home when I have so little time there. I haven't forgotten about books, but books are expensive and the school library is far too limited. I find that I work more efficiently on a laptop anyway. 

I know learning on my own or with my parents will never be enough, which is why if you guys think this is a good idea, how would I do this? Get a full time tutor? Virtual school? Who can check on my learning, and how much would it cost? How can I force myself to work the way a school would while staying at home? How big of a role would my parents have to play? I haven't made a proposal to my parents yet but I need a plan, and I have no idea where to look. 

Feel free to tell me if I'm an ungrateful brat and it's a horrible idea and why.

This really upset her as she wasn’t getting the same time and attention as before but I explained to her that this was necessary as it would help me and her in the future. She still loved me even though it hurt her and it came to a point where she started trying to argue, call, blow up my phone during school. I would either ignore it, block her, or reply with very simple answers. And when we would make up, I explained that hey look it’s okay. I love you and I’m busy, I don’t forget about you and miss you each day that I don’t get to come see you. I’m loaded with school and work 6 days a week. I spent 2300$ getting her back into school and trying to help support her in building something that will help her make her life productive instead of her crying all day about me and how I am not the same as before. Fast forward to later on and she’s in school, she picked up IT classes on the side at night, and is working. We would still fight because she thought I would leave her for someone else since I’m close to graduation, not giving her time or special attention, and she just wanted me to show her all of this. I however was under a lot of pressure trying to juggle so much that I did whatever I could to explain to her that we love each other very much and that it was going to be okay. Around this past month, she began breaking up with me. I’d try and chase. She would come back saying how much she loves me as I’m a guy who doesn’t hit on her or just value her for her body. I accepted it and said okay no problem let’s try again. It became a cycle. The two weeks that ensued I tried meeting up with her but our timing didn’t work out. If I was free. She wasn’t. When I heard two weeks ago she had no money for food, I went to her workplace with food my mom made for her. Three days later she had no money for gas, I went running to get her gas at midnight when I got out of work. The same week she broke up with me again. Told me she has too much stress and she can’t do this anymore with me. Fine. I went crazy and chased after her because she didn’t act like this ever before and I was so scared. I got desperate and needy. Met up with her and began crying my eyes out cause my heart couldn’t hold it in anymore. She straight up told me she lost feelings and doesn’t love me anymore, cares for me as a friend. I dropped her off to her car cause I was going to be very self destructive. I called her up two days later to apologize and say I’m sorry for taking her feelings for granted, went and gave her flowers at night on her car. She didn’t talk to me for two days. I hit her up later and she sent me a picture of my flowers on top of a garbage can saying that it’s over. She’s moved on. She doesn’t love me. She’s happy without me in her life. I lost it. I went to her house and called her 100x and went in front of her car not letting her drive by. Told her I needed to talk cause this is really hurting and if this is what she wants let’s get closure. She told me leave me alone, she doesn’t have feelings for me anymore, she was stupid and this relationship was a mistake, called her mom and her mom came took her home. Her mom was upset at me and told me look, give her few days she gets crazy like this often times and will calm down in a few days. If it’s written it will happen and that don’t be so hung up on her like this rn. I drove home holding my chest in pain crying my eyes out. My friend saw this and hit her up saying look he’s not okay and in his right mind, check up on him. She did HMU but only to say she doesn’t love me, doesn’t want to be with me, I need to leave her alone as she is happy without me after so many years. Told me please not to take that away from her. I told her I’m sorry at least she will be happy knowing I’m gone for good. She told me go home and I never responded and I was in a very bad state. Two days of no contact she blocked me on fb. She posted she’s single, big status of how I need to move on and shit where her family saw it all and liked it. 5 days have passed since and I’m not okay. Depressed anxious and panic attacks. I acknowledge my faults and neglect towards her. They were never signs of not loving her, I had too many things to juggle. I am so fucking hurt. I too at one point saw that our relationship was failing and began losing feelings, but I knew better than to kick her out. I was able to have faith in my love for her deep down and stay with her. But she was the opposite. Now she is happy without me, going to class, working, making friends, and I’m happy that she is because I always wanted to see her in a better place. The friends she’s made though aren’t the greatest as I know them too and she is the type of girl she can’t keep her shit to herself and probably told them and they brainwashed her. I am doing 5 days no contact but she has me blocked. Pretty sure she is moving on. I am here trying to work and go to school but every passing moment my mind wanders to her. I really do miss her and still have residual feelings for her. I started praying and it helps but also instills this hope in me that she will come back if I just give her space and time and my absence will cause her to start missing me. I am having such a hard time right now. I fluctuate between denial that if she does love me she will come back at some point because we had so much together and I always tried to support her and elevate her life. Or I just accept her words that she really did stop loving me and has chosen to move on. It’s eating me alive. Working out, praying, sleeping, nothing is helping much. 

I really feel lost without her. My mind knows better but my heart hasn’t fully given up. She believes her words and I’m stuck here thinking does she even think about me? Miss me? Check up on me? Or am I just fooling myself and wasting my time. This is hurting me too much. ",01Dec2018,1

Once the blond-haired one stopped me on my way out of a bakery and didn't let me exit until I bought him some rolls and a pizza. He often enters a grocery store, stands near the cash desk and begs people to buy him this and that for about half an hour, and then leaves with a bag full of food, drink and sweets. I once even saw a guy beat the shit out of him after he slapped his girlfriend's ass in the middle of the street.

I recently lost the keys to my lock on my shed. It's a big magnum lock with carbide metal.

In the past, I used to use those combination stainless steel ones, and if I forgot the combination it was relatively easy to use a hammer and break them.

But this one seems way bigger and tougher. Would a hammer get through it? If not, how do I get it off so I can replace it?

I don't have any tools on me besides a screwdriver and a hammer, so i'd prefer not to go get a drill or something heavy, but if it can't be done any other way i'll do it.

343,"During my first job at college, I met this girl who I initially was just friends with. We both got the job from being the same major. As I got to know her more I realized that I started to like her. We worked together for 2 years and ended up having a couple of classes together. We never really talked outside of work and class though I had her number. I remember that my friends used to make fun of me and would catch the way I looked at her saying “I wished someone looked at me like that”

I ended up leaving the job because I had too much on my plate. We lost touch for a couple of months. During this time we both started dating other people. I never really loved my girlfriend because I couldn’t forget about this girl. We eventually broke up because of this.

One day there were higher level job openings in my school as paid interns that worked with the college. We both applied and got jobs as interns. She became my coworker again. I was thrilled about it. Though she still had her boyfriend I was happy to see her again. We ended up having the same office hours on certain days it was just us. We started texting more, almost all day every day.

At the end of the first semester working together she broke up with her boyfriend. Which made me think that there was a chance. This is when things started to change though. She barely texted me back. Didn’t even text me all summer. 

This semester we started commuting together and made our hours around each other so we would have someone to make work bearable. My feelings for her got stronger. When she hugs me my heart feels so full. I think about her a lot and I can’t even like anyone else. She started calling me her work boyfriend and everyone in the office says we’d make a cute couple.

This was great until yet again things started to change. She randomly changes from texting me every day to texting me once a week. She started talking to me about other guys that are talking to her. She also randomly gives me a lot of attention and won’t leave my side. She tells me that she doesn’t feel a connection with the guys she’s talking to. Every time I ask her to go for a drink or hang out she either cancels last second or tells me she’s always busy. At times when we’re away for conferences or breaks she says she misses me. It’s a lot of mixed signals.

She graduates soon but because I took time off I will be around for another year. 

My feelings for her are strong. I can’t tell if she feels even remotely the same and its honestly killing me. What do I do? Do I tell her?

360,"Hi guys. Need some advice here. I’m a senior in college studying design and next semester, I have offers from two companies to intern there and already have a schedule of 4 intense design classes in college. Before I explain to you why I need advice let me tell you a little about the internships:

Internship A is at a VR startup that my professor chose me for since he is also involved with it. I’ve already accepted this internship because I was offered it awhile ago and didn’t think I would be accepted from internship B. The internship is 10 hrs/week with a stipend of $5000. The location of the internship is also very far from where I live and would take an hour and 15 mins to get to (on a good day). I’m not entirely sure what I’ll be doing at this startup (probably something design related they haven’t explained much). 

Internship B is at a big name company with their in-house design agency. I would be doing digital design stuff with UX design too (which I’m really interested in). They’re more structured with their internship so I would probably get a lot of cool projects and feedback on my work. It’s 2 days a week (16 hours) and only 25 mins away from where I live. 

I’m honestly more interested in working at Internship B because the work is more interesting to me and in my direct field. Internship A has the possibility to be really amazing and I might fall in love with VR and startup culture or it might be completely unorganized and not interesting to me. The only reason I’m not completely dubbing Internship B is because I’d be screwing over my professor because I already accepted the offer and he had to decline other students to take me. 

Currently, I’m trying to work out a way so I can do both and take my 4 classes as well. It’d be a very tight schedule but I think I can do it? Maybe?

Has anyone ever been in a situation like this? Is it kind of crazy to do 2 internships at once? What should I do? Thanks for anyone’s help in advance :) ",01Dec2018,1

Before that he had a hard time getting around anyway, but was able to make it work on the bus and walk his dog. He's back home after a week in the hospital, during which  I visited him and took care of his dog. 
We're not really close friends, been living together for 1 1/2 years, but he doesn't have any family or friends nearby to help him out financially. He's completely broke and has no where else to go. Luckily a lot of people from our work have stepped to help with the dog and meals, but he's suppose to be off his foot as much as possible for the next 12 weeks.

Here's are the main issues: Because he has to go up stairs to his room (and can't) he's living on the couch, for potentially 12 weeks or longer. He doesn't have money to help with bills (though he's payed to end of December). He can't walk his dog or clean up after himself much, leaving me as housekeeper and sometime dog walker. 
I've tried my best to be fair, empathetic and express no judgment or criticism (I sat with him in the ER before his surgery and have been running errands for him occasionally), but I find the idea of him living on my couch for months on end intolerable.
Our landlord is a nice guy and might give him a break on rent, but that may leave me stuck with bills (it's a house, so there are a bunch) and him stuck on the couch, which is unhealthy for the both of us. I see it highly likely that our current house isn't a viable living option for him, and if we're able to find a new place it's likely he may have to give up his dog.
He's overwhelmed, for sure, and I'm concerned about his mental health going forward.

What to do now? How can I help him get help through social services?

363,"Hey guys, 

This is kind of weird because I've never submitted but, I'm stuck in a career rut. [26, F]. I have an associate degree in hospitality management and a trade program under my belt with a sommelier certification. I've worked in restaurants, I hate it. I'm currently in Cali moving to WA this summer. I currently work front of house at a winery. 

I'm stuck. I don't think wine is my passion anymore. I want to be further in my career but I can't manage to land a role in management or anything above entry level and it's really lowering my self confidence. I don't know how to elevate myself and find my passion again with abandoning all of my hard work in college. 

What should I do? How did you guys manage to re ignite your passion or move further in your career? 

Thanks.

374,"After getting long time stomach pains, and missing school because no one could figure it out. I failed my sophomore year of high school, thus making me stay back a year. That’s not really my problem.

When starting this year I was forced into maturing really fast for my age. My sister quit her job, and my single mother of 4 became the only provider for the house. In order to help out I got a job and started working. It’s wasn’t a lot but it was something to help her out. 

After 3 weeks of working my new job, one of my coworkers decided that she didn’t care about the job anymore, and started calling out sick all the time. Long story short, I had to cover a lot of her shifts because she got fired. During this time I was getting constantly infuriated at school. I hated all of the teen drama, and the work was to easy, and I need a challenge or I get uninterested really fast. 

Because of those reasons I stopped going to school for about 2.5 weeks. I recently started going back, and it’s hasn’t been so hard. But I haven’t been in any classes with my friends/the people I grew up with. Starting soon my guidance counselor is making me go back to the classes and I don’t know what to do. I don’t wanna see everyone because they are going to just start questioning me, which will probably lead me down to leaving again.

375,"6 months ago, I got hired at a new job and I’ve done my best to be the hardest worker there. 3 months in and we get a new store manager, at first she was very nice and understanding but as soon as she got comfortable she completely switched.

She’s very unpredictable, she shows up angry, happy, sometimes says crazy left feild rude things.

2 months after she started working, and basicly 80% herself. She call me into the office, she then give me two written warnings for being 10 minutes late to clock in, I asked her when this happened and she tells me both happened about 2 months ago, And the next write up I will get fired.

I don’t argue and just sign, yesterday she calls me in again and give me a written warning again for being 10 minutes late, a month ago. The day I was running late I texted her 30 minutes before, then when I got to the store I asked her if it was alright and if there was anything I could do to make it up and she said not to worry about it, everything was fine.

Yesterday I sign the paper and she tells me she going to fire me if I get written up again... well today the stress of everything has gotten to me and I have a cold, I call a hour before my clock in, she doesn’t answer I text her, I’m feeling sick can I please take a sick day today?

She texts me back OK

I then text her, I just want to make sure this is alright, I’m sick and I just want to make sure I won’t get written up for this.

She texts back, if your feeling sick please take the day.

Everything was going well, she seemed a little nervous to fly but sort of makes it feel like she’s alright and ready. So time goes by, we get coffees, breakfast, everything to get ready for the flight ahead of us. 

We line up at the gate, and about 30 minutes before the boarding time she starts to get even more nervous, now becoming anxious at this point. I calm her down but about 15 minutes before the boarding time she tells me she can’t do it, that she won’t be able to do the flight. 

I try to convince her that everything will be fine and that it’s only a short flight (Canada to Jamaica) and that it’ll be fine. She still refused. 
So we called a ride out of the airport and we went home to sleep. 

NOW...
I still have a chance to catch the next flight tomorrow. The friend said they 100% will not be able to do the flight and that I could still go.

379,"To be clear he has not died yet. So as morbid as this may be, it has been haunting me for quite some time. 

My father has been in an out of my life for nearly 30 years. He got clean and sober and was a significant part of my life for 7 years before he relapsed again. During those 7 years he made a huge impact on me and was a wonderful man. I have many fond memories of him growing up for that reason. 

After he relapsed, there were short stints where he was sober, but it never lasted longer than a year. For 15 years, dealing with him came with constant drama and anxiety. He has threatened family members with death, lied constantly about anything and everything and just has been an overall nuisance to everyone around him. (As cold as it sounds, it’s how all our family feels-we love him of course, we’re just exhausted from the drama). 

As a result of his behaviour over the last 15 years, I have blocked him out of my life for the last 7 years. I have two children and don’t want them affected by his actions and behaviour. 

He has had a plethora of hospital visits, mostly from heart related issues, due to the drugs of course. He has recently had his 5th heart attack and he is having issues stemming from it, which may result in his death. 

It has recently become apparent that, although being his middle child, and having a sister and mother still alive, that I will be the one giving the eulogy at his funeral. Unfortunately, I have greatly mixed feelings about it. 

I am a great speech writer, and I do love him. However, I am not sure if I am the right person for the job (not that I think anyone else would want to), I just also don’t know what I would focus on. I feel like ignoring his behaviours and just focusing on the ‘great’ memories I have had of him, would be untruthful to who he was. I also think that focusing on his negative behaviours would be trashy. 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation or have any advice on whether I should recuse myself, or how I should handle the eulogy if not?

380,"This is a little long, but I feel like every detail is necessary. 

I work at a beverage company as a low level employee. I previous lived in China for 2 years also in the beverage industry and had a much higher role there due to foreign privilege. As a result, I have a lot of connections and am therefore somewhat capable at my job even though I am pretty young. As to why I am not in China anymore, I had to come back to the US because of visa issues. In the meantime I took a job as a lower level employee to buy time while I figure out my next step. 

Now that I have that explained, I often receive messages on LinkedIn because of my prior experience and received a message from a random person at 11pm last night who distributes bottles. He asked if I wanted to meet the very next morning and he even offered coffee. I knew that I would be busy that following morning so I didn’t even respond knowing I was about to fall asleep any moment and in the off chance this guy responded back to my response, I would have already been fast asleep.

Fast forward to the next morning, I was slaving away at my job and a few hours into work, a random guy shows up saying he was the guy from LinkedIn. Okay... I had no idea this guy was going to show up, but clearly this guy REALLY wanted to talk to me, so I said “sure let’s talk in the meeting room and I’ll take my 15 minute break”. So we end up talking about my experience in China and he talks about his job and then we start talking about my company. I’ve only been at this company for 2 months, but I would say I already know the business and what it’s goals are, so I explain these things to the LinkedIn guy. Suddenly one of the higher level employees comes in and introduces himself to the guy and they start talking about numbers with purchasing bottles and tons of stuff that I have no idea how to answer. 

After they stop talking the high level employee leaves and then me and the LinkedIn guy end our meeting shortly after. Right after he left I had thought to myself “wow, this guy has some gusto. He must be brave to just show up to somebody’s job unannounced and talk. Well that’s why he is in sales and I am not, kudos to him” and I thought that was the end.

I am now on my unpaid half hour break when suddenly my boss comes in and asks me what happened early with the LinkedIn guy. I explain the whole story and how I had zero idea he was going to show up and how I didn’t even answer him on LinkedIn when he messaged me. My boss then says how most people in the industry would be fired on the spot for pulling something like that and then asked for a reason as to why he shouldn’t fire me. I again said “because I had zero idea he was going to be here and I was just being nice talking to him.” He then says “if you do that again I will have to fire you, you are not in a position to represent the company”. 

This is where I was very annoyed. 
1. Because I was threatened to be fired 
2. Because it was clearly not my fault the guy showed up
3. Because they had mentioned “these are industry rules”

Number 3 specifically annoyed me because I only took this job because I need health insurance and was told this job has health insurance from the guy who threatened to fire me. I have worked for a month now working 40+ hours a week and still haven’t been offered health insurance, yet this guy is pulling “the rules” card on me. 

So I am curious, am I in the wrong? Should I have been fired? Should I have been scolded? Or should they have understood the situation and politely said in the future I should refer him to an upper level employee?

I keep wondering if I'm finding excuses or if it ain't easy. So I'll break down the basics.

It's not the hardest job but your gotta be productive. You gotta aim for 10-11 stops an hour. There's quite a bit of things to learn but in my case, knowing my city is my weakness. Yes I can orient myself in it an know the big streets but I don't know every sector and haven't lived everywhere. I am using a GPS, mostly because I'm never sent in the same place twice (I came in the rush of Black Friday, Christmas, New Years).

&amp;#x200B;

Now, my fellow classmates from training (we have a week's paid training) are better than me for the most part. Most did driving in one way or another. This is my first time. I can't get past 8 stops an hour and my team leader is telling me I'm doing fine. That he was once the worst of the place and now he's team leader. My bud who got hired there in a calmer season used to pull 6-7 stops and was told he was good but the guys I trained with go up to 11 stops an hour. I compare myself a lot because we have a probation and I'm already an anxious dude.   


I guess, what I'd like to ask if if y'all have some advice on chilling out while facing new employment. Any tips you guys got? Is it all normal? I'm a very confident guy in pretty much anything in life but getting a new job is my biggest kriptonite. It's the second one I ever had.

I couldn't make the bus and ended up making my date stay home from the party to basically babysit me. 

The thing I hate the most about this is that this guy is probably the nicest guy i've met while i've been at college. He keeps in touch with me and when he went on trips for his major he would update me on where he was and how much longer he would be gone. We had only met in person one time before the party, which was why I was even more impressed at how much he snaps me and wanted to keep up with me.

I am so far behind in all my classes and I feel so guilty. I’ve lied to my parents, professors, and friends about how I’ve been doing, when the reality is, I am so far behind in everything and I’m just trying to keep the illusion that everything’s fine. 

My parents, are specifically, my greatest fear right now. They are paying for my education, so they want to know how their investment is doing. I’ve had a really hard time in school in the past, and they know that, so now they want to be updated on all my assignments, tests, projects and I’ve just been lying. I’ve been saying I’ve turned in all these assignments when I haven’t, and it’s kicking me in the butt right now. I told them I had turned in an important assignment from last semester to complete my incomplete, but the truth is, I just turned it in yesterday and now the professor won’t accept my work and is telling me to start over and turn in the assignment by next semester. The incomplete still shows on my transcript and my parents are relentless in asking about updates, so I just keep saying “He just hasn’t put the grade in yet,”. 

I’m also having problems this current semester. All my classes are requiring I take incompletes to finish up my work that I couldn’t finish by the end of this semester. There’s so much I must do over Christmas break and my parents have no idea. They think I’m pretty much all caught up. They know I’m going to fail one class, so I’ll be retaking it next year, and I’ve rescheduled my graduation date, so I never take more than 10 credits a semester to reduce my stress and work load. I’m just trying to forget that another problem that’s cropped up is that I may not be able to have insurance if I’m not a full-time student… 

But back to my assignments, I’m just not sure what I can do. I’m so overwhelmed, and I have so much support from my professors who are the most accommodating people, but the idea of facing my parents makes me want to preemptively drop out to avoid all confrontation and having them take everything away.

395,"This is all a bit much to read so there is a TLDR at the bottom.

For some context:

I'm the oldest of three children in a household of already grown kids who still live at home. (Me- F23 / Middle child- M21 / Youngest- F19) We live in the NE U.S. and have Hispanic ties if that adds anything to our family dynamic. 

I'm post undergrad and currently live at home while I'm on the tail end of my masters program, my younger brother is a decent ways through college and my sister is about a year into her degree. There has been a longstanding plethora of problems we've had with my youngest including but not limited to: 

* Not doing anything required of her, including neglecting our pets and taking extremely bad care of her belongings like a car paid for by our parents.
* Not holding down any jobs and constantly leaving them after &lt;2 months because she dislikes traditional work situations.
* Becoming increasingly involved with rougher crowds and indulging in hard drugs, and potentially selling them.
* Neglecting her classes and skipping school far too often, while also having dropped classes she considered too difficult so wasting a lot of our family's money.
* Also taking everything for granted and being extremely spoiled; Like as in begging for money constantly and never giving back in other regards where she can. She pushes anything required of her and outright ignores when she's told to do anything that isn't convenient or benefiting her in some way. (I honestly don't know if this really belongs here, but I felt it fit.)
* Being extremely toxic and causing a lot of tension and arguing between my parents, especially due to the fact that in my dad's eyes she can literally do no wrong. My dad can not say no to her, regardless of what she does. Not too long ago she stole is credit card to go bar hopping and received no punishment, but rather about a month later he went with her to buy about $400 worth of clothes.

I'm writing this because it's at a point where she is going down worse and worse paths, and due to her choke hold on my father I don't really know what we could do to stop this from escalating any further. My younger brother and mother both agree that things are beyond out of hand, but we have no idea where to even begin with tackling this.

Her new claims are that she doesn't even want to finish formal schooling, and really is just waiting for her makeup youtube channel (which doesn't even exist yet, granted) to take off so she can drop out and make money through this and just do as she pleases. 

TLDR: Younger sister is extremely toxic and going down a very rough path, ruining my family's dynamic and has my father in the palm of her hand; any advice on helping work on this would be much appreciated.",01Dec2018,1
396,"I'm stressing out so much. I don't think ill have money for presents for Christmas, and my baby turns 1 on the 26th but I don't think I'll have a gift for her.

Unfortunately (and especially lately), my dad won't get off my case about ""blah blah blah, make a decision about what you want to study"" followed by a bunch of ""techniques"" on how to choose what to do. I know his intentions are good, but it opened my eyes about how I'm really not interested in anything, and school hasn't really given me anything that has let me think ""Oh I'm good at this!"" or ""Oh I really like this!"". Like, I can derivate equations, put notes in my calculator, and have a sense of humor at generally inappropriate times, but I have no idea what I want to be doing ten years from now. So what do I do?

399,"So I got this text from my brother: ""Call Mom, her dog died."" I have a few problems with this, and it might make me an asshole. So I need your advice, Reddit...am I an asshole for not calling my mom? Should I call my mom? What would I even say that could possibly make the situation better? 

&amp;#x200B;

For reference, I'm in my 30's and have tween kids. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't live near my mom, and haven't for several years. I'm not a fan of how I grew up, neither is my wife, and we didn't want either of our families to become a regular or more influential part of the ""village"" that some people suggest necessitates raising younglings. I have maintained a decent relationship with both of my parents because I do care about them and the things that their wisdom AND imperfections have taught me, but there's things I'm not huge on making a big deal out of like Holidays.

&amp;#x200B;

Mini-Rant:Holidays: Most of them involve lying to kids (Santa, Easter Bunny), misinterpreting history to create stupid traditions(almost all of them), or gross and overblown commercialism (also almost all of them). A perfect example is that my mom invites her whole family to come down for July 4th and we used to go out of a sense of obligation but then stopped because we didn't want to spend all day drinking and/or performing for people who spend all day drinking. Not to mention that my wife is more concerned with watching our kids, and ended up usually watching all the kids. I do appreciate the days off, given that they augment a shitty PTO program that my work offers. I thought this was important to put here because it might shed light on what I later describe might make me an asshole. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, about this dog. I am going to be open about this, there is a HUGE possibility that I don't want to call my Mom because she'll be crying, and I don't like to hear or see my Mom cry. I don't believe any normal person does, but I saw it a lot as a kid and was extremely glad that my parents got divorced so it would happen less (in retrospect, it was probably bittersweet. Like this damn dog.) So me not wanting to call my mom might be mostly selfish, and I'm coming up with all of these logical excuses to avoid any personal pain at the expense of a little comfort for my mom. Which is the part where I might be an asshole. I MAY also be doing this with Holidays, to a much smaller extent. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there even a thing I can say to comfort her? ""I'm sorry about your dog, that died, but you already knew that, and I didn't do it, but I'm sorry that you feel pain because of it? What were you thinking, becoming attached to a furry thing with such a short lifespan?"" No, that can't be right. Does sharing one's pain even lessen it, or does it prolong it? (Run-on sentence incoming, take cover!) Wouldn't it be better to come to the conclusion that the dog was always going to die and you made the best of it, and to even rejoice at the awesome reciprocal benefits of the life you provided for the stupid mutt and the life you can now provide for a new stupid mutt because of the vacancy in your heart? I guess the sad part is that if she were to get a new puppy it would likely outlive her. Hell, I have no idea now. Not that I did before.

400," TL;DR: My addict brother ran away because I attempted to threaten him into rehab. No one besides me gives a flying fuck about him at this point and I don’t know how to find him alone.

My older brother (29) has been a heroin addict for more than 7 years. I’m the only person he has left. Family gave up on him, his friends left him, he lost his job, home, car and basically everything else he’s worked hard for. He’s lived in my apartment for about a year and I pay for all his living expenses. I barely have any money for myself and my parents refuse to help me financially because they know I’m also going to spend money on my brother. I’ve had countless failed conversations with him about getting clean but two days ago I had the stupid idea of threatening to stop paying for his drugs if he didn’t at least try rehab. I’m not sure what he thinks he’d get out of from leaving but yesterday he left the house and never came back.

I know I shouldn’t even be financially supporting him at all. Everyone thinks he’s better off d\*\*d anyway and obviously they won’t help me if I asked. I know I can’t file a report to the police because he’s a legal adult. What should I do? What *can* I do?",01Dec2018,1

404,"Hello everyone! 

I’m just looking to get some advice about my sister who is 17. Without having to explain every single fucked up thing she’s done, I’ll name a few. Since she was young she’s lied and been physically abusive to us. She’s lied so much in secondary that she ended up getting the social services involved because she wanted freedom (she was able to go out with friends and everything). Her “best friend” at the time ended up brainwashing her saying that she would have all this freedom if she was to get fostered and so on which is why she had done it. She’s been in fights, she’s beaten me up twice and I’m eldest of us three and couldn’t do anything about it because she kept threatening she would get my brother taken away. She apologised and things were normal for a month or so. She would go Facebook and post thing like she had older brothers (we only have a younger brother) and saying that he had killed himself all because she wanted the attention and get people to feel sorry for her. She failed most of her GCSEs and barely got into college. She met her ex bf who ended up getting her pregnant and she didn’t know about it. Drama unfolded with that and she ended up getting an abortion. We told her to get help to deal with it as it’s a massive thing that she’s gone through. Instead when the baby passed, she sent me a photo and put laughing faces and said look at his genitals. I was horrified. She’s recently been hanging around with a girl from college who is a 16 and is leading her to all sorts of troubles. We’ve taken her keys away to bring some sort of boundaries and she comes home when she wants, we asked if she could just let us know where she is or at least pick up to let us know she’s safe. She says yes and then doesn’t do it. She’s now told the college that my mother is physically beating her up which is not true and I can back her up completely. My mum is under so much stress she is in and out of hospital. She sick to death with stress that my sister is going to get my younger brother taken away because of all her lies.  Everyone wants her out of the house we just don’t know where to even start. She’s spoilt. Has her own room, tv, iPad, laptop, iPhone and cat who she barely looks after. I just don’t know what to do anymore. She’ll tell everyone that we don’t like her or we make her life hell which is the polar opposite. She’s patronising, violence aggressive and even hits her own cat. I’m posting this here because it’s breaking what little we have left of this family up. Her father works in a different city Monday to Friday and comes down to see them over the weekend (whenever he feels like it) and is no sort of support or even helps my mother with this issue. He thinks throwing money at my brother or sister to make him look like the good guy is being a good dad. Instead of spending time with them, he ends up being patronising to my mother (I’m from a different marriage) because she speaks English with an accent. I just don’t know what to do anymore and I just want her out as much as my mother does. Where do I go with this ?


Short version : 
17 year old sister is messed up in the head refuses to get any help and is a violent and abusive failing everything in college and wants to be the centre of attention. Getting the social services involved and making my mother hospital sick with all the stress. We all want her out. We just don’t know where to start.

405,"There's this guy who I approached out of the blue at my school and started following on Instagram around a year ago. 

We both had a crush on each other, but we stopped talking when he asked me out a few months ago, because a day after I found out through a friend he was ""seeing"" one of their friends. It wasn't exclusive and they only dated for 3 weeks but I was kind of disappointed and haven't spoken to them since. 

I'm still interested in them because they're my type and we have similar interests. But in a week school ends and it's their last semester.... 

Today they posted something on their story about an art gallery show because they're a Fine Arts major, and this may be my last chance to run into them at school. 

I know an acquaintance in his program and I'm contemplating messaging them and setting something up so it seems like I'm visiting her instead of him..and so I can linger around more. 

None of my friends are available on Monday night, so the only other option would be to show up alone and act like I'm looking at all the art pieces and hope to approach him . 

My only other concern is that his other friends may show up.

So yeah any advice? ",01Dec2018,1

407,"Little bit of background: 
My husband and I both have C-PTSD/Depression. We’ve been together since we were 18 and have two kids and a third on the way. First, I want to say we have an awesome family and love being parents, but we have faced a lot of challenges. Our lives have been incredibly chaotic, I was raised in group homes/inpatient facilities after getting removed from an abusive home(and to treat the mental illnesses acquired from the abuse) and my husband grew up in an emotionally abusive and neglectful home. This is relevant because have both spent a lot of time learning to manage our mental illnesses individually and as a family and it’s left us playing a game of “life skills catch-up” 

Ive already been lectured about the irresponsibility of having children when you’re life isn’t in order or with a mental illness, but we’ve had them, we’ve kept them safe and flourishing. It wasn’t ideal and it wasn’t the perfect timing but here we are. Just getting that out of the way because I’m more interested in discussing how to improve rather than what we should have done. 

We have gotten by working entry level jobs, but having our young kids we really want to be able to provide more for them.  We don’t want to have to rely on state benefits ever again, we want to be able to afford good health insurance. We want to be able to blow a tire and not have a meltdown because we can’t fix it. 

I don’t know where to start/if it’s worth it or possible to get a college education starting this late in life. I don’t know what degrees are worth getting or how to pay for it. We are kind of odd people, and that worries me a little as far as finding a career. My husband is extremely smart/philosophical/artistic and sometimes that gets in the way. He comes off as a “tinkering intellectual” type and it really discourages him from any jobs that require a lot of social interaction. He considered the military, got a 100% on the asvab, was aggressively pursued by the recruiter, but got discouraged because of the C-PTSD, which is understandable. Also- he has a kind of ethical hang-up, he wants to find work that is useful/helpful, contributes to society, I think it’s part of his philosophical nature. It’s just who he is so in looking for work, that’s what I’m keeping in mind. 

We also both have long gaps in work history because of our mental health treatments/being on disability. 

I’m more open to social interaction but our kids are very young and both of us would prefer that he works and I stay with them until school age. I would love to find anything that I can do from home. 

I have no idea where to start. We are in California now, but are open to moving anywhere (preferably the colder, rainier parts of the world that are maybe more affordable) as long as it can help us advance and provide for our kids. 

In short: is college worth it/affordable/doable at 28 with kids? Are there jobs that are less social and more flexible for an intellectual/introverted/creative person? How do we find them, get them with little experience? Any other general advice for our situation. 

Also, brand new to reddit kind of winging it and learning as I go, so if this isn’t the right way to post or right place to post let me know!

408,"I (M24) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (F22) for 6 months. I have been in a tough financial situation for about 3-4 months now. She has had to help me with rent twice, and i owe her ~$1450 already. I fully intend on paying her back when i am in a better situation.

This month was the first month that i was supposed to be financially stable, on top of all my bills, with money to put away for savings, etc. I did not foresee issues with my apartment complex telling me i need to pay the security deposit and pet registration fees (I did not receive my security deposit back from them on the last lease and they never asked for my pets to be registered again, so i figured they just used the money from last lease for my current lease) this is about 4 months into my current lease. To make a long story short, i am supposed to pay the office $1720 today. i have nowhere near that.

My girlfriend is offering to pay the remainder of what i do not have so that i won’t have to worry about it. She comes from a wealthy family and this would not be an issue to her as far as i know. I grew up very poor and was raised to make ends meet on my own and to not accept handouts. I refused her offer and told her i can pick up shifts at my 2nd job to make up for the extra money. She told me that she isn’t going to allow me to get 3 hours of sleep a night so that i can make ends meet and that if i don’t accept her offer, she’s going to go to the office today and pay the amount in full without my contribution.

I would feel extremely selfish and insufficient if i accepted her help for a 3rd time, more than doubling the money that i owe her.

Yeah, I know that sounds silly. I can’t stand the stuff. I can’t eat it, can’t touch it (even through wrappers), and in an ideal world it wouldn’t exist, so I’d never have to think about it. Unfortunately, I live here and now. To make this absolutely clear, I would rather stuff the ear wax of other people in my mouth than put a cube of cheese near my lips.

&amp;#x200B;

I still live at home with my mother – who is a cheese lover and has many different types of cheese on the go at all times. When she has it in the house, I can’t open the fridge, I certainly cannot eat anything out of the fridge. Many times, I have let perfectly good items of food go off because in my head, they’re already contaminated. I don’t eat at parties because I don’t know what’s in the food or where the food has been. One time, I was washing up and I got to the bottom of the washing-up bowl and found a plate with cheese crumbs on. Having had my arms in the water for so long, I spent the rest of the day taking several showers and shuddering at thought of what I’d just done. I don’t feel clean to this day.

If cheese is on the kitchen counter, I cannot use the counter. I have explained my aversion to my mother, but she doesn’t seem to give a shit. I don’t have enough money to move out.

So I am 22, recent college grad, and I currently work for a very large corporation. When I interviewed I was originally told I would be working in a new position where I could flex my creative muscles while doing sales and they would transfer me to marketing very quickly. 

I soon found out that my sole job was prospecting and that was it. I at first only had a list that was 4 pages long and then I asked to get another one, so they bought me a list. I still felt like I wanted to do more so they let me prospect based on any research I wanted to do. I finally had conversation with my boss and told him I felt unfulfilled and so he is moving me to a full sales role, where I would be doing back end work as well. Unfortunately I still feel very bored and unfulfilled. 

To top it off the company culture is just not great. Instead of asking an employee who has worked there for 10 years and has excelled in her district, they hired a manager. 

There is this extremely secretive nature at this company. Everything is a secret. My move was a secret. Our company goals are a secret. If they are hiring, it’s a secret. I asked why everything was so secretive and they replied very condescendingly. 

“I don’t know if you’ve ever worked for a company before, but this is how it is no matter where you work.”  

I was recently offered a job at a plastic surgery/spa as a event developer with a manager title. I would be making 5,000 more a year plus an extra week paid vacation and a paid conference of my choice. I also would get wayy cheaper insurance (I pay 200 a month for just me). 

This job would be something that I would definitely want to do. I’d have a lot of different responsibilities and I would be able to be creative and work on social media. Unfortunately this employer is kind of shady.

He owns a lot of different buildings and strips. One of the buildings has a pharmacy, but it’s also where the spa I will be working at is. The pharmacy in his building was raided by the FBI. He also has the worst doctor reviews EVER. He has a tendency to dismiss patients and yell at them. He also had a sexual harassment case from 4 former patients. This man seems super shady.

Does his shady-ness overshadow the job? Am I being an awful person leaving this other job after they just gave me a promotion? It’s a great opportunity but am I just excited to leave so I am taking whatever comes at me?  Should I ask for a higher salary from new employer? I don’t even know how to quit a job!!!

417,"I had my upper wisdom teeth removed on Monday.

The one on the left was already through the gums and had actually broke off (chipped), which is the reason I decided to go ahead and have them removed. The one on the right was still inside the gums and as far as I know had not caused me any issues at all. But, I figured while I'm there remove both sides just in case. 

The next day I pretty well can't tell anything was done on the left side. That's the side that had already broke through the gums years ago and chipped. HOWEVER....
The right side hurt so much, other than soup, I didn't eat for two days. Third day I woke up with a black-eye and swollen as bad as day one. It hurt all the time as well. So, I went back to the dentist to check on the swelling and black-eye. 

Dentist said, the black eye is because there is still bleeding inside and the blood will pool in different places until it clots. Which makes since to me. I do have several stitches as well. He also said, it looks like it was impacted (note they never said anything of that sort prior to my appointment). He then asked if I received any anti-biotics. I said yes and he promptly stated the doctor, he isn't the same dentist that removed my teeth, that did the work thought there could be issues and this is why he prescribed anti-biotics. He further said they don't normally subscribe them for this type of thing. 

I'm not sure why he said that at all. I find the statement evasive, untrue, and obviously a dodge from admitting something that may have been preventable. 

He said to go home and put a hot towel or wash cloth on it off and on to help with the circulation. Also said not to take too many pain pills, again I thought this was odd. He said he wanted to see me again the next day if I wasn't feeling better. 
He clarified that if the swelling hasn't gone down to come in, but if I felt any better it was probably ok. 

I didn't go back as I felt a bit better and honestly just didn't want to go out in the rainy cold weather. 

Fast forward to today - 5 days from the procedure. 

I've been eating, but it is very painful and difficult. Today, while chewing with the gracefulness and speed of the nimble three-toed sloth, my jaw audibly popped. It felt like I took a hit to the right side of the head from an axe handle, but it loosened up slightly. It still hurts, but not seemingly as bad.

I'm normally pretty good with pain and manage it fine. I've been through a lot worse than this. It's not really the amount of pain so much as type of pain.  It slightly worries me. I really think they either dislocated my jaw or cracked my skull. The pain is a deep bone pain that at its peak, feels like I've been hit in the head with an axe handle. 
But if something like that had happened, why wouldn't they just tell me so I can be prepared? 

Should I go back and have them do another x-ray to make sure nothing is cracked? ",01Dec2018,1
418,"In any company, there are hierarchies that are understood to exist where some groups are clearly seen as more important/significant than others by any person who's being honest with themselves.

In a large engineering company, I received an opportunity for an assignment in a Skunkworks-type position near the top of the technical hierarchy. I'm currently in a role way below this. The problem I'm having is that my manager is making it very difficult for me to leave to take it.

I was told that if he received a sufficient headcount later this year, he would let me leave in January. He recieved the headcount he was looking for then told me I was going to have to wait until July.

I went to executive management about this and the executive manager is supporting the July transfer date. I am under the impression now that when my manager told me that he approached executive management about the January transfer date earlier, he had not actually done that and that this is the first time this guy is hearing about this (there's no way for me to know for sure and I am not outwardly stating my suspicion).

If I quit, I can get a better job than the one I have now, but not one better than the one that's being withheld from me.

How would Reddit approach this situation? 

I am extraordinarily upset, but I want to do the right thing  rather than what my emotions direct me towards.

420,"Hello guys! (Throw away account because him &amp; I use Reddit together a lot)

As Christmas is approaching, I am trying to prepare a sweet gift for my long distance boyfriend.

However, there isn't anything in particular he wants, so I thought I'd make something sweet and personal myself.

So I started making these little ""open when... *situation*"" letters, so he can keep them and read something sweet from time to time when an occasion arrives. I'm making little paintings and writing little messages appropriate to each situation on every letter, so they all have a different theme and are appropriate for each occasion they correspond to.

The problem is I don't know if he'd like them. Maybe it isn't enough, but I really can't afford to buy much at all as of now. Do you, fellow redditors, think it would be a sweet gift? He seems to appreciate having little things from me just so we can feel closer despite the distance but Christmas is a pretty big holiday and I wouldn't want my gift to be a disappointment to him.

423,"I’m not sure where to start. I want to be as short and concise as possible but I want to make sure to include as much detail as possible because I really need advice. Thank you in advance!

In 2016 I started a job as a buyer on a team of 5. I knew in advance that the team was short staffed. One buyer was on LOA. I came into the position optimistic and enthusiastic and volunteered for any work to help alleviate some of the stress from the other buyers. Also, shortly after I was hired the department was restructured and I took over some responsibilities from the director. The other buyers complained about my workload not knowing how involved the new responsibilities were. So again, I volunteered for more responsibilities to hush the complaints. (They never stopped and haven’t stopped 2.5 years later) 

In the meantime, the buyer that was on LOA was let go. We hired a new buyer in her place. The decision was made to bring in a 6th. For over 2 years we’ve been shorted staffed now. During the summer 2 buyers had surgery and were out from July-Oct leaving me to cover for 2 other buyers. No one else in the department is expected to cover 2 people. They will actually tell her “I can’t do that...I don’t have time.” And she accepts that. 

During this time, my brother also passed away suddenly and unexpected leaving my family pretty distraught. I took a week off. A few weeks after returning my boss called me into her office to tell me “While you were on vacation we noticed you had fallen behind. How can we help you manage your time more efficiently.” I explained to her that I wasn’t on vacation (which she knew) that my brother had died and I didn’t have a problem with managing my time but I was consistently covering for 2 people and my own responsibilities. I asked her not to talk to me about my performance until our department was fully staffed. 

She hadn’t until recently. My teenage son had expressed suicidal thoughts. She encouraged me to take time off to deal with it. For the past 3 weeks I had taken off 1 day a week to take him to doctors appointments and find him a therapist. Again during this time I was covering 2 other people and also since someone called off and was supposed to train someone she gave me the job of training them. She called me into her office again this week to discuss my time management. She said “I’m sympathetic to your situation but we have a business for run.” 

We currently have 4 full time buyers and 1 part time buyer. 2 buyers are scheduled to be off the week of Christmas leaving myself and one other buyer. The part time buyer doesn’t help cover any of the shared responsibilities. I’ve tried to discuss the coverage with my boss but she keeps saying “we will discuss it” but I suspect I will be expected to cover for 3 other people and my own responsibilities this time. 

I am bitter over her choosing the most insensitive times to discuss my performance without acknowledging the fact that I’m carrying the burden of being the only buyer who is expected to cover everyone in the department. Part of me wants to give my 2 weeks notice and leave right before the week of Christmas and let the other buyers figure it out. 

Any advice is appreciated.

424,"I had gone on a few dates with this girl from tinder over the course of a month. I lent her my guitar, and shortly after stopped hearing from her. I had texted her a few times over the last week about getting it back because I knew I'd leaving town tonight for Christmas break. So, not hearing from her, I checked on tinder which says she's 500 km away - she was only living in my city temporarily and is back home now I guess. She also blocked me on instagram. I'm wondering what my options are at this point? 

The house she was staying at is just down the street from me, but I only walked her home once at night and doubt I would remember the exact house. Either way, would it be out of line to hypothetically knock on the door and see if she left it there?

426,"\*Copied from a past post\*  


I'm currently in a living situation that's an actual nightmare. I am living with two past-abusers: my brother, and my mother.

My brother physically, verbally, and emotionally abused me almost daily growing up - to a point of giving me PTSD, and is a large contributor to my generalized anxiety. He still to this day verbally and emotionally abuses me when he can, but the physical aspect has since ceased.

My mother, now an alcoholic, verbally and emotionally abused me as well. It was never physical but she literally watched my brother beat me as a kid. She now drinks herself into situations where I have to call the ambulance a *lot,* and it's incredibly stressful.  


So, my best friend (of 10 years) wants me to move in with him. We thought most of it out... we would split the bills and buy a small house doing a combination of not buying a car (transit is really good where he lives), OSAP funding ( I live in Ontario Canada and the Government gives you money to help with school expenses) , and working for 4 or 5 shifts a week on top of school.

427,"Hi all
Ok so I am currently a junior in high school. Ever since my freshman year my mom has wanted me to join the wrestling team and she had accepted that I did not want to do it. Two friends of mine along with her pushing me convinced me to do it this year, as she thought it would allow me to make new friends (I already know half the team) and get into better shape (she’s right about this part). I had decided this past summer that I would join. So, I did the preseason conditioning through mid October and November and now our real practices have started. This past week was our first week. I went to the first three days of practice, missed Thursday because I was sick and missed Friday and Saturday (today) to get some schoolwork done. Practice is 3-3.5hrs a day after school. So I am currently trying to balance 3 AP and 4 Honors classes, Wrestling, and work. Since the season has started (this week) I have been stressed like never before. I don’t really want to quit wrestling as I know it will get me into better shape and I am already in the group chat with the team and don’t want to deal with **** from my friends about quitting, but I really dont love how things have started and I don’t know how I’m going to manage this going forward.

434," Hi, So let me preface this by saying this is my first Reddit Post.s I'm a bit nervous! I'm a 29 year old female I've been in 1 relationship with my BFF who is male who I've known since i was 17. We got married in 2012 and got divorced in 2015. I lost my V card to him and everything else too. First kiss first....everything lol We are still BFFs and he is my roommate currently. I haven't dated since my divorce since i don't want a bf yet. So my ex is also my FWB. I have another close guy friend who I've known since i was 19. He was the first person i told about my divorce and things escalated from there. Heavy sexual tension and what not unless we messed around about a year later but we haven't had sex. Ive giving him a BJ a hand full of times over the past 2 years but that's it. we don't wanna date or anything just FWB but its so so difficult to get him to come over and let me blow him. He seems into it and he always talks about my bjs because I'm great at them. I know it sounds arrogant but i just am great, i know it, my ex knows it and he knows it. my ex also aware i mess with this guy as well so it isn't awkward because we only mess around when my ex is out. Anywhooo, I guess my question is. Since my friend keeps having hang ups and flaking on me, how do i sorta get a new FWB.I don't know how to make new guy friends and have it turn into that. My guy friend and i work together and there is another guy at work that i get along with amazingly well. So it would be awesome if it could be him .I just don't know how to.........I guess subtly transition our friendship into suggesting we mess around. I don't want to come off creepy.  i love giving bjs and i want a FWB so i can do it when i want too. it drives me insane when my current sorta FWBflakes because i just crave it lol its oddly selfish but its sorta purely for me. 30 min bjs are standard lol The fact that it also feels good for the guy is a bonus i guess. i'm not saying this to come of like i would blow anyone. or that i want contact. PLEASE do not contact me to get a BJ lol its just that its something i love to do and its a must.  Yes  i know i can blow my ex when ever but i want to but i want a new guy too lol any non cheesy porn style ideas? 

TLDR- 29yr old female. I've been in 1 relationship and i've only had intercourse sex with him but I've given bjs to guy friend.  Still FWB with my ex and occasionally with my guy friend but he's flakey so i don't wanna mess around anymore. How do make a work friend into my new fwb?",01Dec2018,1

Now here is the question we haven't sent a snap in about 11 hours and if I don't send or she doesn't then we will lose the streak. I know that she is online because I can see it on the Snapchat map.
Should I send her and keep the streak or wait and see if she will send it, Honestly at this point if she doesn't send a Snapchat I have no reason to to talk to her because it proves that she isn't interested in me.

438,"So I will freely admit that I have fucked up with my partner big time.  I went out last night and got much more drunk that I usually do.  Combination of not eating enough and having 1 glass of wine too many.  I got into a fight with my father - there is A LOT of baggage there and I was very upset.  I went to a concert with my dad, and the fight occurred on the way home.  My boyfriend was out with a friend at the time when I called very upset and in tears.  He didn't answer and instead of being the respectful and understanding partner I should have been, I turned my anger on him.  Even though this does not excuse my behavior in any way, I don't behave this way sober.  My father made a comment that shook me to my core, and it was like all of this repressed anger and resentment I have been harboring towards the men in my life that have hurt me came pouring out, and directed at a man that I adore and respect, that in no way shape or form deserved it.  I honestly keep trying to make sense of my twisted logic last night - because he wasn't there for me when I needed him to be, he must have been with another woman, right?  God I'm cringing just thinking about this. 

&amp;#x200B;

BUT,... it gets worse.  A lot worse.  When I got home I really don't know what led up to this chain of events other than me feeling sorry for myself and acting impulsively I guess.  I grabbed a bottle of unisom (an anti-histamine used as a sleep aid) and swallowed like 10-15 pills.  I sat on my bed and within like 3 minutes I realized not only was I being stupid for being in the frame of mind of wanting to hurt myself, but I'm pretty sure all these pills were going to do was make me sick to my stomach.  I barfed them up.  I then proceeded to tell my boyfriend about it.

&amp;#x200B;

This wasn't my first suicide attempt/tease (? not sure that's the right word for it).  When I was in college I was in a very toxic relationship that has screwed me up even to this day.  Something similar, I took a bunch of asprin and chased it with a bottle of wine.  Only that time I did not rethink my actions, I was found by a roommate.  Spent a week in the psych ward after having to drink charcoal for 2 straight days.  Not fun.  You would think I would have learned from this.  Clearly I didn't!  My mother attempted suicide this way when my father was leaving her and I was the one who was left to deal with it (my father walked out of the house and left me fighting with my mom and the garage door until the paramedics showed up).  I think this experience has a lot to do with this impulsive behavior to do this sort of thing when I am intoxicated.  I have never done anything like this while sober and just the thought of it makes me want to barf I'm so ashamed of myself.  I really don't know what I was thinking last night, or why I thought I should share the information with my partner (I shared it after I had thrown up).  We got into a screaming match on the phone where I proceeded to tell him to enjoy his lady friend and that I was done.  Yikes.  

&amp;#x200B;

I should also add that I have struggled with opiate addiction for almost a decade.  I had been getting help through a clinic over the summer and was doing well until I was denied my suboxone script one week because I wasn't able to attend a group meeting that I was notified of when I arrived at the office because I had to be at work.  I had to work all weekend, so after I exhausted my options of finding street suboxone, I wound up buying a bag of dope and then proceeded to get pulled over and arrested for possession.  I came clean to my partner, I got myself into a different and much better clinic, and I have been doing very well since.  I have grown a lot over the past few months.  I apparently thought I was capable of being able to have a few drinks from time to time, but my behavior last night has shown me that I cannot.  Moving forward I am going to abstain from all substances.  I even quit smoking a few weeks ago.

&amp;#x200B;

My arrest combined with my behavior last night as you can imagine has me in a very bad situation with my partner.  Once I sobered up I explained myself to him, but the damage was done.  He told me last night and has reaffirmed today that he wants to break up and won't consider a relationship with me unless I am in therapy and actively working on my deep seeded issues (jealousy/trust issues &amp; this compulsion to run from my emotional pain whether it be a suicide attempt, or just shutting down completely).  I wholeheartedly agree with him that I need professional help, and the first thing that I did this morning was find a therapist in the area that is actually going to be calling me for a consultation in about a half hour.  I don't expect him to just turn a blind eye to this and forgive and forget, but our situation is,... complicated.  We live together, and I have a very close relationship with what I have begun thinking of as a step daughter.  All our assets are tied together including vehicles.  I don't have the money right now for a down payment on my own place and there is no one close enough for me to stay with at the moment so I can keep my job.  I have worked very hard to improve my life over the past few months, and I am very worried that this break up is going to send me into free fall.  I haven't thought of using, which is good, and I think represents real progress in terms of my addiction.  I want to get myself the mental health help that I need and be the best partner to him that I can be.

&amp;#x200B;

He has said that I can stay living here for now.  He has been very firm about us only being friends for the time being.  He's rightfully very angry at me right now, so I would say the demeanor between us is far from a friendly one, but I know the anger won't last forever and I need to be patient.  He is allowing me a chance to make things right, which I am thankful for, but I have to admit this is very hard for me.  He told me earlier that he still loved me but that he wasn't in love with me right now, which is understandable, given my behavior.  It doesn't make it any less painful.  I feel like I'm coming apart at the seams right now to be honest.  I have poor coping skills to begin with, which I know is one of the things that I need to work on but this has almost been unbearable.  A part of me feels like he's just taking a hard line with me and that once the anger has subsided things will be OK.  The other part of me is terrified that I have lost the love of my life forever, and I can't crying.  I can feel my mental health rapidly deteriorating, and the person I have counted on to lean on and help give me strength is no longer there.  I'm trying to give him space, but it's hard given the fact that we are in such close proximity and I am fighting the urges to try and talk this out with him.  I love this man so much guys, he's the best person I have ever met and he seriously didn't deserve to be put through all of this.  I am so angry at myself for subjecting him to this awful side of me.  He has given me this opportunity to make things right and I cannot stop obsessing over it.  I haven't been able to think about anything else, I keep trying to distract myself but I just wind back here (hence the lengthy post!)  and I'm having trouble coping.  I keep crying, especially when spending time with my step daughter - she gave me a drawing this morning she made in school for me of the three of us in a car together.  I legit had to run away to avoid her seeing me bawling my eyes out.  

&amp;#x200B;

I should mention that neither of us slept much last night, and my (ex?) boyfriend is very testy when he's over tired.  I let him take a 5 hour nap today while I watched his daughter, and I am hoping that his attitude toward me softens a little when he wakes up.  I desperately need sleep myself but even when I tried to lie down this morning I could not fall asleep because my mind is racing.  I want to be a more capable &amp; mature adult and handle this better, I just have no idea how to do that.  I also really don't want to lose what we had, it was something special.  I don't want to be a doormat or appear too needy, but I'm afraid I've already given off that vibe.  I did write down a list of things that I want to work on with a therapist/things that I need to improve upon on my end of things in the relationship that I sent to him but I don't think he's read it yet.  I want to be a better person not just for my family but for myself as well, as well as save what I consider the relationship of my lifetime.  How do I tread carefully here while still showing him I am committed to real change?  Please help!

tldr; I was emotionally abusive while I was drunk and had a half assed suicide attempt that may have ruined my relationship for good.  I'm having trouble coping with the situation - living arrangements, emotional pain and just general uneasiness.  Hoping for some sound advice.

What I like about her is she always check how I am doing sending me message of, ""How are you?"", but when we have a conversation chat, I always try to tell her how my day has been and if there is interesting things happened to me, I usually will write long paragraph of an interesting story about my day, and she usually replied to me back with a very boring effortless response to my story, like for example, from my interesting stories, these are her replies, ""I see"", ""Gotcha"", ""Ah"". I felt really annoyed towards her when she don't put feelings and effort the way we chat. Last time, I told her an interesting story of what happened to me in my day and she just responded, ""Oh..."", I completely goes banana that time, and told myself, this is enough to communicate with her. She is like that ever since and I forgave the way she is for so long time we are chatting but this time I utterly felt so annoyed, upset and disappointed with her. I felt like the way we chat is just one way effort, and that is me who only puts effort to have a meaningful conversation between us as a friends. If she asked me, ""How are you?"", and I replied, ""I am good"", our conversation chat history is like that only, ""How are you I am good History"" chat, is this really what a friendship should be look like? Because she upset me so much, I uninstall my Whatsapp now so I don't get message from her, I still care for her, but it felt like it is useless to chat with her, the way she reacts to me when I share something, for now, I don't plan to talk to her anymore...

445,"Hello Reddit, I am 16 and a junior in high school, I'm on the spectrum but borderline, and my parents are putting two rules in place that sounds like it's for a little kid. I heard about these about three hours ago at my counselors office and it ended with me saying ""fuck you both for giving me rules fit for an elementary schooler"" to my mom and dad. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first rule is and I quote ""phase 1: (Immediate): Technology (xbox, phone, pc) is limited to two hours a day on weekdays and weekends when not at school. Phase 2: (2 weeks after phase 1): Xbox, gaming systems, computers, and tv's will not be allowed bedrooms. these limits will be permanent.""

&amp;#x200B;

The second rule is a wall of text so I'll just write a Tl;Dr of it. ""Family events must be attended by each family member. including church, movies, family trips(around town), malls, birthday celebrations(\[City two hours south\])."" then they added a paragraph of how church is a ""community event and it teaches basic principles"" but I've repeatedly voiced my aversion to going to church and malls because of the amount of people (I don't do well with large crowds)

&amp;#x200B;

with the rules now laid out I need advice to refute the time limit on the first rule and phase 2 of the first rule, all I have is that I'm a junior and I've proven myself to be responsible with my work, and that they shouldn't have to put a time limit on me or remove my tv if I'm getting my work done. (all A's and B's except for one class which was a high C). 

&amp;#x200B;

The second rule is a bit harder for me because it just seems that they don't care about my aversion to large crowds, malls, and church. Even though I've explained myself numerous times. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also have an aversion to going to \[city two hours away\] because I hate two of my cousins. they always try and find me when I try to avoid them and when they find me It's constant annoyance for the next hour and a half (they usually find me after half an hour), whenever I move, they move with me. I don't want to snap because if I snap in front of a house full of hispanics and start cursing......well, you make the inference. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My parents are putting two rules into place that are fit for an elementary kid and I'm a junior in high school. I need advice. Help

452,"This has happened twice.

First time was even years ago - I was with my ex Alex for five years, during that time he made friends with my friends and I'd gotten him a job working in the same office as all my friends. The breakup was amicable but as he worked with my friends they couldn't very well exclude him from parties ect. they'd talk about at work, between this and his lying by telling people I'd broken up with him meant I lost my friends - they're still friends with him, but not with me. 

Last time was earlier this year - after the above situation I was living in another country, when I cam home I realized I had no friends locally. I started using Meetup and this is where I met my ex Scott, but what started as a very happy promising relationship ended when he became abusive. As Scott was more active and popular with the Meetup groups I felt I could no longer be part of the group, also I have a feeling that he may have lied to them about me/our breakup too. 

It's not as easy as just making new friends...

I'm Autistic so it takes a long time for me to establish any sort of social group, even then as you can tell from the above examples it's not like I become a valued member of the group or make real friends - add to this that Meetup is no longer an option, money to do things or find new hobbies is tight, and that no one wants to be friends with the weirdo with no friends....it's a big knock to have lost these social groups. I currently have no friends what-so-ever and no social life. 

I get over the breakups, but having no friends to help me through the breakup or get back out there is so tough, it also makes it harder to move on in the sense that it feels so unfair to me and compounds any pain from the breakup.

456,"Warning: long post,tldr is on bottom


So recently i started playing an online game with some friends. Im not a very casual player but everyone else is. Then one day, this new dungeon came out and we were all eager to run it, ( 3 weekish ago) so we made a spreadsheet to discuss who would go to dungeon.  At the moment we didnt have enough people ready to run it so we decided to wait till we had enough.  We could run it with like 5 guildies then find 5 random players to join but my guild leader did not want to do that.


But that never came. I waited for about a week before asking about the new run, and then my guild leader said two of our guildmates were having vpn issues and cant play anymore. So i was okay with waiting more.  Around this time i mentioned we should clean out the people who dont play anymore and recruit more people to play with because we only have like 5-6 active members daily and we have 30 some slots.
Then my guild-leader was all like, “ well i dont wanna boot people because this is a casual guild with friends” and so i was like ok 


The next day they change their mind and release a poll. The question was weather to kick inactives and alts and recruit or not. Well the kick inactives won in favor 4-2 iirc 
So we cleaned the guild but we didn’t actively recruit. 
So i think the day after i mention that we should recruit in game to which my guild leader replied that no because that want to get people from the discord of the game or reddit or something. So whatever ill wait 

A week passes and i ask again, its thanksgiving week. “ well this week everyone is their families so its slow” meanwhile im seeing people recruit for their guild dailies. Im stuck playing alone in a guild with 5-6 people because everyone just isnt as gung ho about the game as i am. 

Anyway so three days ago i ask again about the run and they reply that we need to find one more priests ( i play priest) for the run 
I explain that the run only needs one priest and they reply “we could run with one priest if we had an experienced priest” mind you im the only priest in the guild and ive been ready to run this run for 3 weeks now so then i reply, “ well i could run it alone with a pick up group ( random group of people) and then we can run it” and then they say, “ [lol i was kidding dont get mad]”  so whatever im pretty annoyed because in my head im still trying to figure out how that was sarcasm, and that wasnt the first time theyd say underhanded comments like that either. Despite me being more geared than anyone in the guild atm 


So whatever i was actually serious when i said id run it alone. After weeks of waiting, asking,  and being patient only to be met with dodgy statements and shitty reactions i ran the dungeon without my guild. And after 2 hours of practice complete with another hour of running i completed the run. 
So then i posted that i completed the guild and some members praised me. But my guildleader was furious. 
“ do i have to find one or two priests now?” They said
Which now in retrospect makes me wonder if they were joking about needing more than one priest. 
“Wdym” i replied, confused as towards what they were asking at the time. 
“ well youre gonna cap your runs before wednesday, when we said we were gonna run we talked about it this week”  at that moment my mind went blank, because i did sign up to run on wed, but i did not know that we were doing it this wed, but we still needed like 5 people because we lost two to vpn issues. and with no applications, how were we gonna be ready till wednesday? 
“Anon never wants to run with us” some guildmate replied who i actually have never ran with, but thats usually because we’re running different dungeons. They need one whole i need the other
“You always do your runs fast” the second in command adds. 


“ i like to do my runs early because i have lots of things to do throughout the week and i dont like to wait. We just play different” I replied wondering how anyone could say that after i always invite people to
My runs and announce when im running and no one ever replies. And then on the opposite coin no one ever invite me to runs or invites me to discord chat either. 


“Well if youre gonna put your name down on the roster  [for the dungeon runs] then at least commit to it.” The second in command retorts
The guild leader remarks,” I couldve ran the dungeon the day it came out but i waited for everyone” 
In my head im so confused because how can anyone be upset that im ahead if i was only going to go back to help everyone else out


The second in command adds,”Youre being selfish” 
I reply, “How is it selfish? If i know how to do the run i can belp you guys. We dont need a second priest now.”
they continue, “ i save my runs for my guildies so i can hep them out but i guess we just play differently” 
I facepalm because that was the most petty holier than thou comment ever but i just want this to end to i reply, “ i understand” 
They continue with, “we just want you to understand how we feel” 
Idk thats the end i change the chat and ignore messages till i fall asleep.


Idk what to do i want to keep playing with these guys but are they really my friends if they just berate me and beat me down when i completed the new dungeon after being told i wasnt experienced enough? Literally theres been times where people will harass me and everyone just watches. These are people ive known for years and i feel like theyre a clique within a clique and have no intention in adding me
Idk what do yall think? Should i change guilds? Should i confront then about this again?


Tl;dr guild leader takes 9ever to recruit members and get the guild moving towards new raid so after waiting 3ish weeks i run the dungeon with randoms and theyre pissed along with second in command

I have been an Apple person for the majority of my smartphone life, and I’m very used to them. I’m a fan, but I definitely see some of the flaws. I’m nervous about switching to a new operating system, but some friends are encouraging me to, and I can definitely see the benefits. Commercials for the new Galaxy phones do a great job of making them look much better than iPhones, but that’s obviously what they’re supposed to do. My choice for an upgrade would be an iPhone 8 Plus or a Galaxy S9 or Note 9 (more likely the S9). Has anyone switched, and how did you feel about it? It’s a big decision for me. I desperately need a new phone as my 6s that I got when it first came out is barely functional anymore and I’m not the type who upgrades their phone as soon as a new one comes out.

I should also note that an iPhone X is not in the cards for me because it’s too much $ to upgrade to with my plan.

I observed it for months that I lost so much empathy. 

Half an hour ago I sat together with my parents. My aunt is about to die and my parents were shocked about that information. For the first time in my life I saw tears in my dad's eyes. To be honest I did not feel any sadness... Not because i did not like her, on contrast I really enjoyed spending time with my aunt. But Still I was the only one in the room staying ""rational"". My mom told me my aunt is going to have an operation on her stomach and I immediately asked if she got cancer. A few moments later I thought ""Wtf did you just ask. Are you serious?"". 

It was obvious and I did ask it anyway and my dad was about to cry. I stood up told my dad not to worry and wished him a good night and went to my room and just feel ashamed and guilty for being so stupid and rude. It is not the first time I was so  insensitive... Over the months I hesitated less to tell someone the truth in person even if they are really good friends.

Every single time we have an argument he posts about it on reddit and asks for everyone to agree with him to make me look dumb and wrong. since our relationship is public, with his hundreds of people who follow him, it makes me feel really insecure. He words all the questions so they HAVE to say hes right, and offers no story or context at all which especially makes me seem wrong. 

For example, today he told me that when we have kids he would bring them to the liquor store to play. Like 2 year old children to play in a liquor store. This literally pissed me off so bad that i didnt handle it like a mature adult at all. I yelled at him and called him every name in the book.

she’s always been kind of boy crazy and has always wanted a boyfriend, it’s been like this for 3 years and we’ve always just put up with it, but these past four months have been such hell in dealing with her. she sets herself up with guys who either she doesn’t like that much (but likes the attention) or guys she knows don’t like her, and interacts with them trying to get some kind of relationship out of it. Every time she gets a romantic interest she claims its love and that they’re soulmates, but just ends up getting her heart broken in the end. i don’t think she understands a healthy relationship balance either, which is why i’m scared if she does find a guy who likes her back he’s gonna take advantage of her naivety.

it’s just been very hard lately, as we can’t go certain places or talk about certain things as it will remind her of the guy she’s interested in and makes her sad. she has anxiety, and i think this stuff has just worsened it as she has literal panic attacks if she encounters any negative occurrence relating to her love life. it’s like walking on eggshells around her because you never know when the next catastrophe will happen and when we’re just going to sit in awkward silence while she sulks. 

it’s to the point where we (her friends) don’t really feel important to her anymore. she’s never happy with what we do for her, she doesn’t make an effort to talk to us, it’s always ruined by this. and we try to talk to her about it and tell her it’s unhealthy, but she says we’re attacking her or that we don’t give her enough help or we don’t care about her. i know as friends we need to be there for her, but it’s been three years! she’s incredibly stubborn and won’t listen to others advice, but she knows what she’s doing isn’t getting her anywhere.

This is coming about after a discussion with my boyfriend the other day. I agreed I would seek out therapy and actively work on this. However, after speaking with my insurance company last night after I found a few counselors I thought would be a good fit, I found out they won't cover the kind of counseling I'm looking at. I can't add another expense at this time, so therapy is now not an option unless I can find someone willing to work with me on payments, which I'm still looking into. I explained this to my boyfriend and he was understanding and is very supportive, but now I'm trying to find other ways that I can manage and change this myself without adding another expense and without just throwing my hands up acting like I tried.


I've tried to be very mindful the past few days of where my head is at. I've ignored reading negative news stories and I've let things roll off my back instead of focusing on them like I usually would. So far it has been a rude awakening as to how much I let things get to me, but it has helped.


I'm hoping to hear other suggestions to continue managing and actively change my mindset. I know it will be a work in progress for quite some time because I didn't get this way overnight, but I want to fix this and be a happier person. I've rid myself of a lot of toxicity in my life in the last year because I was tired of being so unhappy, and now it seems like I'm the last toxic one I need to find a resolution to. Negativity seems to spread like the plague and I don't want to be that person anymore.


Has anyone had success with self-help books with something like this? I love to read so I'm open to suggestions. Any mental notes I should take? Other things I should actively be focusing on (like forcing myself to stop focusing on something and think about something positive, etc.)? Any other advice is more than welcomed!

479,"Throwaway because the person I'm talking about knows my reddit account. 

How do you deal with a friend who constantly makes everything about them and has to be centre of attention? 

Normally, with people like this I just end the friendship and move on with my life, because I can't deal with narcissistic people, but this person had such a traumatic childhood and has such abandonment issues I feel ending the friendship would cause more issues for everyone involved. 

For example this friend got the shits because they weren't invited to one of their friend's wedding, they just expected to be invited, despite being told it was only a small wedding, they thought they were owed an invite. For weeks leading up to the wedding they constantly bitched and moaned about how this person ""mustn't be as good of a friend as they thought"" and ""how could they not invite me?!"". I'm sorry, but to me, a person's wedding is incredibly personal and they can invite or not invite whoever they damn well please. 

To be honest I don't blame them for not inviting this friend because they have a habit of turning other people's events around to be about them. The other week they went to a party and just started crying in front of everyone, so people were like ""oh my god, are you OK?"" And completely forgot about the person who was hosting the part, this friend saw nothing wrong with that. 

Then they constantly have stories about how strangers come up to them and tell them how gorgeous they are and they've been watching them from across the room and they can just tell what a beautiful soul they are, yet whenever I've been with this person, that has not happened once. 

I just don't know how to deal with it any more, it's getting harder and harder to bite my tongue, because I know if I say something, I'll be the bitch because this person has such horrible mental health issues. 

On the other hand, having those issues doesn't entitle you to be a selfish cunt and think you're the only one with issues, so I feel stuck.

Something makes me feel... well, inferior, or incomplete when I look at my friends and I see them all living their best lives, and I’m treated cruelly or unfairly for what I feel is nothing at all, or someone’s denied a friend request on facebook despite me really liking them - this stuff sucks ass and I can’t figure out how to take it in my stride. 

Or I try and talk to a girl at lunch in school and she just seems... detached, like she’d rather be talking to someone cooler or more attractive. And then someone who is cooler or more attractive comes along and suddenly she’s engaged with them. 

I just... feel so inferior. 

And then, I try and talk to new girls and I just can’t talk to them like I can a guy. If I say hello, they say hi. Where the fuck do I go from there? With guys they put effort in. They help.

I am a second-year university student and I am really struggling at the moment. I have an essay due in two days which I am pretty much done with, it just needs some polishing off but I also have this huge exam on the 14th. I have been trying to dedicate some time to the essay and some time to exam revision so that I have some balance. However, I am completely overwhelmed by this exam because there are so many topics and any of them could come up. When I study I get tired really quickly which leads to the amount I actually get done being very little. This also affects the amount of information I retain.

I see other students who can revise so many pages and keep going for so many hours and in comparison, I feel like I am super bad at studying. Last year my grades in this subject (I do a joint-degree) were really good but this semester I have been struggling slightly. Also, during exam time I also become super lonely and depressed. Everyone is busy, and I am either stuck in my room or the library. I've been crying. I am also a perfectionist so I obsess over things for a really long time which doesn't help.

I have been trying to find the reasons for my tiredness; whether it be stress or maybe I am lacking in iron (I am a vegetarian who doesn't really keep track of vitamin levels) but honestly, I think it is mostly just the stress.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has any advice for studying for exams, reducing tiredness or dealing with loneliness I would really appreciate it!

482,"I'm a natural extrovert, so this is extremely hard for me, especially because I've never been in this position before. 

I'm (18f) a university student and I have no friends. That's a little bit of a lie - I have two very close friends, but both live in different countries and although we speak daily, I can only see even *one* of them in person about twice a year.

I used to have a huge social circle about two years ago. Since then, circumstances have changed and I've lost contact one way or another with almost all of them. The ones I still keep in touch with, and see occasionally, live too far away and are too detached for me to really consider them *friends* any more.

Now I'm in a situation where I have... no one. No one to have a spontaneous cinema trip with, no one to go clubbing with, no one to just grab coffee with and catch up. I am super, super lonely. I'm incredibly thankful for my two online friends, because I honestly think I'd be about ready to top myself without them.

So... how do I make friends? I plan to join some societies in the uni after the Christmas break and try to make connections there, but what else can I do until then?

A while ago someone gave me a bottle of Valium, and they claimed that it could help me. I strongly dislike drugs that aren't marijuana though, and hard drugs honestly scare me, so I am very reluctant to try any. I worry that it wont do what I want it to do. How long does it take to kick in? How long does it last? How much I should take? Will it fuck me up? Will I still feel traumatized afterwards if it doesn't fuck me up enough? 

If I called the hospital to make an appointment and asked to be anesthetized would they say something like:

485,"Hi, first post on reddit :)

&amp;#x200B;

I became an engineering student this summer, applied physics and electrical engineering, and now I can't decide what my ambitions should be.

&amp;#x200B;

In my previous years of school I've had no issues at all getting good grades, at least when it came to STEM subjects. I never really tried that hard, but I seem to be able to understand mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology better than most people. Now that I'm in university things have undoubtedly gotten a lot harder, and I'm not sure what I should expect from myself in terms of grades and such.

&amp;#x200B;

On the one hand, I really feel like I could be one of the top students on my programme. If I were, I'd be able to study abroad at a highly regarded university, like Stanford, and probably get paid a little more at my first job. Most importantly however, I think I would learn a lot more, and I genuinely do love to learn about electronics, maths, physics and so on. That being said, I lack a lot of discipline right now, and as a result, I might not be able to get top grades in the courses I'm taking right now.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, I have a lot of things I love doing in my spare time. I play guitar and love to sing and cook. I like building stuff, I recently built a drone and am currently thinking about building a 3D printer. I honestly can say that I feel like what I'm doing in my spare time means a lot to me and I don't feel like I'm wasting my time like I used to when I was playing games on my computer all days. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what should I do? Should I try my very hardest to discipline myself to study 50 hours a week, get top grades, maybe go to Stanford for a year, but at the same time, sacrifice my spare time for it? Will it be worth it in the end?

&amp;#x200B;

My father sometimes tells me: ""Don't forget to be young while you're young"", I'm worried that if I try my hardest at Uni and spend all the time it would take, I'd miss out on things like playing in a band, building my own 3D-printer, writing songs, meeting new friends, partying etc. ",01Dec2018,1

I introduced my gf of 2 years and him to each other via Facebook a few weeks ago and they got to talking, which didn't bother me really. But lately I've noticed... they've been messaging each other every single day. None of the messages are explicit as far as I know, and she mentions me in conversation sometimes, but it gives me a weird feeling.

I mean she can talk to him for hours on end, sometimes even texts during work. I know she isn't physically cheating on me, but I still feel like their bond has become too strong and is making me uncomfortable.

490,"Okay, story starts a year ago. Both friend in question - Ann (19F) and I (19F) move into our college dorms. We meet on the first day since we were on the same floor and hit it off really well. Initially, we'd share stories about highschool and talk about light-hearted stuff so everything was cool. She told me that she was lonely in her senior year since two of her friends became closer and kinda left her out of stuff and so she was determined to socialize in college. I told her I was deciding to start afresh and thus don't talk to my friends from school anymore (nothing bad happened). First few weeks everything's great.

However, a few weeks later I noticed that she was extremely judgemental and snobby. She would constantly speak about other people's physical appearance, clothes, style, accents, religion, etc. And it would really bother me because I'm pretty open-minded and liberal when it comes to people's choices. However, I let it slide. I didn't really say anything to her because I don't have a confrontational nature and didn't want to start an argument.

Around a month later, a girl from the same city as her (they don't know each other) gets admitted to our college, I decided to introduce myself to her. We both went to her room and talked for a while. When we left, Ann starts rambling about her; nitpicking every detail and I'm just done with her at this point so I leave. A week later, I'm helping out this new girl with some coursework she missed out on when Ann takes me over to a side and tells me, ""why do you have to help her? You're not her mother!"" So now I'm pissed because you do not tell me what to do, I like to help people out and that should not be the problem. I storm off and we don't talk for a week. She comes to me one day and apologizes and says that the reason for her outburst was that she's scared that I'd leave her for the new girl (which tbh I was never planning to do). I tell her that was not my intention and we patch things up.  
A month later we get into another altercation - we had a presentation (group work), I was sleeping all day and she apparently knocked on my door which I didn't hear obviously - so she didn't talk to the other members about it. When I discover none of them worked on the presentation, I had to stay up all night to create it and work on everyone's parts. After this argument, we didn't talk for a while and that's when our relationship started to strain. We started to see each other less often. So at this point I thought perhaps she's done with me or maybe she's found someone else to befriend so I don't bother talking to her. Meanwhile, the new girl and I become close (completely coincidentally) - we have similar personality types and she doesn't backstab people :) - so i'm thinking everything's chill.

But it was too good to be true, a few months later I discover that Ann's been backstabbing me to her other friends and calling me a snake and all sorts of names, and went as far as to getting her parents to call my parents and tell them that your daughter isn't quite alright and she needs to visit a psychologist and that she cut off contact with her school friends because she's messed up in the head. I was **gobsmacked**, we were both 18 and it was beyond my comprehension how she could just go out there and ask her parents to talk to mine. This is none of their business. So after this, I just decide to cut her off completely - only to find out she's blocked me on Instagram. I delete her off of my Facebook and Snapchat and just don't talk to or about her anymore.

Sorry this is so long but I want to know if what I did was wrong, I feel guilty for ending the friendship at times whenever I see her around campus but also at times I'm glad that I got out of it. What would you do if you were in my place? Did I overreact?

TL;DR - I (19F) met a girl (19F) who seemed cool at first. Hit it off well. Slowly start noticing she's snobby, judgemental, rude and possessive. Break off friendship. Feel guilty when I see her around campus. Need validation if I did right thing.",01Dec2018,1

495,"I (16M) haven’t had a continuously great relationship with my parents in a while. Ive been on and off with them for so long now. I’ve been depressed for a while now and my life sucks in general.

So I’ve been in this paid basketball program since probably 6th grade, but I stopped going after the summer term. (This is the fall term right now). There are four terms a year, one for each season. Each term is 10 weeks, and once a week for 1.5 hours. The program costs around $300 (I think) per term. The current term ends today. 

So during the summer term, the people who ran the program told me that we would have an opportunity to meet a “famous” basketball player. (He is pretty famous don’t get me wrong). My mom is a big fan of this person and she told me to get tickets to meet this person. It was at a different place and it wasn’t really basketball related but whatever, she’d still get to meet this person. 

So basically, during the period that I sign up and receive the tickets, my relationship with my mom soured again. But before that she promised that she wouldn’t sign me up ever again if I got the tickets. I don’t really hate it there, it’s actually pretty fun sometimes. I just don’t have any time. I’m a junior now and in my freshman and sophomore year, I didn’t try in school so I did poorly. This year I actually started studying and whatever. I also have to volunteer every Monday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. I even stopped going to taekwondo (which I really enjoy) for a long time because I felt too stressed. I have gone there probably 5-10 times since the school year started.

Anyways I got the ticket, but I didn’t talk to her at all. If she wanted to go, she could go. Little did I know, she actually signed me up for the next term. I literally fucking said I wouldn’t fucking go if she fucking signed me up for anything, including basketball and tutoring. For me I think it’s such a waste of time. She says that she signs me up for basketball for my own good because I’m too fucking short.

So my dad brings this news to me. As you can guess, I don’t go because I have volunteering on Saturdays. They also have Sunday classes but I don’t go because I need to go to the fucking library to do school work since they don’t let me use any ducking internet at home. I have t been on the Internet at home since the start of sophomore year.

Now the term is about to end, my dad made a deal with me that, if I went to the basketball classes, he would let me use the Internet for as long as I want. This is a really tempting offer, but I don’t think I can ever trust my parents, they always manage to break my trust. This is why I always go to the library, for internet.  

Nobody knows how I’m feeling and there’s too much to write here. But I want to know what I should do. Cuz my dad was like just go for one more year, but I’m not going. He wants me to get the money back. He says if I don’t go, he’s going to never give me money anymore and take away my phone and shit. But that’s not the biggest problem. The biggest problem is that I know if he does I’ll hit rock bottom and stop eating at home again. 

So how should I go about this. The basketball thing. Like should I ask for my parents money? I’m pretty sure they won’t give it back because it’s been 3 months. They won’t let anyone go in my place. I don’t know anymore. Should I run away from home. ",01Dec2018,1

499,"Preface: I'm a 24M who's in a Master's program trying to use it as a stepping stone to get into medical school. The last time I was in a relationship was over 2.5 years ago while I was still in undergrad, and it only ended because I'm a fucking idiot.

So like I said I'm in this Master's program and have developed an almost creepily huge crush on a girl in my class. She's a little older than me [28F], but she's great. I can't find a thing about her that I don't like. The only problem is that aside from the usual ""how are you doing"" minimal conversations on the way to classes/in the hallways sometimes I hardly talk to her at all, yet I still find myself thinking about her all the time, and honestly it's kinda freaking me out.

I feel like a huge creep: I try to steal glances at her during lectures, and try to talk to her as much as possible without being weird, since for the duration of the program (about 3 months at this point) I haven't really talked to her on a regular basis. I've also found myself day-dreaming about her, and what us being a couple would be like, even though aside from the normal icebreaker shit (where you're from, where'd you go to school, etc.) I don't really know anything about her.

We were randomly assigned in a group together for our Humanities class at the beginning of the semester, and I feel like at first I was so focused on trying to succeed in class (since I've been out of school for over 2 years) that I wasn't really paying attention to anyone at all. But we have meetings every few weeks to talk about the books we've read for class, and during one of those meetings after our second set of exams (maybe 1.5 months ago?) I had an ""oh shit"" moment.

I can remember what she was wearing, how her hair was, even what earrings she was wearing that day when I really noticed her for the first time, and I remember thinking how beautiful she was and how I never noticed before. Since then I've been noticing little things about her that I find super attractive, and I want to talk to her more without it being weird that all of a sudden I'm paying more attention to her than usual.

The worst part is that I can't tell at all if she even sees me in the same way, because she's just a genuinely kind and sweet person who really seems to care about other people. She's the type of person that doesn't just ask questions for politeness, but because she really cares, and actually remembers the answers. I honestly can't tell if she acts different towards me when we do talk because she's just so genuine with everyone, and I really find that attractive as hell but also frustrating at the same time.

Mostly I feel like I'm scared. Pretty much every relationship I've been in, even if it was going great, I've ended up fucking it up somehow because I'm an idiot that makes bad decisions. At this point I want to just get to know her better, but I'm afraid that (a) it will come across totally creepy/out of nowhere, (b) she won't like me anymore when she finds out who I really am, and (c) that she already has someone I don't know about and I'm gonna get turned down. I've had issues with substance abuse (""only"" pot but it's still a huge problem for me) as well as a prior emotionally abusive girlfriend when I was younger, and I'm scared that not only will she reject me, but also that she won't even want to talk to me anymore if she finds out. I'd say at this point we're friends, but I'm friends with everyone in my class so that's not much to write home about.

I just really don't know what I should do. I'm ending up staying up way later at night than I want/need to thinking about her (fantasizing really, hence why it feels so creepy), but don't think I can bring myself to actually ask her even if she wants to hang out, let alone asking her on a real date, because I'm just so scared that she only sees me as a friend/classmate and will turn me down, especially given that we don't interact much at all during class, and hardly ever outside of class.

TL;DR - I have a crush on a girl in my class and it feels really creepy, and I'm afraid to ask her even just to hang out some time. I feel like I'm 15 again and I hate it.",01Dec2018,1
500,"This week I was kicked out of the gym I frequent. You may be now thinking I did something terrible wrong, like curling in the squat rack. But that was not the reason. I was just minding my own business on the bench press when it happened.

So I would start saying I am a college student and that it's a public university gym. As it's a government institution, in other words, paid by taxes, I would expect it to be free and open at least for the students. Yet there's a catch, I discovered that only certain students can use it, id est the ones that study on the sport's center as it's noticed on a memo at the entrance. 

But I already knew that, so this semester I happened to take classes in this specific center and I would have access to my university gym. Nothing to worry about I was thinking, but then while mid workout a guy questioned me if I am a student in the sport's center and that was the start of me getting kicked out.

Apparently I would not have the right to use the gym because I was not from the courses deemed worthy, even tought while discussing I mentioned I am doing extra classes so I should be able to use the equipments. I explained that obviously it makes me a student, because the memo does not mention only graduation students from this specific center, what would make me allowed and on the right, but as he was not willing to concede  I ended up leaving after him insisting that it wouldn't include someone taking extra classes. 

I believe I was kicked out without justification,  but after reflecting I don't agree at all with any of it and already sent a complaining to the university suggesting a change in policies to allow to all of the students, not only to the ones bound to one center. Still waiting for their response. 

I would like to know if it's a common practice for only some college students be able to use a public university gym and if I am being too demanding for suggesting that all students should be allowed. What would you guys do in a similar situation? I would appreciate some insight over the topic.",01Dec2018,1
501,"I have a coworker who has become quite the headache to deal with. This guy has \~30 years experience working at the same company his entire life (read: he's been doing the exact same thing so he is really good at it) while I am still early in my career. He has had a couple recent (before my time at company) performance improvement plans along with constant bad reviews over his career due to his behaviour problems ( absolutely no one likes working with him). He passes the improvement plans (which include a psychologist) because he temporarily cleans up his behaviour AND he has always been the only one capable of doing the job which is vital to the company (i.e. his job security). After his reviews, he goes back to his old ways. I know for a fact that he takes behavioural meds and his behaviour is like a roller-coaster; you never know what you will get for that day.

This is where I come into the picture. I am the first employee ever in the team who is also really good at doing the work. He definitely knows more than me due to his years of experience BUT I figure things out on my own without any assistance required (it isn't like he would be one to ""teach his replacement"", as he sees it). I have progressed to taking over a lot more responsibility to the point that I am now leading new projects (due to my knowledge and interpersonal skills..people prefer to work with me). He has definitely made working at this place difficult. For every single instance of me gaining more responsibility, he has tried to either undermine me, destroy my confidence, say a rude/dickish comment to my face, insult my skills in front of other (or behind my back), all while keeping up the facade that HE is still the ""master"" of this niche. The latest interaction between us involved him severely belittling my newly acquired responsibility because now it puts me as his full equal. I now no longer need him at all along with the rest of the team (previously I had to get ""approval"" from him before publishing...now I have ""approval"" power). He definitely is paranoid and sees all of this as the company's next attempt to push him out. I personally am a straight shooter, honest, and I feel like we all succeed if we work together as a team so I share ALL information with others (including him...even though he would never share with anyone). He may think I am trying to take over but I have absolutely no desire/motivation to push him out of a job since I want to keep on progressing up in the company (if he goes...who will do the work if it isn't me!?).

Initially, I had a really strong response to our first conflict followed by me reassuring him that I am not out to get him. I now realize that my responses weren't the right choices and this is NOT my problem to deal with.

At this point, I decided that I will only have professional conversations and anytime he says anything I will just act like he's a child and either ignore his comments or give smart-ass responses, depending on the situation.

Does anyone have any advice/suggestions on how to further handle the situation? And how can I stop thinking/stressing over the situation?

504,"The title says it all. I was sitting in class, minding my own business and eating hot cheetos. My teacher just walked over and told my friend, who was sitting next to me, that if he ever got on my bad side he could just buy me hot cheetos since they're my favorite thing. He just said this out of nowhere to my friend (I'll call him Jason). 

When I told my teacher it wasn't my favorite thing he started talking about (while almost yelling) how I eat them ""all the time"" so he couldn't understand why they weren't my favorite thing. I explained that I just so happened to have them in my backpack which was why I was eating them. 

Now,

I have said multiple times that hot cheetos are ridiculously expensive. Five dollars per bag isn't something that is affordable for me. I moved to where I live now only 2 years ago and it cost a lot of money considering I lived out of state previously. My family does not have the money to buy name brand everything and hot cheetos are no exception. My friends know this and because they're awesome, they buy me hot cheetos a lot. 

My teacher remembered that I said hot cheetos are expensive, so he said, ""so you just *happen* to have the most expensive food *on hand*? You must be loaded!"" To say I was unamused would be an understatement. I told him my friend bought them and that I was in fact, *not* ""loaded"". He ignored me. He just leaned over to Jason and instructed him to come to me if he ever needed money because I'm ""loaded"".

Honestly, I was pretty close to saying, ""your breath smells like whiskey, you must be loaded too!"" But because I'm a *humble person* I would never do that. Like I said, I'm from out of state. I lived in southern Washington D.C. for the first 11 years of my life, so I was raised to be paranoid and to not tell people how much money my family makes because we have been robbed before. I don't want people thinking I have a lot of money out of fear of being robbed again.

Next time he does something like this (which he happens to do a lot), I'm just going tell him that I think what he is doing is inappropriate and that I do not appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to HS very nearby this college town and most kids from there went to the CC nearby and then transferred to the nearby university or just went the that uni.

&amp;#x200B;

Alot of the kids I went to HS with were very rich and sociable and many are in sororities/fraternities here. I am transferring to this big uni from this CC next semester, but I'm not excited or looking forward to potentially bumping into someone I know down the road. College was fun when it started, but after getting alcohol poisoning at the beginning of freshman year, I am made fun of by the people who were there for being the guy who almost died and ruined their fun. I fucking hate my life, I don't want to do anything but smoke weed and eventually become addicted to stimulants. I hear that some people I grad'd with know about this incident. I hate how I get made fun of, I know I deserve it but I'm not planning on doing anything fun, meeting people or anything in college from here on out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just not cut out for this world; I can'tt ake responsibiliy for what I did' that's why I'm getting shit on. My fun for the next few years is finished and the people I grad'd with never really liked me anything. I've lied to myself my whole life and surrounded myself with anyone who ddin't treat me like shit because I just didn't want to be lonely. I'm finished living. 19 and I'm already looking at death.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't appreciate anything. I'm so ungrateful; why do I have to sit in this bullshit traffic when i can just kill myself instead? I'm so immature; I feel like if I met anyone who was there when it happened or, even worse, someone who wasn't even there who somehow knew what happened, I'd just immediately drop everything I'm doing, go home and OD on something. I don't believe in God, but if He's real, then I'm going to Hell forever. What a fucking asshole; I don't care. I've realized through this experience that the world isn't fair, but I'm not cut out to understand that. I feel like dropping out of society but killing myself seems rash at this point, maybe later I'll reconsider. 2018 was filled with laying in my bed, doing nothing. Once you sit around and do nothing forever, you're just stuck like that. I fucking hate talking to people or seeing anyone, espciayl someone I used to know in the past.  It went by so fast and life is only gonna get faster. Sometimes I consider living through this life doing nothing to see how bad it gets for me.

Too mmuch instantt gratification growing up. Doing nothing and beibg told I'm ""Responsib;le and smart"". I lied to myself believing these things. I don't have any vasic understanding of this world and I'm finished.

My girlfriend’s father was verbally and physically abusive towards her and her mother.  He also made sexual advances against her when she was less than 8 years old.  After they separated he got full custody of her and she witnessed more physical abuse against his new girlfriend, as well as being screamed at and offered alcohol and illegal drugs.  He has received jail time for several tangentially related offenses, though never for anything against her specifically.

She has depression and anxiety as well as PTSD, all of which were just diagnosed two months ago. While she has been doing much better with medication and therapy she still has rough periods lasting a week at a time, and sometimes she crashes hard and has to be talked down from self harm.  Her doctors have confirmed that this is likely due to childhood trauma, and once she disclosed the above info to them she received much better care.

First of all, how can I as her friend and partner support her when she comes to me for guidance?  I want nothing but the best for her but I have only experienced a short depressive episode myself so I only know a little of what she’s going through.  What advice is there for helping someone with depression, anxiety, and ptsd together?

Second, assuming she even wants to pursue this route, is there any action we could take against her father?  We have almost no evidence for anything that isn’t already in a police report somewhere, and that includes most of what he did to her specifically.

She is a pretty big dog lover and I am not. I didn't grow up around many dogs and I'm not allergic or a dog-hater/scared of them, but I've just never gotten comfortable with dogs. 

A while ago she brought up the idea of adopting a dog and toyed around the idea with taking on a larger portion of the rent (right now we're 50/50).

Then I make a pretty damn good friend at my retail job, we studied basically the same thing at different schools, have similar opinions on a lot of things, and when we dont, we actually have really intellectual conversations about it. She's become a person I can talk to about literally anything and get no judgement whatsoever. She even listens when I go off on nerdy tangents about video game lore, and remembers what I talk about! 

So I thought to myself 'this is dope, I finally have a friend out here.' I told myself I wasn't gonna catch feelings cuz I'm planning on moving back home in about a year, and guess what I did. Catch feelings. It hit me like a ton of bricks on my way home from work black Friday since we worked together for the first time in a while. But its weird for me, since this is the first time I'm genuinely attracted to someone based on what kind of person they are, and not how they look. (I had a habit of falling for pretty women and convincing myself that they're decent people.)

I know for a fact she doesn't have feelings for me, because honestly, who would? 

Anyway, we've hung out outside of work a handful of times, I've gone to her house to hang out a few times too. She calls me one of her best friends. Which makes me ridiculously happy and kinda torn at the same time. 

Another thing I should probably mention is that she's still hung up on her ex. She said that she still has feelings and kinda hopes they'll get back together even though he was a manipulative asshole who would make her feel like shit and then console her to make her feel like he's the only one who can make her happy. Which makes me furious because I hate manipulative people. She even said she was gonna hook up with him if he came home for Thanksgiving, but he didn't. Anyway, moving on. 

I've fucked up a few friendships by catching feelings and then telling the girl, which was no big deal cuz we were just friends because we spent a lot of time at the same places, so we became friends by coincidence.

I gave her 100% of me and more.  and it sucks because I still hold so many feelings for her. we broke up and got together quite a few times but it hurts because I know it's over for good.

After a couple times of frustration and asking them to help out more or to at least pick up their own stuff and not leave garbage etc. around the apartment my one roommate (let's say roommate 1) was very nice, understanding and apologetic. It was her first time living away from home and didn't really know anything. She has gotten a lot better and really makes an effort-I really respect that. My other roommate has proceeded to ignore all my frustrations and continues to leave a mess, not do her dishes etc. after months of being very nice asking to help out more or at least do her stuff, it has gone nowhere.

A few weeks ago she said she was going to get a cat and I said that it's not a good idea because I'm very allergic and it'll be a lot of cleaning (for me to do). Since then she made a ""chore chart"" where alternate chores each week (her trying to prove that she can clean and convince me to yes to the cat)...

The first week her chore was to clean the floors of all the common areas. I was home all day and she only did the kitchen and bathroom... not the living room or any of the hallways. I didn't want to fight with her since we've already been fighting about many things like she steals my food and baking things. So I simply added on the chore sheet ""including living room and hallways"". She then sent a picture of this in our group chat and was super pissed off saying she did it (even tho I'm 99% sure she didn't.) and if she did later when I was gone I still don't trust her for obvious reasons. so instead of arguing with her I simply replied ""ok"". She proceeded to send long messages insulting me and my other roommate saying stating specific things that we didn't clean well enough and all the things she cleaned (that one time... when I already do all of those every day). This started a big fight and I tried pointing out to her that there's a lot of things that she is still doing after I've asked so many times to help out with.

After this I told her I'm no longer to be super nice and baby her, I'm just going to be honest, straight up and direct. One example is when she leaves her dishes in the dish rack for days/ weeks and just stacks them to make a mountain and then expects me and my other roommate to clean up after her. the other day she did this again and as always, there was no room for me to put my dishes. I very respectfully but directly messaged her and asked to put away her dishes before piling them up and letting my other roommate and I put them away.

She, as usual, ignored me and let my other roommate do it all. The next day I said (since I cannot change her behaviour, I will just change mine) I will find a new solution which is buying another dish rack. This obviously really upset her because that night her boyfriend and cousin (her only two friends and complains she has no other friends) starting harassing me saying that I'm bullying her and she has depression so I should just suck it up and do her chores and that this is HER apartment (which is not true we all pay the same rent and are all equally on the lease) and then said that this harassment from them I brought upon myself because I'm bullying her etc..

I didn't even know what to say I was baffled-- I had never said a mean word and only ever called her out on her shit when she started having a meltdown after we asked to uphold her responsibilities. After I explained to her boyfriend and cousin the real issues and that it wasn't personal, but that my roommate should come to talk to me in person if she feels like I'm being unfairly mean to her, the cousin apologized and said it was a misunderstanding, but the boyfriend continued to harass me for 2 days. He was saying that this was all personal and I hated for some reason (which wasn't true until now... now it is personal) and continued saying that I'm just angry cause she's not giving attention or thanking me for doing all her stuff. This is not the case, she has been unfriendly since day 1 and I just accepted it cause I didn't want to be friends with someone like that. I explained that I was not seeking gratitude but I wanted equality, respect and effort which she has done nothing of. I further explained to them (after multiple times them bashing me for being upset over her stealing my stuff and not doing the dishes) that it is not these small things that are really upsetting me but it is the overall principle. Stealing is stealing no matter how much and that loses my trust. Living with someone who is this immature, passive aggressive and who I cannot trust- THAT is what makes me angry. He continued to say how much I was hurting her and being mean to her for getting about these things.

This whole time I was very straightforward, honest and tried really hard to be respectful and asked to speak in person instead. After 2 days of this, I finally got fed up and admitted that I don't like her attitude cause she is non stop complaining about her life, that she has no friends, how sorry she feels for herself and that she thinks everyone should do things for her. I then said that due to this harassment from them and her overall attitude that she thinks the world owes her something it has now become personal.

I told him I was going to block all of them cause I'm a full-time uni student and I work and have my own life and problems and couldn't handle this immaturity. He then he accused me of ""running away"" and ""not facing the truth"". Like wtf?! what truth?? The simple fact is that asking respectfully and directed my roommate to uphold her responsibility is not bullying her and she needs to start to do her own stuff. I eventually blocked him but I have been at my boyfriend's house for 2 days now and I honestly don't feel comfortable going home. Every time I come up with solutions she gets offended and sarts a big fight.... like this. How do I handle this?!",01Dec2018,1

I’ve talked to 5 managers at my 1st job and none of them will help me..? They removed my name from the schedule and nobody has contacted me? 
So after 2 weeks, I went in and said wtf? So my manager who does the schedule said that she lost the availability paper that I gave them....... okay.. so at this point I’m getting pretty mad. I talked to another manager above that one, and he didn’t say anything helpful.. 

At my other job, they have worked with me 100% so no issue there, and I even told my 2nd job manager about the issue and they said that’s crazy and to keep them updated. 

So I went in to my 1st job last week and gave them my availability and now they updated the schedule.. and I’m off for another week :( 
What do I do guys? Please help me..

536,"I'm an 18 year old male college freshman and as the title says, I've been rejected by every single girl I've talked to &amp; never had a gf. Ths is my first semester in college and I basically tried to hookup with a lot of girls because I was not thinking properly and assumed college would be the best time for this. However, I was wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Back in high school I got rejected by every girl I've spoken to and the reason for that is because I tried to become their friend first and they didn't realize that I liked them. My problem now is that because of this, it started lots of drama because those girls spread rumors and word got around which created a bad reputation for me. I go to a university which is nearby the area that I grew up and went to high school around so I'm extremely afraid of trying to ask out girls around here in fear of drama starting up. As for my appearance, I'm not really sure how attractive I am or anything (can send pics in DM if needed).

&amp;#x200B;

There is this one girl that is friends with a friend of mine here that I think is very cute but the problem is that she most likely knows about my history. This is because one of her friends is a girl that tried to hookup with me in the summer because she said I was cute (I was completely oblivious to the hints she was dropping and later said ""I think we're better as friends"" and completely ghosted me after).

My question is: what is the ""correct"" way to approach a girl and minimize chances of rejection? And also, how do I get over my fears of all of this? I'm seriously thinking of taking a semester off from school to intern somewhere out of state just to get somewhat of a fresh start.",01Dec2018,1

540,"Hi all -

Thank you for reading! When I was 24 (I'm 27 now), I moved away from my family and started a new job in California (from Philadelphia to San Diego). It was an awful decision because I am an only child and my Dad passed away when I was young. My mom was re-married and my Stepdad is now on drugs and no longer living at home with her. The job was exactly what I wanted in a place I had always dreamed of living. I always had a very strong feeling of guilt for leaving my mom alone and it has kept me from being truly happy and settled in California, even though I really enjoy my life there. I now have a boyfriend in California who I love and who supports me in whatever I do. This past September I was offered a job as a consultant - working in Philadelphia where my Mom is, but with all travel/expenses covered so I was able to go back and forth between Philadelphia and San Diego as much as I wanted. Although I was comfortable in my job in San Diego, I took the role so I could be in both places - Philadelphia with my mom and San Diego. It was physically exhausting and unsettling going back and forth -  but I was able to keep everyone happy this way and had less feelings of guilt. It is now December and I am being laid off of this consulting role because the company is in ""extreme financial hardship"" and cannot afford to pay consultants. They offered me a full-time permanent role in Philadelphia, which would mean that I need to permanently move, and make less money. My boyfriend is open to moving here with me, but I do not truly love it here. I could also get my job back in San Diego. I love the culture of the west coast - camping, hiking, traveling, the weather, etc. I feel so bored on the east coast, especially in the winter. So now, yet again, I am at a crossroads and cannot make a decision in fear of hurting the people I love and feeling guilty in the process. It's almost like I do not know what I truly want anymore because I've spent years trying to please other people. I really dislike Philadelphia, but could consider living outside of the city in a boring suburb and commuting into the city every day. I've also considered living in places closer to Philadelphia than California, but I haven't had the time to explore. As for my mom moving to California with me, I am nervous about doing that because CA is really expensive and I cannot financially support her at my age. She expects to live with me in CA and at age 27, I just feel like I am too young to commit to that. I feel like either way I lose, so I really have no idea what to do. I could collect unemployment and take some time to think about this - travel around the country trying to find somewhere closer, but I just feel like an unsettled wreck at 27 years old. Has anyone else had a similar situation? What did you do? Any advice would be amazing! ",01Dec2018,1
541,"I went out on Thursday night. I got very drunk and it is normal for me to lose all memory after getting very drunk. My friends found me alone on the streets while going home. My friend last saw me making out with a guy. When she was going home no one could find me. Some girls found me on the street at some point and took me to the subway station and gave me their phone to call a friend but I just called a friend of a friend who didnt know how to help, but got this info from them. The girls lost sight of me and assumed I took the subway. My friend told me she lost sight of me at about 6am and they found me at 7:30am. I had had my period until wednesday and after being home and showering I had some light spotting. My knees and arms were dirty and I have bruises on my knees- The thing is that Ive gone to the streets by myself before, I have gotten on the ground drunk before, and all of this while being drunk and nothing has happened to me. Thats why Im not sure if something actually happened this time. Im scared. My vagina didnt hurt, My clothes were perfectly put together and my friends were certain that if I was raped I would remember it and I would have my clothes torn or something. They convinced me not to go get checked if I was raped and not to take the day after pill because it was a lot of trouble and they were sure nothing happened. I cant go get tested unless I pay like 150€ cause Im a foreigner in Madrid but Im scared that something may have happened.

542,"Something I struggle with for a long time was being alone. This year I became 25 and had my first relationship for about six months I was at a point where I had to give up on meeting anyone. I have broken my own heart so many times over and over.  I worked hard getting myself in shape, and at the time I was focusing on me in life no one else. We met work and things just happened. She made a move on me. It didn't start as a like a relationship. We were more like friends with benefits, but we fell for each other. I never felt more happy and complete in my life. But because of various reasons and because I instead respect her privacy we couldn't continue that relationship. Now I feel like I had everything all of the things that made me whole feel ripped apart from me. I gave her 100% of me and more. It sucks because I still hold so many feelings for her. We broke up and got together quite a few times, but it hurts because I know it's over for good. She told me in the end that she couldn't give me what I wanted and without going into her personal life details and I get where she was coming from. She said that there was someone out there for me. But I feel this universe is very indifferent. No one is owed anything at all. And I already see that she's looking for someone else or is with someone else. That's something that hurts because it's happening in front of me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 25 5'3 straight male, and I feel very insecure about my height. I have been told I'm good looking at times, but I don't know if people are just nice or they are playing me. I used to be on the heavy side, but I worked hard to improve myself and have come a long way. But even with everything, I have done to improve myself. I have an incredibly difficult time approaching a person I have an interest in feelings for. I still feel like I have so many things holding me back. And After finally having a blissful relationship and experience in my life, even though it was a short live relationship I guess I feel anxious about never meeting someone again. I'm scared that ill never be able to approach someone or that someone will never approach me.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I shouldn't dread about being alone or needing someone, but I loathe to have someone see the person I am and be able to have someone that can look beyond the outside shell that we all project. Someone that could break my walls down and I theirs. Someone with who I could press my forehead against and have that meaningful human connection. I hate this empty feeling recurring within me, slowly swallowing me a whole moment to moment. But I don't want to give up. I want to be able to put myself out there, and meet someone. I don't fear rejection its more that it never seems like the right time or the person appears uninterest or just feeling like there are so many things holding me back or that I will be ridiculed. It just feels so impossible While I feel like I can figure many parts of my life out, I fear ill be alone and never feel that connection again, its the one thing that burns my heart and lets my tears flow. My thoughts can't seem to wander away from this subject no matter how hard I try. I'm seating in tears hoping someone can answer if you can please.",01Dec2018,1
543,"I found out today that my girlfriends ex boyfriend has been showing people nude pictures of her (mainly to people she knows) I found out from 3 of my friends today who are friends with him, me and him are own decent terms I guess I’ve never really cared for him just because of how he handles himself

Anyways what I’m asking is, do I need to take charge and tell him to delete them? I’ve talked to her about it and she said she’s asked him before to delete them and he won’t do it,  but personally I think if i were to ask him as a guy, he would understand and would delete them (or at least stop showing people so I wouldn’t find out)

I asked my GF and she says it’s up to me, just not to make it “a huge ordeal” she says it is really embarrassing tho especially because he’s showing them to people we know. (Idk if age matters but we’re a around 20)

544,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm not sure where to begin but I guess I'll start. Because of my OCD, (Pure OCD), I have a tendency to remember things from a long time ago and feel really bad about myself/over-exaggerate the thing that happened. I'm trying to remember this as best as I can, but today I happened to be watching videos online and somehow I remembered something that happened with my now-ex girlfriend over a year ago. At the time we were in bed watching a movie right after having some ""fun"" and I can't remember how or why but I just put my right hand over her breasts to play with them. She got pretty upset at this and moved my hand off her body. I can't remember how the rest of the night went but I didn't try to touch her like that again, and I think at the time I understood on some level that what I did was wrong. A few weeks later she graduated college and we broke up cause she moved halfway across the country. 

&amp;#x200B;

For some reason I remembered this today and I feel so bad about what I did. I had no right to just grope her like that. I can't remember exactly how or if I dealt with it back then but I feel really bad about this. Am I over-exaggerating? How bad should  I feel? This has been bothering me all day and I just needed to talk to someone about this.  ",01Dec2018,1
