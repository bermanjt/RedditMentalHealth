1,"I’m a girl and I’m not gonna say my exact age or anything because it’s really not important but, for the past year I’d say I’ve had multiple boyfriends+girlfriends all at the same time. They never know about each other and I’m really cautious to not get caught. Even if i did get caught though i don’t think I’d care, me not telling them is me helping them because if it will hurt them I’m not going to tell them. An important thing to state here is that they are all long distance relationships. Usually from different countries. This usually doesn’t really make me feel shameful about myself and i don’t really feel anything until recently. I don’t want to admit it to myself but i think it all started after i got cheated on by my first real love. I used to be such a good loyal girlfriend. I couldn’t even look at other guys and feel an ounce of anything. Now it’s like everybody i see can be my newest addition. I’m starting to flirt with people i don’t ever find attractive and i notice i might have genuine feelings for somebody but once they are busy or go to sleep I’m onto the next. At this point i don’t know how to stop. Do i come clean? Or do i just ghost them all? I don’t know what to do or how to stop and it’s starting to consume me because I’m playing all of these innocent wonderful people and I’m starting to become who i hate most. Thank you",05Nov2018,1
2,"I’m a guy I work at a football stadium and 2 guys came up to find their seats early on and one put his arm around my shoulder while the other pointed his camera towards us and I swiftly moved away as his arm rolled off me as I hate cameras etc, he then said something to the 2 guys I was standing  with and they all laughed a bit (I didn’t hear what he said) he then put his arm around my shoulder again and said ‘you’re a decent looking lad but the way’ (he was looking down to floor with a serious face while saying it) he then said to the 2 guys I work with ‘I bet you trust him, he looks a trustworthy guy him’ then he just asked me about the game and what I think the score will be.

4,"Okay, so this dude installed new pressure tank. When I asked him to tell me (before he began work) what I'd be paying for, he said the tank itself, plus the labor, + the cost of the brass T. I asked him the price for the two items. He told me, I said sure. I asked him how much time he expected it to take, he said an hour. They did the job in less than an hour. I watched the whole time. He used some tape and putty and that's about it. 

I get the bill. They charged me for 2.5 hours of labor (he worked for 50 minutes) and they charged me an additional $325 for ""fittings and accessories."" All in, installing this pressure tank is coming to $1235. It's obscene and unfair. 

If they do not give me an itemized breakdown of the ""fittings and accessories"" and if they refuse to charge me for the accurate hours worked, do I still have the pay the whole amount? Or can I pay for the tank, the brass T, and the accurate labor? Can they place a lien on my house or take legal action if I don't pay the whole bill? ",05Nov2018,1
5,"I met this girl when I was admitted to hospital earlier this year. She was admitted a week earlier and we pretty much connected straight away. We used to talk for most of the day and I always made an effort to see her. I was discharged a couple months ago and I have been to see her (and one other friend) once and she was so excited to see me (as I was her). She is a special girl who has a lot to give in the world. 

I was planning to go and see her this week and she suggested to go and see Halloween in the cinema which is a really interesting choice, but made me believe she definitely has an interest in me. I have an interest in her and definitely want to ask her out on a date, but I am just worried that if she says no then our friendship will be ruined. I don't wanna be interpreting these signs wrongly. 

What do you think? I have had a few crushes in my past but have never asked anyone out before. The friendship we have is one I definitely want to keep because it definitely helps me deal with my eating disorder and I haven't met a girl like her before.

6,"Hi everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'll try to keep this short, hopefully while still being clear haha. Basically...

I've been best friends w my bf for 6 years, and we've been dating for a little over 4 now. When he was 17 or 18 his mother passed away from cancer. About a year or so later his dad met a new woman and they soon got engaged. In April this new woman his dad met really pushed for the family to move away and closer to her own family, so my bf was kicked out. He's been living with me now. Obviously, his family life is very stressful. This woman seemed cool at first, but it seems like she's controlling, mostly because she pushed for the family to move and kick out my bf. Another recent instance that shows her controlling character is when her dog was about to be put down. My bf really loved and cared for that dog even more than she did (she did nothing to prevent this dog from needing to be put down btw), but neither she nor his dad told him that they were doing it. He only found out about it just MINUTES before the dog was about to die because his grandparents called him to wish condolences. She hates me too for some reason, which also affects us because it affects how his father perceives me.

Anyway, this family stress is really starting to seep into our own relationship. He can no longer hide the stress and has no outlets for it. He does not open up to me about it in a constructive way. All the information I know is either from him drunkenly ranting, or because my attempts to have a discussion with him made him mad enough so some information slips out as he yells at me. Because he's so worn thin, more and more often he'll blow up on me for minuscule stuff that absolutely doesn't warrant being yelled at. For example if I ask him to bring his plates downstairs or roll up his guitar chord so I don't trip on it, he throws a tantrum. Just the other day I was CONTEMPLATING going to Chipotle after school and asked him what he wanted in case I went, and I decided to not go bc I was exhausted, and he blew up at me but later apologized. Another way this all affects him is if he's given the opportunity to drink a lot, he'll take it. If we go out with friends to barhop, he's usually not able walk in a straight line within an hour.

The thing that gets to me most though is if I open up about my feelings and try to talk to him about stuff he does that upsets me, he absolutely loses it. Yelling at me, telling me to shut up, slamming his fists on the bed, just overall thinking I'm attacking him instead of listening to me. It gets nowhere. He'll usually apologize for it, but it means nothing because it happens again and again. 

A month ago he revealed he was going to see a therapist, but today I finally found out he decided not to. I really really want him to go. I think he needs it. I told him I was really proud of him and happy for him that he decided to go, and urged him to follow through with it. He just refuses because he says they can't help him. He gets mad at me when I try to bring it up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do anymore. We're such a perfect match for each other, but his family is truly putting this to the test. He doesn't listen to me, he just uses me as a target to yell at. His family life affects our relationship because it puts so much stress on him and he winds up taking it out on me. He obviously carries great grief, but he just won't see a therapist. I don't know if there's anything I'm doing wrong, anything I should also be doing, or if I just can't do anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Tl;DR: Bf has a fucked up family life and it's constantly stressing him out to the point where he takes it out on me verbally, so I'm constantly stressed and it feels like we're crumbling. He refuses to open up about his issues so I have to piece together his life by little bits that slip out. He won't see a therapist despite contemplating seeing one a month ago. Is there anyway I can get him to see one, or do I just have to hope he comes to his senses? Is there anything else I can do about the situation?**

&amp;#x200B;

Other important info:

He used to have a somewhat bad alcohol problem as a way to destress from all this but I was able to get him to only casually drink on weekends. Sometimes he'll lose control of himself and get absolutely plastered in less than hour though. 

He used to sleep for hours and hours but it's also gotten better. There are some weekends though he won't get up until 1 or 2. He told me he sleeps to forget about all this.

7,"Its pretty long, but i really need the advice.

I was convinced to be a player in chess as part of a inter-school sportsfest between other schools in my province. They knew that I play because some classmates knew. but I know they wouldnt even cast a glance at me if they didnt know I play chess. They told me the team would lose without me because they lacked players. So I agreed.There are two of us in the team and we were asked to go to a place about 1 hour and  a half away from my home.

I didnt know where that place was so I went there with a classmate who knows how to get there.

When we arrived I saw my classmates there, but Im not close to any of them for they have their own groups. My only friend there was the classmate I went with to the meeting place and he has a game later on the afternoon.(we arrived there at about 10 am and his game started at around 2 pm) 

While my friend played his match I thought I would get to play as well, considering that they had a hard time making me agree to play for them. Only to find out that they let my other teammate play the entire games the whole day. While I just sat on the sidelines, thinking that I just wasted the day away in a placd Im not famillar with and with people I barely know. I am very antisocial and awkward so I felt like I was the odd one out thinking that I went out of my way to go here only to find that Im just benched.

I felt humiliated and sad because I believed that they thought I wasnt good enough to play. So at around 4pm I convinced my friend that we should leave.

After a  few weeks, this morning, a classmate messaged me and asked me to play for them again, only that its a championship game because my other teammate wasnt available at that time. Im really confused on what to do, should I accept or not?


Summary: was convinced to play for the interschool sportsfest as a chess player only to be pushed in the sidelines for the whole day. Weeks later they message me again to play because the other player couldn't make it.

8,"Okay, I want to preface this by saying that I know that this is a really, really long story with a lot of components, so I’m going to break it down into bullet points. I know that this is long but i just really need help, please.

So this all started in kindergarten.

- me and this girl, who we’re going to call Janey, are in the same class
- I think Janey is super fucking cool and i want to hang out with her, but I’m stupid and intimidated so we never talk 

- Sophomore year of high school, we have art class together
- We finally start talking 
- She’s going out with a guy named Aaron 
- I find out that she always wanted to get to know me 
- since I never talked to her she thought that I didn’t like her
- She tells me that she discovered last year that she has a genetic disorder that will result in her death by the time she’s 50
- We start hanging out a lot
- Like, a lot a lot
- Like to the point we’re most days after school I just go to her house instead of my own

- Beginning of junior year, we don’t have any classes together and Janey and Aaron have been going out for the past year
- Janey tells me that her and Aaron never really clicked, but they were both lonely and wanted affection, so they gravitated towards each other 
- Aaron was never really the affectionate type, all they ever did was fight and bicker, they never even went on a single date
- A few months into the school year I confess to Janey that I’ve had a crush on her since we were kids
- She says that she feels the same way, but wants to wait just a little bit longer to break up with Aaron to make things easier for him
- We never really have any physical contact. No kissing, no holding hands, nothing. I think our knees touched on accident one time
- Flash forward to January, me and Janey have been keeping that we have a thing for each other a secret for about 4 months now, she still haven’t ended things with Aaron
- About halfway through the month she says that she doesn’t have feelings for me anymore, and breaks up with Aaron
- We still try to be friends, but it isn’t the same, things are weird now
- She gets really mad at me for basic shit and i get the sense that she wants me out of her life
- So I stop hanging out with her
- A few weeks later she attempts suicide
- She lives, and while she’s in the hospital she reconnects with a guy who we’re gonna call Corey. we both knew in middle school but fell out of our lives
- He’ll be important later
- So it’s around the middle of March, and me and Janey have minimal contact
- Me and Arron have graphic design together
- Bond over the fact that Janey cut herself out of both of our lives
- We become really good friends
- Like, best friends
- hang out all the time, play in the same PS4 party almost every night, etc
- This girl in my graphic design class just went through a rough breakup, we’re gonna call her Sam
- Me and Sam start talking 
- A week later we’re going out because I haven’t felt affection in 3+ years, and I’ll take what I can get at this point
- We don’t agree on anything politically, shes shitty to her friends, shes actually a racist, etc, but I convince myself to try and love her

- 6 months later, senior year has started, me and Janey have art together again 
- We start to reconnect and I’m really happy to have my friend back
- I realize that 1. I still have feelings for her after all this time, and 2. that Sam is a very controlling, jealous, shitty person that I don’t want to be with anymore
- I end things with Sam
- Find out that Janey still has feelings for me
- The reason she shut me out and made me dislike her was because she didn’t want to hurt me when she attempted suicide
- She tells me that her and Corey have been fucking because she just needed someone to be with
- (Corey is fucking gross too, he’s super narcissistic and only ever wanted to be with Janey for the sex. he sexually assaulted her on several occasions)
- Corey is in jail right now for breaking parole and having LSD in his possession

Flash forward to now. Corey is in jail and tried to kill himself a few days ago. Aaron, despite how he acted when they were going out, really really liked Janey, and talks about how he still has feelings for her almost every day. She wants nothing to do with him. She’s tried blocking him, ignoring him, everything, but every time she does he threatens suicide. Sam is fucking pissed at me for ignoring her all the time, because I don’t want anything to do with her. 

Janey is the only person that I want to be with. She’s the only person that I’ve ever truly wanted to be with. Ever since I first laid eyes on her, it’s only ever been her. She’s told me that she feels the exact same way, she’s always had feelings for me, but nervousness and empty relationships and shitty exes have always stood between us. She’s the funniest, most charming, most beautiful person that I’ve ever met in my life, and it hurts my heart that we’ll be hurting everyone else so much by going out. I love Aaron like a brother, and I don’t want to hurt him, but it’s almost been a year and he still isn’t over it. He’s so obsessive and paranoid, and he already suspects me of trying to be with Janey. His parents are going through a divorce right now, so that doesn’t help our situation. He’s threatened suicide on several occasions, and I wouldn’t want this to be the thing that drives him over the edge. I’ve tried convincing him that he isn’t in love with Janey, because they regularly treated each other like shit, but instead that she’s in love with the idea of a relationship, but he disagrees with me. Sam is a real, actual crazy person, and is beyond angry with me. I don’t want her in my life at all, but I wouldn’t want this to make her want to hurt me or Janey. Corey get out of jail in about a year and a half, so we don’t have to worry about him for a while, but he’s had a really, really shitty life. He treated Janey like shit and I hate him with every fiber of my being, but I think Janey was the only positive force in his life, and I wouldn’t want him to kill himself either. I just don’t know what to do. 

Janey and I have wasted so much time, and I don’t want to waste another second. She has a limited time on Earth, and I want to spend as much time with her and make her happy for as long as I possibly can. I don’t know what to do. We’ve thought of everything that we can. We think that’s we’ve considered every option, but we are very open to any option that anyone can think of. We’re so desperate to be together, but neither of us wants to hurt anyone. Please respond to this if you can offer any advice at all, we’ll take anything that we can get.",05Nov2018,1
9,"I grew up being told by my dad that women that mess around are whores. He’s fine with me going out and fucking girls but he says ones that have already had sex aren’t good for anything else except fucking

I’ve thought like this for a long time but recently I met a really great girl, she’s nice, funny, and has an amazing body. We had sex last night but she REALLY knew was she was doing and she said she hasn’t had sex in “so long” (which to her was 2 months). so I automatically assumed she was a hoe. How do I switch my mind to know that sex is a normal thing and that the amount of times she’s had sex doesn’t change anything about her

15,"I'm not sure if the title is relevant to me, mainly because I am at a point were I do not understand how I feel. I don't feel sad, I don't feel happy. I just autopilot life I guess you could say.

&amp;#x200B;

I am sorry for this post, and if I ramble, I'm not sure what to write, so I feel like mentioning everything is the best approach. I have also never spoken to anyone ever about any of this stuff, especially my feelings, and I don't feel like I have anyone who I can speak too.

&amp;#x200B;

However, now about me. I am from the Uk \[M17\]. For the majority of my life, I have been alone. At least I have felt this way, never had many friends, and any that I did have, I was never super close to them, it felt more like an acquaintance. From a young age, I got into video games, beginning from a PlayStation 2 as a birthday gift. Since then, this has been a very big hobby of mine, and something that I only have nowadays. I'm currently in college, in my second year studying a level 3 in ICT (Game Design).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure how to describe what I want to say, because I am unsure what it is I feel. I have had my problems growing up with anxiety, I'm not sure if this is the correct term for it, so correct me if I'm wrong, but I was very self-consciousness. I believe this is the main reason I have struggled to make friends, however I also just never met anyone with similar hobbies growing up, like I just didn't know many people who played games. The only thing I had going for me was the fact I was good at football and really enjoyed it, so I had a friendship group around this.

&amp;#x200B;

My main problems came about last year. The friendship group I had, I fall out with. Mainly because I didn't get along with one of them, and all of them seemed to follow this guy. He would start talking shit to them about me behind my back, and the others started to feel very two faced. So I moved on from them, these guys where pretty much my only friends, other then just people I knew around secondary school, but I was never close with, I would just speak with them time to time as we were in the same class etc. This was very close to my GCSEs. So I focused a lot on my exams and moved on from these guys. Come July, this is the point that has kinda had the biggest toll on me. As it was the point I was the main witness to a stabbing which happened right outside the door of our house. This was a new house my father had just moved into, my parents are separated, so I tend to spend time with each of them. I felt very guilty for this guys passing, I called my dad first thing, rather then an ambulance, I never called the ambulance. The guys friend did after some time. I'm not sure if I should go into more detail on this, if you are interested I don't mind speaking about it. The experience also has had a large impact on how I act outside the house, I am always very cautious now, looking around me a lot and avoiding anyone I find suspicious. I'm not sure why, I wish I could explain, but I don't know how to put it into words. Lastly, my dog passed away. This was a dog I had for nearly all my life, got him for my 2nd Birthday, he was put down in September last year due to just being ill and having heart problems. I had never lost anyone before, I my dog was the closest thing to me.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this has had a toll on me, and I think has influenced the way I am now, and my mind set on things. I feel like I'm a burden to a lot of people, and I have never had a good relationship with my parents. I am a very secluded person, and not being close with anyone, I have never spoke about this stuff. I just bottle it up and move on, I don't know any other way. Playing games are the only thing I have going for myself, I gave up football. My college course is the only thing I'm working towards at the moment, I finish the course next year, my dream is to simply work at Riot Games, the creators behind the game I spend most my time on. This is the only thing I'm motivated towards.

I'm not sure what I am trying to achieve with this post. But I was just reading through posts on here of problems people have, and it made me want to talk about myself.

19,"Started liking this girl I volunteered with at an animal shelter and we became pretty good friends. We talked the whole time we were together and flirted &amp; I’m pretty sure she likes me. She eventually stopped volunteering because school got busy for her so I don’t see her in person anymore. We hung out one time a week after she stopped volunteering and it was great, we walked the river, I put my arm around her when we sat down and she rested her head on my shoulder/arm and smiled &amp; we talked for a couple hours, &amp; then went to dinner. We agreed that we had a great time together &amp; we agreed to hang out again the next week. So here’s where things get confusing. I text her like 5 days after our hang out, &amp; she’s responding super quick &amp; is super engaged. I had to go to work so ended up not texting her back that day, but texted her 3 days later to ask her if she wanted to come over that weekend and watch a scary movie with me. She responded quickly &amp; said “aw I already have plans :(“ so I texted her asking when she was free and she said “good question.. maybe Saturday morning” &amp; then I texted her 2 days later to ask how Saturday morning was looking and if we were hanging out &amp; she said “quite possibly I’m sorry it’s taking so long to figure out” &amp; then I told her not to worry about it and then the next day she texted me to tell me Saturday morning wouldn’t work because she had dance recital. I told her cool no worries &amp; to hit me up if she wants to hang out some other time. She didn’t respond to that &amp; that was the first time she didn’t text me back so I was like whoa am I missing something does she not want to hang out again, did she lie when she said she had a great time the first time we hung out. So then 3 days later she texted me to tell me something I posted on my Snapchat story was really funny and I told her thanks but was confused on why she’d comment on my Snapchat story but not tell me if she wanted to hang out again. So then I got super insecure about this for like 4 days and didn’t text her until I decided that I’m overthinking and that it’s not that big of a deal. So I texted her yesterday a video of something I saw that made me think of her.. and of course she took 5 hours to even read my msg but she instantly replied after she read it &amp; was super engaged and thought it was hilarious. I then told her how it made me think of her and she sent me a :) &amp; told me the song “happier” played on the radio that day while she was in the car (which is basically our song) &amp; I told her how I made a video singing happier but didn’t send it to her because I was embarrassed &amp; she told me next time to send it to her and I said I would and then she never responded. So my concern is that we haven’t seen each other in 3 weeks and our texting conversations are rather short and recently they typically end with her not responding which irks me because I always like to be the last one not to respond lol. But I’m wondering should I just go ahead &amp; ask her to hangout again or should I keep trying to build attraction over text and warm her up to the idea of hanging out with me again since she seems to have lost interest a little bit. Also would a text like this be okay.. “hey I like you a lot but I’m not too sure if you’re feeling the same. If you’re not interested it’s totally cool but just be honest with me &amp; tell me so I can move on” ",05Nov2018,1

The guy clearly targeted me because he took a picture of my license plate after slashing two tires then left and came back 2 minutes later and slashed my other two tires. My car was the only one of about 30 parked along the side of a road. 


I’ve already filed a police report but haven’t yet gave the cops the videos a friendly neighbor gave me. I’m thinking the guy got the wrong person or I unintentionally triggered him. What makes me more confused is that he was shown walking around with his daughter near my car earlier. (He probably lives in the area with his daughter and wife). Any advice is much appreciated.

I have been smoking for over 10 years now and my children are getting worried about my health. I use smoking to calm my nerves when im stressed even though people say it does the opposite.  I feel more relaxed after a smoke break. I only smoke a pack every three to four days, so i feel like im not that bad of a smoker. I have also quit other habits really easily, like drinking mountain dew,alcohol, gambling, but i am having a hard time with smoking. I have tried the gum with no effect. Right now i have asked my girlfriend to ration them out to me as 5 for 5 days 4 for 5 days 3 for 5 days and so on. When i run out for the day i dont know what to do. I had 5 extra meals last night and i know that it is not healthy. A lot of the people i know of that quit gained a lot of weight. And i dont want that. I am at 185 pounds right now and am currently stuck at home for medical reasons. 
Is there advice you guys could give me to help with the stress and not gaining weight with my situation?  I would really appreciate it.

tl;dr : My indoor/outdoor black cat Toothless went missing the day before Halloween, and showed up again the morning after Halloween showing signs of torture. After taking her to the vet, he told us her backleg needed removal and gave an absurdly high quote for it.

UPDATE: Thank you to everyone who offered to spread the word, donate to her, or offered advice. That evening, I sat down and read all your comments and took everything into consideration and decided to go ahead with Toothless's life saving surgery. We managed to look around and find a non-profit animal clinic that could do the operation for cheaper. She's down a leg, but she'll hopefully make a recovery soon and relearn how to get around. And to all you guys telling me she should be an indoor, dont worry, she most definitely will be after all this.

I have absolutely no idea what I want to do career wise but I have a few ideas I'm considering one is the army. I currently work full time which I don't mind the job too much. The pay is decent and my co-workers are nice. But I've always been a little drawn to the idea of joining the army. The problem is I'm not sure someone in my situation could, since I am taking out student loans currently, because I can only pay some out of pocket. Would I even be able to join with having student loans? Not sure how that would work. Also, I wouldn't want to wait to try to join after I graduate, but I'm not sure how being a full-time college student I could join. Do schools accommodate you if you did decide to join, is there any option to just take a break from your degree while you were completing basic training? I did some research and saw that there is an option to join the reserves part time and you could still be in college. Please if anyone has any insight on this it would be greatly appreciated. Also, another thing is I am currently in a serious relationship with someone who is currently in the army. But if I did make the decision to join I know from further research depending on what MOS you get, you don't exactly get to pick what base you'll be stationed at. He is probably going to be deployed sometime next year in the summer overseas, so I don't even know how if I did decide to join in the future how our relationship would even make sense who knows where we would both end up.

37,"(If this is better suited to a different sub let me know)

I (24F) mentor a 14yo girl through my work (we'll call her Eva). We get along and she seems to look up to me. 

A month or so ago we were chatting and I asked what her plans are for post-high school graduation. She mentioned that she wants to go to a college ""*very* far from home."" Of course I found her emphasis suspect and asked why she felt that way. Long story short, she eventually revealed to me that her 17yo brother (we'll call him Jay) is physically abusive to her. She did not describe it in detail, but told me that he hits her and that there is no sexual abuse involved. She claimed neither of her parents are abusive. However, for some reason the parents won't believe Eva about the extent of the abuse she is suffering (they basically believe that it's a normal sibling relationship and that Jay is a bit of a bully). For the record, I've never met the parents or Jay.

Does she want to go to the police? She doesn't, for fear of tearing apart her family. Will she confide in a trusted adult at school? Probably not, because she doesn't feel comfortable sharing this info with most people and doubts they'll be able to do anything. Eva claims she just wants to ""wait it out"" since Jay is about to graduate and will then move away.

I made it very clear that she can call me anytime and I'll come and pick her up if needed. 

Fast forward to last night, 10pm Saturday. Eva calls me sobbing and asks if I can come and get her because Jay just choked her and she's too scared to stay in her house alone with him (her parents are out for the night at the local casino... -\_-) 

Of course I hopped in the car and got to her as quickly as I could. She requested that I park in a specific spot that couldn't be seen from her house. When I got to her, she described what happened (through constant tears):

Eva: ""It was so stupid - I had a bag of chips and he said he wanted them - I said no because I bought them for myself and he grabbed them out of my hand - I grabbed them back and then he hit me, and then choked me. He always makes it so that there are no marks so he can't get into trouble.""

Me: ""So this isn't the first time he's choked you?"" 

Eva: ""No! He always acts stupid like this, he can be so stupid.""

Me: ""Eva, this isn't just him being stupid. This behavior is violent and completely unacceptable.""

I dropped her off at one of her friends' houses nearby, checked in with the friend and made sure Eva could spend the night. Eva thanked me profusely and told me (again through tears) that no one had ever done this for her and that it meant a lot. She said her parents would only come get her ""after they've finished what they're doing."" Basically she's never had someone that she can actually count on. 

I texted her this morning and she's doing okay - back at her house and her parents are home. I guess Jay won't do anything in front of her parents and otherwise Eva avoids him as much as possible. 

I told her that next time we're together (which is this Tuesday) I want to discuss what we can do to make sure she's safe. She agreed to that - and that's where you all come in.

I've tried my best but I'm no expert with this stuff. Eva doesn't want to go to police and as far as I understand, wants to make as little a scene as possible (she lives in a pretty small town and is quite shy too). Clearly she doesn't want to go to a battered women's shelter or anything of the sort - she wants to stay in her house and live as normal a life as possible. She's just a kid! I don't know what the next steps are - but I want to make sure this girl can feel safe. I'm also concerned that Jay will abuse other women - Eva might be safe when he moves away, but then who will his next target be? 

Any advice MUCH APPRECIATED. Especially before Tuesday (11/6)!",05Nov2018,1

42,"So I (f22) came home today and accidentally caught my dad (m67) masturbating to porn. Now I’m not one of those people who has a vendetta against porn or anything, and I realize that everyone has urges. I’m cool with all that. I was scarred for a few hours after this happened, but that’s not what’s concerning to me. What’s really bothering me is that he specifically asked me not to tell my mom. She’s overweight and very self-conscious about it all. She’s said to me before that as she gets older she is all too aware that she is becoming less and less desirable. It also might be worth noting that the woman in the porno was skinny.

The idea of being dishonest to my mom really doesn’t sit well with me, even if just by omission. I also don’t like the idea of covering for my dad, just because this is a really intimate secret that I’m not fond of keeping at the moment.

Basically today my dad told me last night that he and my mom were talking about my high school experience and she was literally brought to tears (bawling her eyes out!!!) over the fact that I haven't had a serious boyfriend yet (I'm 17 and a senior). Apparently she wasn't even planning on telling me about this and I had to hear it from my dad instead of her. She thinks I'm somehow socially stunted because I've made the personal decision not get involved in a serious relationship yet. Keep in mind she's one of those moms who tries to relive their high school years through their children. She did some wild shit in high school (AKA cocaine and horse tranquilizers - yes you heard me right horse tranquilizers) and dated around quite a bit, so me being the goodie goodie student I am isn't quite how she imagined her daughter to be in high school. Don't get me wrong, I'm not some kind of hermit; I have a decent social life and go to parties and shit, I'm just careful with who I hang out with and where I go to keep myself safe because there are some dumb ass people at my school who do stupid shit. So anyway, she's now somehow worried about my social life because I haven't dated any of the immature boys at my school who half the time only talk to me to try and get their dicks sucked. What really pisses me off about this is that I've devoted everything in me to being a daughter my parents can be proud of - I have a 4.6 GPA, am applying to Ivy League schools, I've been lead roles in school drama productions, make my own money with my own jobs, and have 300+ volunteer hours going onto my college apps - and somehow this isn't enough because I don't have a boyfriend???????

For the last year of my life I’ve faced a lot of health issues. For 6 months straight I was nauseous, dizzy, and in pain every day. I ended up in the emergency room twice and urgent care over 10 times, I even had an endoscopy and no one could figure out why this was happening to me. Because I was sick I ended up losing my job but I had already moved in with my boyfriend and he was able to support us both. The whole time I was sick, every time I updated my parents on my health, they just brushed it off and peppered me with questions about when I’d be going back to work, and reminding me that it’s a really good job that I can’t lose. They both implied that I was faking it because I wanted to be lazy. Eventually I stopped answering their calls and texts because I wasn’t able to give them the answer they wanted, I was focused on trying to get better or find the cause of my issues. I told myself that once I had a diagnosis, I’d respond to my parents so I could explain why it was I wasn’t returning to work. 

I have to include that my parents and I have had an extremely rocky relationship. I’m physically disabled (cerebral palsy, I basically just walk with a bad limp) and my parents never babied me because of it. I struggled really hard with depression and suicidal thoughts in high school, but my parents don’t believe in mental health issues really so they never took it seriously, and told me I was just lazy and awful and trying to get back at them for something. They’re both very controlling and hard-headed people and have never been very supportive, except financially. The way I see it, they did the best they could raising me with the knowledge they had, but things would’ve gone a lot smoother for everyone if they had done some research on my disability and the side effects that come with living as a disabled person. I’m certainly not saying it was all their fault though, I’ve lied to them a lot in my life. For example, they were under the impression that I’ve been taking community college classes for the last 2 years, I showed them photoshopped grades and pretended like everything’s been great, when in reality my legs couldn’t handle walking around the campus 3 days a week and working the other 4. We had an agreement that they would pay half my rent as long as I was in school, and since I lived in San Diego I couldn’t survive without their help, but I also couldn’t survive without working and they make it clear that moving back in with them wasn’t an option. I was too scared to tell them I stopped going to class and didn’t know what to do so I just kept lying. 

I don’t have a very big family, but they’ve all tried to contact me in some way since February. I didn’t respond to anyone until my birthday at the end of August, I said thank you to my dad and his girlfriend for wishing me a happy birthday, and told my grandparents on my dads side that I’m okay. My mom didn’t say anything for my birthday, but emailed me 2 weeks before telling me that if I wanted to stay on her insurance, I’d have to let her know by October. (I never worked up the courage to respond and probably screwed myself out of insurance) 

At the end of June, I moved to a different state and didn’t tell them. They found out through a family friend (my best friend’s mom happens to be my moms best friend) and let me know that they knew. My dad said something along the lines of “I hope you find your happiness, but i don’t understand why you couldn’t just be honest with me.” 

Since I moved, my health issues got better almost instantly. Every 2 weeks or so I have a nauseous/headache episode, but it’s nothing compared to the hell my life used to be. I believe my issues were mainly caused by anxiety, and now that I’m hundreds of miles from everyone and everything that caused me stress, I feel a million times better.

 I’ve been doing pretty well, my boyfriend and I are renting a 2 bedroom house with a yard and we have 3 cats and a dog, and I’m genuinely happier than I’ve ever been. I really want to be able to share this with my parents, but I’m really scared to make contact at this point. It’s been so long, I know I screwed up really bad, they found out about the lying about college, and I’m worried they’ll see me as a failure since I don’t work and don’t plan on going back to school anytime soon. I’m worried that they’ll decide they don’t want me in their lives since they don’t agree with my decisions. I’m their only kid, but we’ve never been that close, and I know they have absolutely no trust in me. If I do reach out, how should I start? Do I send a long apology, or just start by saying hi, or catch them up on how I’ve been, or do I just wait until I have something to tell them that they can be proud of? 

If you read my whole story, thank you for your time. ",05Nov2018,1
54,"We usually play basketball everyday however winter weather is forcing us to use an indoor gym. The only close indoor basketball court to us requires a membership cost of $43/month, which isn't an issue for me but it is for my friend. I'm willing to pay a portion of his membership cost so he can afford it (he says willing to pay $35/month). 


My only issue with this are:

1) How do I bring this up to him?

2) Would he feel comfortable with me helping him out financially? The total cost would only be like $40 as we're only using the court for 5 months.  

3) Would me paying a part of his membership have negative consequences on the relationship?

57,"Alright to prodvice some context:

I started a full time position and I would like to think that I make decent money. However, it hasn't been decent at all. I got this position to pay for my credit card that my parents maxed out, which was $1000.

My parents, were asking for a little bit to help out when I got this position. I fully understood that I wasn't in school and I need to contribute. But then it started getting worse. My mom asked me to get a loan out for her for about $2500. I didnt have too many bills so I agreed. They also threw in the gurantee that they wouldn't ask me for more money.

(I had gotten a new phone about 4 months into working and my dad put his phone on the same line as mine, he said he was going to pay for his half but I end up paying for both lines which is about $150 monthly, getting back to the main point)

A couple of months go by and then I have a talk with them. Another situation has arised with them and on top of me paying off the loan I need to give then $150 EVERY WEEK. Meaning over the month, I would be paying about $600. 

Now, I'm pretty much broke and whenever I try to save up money it gets eaten away by the bills I have to pay or my mom or dad asking for money for all the bills that they have to pay. I understand that they got a lot to pay for, like lawyers(my mother got divorced not too long ago), phones, food, etc but I feel as if im spreading myself too thin for them. I feel as if I put their well being before my own, not only with the money but with my future as well. I am practically going to a completely different field of work for the sake of my family instead of what I want to do.

I understand that my folks care but with all this shit and all the money they owe me at this point, I feel as if I am trapped.

Fast forward a month and we get moved to different shifts so I end up adding her on Facebook and we talk like none stop for a week solid, one day after talking to her for a couple hours I asked what she was doing and she said waiting for her boyfriend to get home from his trip. 

Turns out that whole week he was gone. And the next week she only texts me during her shift hours and very sparsely through the evening when I work. Okay so this makes me think she's not into me more then a friend.

2 months ago I have 2ish shifts a week I work with her and we always talk and make each other laugh. It seems to me sometimes she will go out of her way to talk to me or will follow me to the cafe to chat even if she's not getting anything. 

Now I don't really believe In going after a girl that's taken but sometimes It really feels like she's into me. And I reeeeealllly like her she's so unique and has a lot of qualities I have been looking for in a girl. 

So what should I do? I've been thinkin about telling her how I feel or asking her if she likes me as I am going to be starting a new job in 3 weeks so we would no longer be co-workers. Is that a bad idea? If not how should I go about it.

69,"So let me put this in context. I'm 18 years old living with my dad. My dad has anger issues. He gets mad over mundane things. Today we went to go out to eat and my dad forgot his wallet. He asked me and my step mom if we had our cash on us. We didn't have enough on us so there was nothing we could do. He blamed the entire situation on my step mom and me. When we got home I noticed he went straight to my room. He usually goes into my room to check if it's clean. My ps4 and tv is on the floor because I don't have a drawer to put it on. So I was just gonna leave them there for a temporary moment until I find a place to put my stuff. My dad doesn't care. He kicked it to the side and started complaining about how messy my room is. (There was no mess just the ps4 and the tv). He then PROCEEDEDS TO MAKE AN ACTUAL MESS and takes pictures of my room to show ""everyone"" how messy I am. I kept cool while genuinely feeling every bone in my body being filled with anger. I told him that me living with him isn't working out and that I'd rather just move out. I was planning on moving in with my mom. She was the one who got me the ps4 as a gift. It was brand new. That was THE ONLY thing I didn't have to work for. The rest like clothes phone and service Bill's ect. I pay for them. So I cherished that thing. It's the only thing that kept me sane living with my dad. It sounds ridiculous but it's true. Soon my step mom was speaking on behalf of my dad and begged me not to move out. To give my dad another chance. My dad apologized and promised to buy me another ps4 (that's most likely going to be used).I couldn't help but feel guilty. I'm stuck in a limbo to where I don't know what to do. This isn't even the first time that my dad has done something like this. He literally kicked my door and broke the lock just to get inside my room and complain. I now have little to no privacy. And every time I remind him of how much I don't wanna be here, my dad and step mom guilt me into staying here. I love them, but I can't stay. The problem is that they don't want me to go, and I know that if I leave, my dad would be emotionally unstable. And it pisses me off on how he treats ME out of all kids. My sister's constantly argue with him, and only visit him to ask for money or any financial help. And once they finish fighting with my dad, they leave me with an angry middle aged man and I have to pick up after the havoc they've caused. Living here has gave me the result of suicidal thoughts inflicting pain on myself and constant moments of genuine depression. I don't know what to do.

70,"So I will try to keep this short. I’m going insane.

I come from a family of 4: mom, dad, sister (14), and me (20). I still live with them. In 2016, we decided to rescue a husky puppy who was in terrible condition around Christmas time. Keep in mind, at first I said no because I know how my parents are with dogs who shed. Prior to this, we only had one dog and she was 6 at the time. Also hypoallergenic. Anyways, the puppy grew up and over time started to shed. He wasn’t and still isn’t allowed inside the household but our other dog is, smh. Our dog ended up being the best gift ever because as a family we were going through heartbreak over a family member. Our dog is 2 now. And the responsible ones are my sister and I. However, I have to clean their shit up, feed them, bath them, and still try to take them out for a walk. My sister is always saying no no and no and gets extremely furious to the point where she cusses me out. I try to keep my temper down but sometimes I want to beat the shit out of my irresponsible sister’s ass. Lately, she’s gotten on my nerves. She made a fit because I picked her up from school where my parents normally don’t pick her up. I made her walk home because I refuse to allow someone disrespect me and I value my self worth. The dog situation is getting crazy. It’s gotten to the point where I refuse to feed the dogs and pick after them unless she does it and she reluctantly does. I haven’t even taken the dogs out for a walk in months! And I do notice that the dog (the pup)is getting aggressive. We’re always getting in heated arguments because she doesn’t want to do shit. Right now, I got irritated because I took her to a friend’s party last night. She had permission but it was all a lie! My parents weren’t home and I trusted her. And it’s a constant thing I do. I seem to trust her but deep down I’m expecting change, idk. Anyways she was never allowed and there was an argument at home and she began to blame me for being the one taking her and giving her permission. Right now, I know the dogs are hungry. I told her if she doesn’t help out with feeding them, I’m giving them up for adoption. She said I DON’T CARE. She even cries when my mom says the same thing. That’s another problem, I want the dog inside and my parents don’t. Then they say shit like “well you wanted a dog”. I go to school and work and she also goes to school. She’s on her fucking phone what seems to be 24/7. She does nothing productive at home, never cleans up after her fucking shit too. I’ve even had a talk with my parents and still nothing works with her. My parents are always like “J do this and J do that” and I’m like “why can’t G do it?” and they’re like “G never does anything”. Like what the fuck, it’s so true but I’m not gonna do every fucking thing. The household needs change. I’m deeply heartbroken about the dogs too but I think it’s best to put them up for adoption if the owners are always into their egos and clashing with one another and not caring for the dogs. Also, I’ve told my mom to get my sister into therapy or something because she’s a compulsive liar at times, lazy, and has anger issues. She slams doors, locks herself, and cries when she doesn’t get her way. She can’t fucking grow up. I really want to take that phone of hers. My mom is constantly threatening too. Even I think she’s a narcissist. Anyways, I need advice. I’m torn. If anyone read this, thank you!",05Nov2018,1
71,"Earlier this year, a theatre actor I follow on Instagram was having a charity drive. He was a little short of his goal with less than an hour left, so he posted that anyone donating a certain amount of money before the campaign ended would get a backstage tour of the show he is currently in. I adore this show, and while the amount was a good bit more than I would have donated otherwise, this was absolutely worth it to me and so I did it. He offered no guidance on how this tour would be distributed, so I assumed he'd just be keeping an eye on his DMs.

Cut to now. I haven't had a chance to take him up on it until next weekend. This past Wednesday, a week and a half out (I wanted to give him a decent amount of notice), I send him a friendly DM asking if he's free for the tour next weekend, along with something like ""my name is GooGooGajoob67, you should see it on the donor page"" (wanted to offer him a little something in the way of proof without getting too businesslike). When I hadn't heard anything, on Friday I commented on the original, months-old post where he first mentioned the backstage tour, with ""Hey, don't know if you got my DM, was wondering if we could set this up for next weekend - let me know! :)"" or something like that.

Still nothing as of now. Since I'm not a huge IG person - is there any way he wouldn't have seen the DM or the comment? I think DMs can go to a hidden inbox if they're from someone you don't follow (right?), but the comment? Don't you *always* get notifications for comments? Thought about tweeting him but my Twitter feed is pretty much just sweepstakes entries so it might look weird. Also taking it to another platform feels stalk-y.

I'm just not sure how to proceed. I've never been in a situation like this. Getting a tour under duress because I wore him down would ruin it for me, so I'm hesitant to push too much if he *is* trying to blow me off. My current plan at this point is to watch for him to make a post sometime midweek-ish, and then to comment something friendly and unconfrontational similar to what I commented on the original post.

A week or two ago, there was a rumor circulating my school that one of our newly hired teachers has been sending nudes to/inappropriately texting a student. My friends and I just believed it was a dumb rumor spread by underclassmen (I’m a senior).

One of the more cool teachers heard my friends and I talking about this rumor, so he asked about it and asked where we had heard it. I told him where we heard it, and that was that. The next morning, he came to me and thanked me for telling him where we heard it and that he notified the principle and some sort of action plan was put into place for the rumor if it were to ever start again. 

Flash forward to now. Last night, I went to a huge bonfire with some friends. There was a lot of underage drinking and smoking, that sorta thing. Including me, I drank some. I shouldn’t have. I honestly shouldn’t even have been there at that party because I’m on a sports team and I could get kicked off easily if someone were to snitch on me. But my captains were both there partaking in it, so I’m not worried about getting caught.

Anywho, one of my friends got wasted and told me that one of the new female teachers has been texting this sophomore guy (and possibly others) as late as 1am. I dunno. 

A teacher texting a student seems weird to me. But she’s also been texting the sophomore about other teachers and her relationship issues. This is definitely inappropriate as it seems almost predatory.

But then the rumor about a teacher sending nudes to a student comes into play, and I don’t think it’s too unreasonable to assume that she’s the one who the rumor could be about. 

I’ve thought about telling the cool teacher who asked my friends and I about the rumor two weeks ago, but I’d risk getting myself (and my friends) into big trouble for being at that party.

74," 

So let me begin with a little bit of context as there is so much I can't add due to time. So last year was my first year of college and I had become best friends with an individual in my major and me and he soon built a bond with another girl within our major and grew somewhat close. However, I was never as close as they were but at the end of the day, we always seemed like all good friends. I'm going to fast forward a year to my second year of college; I'm no longer that close with the individual I said was my best friend; however, I grew closer with this girl. We smoked with each other occasionally, at times she would get pretty flirtatious, but at the end of the day, we both saw different people constinently over the last two years. However, I started growing feelings for her and we grew closer but to me, it seemed clear that she wanted to stay just as friends; let it be known that I have done incredible favors for this person that one would rarely do. Flash forward to present, I've had an incredibly tough time getting over this girl and additionally I feel as if she has grown feelings or had some previous thing going on with my former best friend this whole time ( I know this all sounds like some petty college shit); additionally, she told me the other day that she was upset but couldn't, and would not, no matter how much I urged her to, tell me but all she told me was that she and him were fighting and that she couldn't give me context about till after graduation (Mind you that is two years away) and I'm the type of person to overthink everything; why is that something is that secretive to where you can't tell me about it until post graduation then she continues to tell me that he is her best friend etc etc. I'm only 20 years old and I don't do well with feelings of jealousy and confusion like this situation has put me in. I know there is a ton of context I could of probably provide so feel free to ask. Essentially, I feel like incredibly embarrassed for trying to pursue this and somewhat angry because I feel very used with this person for favors on a day to day basis, but she claims to be there for me through anything. \*Note i have never been forward to this girl about my feelings because I always felt it would backfire\*.

I have an older friend there that I trust and love(platonically - she's like family to me) very much, and can stay with while I attend college and get a degree. I am not afraid to take risks, and I have a really strong feeling I'd be so much happier there because I would feel more accepted as a person. 

I don't live with my parents, and see them often but neither live a lifestyle I want. Dad is an alcoholic(but not abusive) and has heart problems. Mom can't stay out of jail for more than eight years. Both can barely take care of themselves. 

 I was raised by my grandparents, both in there early to mid 70's and they are getting older, weaker, and sicker. It's incredibly lonely living with them, and being out of high school. And I love them, but old age and poverty have taken a toll on them, and me as well. 

I don't feel happy here, and it's so tempting to just up and leave them behind but I would feel terrible for it. People say family is supposed to be there for you, but I don't know if I can be there for them anymore. I feel empty around them, but not around friends. 

They seem to be taking okay care of themselves, even if we're low income. But I guess I feel obligated to stay. They argue a lot, and this is what worries me. If something happens to them because I wasn't here, I'd feel horrible.

77,"So I got accepted into the nursing program. Today, I sent an email withdrawing temporarily. It is to be noted that orientation hasn’t started and I just turned in my acceptance letter on the 31 of October. 

The reason I withdrew was financial and personal. It’s just over $3000 a semester and I know there are options available, but my school doesn’t accept student loans. If I wasn’t able to get financial assistance there is no way I could pay for the 5 semesters out of pocket immediately. And I don’t want to ask my parents to foot the bill (even though I’d be paying it back). They have enough going on. 

On top of that, they also require a little over $300 in pre-class exams and checks that weren’t outlined in in the application class, so I feel like we’re bombarded with so called “hidden expenses”. 

The other reason I withdrew was personal. I know for a fact I wouldn’t pass the drug test that would be administered this Friday. I smoked a joint like 2 weeks prior. It was supposed to be a surprise test, but I know current students. I take full responsibility on that part and I know it was irresponsible to do. There is no defense, but in mine I was stressing out about outside factors. 

I’ll be reapplying next semester, but I feel like I’ve taken a backwards step in my journey. Did I do the right thing?

He moved out when I was in middle school to live with his girlfriend, which he still lives with. We've been close but never super close, like him and R were. He used to do alot with R but never me. They'd go camping, concerts, laser tag, and more. I used to get really envious of them.  R used to hang out with me, not as much as him and N, until he passed. 

In high school, before R passed, my family moved about 40 minutes away from N. R would always get a ride to N from our dad since they worked together. I can't drive yet and neither can N. I can get a ride down but most of the time he doesn't have the time for me. He plays dnd every weekend with his friends now, so he's always busy on Saturday. His girlfriend will drive him up here on a Sunday once in a blue moon. Then he'll only stay for an hour or two then leave. Typically because his girlfriend will act like shes having a terrible time.

I'll often mention things for us to do together, like play dnd, go to the movies, or just hang out. Those ideas often get shot down as he says that he has plans or doesn't have the money to do it. Every single time. 

It's been very difficult for me to not have a brother to hang out with since R passed. I've tried explaining this to him and my parents tried too. He doesn't seem to understand this. 

He typically spends Christmas eve and day with us, which is really nice because I get to spend alot of time with him. He says that he can only spend a couple of hours on Christmas day because his friends want him to spend eve and Christmas day with him. Its probably stupid of me to get upset but this hurts my feelings. He knows how much I like spending time with him during this time of the year.

I've asked other people about this but only got responses like ""No one likes to hang out with their sister"" or ""Well there's an 8 year gap between you and Him"".

I've tried explaining it to him but he doesn't understand. I'm upset that he doesn't seem to care about my feeling. I only have one brother left and he doesn't want to be around me. It's like he doesn't care. Does any have any advice because I dont what to do.

79,"Okay so, I was introduced to a guy over social media through a friend but he goes to another school. I posted about the World Series game (I’m a Red Sox fan while he’s a dodgers fan) he messaged me and said “stfu” we continued arguing and it got to the point where he was genuinely mad until I decided to cool down the fire. Yes he did say sorry, he just loves the dodgers too much. We continued talking for about 2 hours but the conversation was so stale.

81,"I live in a small apartment only one neighbor to deal with but man he’s a weirdo even the landlord agrees. Initially I felt pretty good moving in here a couple years back but rapidly over the past two years I’ve started to feel uncomfortable about my privacy and peace of mind. 

His apartment windows are all taped down not a shed of light can enter. He’s got a security camera. He’s always home for holidays and usually there all the time. So I’m sure he uses reddit so I won’t be too specific with details

Never bumped into him for two years when he moved in. Never had any issues either until he caught on that I knew he was my neighbor. He has always avoided any chance at interaction. Which is fine with me I’m a pretty private person myself but his behavior is really odd like he’s up to something and doesn’t want me catching on or maybe I’ve just been weirded out to the point where I’m paranoid now.

 I observed that if we were arriving at the same time to the apartments he would stay parked in his car and would wait to get out until I left. Other times he would arrive to the parking lot and drive past around the block to pretend he was going somewhere and not parking to go to his home. Few times I’ve been sitting in my car and he wouldn’t notice me. As soon as he would realize I could tell the panic in his mannerisms. He’d pretend he left something in his car, check his trunk, check his tires, just to avoid walking past me. I’ve caught him spying on the other neighbor as I was walking home one time. Peeking his head over their fence. He dashed away into his home when he saw me. 

Now I’m sure you’re wondering what did I do but the answer is nothing.. honestly... I try to keep the noise down when I have a friend over. I don’t blast loud music. Hell I don’t even flush the toilet if I hear the shower running on his side, well now I do cuz fuck him. Never complained about him to the landlord either, that is until the landlord told me he was having legal issues with him. He’s complained about my cooking that the smell finds it’s way through a hole into his kitchen. Never could find this hole. Never got a complaint until three years in which was even weirder. In the past year I’ve found my internet line cut one day, window cover bent, and consistent banging on the walls from him. 

My worst fear is that he’s spying on me. I don’t have evidence but I have reached the point where I hate living here. Moving seems like the only option. Has anyone experienced a similar situation with their neighbor and have any insight?

83,"Reddit, I had to make an anon account Bc my friends follow me on my main. 

I’m a 19 yo male and I’m a tough point in my life where I don’t know what my next move is.

Senior year in high school was the first time I ever experienced a close family death. It was one of my grandfathers and before I could even think about mourning and grieving, the passing of my other grandfather shortly followed later that same month. I didn’t know how to handle these emotions and blamed all my dark hours on my relationship of 2 years and without thinking I broke up with this girl. Weeks later I realized it’s not at all what I wanted and this is when my anxiety and depression really grew. I had anxiety attacks in school and stopped showing up because I was scared to go and be “alone” and have more attacks. I finished out the year the best I could. 

I was too scared and not ready to start college and took a gap year and just worked year round living with my parents and siblings still as there is a community college in my town. 

I eventually went to see my doctor and a therapist for my anti-depressants and for counseling. My first medications made me have the darkest hours of my life and I had to switch. Second prescription works wonders for me. However.

Attending college this semester started well, but I’ve never been a very motivated student, and after about 2 months I stopped showing up and eventually dropped out. I told my mother I have to get out of this relatively small town and want to attend Uni next semester with all my buddies. 

That’d be great except, I have a very poor GPA due to my lack of motivation and I doubt I’ll ever get accepted into Uni. I don’t want to continue to live here but I have so much passion for computer science and wish it as a career choice.

I never asked to be put on this planet and be forced into the burdens of growing up and being individually successful. I don’t want to be here but suicide has never been an option. 

TL;DR, I don’t want to be alive all that much because I can’t hold myself accountable for responsibilities. I don’t trust myself to finish college with motivation and and committing not alive has never been an option for me. What do?",05Nov2018,1

85,"Hi, I'm new to this subreddit. I hope this is an appropriate question: How do I stop being resentful?

I'm a 22 y/o male and feel like my life is slowly falling apart. Up until a year ago, I was studious, goal oriented, focused, and content with my life. Then, after a rather brief sexual relationship (my only one), I have this deep sense of emptiness and resentment for my ex.

I became heavily depressed after about a month of seeing her (I don't really understand why), and I think this played a large role in why we broke up. But she also hid a lot of things about herself from me that came out later in seeing her (promiscuity, drug use, etc.) and I have somewhat reliable leads indicating she cheated on me. When we split, she knew I was having mental issues, but she took the liberty of telling me ""you're not the person I thought you were"" (almost blaming me in entirety for the botched relationship). She also immediately moved on with someone else, which hurt bad.

It's been months, and I'm still not healed psychologically. I still have no sex drive (this started when I became depressed while we dated), I have what my therapist refers to as anhedonia (I don't experience joy), I feel detached from everything I once loved (this girl works for my family, and they love her because they don't know what kind of person she is...so I feel uncomfortable around my family now), and I purely HATE her (I don't want to, but I do...I have never been so resentful or felt so evil at any other point in my life).

I don't know what to do. I hope this doesn't sound like I'm whining. I genuinely feel dead inside. She got in a car crash (near fatal) after we split, and, honestly, I really enjoy hearing she was ok. I feel sick in the head. Therapy hasn't helped.",05Nov2018,1
86,"Hello everybody! I deeply apologize in advance for this wall of text...

I am a freshman at an art school and I have a weird problem. In my graphic design classes (and honestly any classes) when I am given a new assignment which requires me to spend a whole week working on, I feel this unshakable urge to really push myself to make the absolute best finished product that I can come up with. 

On one hand this causes me to excel at my classes and push myself to experiment and try new things, but on the other hand these ideas are almost always way more than my teachers ever expect their students to do. I don't know how to feel satisfied and content working on an idea that I know can be WAY better if I actually spent more time on it. The only problem is that when I do put as much effort into it to satisfy myself, I am almost always staying up till 4am working on it.

It's not that I even procrastinate on it, I genuinely will try to work on it every weekday and spend almost the entire weekends working on it. For example, from when I got started at 9am to 10:12pm right now I am still working on finishing up a project due tomorrow.

I feel guilty and anxious when I spent any time not working on projects. I am almost always stressing myself out about these things. I love art and I love working on it, but when I feel stressed out about my never-ending project to-do list when watching a tv show with my boyfriend, I know this cannot continue.

To add some more context to my situation, I am diagnosed with ADD. I have been taking medication to better manage it so for the most part it doesn't seem to be an issue. When I am working on these projects I do not break concentration so much so that I don't take many breaks or eat, so my ADD and general level of procrastination does not seem to be the cause of this.

Everything I work on, no matter how efficiently I am doing things, I do much slower than anybody else in my class.

I've had this over-achieving problem all the way through high school as well. I thought when I would be in college I would finally be free from this cycle because I'll be doing something that is easy and fun for me to do. I hope somebody can help me with this because it's making my life a never ending hell week.

The solution is: ""stop trying to make everything your magnum opus"", but when I plan out my project I don't realize how much effort is going to be required.

TLDR: I am an over-achieving perfectionist who puts too much blood, sweat, and tears into projects that don't require a lot for art school classes I already am doing good at and I cannot stop.",05Nov2018,1

My goal is to move out of the state I live in to another state pretty far away. However, I only want to do so when I know I’m fully prepared. I’m not looking to have any kind of huge house or luxurious lifestyle, I just want to be able to live comfortably.

- When do I know that I am fully prepared to safely move out of state?

- How does buying a house out of state work?

- How should I go about quickly securing a job in the area I want to relocate? (Again, I have no college experience and I’m not sure if you can secure low level jobs over the phone out of state.)

* **An abandoned parking structure**. There is one about 300 feet from my house, and it is almost completely deserted and unlit at night. We might be able to get it going there with little to no rish, possibly inside my car there as well.

He's very clingy to me, and originally I took this as a compliment and I did spend a lot of time with him.

He is now quite close to the rest of the group but has proceeded to make them make sure I am not invited to numerous events, but if I am invited to something he isn't he gets very angry I don't attempt to get him included.

I want your advice. I don't know what I'm doing with my life.
I grew up thinking I was supposed to become a neurologist. I had excellent grades and saving lives seemed like the best way to help people. I have always wanted to help others.
But, now that I'm older, I don't have such a simplistic point of view. I know that we all play important roles and that a kind bartender is better than a materialistic doctor.
I'm jealous of people who have gotten into medical school and written books mainly because my mother wants me to be a doctor and I wish I was a professional writer.
Haha I guess I do know what I want.
As much as I respect doctors, I feel like writers and artists play a bigger role. They shape our culture and thus can make people's lives happier.

Not sure if this is the right sub, please let me know if there a more appropriate one.

So some background, this teacher is known as pretty chill and also likes to say that he wants us to focus on the learning instead of the grade. I have approached him multiple times about grade concerns before and I guess he just got tired of it? He seems to like me as a student over other kids because we have a lot of annoying people in the class which makes me look good in comparison. At the start of the quarter I failed a big lab which has been dragging down my grade. I have also been fairly diligent throughout the quarter and I guess he liked that?

And so on Friday, as he sent us into the lab, he quietly told me to stay back. When everyone cleared the ""classroom"" section of the lab he pulled up the gradebook and out of nowhere just asked me what grade I wanted. Not knowing what to say I went with ""I think a low A is an accurate reflection of my work?..."" and he changed my grade on the big lab from a 60 to a 100. Then he said, ""Stop worrying about your grade. Get to work."" I walked out into the lab and he walked out right behind me and quietly warned, ""this stays between us."" I spent the lab day working mostly away from the group and focusing on my project. He walked by a few times and made general positive comments. I tried to be more lighthearted than normal but I also didn't want to come off as too teacher's-pet.

I do not think this was a sexual advance? This teacher is a good looking male teacher who some people think is gay. I'm gay but I haven't come out to the teacher or anything. To be honest, part of me wishes it \*were\* some wild-fantasy sexual advance, but I know that THAT would definitely be illegal. All that happened was that my teacher bumped up my grade more than 10% in front of me, and he didn't do it for anyone else.

If this makes its way to the school administration, am I liable for anything? My school is big on honor. Would I be in trouble for not reporting the grade bump? I could really use this A. Maybe he is testing me if I am honorable or something? It didn't seem that way. Please help!",05Nov2018,1

* I’m currently in a contract role but with good chance of extension or permanent offer
* My manager is fairly nice albeit a workoholic
* The monitor I was given is extremely crappy and makes it very difficult to work with considering I work with data/spreadsheets often, and have to do QA (imagine doing cross device testing on a 1990s monitor)
* As a contractor I don’t want to look fussy and “make demands”, however, everyone else sitting around me (we all have same roles) has a better monitor

Should I ask my manager to request for a better monitor? It’s not gonna cost her a penny. Is it too much to ask for equal treatment in equipment we work with everyday? Should I be worried about her remembering me as “fussy” and not extend my contract?",05Nov2018,1

Plan to forward this posting so he can gather perspective.

Baby brother (33yrs) is the sweetest, most sensitive, affectionate man I've had the luck to be close too. He has always been loyal and honest and had integrity.

Several years ago, after a string of horrific and abusive relationships, he meets a delightful woman who as it turns out, is sane, classy, creative, and madly in love with him. He wasnt ready to have her move in, get engaged, or even get married but out of fear of losing her, he gave her what she wanted. He loved her. He still does, of this is I'm sure.

Alas, they always had a dead bedroom. Doesn't matter, they are determined to make it work and I salute the determination. Marriage is work, right?

Fast forward to a couple months ago.

Bro wakes up one morning with severe anxiety, heads to work and proceeds to have a nervous breakdown. Goes on disability for a month, seeks therapy, starts taking Krav to manage his sudden rages, and essentially tells his sweet wife that he loves her but needs space. 

She has let herself go at this point. She showers a couple times a week and has eaten herself to the threshold of morbid obesity. He just can't bring himself to fuck her. She is depressed and withdraws even more.

Finally she moves back to her parents to give him space. She is sure they will work it out. He tells her they will work it out. He feeds her hope. Maybe he even means it.

He starts an affair because it makes him fee alive again.

I need you fine folks at reddit to explain to him that he cant justify the affair with grocery store checkout lady and still maintain that he might rejoin his wife someday. Explain that he needs to let his wife off the hook so she can move on OR ditch the grocery thot and get his life back in track.

He doesn't listen to me. We were thick as thieves until I called him out on this mishuga. He used to tell me everything. We were best friends. I'd follow my brother the hero everywhere but this madness needs to get sorted out.

He is drinking way more than ever.
He isnt repairing his marraige.
Not even sure he wants to keep it.
He was never a cheater before his wife.
He was NEVER EVER a liar.
He was a good, good man.
Now he is wandering and this barrel scrape of a woman is coaching him.

What should I tell him?

TL;DR used to be a good man brother has become scumbag cheater after rushed marriage and nervous breakdown and now doesnt know if he should stay with mistress or wife.

121,"For the sake of whatever, imma name the person in the situation Bob. There will be a TL;DR.

Okay so I play in a Basketball Rec League. Bob is on my team, along with 6-7 others. In this league, we had to pay to be eligibe. So I took the cost of the team, and divided it up per person so every paid evenly. Fair enough, right?

So fast forward a month into this season , we played today and it was messy. So Bob brings a friend, and I didn't like this to begin with because this friend, hasn't paid or really I've never met this person a day in my life. 

So whatever, but I think this encouraged Bob to bring my fillers in. One of our teammates has a GF, and she does play basketball and she is really good at it. However, I was strongly against her playing for reasons a) she hasn't paid, and b)*not to be a sexist evil dick* but she is a girl facing against guys that are 6'5 or 6'6 and who are dunking and shit like that, and I have to sit out somebody who has paid their due and can *maybe* defend that. 

She played also (Ill call her Jen). Bob was gunhoe about Jen playing, she did (again dispite me saying not) and it was a trainwreck. This is nothing against her at all, trust me. It's just again, I think it's unfair that people are playing who haven't paid, and thoses who have are sitting out. 

So far I have one person on the team agree with me, and I was talking with him during the game and told me that he agrees with me. Also, Jen's BF (who is on my team) agreed with me as well. 

After the game, I made an annoucement on the group chat that I am not allowing ""Filler Players"" anymore without my permissions. I said that I think it is extremely unfair for the reasons I have said. However, Bob is arguing me that I am the only one who thinks this and that she should play because she has basketball experience. 

I doubt anyone is gonna come out in anyone's favor, but I know most of them are under the thinking that this is my team, and I say as go (I am the captain of this team overall). I hate having to actually play ""captain,"" I really do try to be cool and loose with everyone. But obvisiously with this situation, gotta lay down the smackdown.

So who is right? Is Bob actually right, does it really matter and I am being butthurt over nothing? Or am I right, and I should affirm my rule of no ""filler players."" 

Bonus: Bob is such a chore to deal with sometimes. He whines and bitches, he thinks this rec league is nearly the NBA. If you mess up he will point you out on it and he will more or less, ""tell you what you need to do,"" rather than, ""provide contructed feedback."" If that makes sense, like he is kinda snobby about it and it's annoying. 

**TL;DR: Bob wants a teammate's GF to play, I don't because she hasn't paid and it's not fair to those who have. Bob thinks nobody cares. Whos is right?**

I haven't been in school the whole time, I took a few years off to get a job and stuff. I quit my job and came back to school in the spring of 2017, so this is my 4th semester back. Needless to say, being older than everyone on campus had made it hard for me to connect with people. I'm also a big introvert, and while I have no problem talking with and meeting new people, I tend to keep to myself and I don't usually seek out contact. I used to be fine with being single, but last year I had a few attempts at romance that crashed and burned and ever since then, I've had pretty strong feelings of bitterness whenever I see couples on campus. I recently realized I had a problem when I reacted quite bitterly to my younger brother and his girlfriend and some excessive PDA, and my mother confronted me (in a loving, motherly way) and warned about letting bitterness stay in my heart. I obviously don't plan on remaining single, and am taking slow, plodding steps to find someone I would like to date, but in the meantime I need to figure out how to stop feeling bitter all the time when I see couples enjoying their time together.

He says he’s had to sleep in vans, was only able to wear his shoes out in public, and live off of nothing. He knows how to hustle and he still has to sacrifice luxuries to just be able to eat or go to work.

Right now he lives with his best friend and the best friend’s dad, who charge him $200 in rent. He also pays $200 towards a used-car payment, and other necessities. He works graveyard shifts at a gas station, and recently got a raise with guaranteed hours.

He’s gone far in his life, especially when looking at where he started. But my family often questions whether he’s responsible enough to be in a relationship with me.

His job is an hour away, when he can probably land a job closer to his house. He hasn’t gotten a new license after he “lost” his other one. He doesn’t go to school. He also has no savings.

I’m very frustrated with the license issue because he’s been stringing it along for months, saying that it’s not a high priority for him because he has to pay bills and eat. But if got a license, he’d be able to avoid potential penalties, PLUS he’d be able to show my family that he does have one and that he’s not lying.

I know my relationship has a few... problems. I know that I could be wasting a lot of time with this person. But I do truly care about him and I love him a whole lot. I know he feels the same about me and he’s committed to me.

She then complains that I stole her scanner. And continued to sigh really loudly. So I eventually just gave her the scanner because I couldn't deal with it.

I'm currently on probation for getting caught with alcohol as a minor and I'm still drinking. I can be randomly tested and I still drink whenever I want because fuck it. 

I spend a lot of money gambling and at the strip club. Last week alone I blew a $1000 at the casino. I will go to the strip club once or twice a month and spend a couple hundred each night. At the end of each night when I think about all the money I spend/lost I shrug it off. The few times that I do think I'm making a mistake I lose all self control and just keep spending.

136,"Obvious throwaway for obvious reasons.

I'm not sure where to start with this. I suppose I should summarize the main issues at hand, those being my depression, my relationship with school, and my relationship with substances.

As a kid I did really well in school, always straight A's. I was transferred to a small charter school in my city that admitted students based on their scores on standardized tests, which had accelerated curriculum.

It was here that I started to flounder - in 4th grade. I should mention that I'm 18 now and graduated from high school. Suddenly it wasn't easy for me to be the smart kid, and I stopped taking pleasure in success. I completely stopped caring. I gave up. From there on out, I passed each class by the skin of my teeth - C's and D's.

I coasted through high school getting the same grades and became your classic stoner. It was fun in high school, I guess, but my relationship with school (tenuous at best) had me consistently stressed out.

Now I've graduated and am trying to attend college, but my motivation isn't any better. I don't make appointments for myself or get anything done. I don't write, play music, or draw anymore. I'm studying what I love more than anything, and yet I can't bring myself to give a shit. I hardly do my homework, I only attend about half my classes; and the worst part is that I absolutely love what I'm studying. It's only my first term, but I really thought things could be different for me in college. I'm totally ashamed of myself.

I'm also quite dependent on weed and smoke cigarettes as well. Every day I spend time with my friends, and smoking weed is our social activity. When I have a job (I have an interview tomorrow), most of my money goes towards pot. This is the main source of my issues with motivation. The problem is that while I want to distance myself from that environment, I don't want to cut off my friends, and I also don't want to completely cut weed out of my life. I'd love to be able to smoke a bowl a few nights out of the week or something like that, but I smoke every day, a lot.

TL;DR: I'm 18 years old, graduated from high school by the skin of my teeth, and I'm floundering again in college. I need to distance myself from my current lifestyle but don't want to cut off all of my long-time friends. I'm completely ashamed that my depression and substance dependence prevent me from performing the most basic tasks. I don't want to bottom out at 18 and end up living a life I hate because I have no self-discipline now.",05Nov2018,1

I have absolitely no idea whay could drive a parent to do this to their child.

On other occasions, the mom has said she wishes she'd thrown my friend into the ocean, encouraged her to commit suicide, called her ugly, and basically every other bad thing possible. The mom has never physically given severe injury, at least from what I know, but she's seriously messed up my friend mentally and emotionally. My friend's mom also has a stupid boyfriend that reportedly attacks her mom and grandpa, hides and steals their belongings, and forces them to stay with him in his apartment. She overall doesn't live in a very nice household. However, she also has 2 younger brothers that have to suffer through this with her, which is the only glimmer of a good thing she has at home.

Anyway, this is an advice post for both me and for her.

For her, what are her options to deal with this? From what I know, she's only tried to branch out to the police once but was dismissed to her claims being shunned by her mom and the boyfriend.

For me, how can I be supportive as a friend? How can I help?

Also, if you see this, friend, sorry if you didn't want me to share this, I always make bas decisions.

To you, the reader, let me know if you need additional info to come to a conclusion. Thank you with all my heart for making it this far.

142,"I am in High School and lately I have found out most of my friends I know and hang out with, have been smoking pot and vaping. I do not know what to do. I am sort of scarred by this, mainly because I thought they were better people and I have a mindset where doing drugs and all that is just really dumb and overall stupid. I just can’t look at my friends the same way. I know this may sound stupid but I don’t know why, that is just who I am.

145,"TL;DR One of my roommates is adopting a lot of traits very unique to a different roommate who left a while ago.

When I first started going to college, I was put in a dorm with three other guys, two of us in each room, and the guy bunked with me turned out to be quite a character.

He was a big, ripped hawaiian dude, real cool guy, with some very iconic traits. He worked out a bunch, always wore a hoodie with the hood up and covering his eyes whenever he worked out, always took a milk-gallon jug of water with him to the gym, and he had these backwards-headphones where the music was played outwardly, like speakers, and he'd be playing his music wherever he went (within reason like, not in super public areas or anywhere it would be really annoying). And he also loved watching workout videos when he got back to the dorm. Everything I just described is all you'd ever see him doing.

One of my other roommates is a fat californian latino who streams fortnite, watches anime, and tries to act like a thug. Recently, I've noticed the californian try to become just like him. He's started playing his music out of his phone in his pocket when leaving the dorm room, wearing a hoodie to go work out while also putting the hood up, bringing a milk-gallon jug of water with him, and just recently he's started watching workout videos. His personality has even been skewing slightly towards my old roommate's. All of this has come gradually over the past week, even though the other roommate has been gone for almost two months now.

This behavior is very unlike him, and it's rather annoying to see him trying to become my old roommate. I didn't know exactly where to take this question, as it's just so odd it's like something out of a TV show, but how do I let him know that it's bothering me, and that it's unhealthy to act like someone else, without making him seem like a fool, as I don't want to do that (I do have to live with him after all lol).",05Nov2018,1

148,"It's been some months now since I've stopped going out with my circle of friends that would get together often and drink and hang out and all. A new group of girls came into the circle a year or so back, I started seeing one, she got into it with my buddy's gf (he's the guy that brought us all together it seems like) and some more things happened between them. So I sided with the girl I was seeing, and I started hanging out with her more, and them less, and now they haven't ever really reached out to me. Although things are still on good terms between me and them, except for my buddy's gf who I'm not sure how she feels about me since I called her out.

But the girl I was seeing went off to school -- ( Out of two girls I've ever been this close with, both have left to school in Colorado) -- I'm busy with school of my own, working, paying my bills, and recently my dad's broken his ribs so I've taken over his pool cleaning route on top of everything else for what will probably be at least half a year. My last couple attempts at finding a new girl haven't really gone anywhere, I don't see anybody very often, don't have many people I can reach out to, save for my family ( Who I regard as a last resort for anything. I don't know why, I have a good but solitary relationship with them ), and it feels like I'm really just grinding through what's going to be a lonely, tough set of years ahead of me with much the same pattern.

I've tried reaching out to that same group of friends recently, we'll see what comes of it. The other day after finishing the last pool on the route, I reckoned I'd stop by an old friend's parents' house next door and say hi. I talked with them for a while and caught up on how the family was doing. He's out in school for a while but it felt nice to reestablish a connection that was lost some 5 or so years ago. Hoping I see him when he comes back. 

I'm an almost 22 man and it seems like this is just too young to be seeing this kind of trend, and I don't want it to stay like this. I'm exhausted, lonely, and it feels like the only thing keeping me together is the thought of the future I'm trying to build for myself. Hopefully if it all goes to plan, I'll have entirely new opportunities to meet and connect with new people, but that's supposed to be way down the line. 

I guess I'm really just asking for advice in any manner... in what to keep in mind, how to keep myself from digging myself into a depressing hole like I have before in life (it sucks), and I don't know, anything really.

TL;DR:    Lost the amount of contact I'm used to with many friends, constantly working and keeping up, everything seems so far off. What can I do?",05Nov2018,1
149,"I go to an all boys school, and I have just come to the realization that I have literally not spoken to a girl in many years, let alone make friends with them. 

I kinda need a girl for formal next year, but I genuinely just wanna meet some people of the opposite gender, not even in a romantic kinda way. I am about 180cm tall, yet I am 88kg so im also somewhat overweight. I feel this has held me back a little confidence wise. I also dont usually go to parties, and dont really like sport. My likings are kinda weird, with interests including fish keeping, pokemon go, gaming etc. 

Our school had a social event many years ago, but back then I was even less confident, and making any friends with girls did not happen. However, I feel now I am a little more grown up, and I can start a conversation with anyone pretty easily.

Here’s the thing: I have a pretty great relationship with my parents, but living with them, I just sort of feel like I’m not able to fully become an adult. Looking at prices in my city, I could probably get a place near my university for $500-650. Yearly, that could add anywhere between $6000 and $7800 yearly to my costs, which doesn’t even include stuff like utilities, internet, and laundry. I’d have to take out a lot more student loans.

152,"I've been in a really bad place mentally for quite a while now. It got particularly bad over the summer, i was crying constantly due to my unhappiness and feeling lost. i decided i needed a change, so i started planning to study abroad in the spring. i spent so much time thinking about this decision, researching it, finishing tasks for it and then i performed the biggest act of self sabotage. i withdrew from the program i worked so hard to apply and get accepted to. at the time, i felt like it was the most logical decision to put off studying abroad. i thought i would be able to spend more time with my sisters before they move out in the coming years and i thought i can have more time to save up. in retrospect, those were the dumbest things i could base my decision off. i shouldve known better than to let my decision be impacted by other people and wanting to spend time with them. i shouldve been selfish just this once when it came to my mental health. i knew this one thing was possibly my only route to happiness and i destroyed it for trivial reasons. i have been beating myself up since withdrawing because i have never done something so idiotic. the next day, i emailed my advisor asking to get back in and she told me i could but that i already lost out on my scholarships. to go in the spring instead of putting it off another 8 months, i would need to take out a great deal of loans (i already took out 3750). these would be private loans, which are less manageable than federal ones. i guess what i need help on is deciding if that's what i should do. should i go into more debt in order to study abroad now or should i just wait until the fall semester so that i can have time to apply for more scholarships and increase my savings? what should i do?",05Nov2018,1

154,"Hi, I'm not sure if this is the right place to be looking for this kind of help, but I'm looking for any sort of advice on a situation my girlfriend (19 years old) has found herself in. For the past few months her primary income has been from online sex work (camming) and has recently decided she feels incredibly uncomfortable about it and doesn't wish to continue. She's trying to find another job to get by but will be unable to do so until her uni exams have finished (November 19). She lives out of home and today was hit with $300 in utility bills, not to mention the monthly rent she will have to pay in a few weeks (which I think is about $400-$500). She receives payments from Centrelink (Australian government funding), but it won't be nearly enough to cover these expenses and refuses to accept money from me (even though I have enough to cover everything). Her mum lives a long plane trip away, but she is unable to afford a ticket home to stay with her while these issues are handled. At this point her only option is to continue the online sex work until exams are over and she can find another job, which we are both incredibly uncomfortable with. The issue is not that I don't approve or don't think it's respectable work, it's that she's not comfortable doing it.

156,"So in getting to know our office secretary over the past 2 years Ive found out a lot. It started with a car accident she had. Turns out it happened because she was drunk. Then she admitted to being an alcoholic. Next she said she was in a verbally abusive relationship with her husband and they're getting a divorce. She seemed to not help the situation of their marriage either. I learned all this about 6 months ago. But over that past few weeks shes been out a lot. Last time I saw her and we spoke I'm like 99% sure she was under the influence of something. He eyes were so glossy, she was straining to held her head up, and she was delayed in a lot of responses. How do I confront her? I feel like bringing it up to my manager is not helpful. Like might push her off the edge if she's confronted that way versus a friend. But not gonna lie I feel I'm sort of crappy even calling myself a friend. If I tell a bit of my drama to a coworker, it's to let it out. Or I want people to get a hint that if I'm more silent this week I need it. People seem to be put off if im not bubbly cause most times I'm ultra bubbly. I usually dont need to talk about it ever again. I actually dont want to talk about it again and prefer my privacy back. Point is I reciprocate that and don't follow up on other person's drama.

161,"I don't know to do.

We're still young both in high school and I need no-one to know so I'll keep personal details to a minimum

So she has absolutely no sex drive, we're both in our teens, y'know when kids usually have a high sex drive. she's my first girlfriend, I'm her first boyfriend. She hates sex, everything about it, the talk, jokes, culture, and the idea of it. She is 100% firm that she will never have sex ever in her life, she is most sure about this than anything else.

Me on the other is your normal teenager, with a strong sex drive, now I'm not trying to have sex with her currently, she doesn't want it and I can respect that. The unfortunate thing is, everyday I find myself wanting to more and more. The more I engage in this relationship and build love for her, the more I want to have sex with her.

I'm not entirely on board with staying abstinent my whole life, I'd never cheat on her or do anything that would hurt her, I'm not a psychopath. But I don't know what to actually do, or what I'm going to do, not for my whole life

Just general info, neither of us are religious none of that ""wait till marriage, no. She's never had a traumatizing sexual experience, she just hates it in it's entirety for some reason. So I don't know what to do, or what to think, I'm lost....   ",05Nov2018,1
162,"This was a couple of years ago, but it still bothers me. I want to know if I was actually taken advantage of/manipulated or I am just an idiot. 

I started working somewhere and there was someone working there that had started just a couple months before me. Every time I tried to have conversation he’d blow me off, or would just straight up ignore me. I don’t know why he hated me so much, but we worked in close quarters, and I’m usually a really nice and easygoing kind of person (I find it really easy to get along with new people). So naturally, I tried to break him and eventually started actually getting some conversation our of him. 

We became friends after that, but in a coworker sense. Like text every so often, but we didn’t hang out or anything like that. Until one night he asked me out for drink. I dreaded it, but I didn’t want to disappoint him, thus making things awkward at work, so I went. We had a few drinks, and I’m a lightweight, so I was pretty tipsy by this point and he was fine. He said drinks at the bar were too expensive, so he offered to go to his place. Again, I didn’t want to do the awkward ‘just take me home’, so I went. 

So we get to his place, and I keep drinking and I’m eventually drunk. Long story short, he manages to get me into bed. I didn’t want to, but I didn’t say no, but I was also really drunk. He was tipsy at the most. I wasn’t really thinking much other than ‘I don’t want this, but I’m just gonna go along with it, and explain it was a mistake tomorrow’. Big mistake. 

The next day, I let him know that we probably shouldn’t do that again. He gets extremely angry and he basically says that he will no longer talk to me at work or at all really unless I kept sleeping with him. In my mind, I’m just thinking what everyone would think at work. Suddenly we go from work friends to not talking to each other? I didn’t want the drama. So I kept sleeping with him. 

This was a couple of years ago, and now I see how ridiculous that was. I went on sleeping with him as a friends with benefits type deal. I hated all of it. He basically pretended I was his girlfriend too. He would take me out, he would have me sleepover and make breakfast in the morning, and have me shower with him. He would get angry if I would say no, and would start an argument about how disrespectful I am and how he should just cut me out of his life. 

Not to mention, if I spent a day without talking to him, or if I just wanted to be by myself instead of being with him he’d get extremely mad. Like if I had any free time, it had to be with him. Otherwise I’d make up excuses, but he eventually caught on. 

When I left that job, I cut all ties with him and went on with my life. But I can’t stop thinking about how scary the whole situation was, and it’s affected my relationships and how I choose people I get into relationships with ever since. 

How do I move on from this? Am I overreacting? ",05Nov2018,1
163,"So I work in nursing care. I’m 23 and have autism spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder, despite these illness’s I am able to do my job very well and have great rapport with all the residents. I only do nights and evenings due to my autism making it a little harder to focus on day shifts when it’s hectic. My boss is really good to me and understanding, she has helped arrange a schedule for me that I like. I have been feeling these symptoms for months and months. Recently I had 9 days vacation and thought it would help. It did not help me as much as I thought. 

For months I’ve been eating one meal a day, even with the meal I only eat half of it. I now smoke a pack of king size cigarettes maybe everyday or 2. I feel exhausted mentally, physically and emotionally. I only sleep about 4 hours a night, recently marijuana was legalized so I got back into smoking that and I sleep usually 8 hours now which is good. I am not in any relationship, I have no interest in being involved with anyone at that level currently, I also don’t have many friends and tend to just see my life coach every 2 weeks. I usually spend all my evenings or nights at work getting around 80-90 biweekly sometimes more, sometimes less.

I have a lot of moods swings with my bipolar. Despite that at work I keep my problems at the door and work my hardest every shift. Where I work we are supposed to work weekend on weekend off. I am one of the unlucky ones who maybe gets 1 weekend off out of the whole schedule, my only weekend off was in the 9 day vacation. I don’t have another off till 2-3 weeks away. My boss asks me a lot how I’m doing with work as she is concerned, she apologizes about making me work so many weekends, but she has no one to fill them and I never complain about shifts I’m given I just do them. 

I’m very angry at home. Often feeling trapped in my house. I don’t like going out to do stuff as it exhausts me. I don’t like gaming and stuff I used to have a strong passion for. I feel when I’m free every activity I do is a waste of time. I neglect my sleep when I’m off because I feel I won’t get free time like it again for a while. 

Another scary factor is when I was manic I took money out of a loan company and I still have to pay student loans. I’m in a lot of debt I’m struggling to pay off. I am scared to take time off or lose my job, because if I do I’ll lose everything. I don’t know what to do anymore. The past 4 shifts have been 12 hour nights, 2 turned to 13 hour overtime. I am currently at work for my 4th.

I’m considering talking to my boss about lowering my hours a little and getting no 12 hour shifts. But I don’t know how to approach, I don’t want to sound lazy or anything. It’s just I love my job and always did, but now I just feel agony when I have to go again. I’ve considered suicide as a way out of my debt. I just don’t know what to do anymore.

AP Biology 
AP Human Geography
Pre-AP Chemistry
Pre-AP English II
Pre-AP Geometry 
Drawing/Painting 
German 2

I am very passionate about my sciences, and I am doubling up on them currently. I am tentatively saying I plan on being a Biochemist or Microbiologist,  simply because those are things I feel like I would like. I currently have absolutely no ideas or plans on what college I plan on going to. I come from a lower income family (30,000 USD/year)
I have no job, and I do not have ready access to transportation. I recently took the PSAT (8th grade) and Pre-ACT (this year) and scored a 1115 and 26 composite, respectively. My mother was the valedictorian for her class, and was previously a nurse. She left nursing in pursuit for a less physically taxing job and is now working at Walmart, as a night time stocker. My father is a highschool dropout who is basically a handyman, currently is working concrete jobs. He is not a reliable source of income so I have excluded his income.


With all previous information out of the way, what are my best options on colleges, keeping my financial status and job history in mind? What should be my next moves when it comes to classes, assuming I want to continue on my initial ideas of being a biochemist/microbiologist? Jobs? 

I understand this is rather early, and I have a poor grasp on how college works in general, but I’ve been stressing out due to my financial status possibly getting even worse (ha) and I feel like this may harm my future.

166,"I'm 34 and I started smoking when I was 12. I quit once for almost 2 years about 10 years ago and that time, I just decided to quit and did it without any help and it was surprisingly easy. For some reason this time quitting cold turkey just isn't an option. I do smoke more now than I did when I quit before so I don't know if that has something to do with it or not. I also have nothing but free time now which may contribute to how much more difficult it's been. So far I've tried nicotine gum, patches, e-cigs/vaping and chantix and none of it worked. All I thought about was how much I wanted a cigarette with every one of the things I tried. My reason for wanting to quit is mostly about how expensive it is so it's possible that I'm just not motivated enough but I was really hoping to find something that would help me not have the desire to smoke as much to make it easier. Chantix was kind of a last resort because I was worried about the side effects and I was really surprised it did nothing for me even after taking it for 6 months. I was hoping maybe someone here had an idea of something else I could try that might work where everything else has failed?

A couple things worth mentioning. 
My husband also smokes so having access to them even if I'm trying to quit is an issue. I also have multiple forms of chronic pain that have basically made me housebound most of the time so having too much free time isn't something I can do a lot about. I can't fully function for very long when I go anywhere without extreme pain.

&amp;#x200B;

I had just returned from a trip and was in the process of unloading several things from my car. My parking spaces are in the back of my building and directly across from 2-3 seedy houses. When I say seedy houses, I mean the kind of houses where tenants are constantly moving in and out, cars coming and going at all hours (drugs? probably drugs...), blasting music, trash all over the place, etc. 

While I was unloading my car someone pulls up to one of the seedy houses, gets out, and just kind of stands by their car. The woman who lives in the house walks out to her porch and starts having a super loud conversation with her visitor. When I say super loud, she was literally *yelling,* so it was hard not to eavesdrop. 

I'll paraphrase the part of the conversation that got my attention:

She was all worked up because ""So and so (male name) likes to lock the kids in the closet with the lights off while I'm at work because he thinks it's funny!"" 

It was clear to me that she was more annoyed at the action of this person locking the kids in the closet than she was the wellbeing and safety of her kids, if that makes sense? 

I'm not sure who is looking after these kids (older brother? boyfriend?), but the fact that this person is locking them in a dark closet for who knows *how* long, doesn't sit well with me. It also sounds like this definitely isn't the first time it's happened and probably won't be the last. 

Other than this instance, I haven't seen or heard anything alarming. 

&amp;#x200B;

This woman seems crazed, so I'm not about to try and invite her over for tea. Also, there are no cameras where my cars are parked, and I really wouldn't put it past her to mess with them if she's pissed at me. 

If I call CPS (living in WI) will I remain anonymous? What if she remembers me being outside while she was yelling about her kids being locked in a closet? 

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts or advice are greatly appreciated. ",05Nov2018,1
169,"I live in a house of 4 long time friends. We are all in our mid twenties and two have significant others that come around often. 
Before we moved in here we decided that it would only be the 4 of us living there and we wouldn’t break the lease to ease our rent with another person since we were comfortable with the money we would be saving already. 
One roommate has repeatedly decided to allow his gf over for 5 days a week. We’ve called him out on it multiple times but he will only change things temporarily. And normally it wouldn’t be that big of a deal but she is becoming increasingly unbearable. She doesn’t acknowledge anyone but her bf even if we’re all talking together. She sings constantly despite what other people are doing. She has been streaming so much on the internet that we’ve reached our limit multiple times. She leaves her crap everywhere and she doesn’t provide for the house unless we get on to her about leeching. 
On top of all of this their relationship has driven away a number of his friends already. He’s not willing to hear criticisms regarding his relationship and usually comes up with wild excuses whenever someone says something about it. 
It’s gotten to a point where we realize we have to ask him to not sign the next lease but that’s 4 months away and we don’t know if we’re willing to deal with it for that much longer. 
Living with 3 other people is hard enough but when you add another one who doesn’t seem to like anyone it makes it a lot harder. ",05Nov2018,1

So my (20M) girlfriend (24F) has neurodermatitis (skin disorder) along with a host of allergies, and money's tight for her working part-time at McDonald's &amp; having to pay for uni, since student loans are inexistent here. I'm okay financially, coming from a middle-class background - I don't have unlimited funds but I'm more than comfortable. She has what I would describe as okay access to medication, but that only takes care of the allergies. She still itches so much that my bed ends up full of bloody stains on her side after every sleepover.

One thing that helps her is *Nigella sativa* oil, of which a bottle is about $13 at current exchange rates, and one bottle lasts her slightly more than a month. She just ran out and now the itches are even worse, and she said ""I'll get a bottle on pay day"" - she's usually paid on the 15th. Not wanting her to suffer such itches for 10 days, I offered to get her a bottle, and if she wanted she'd give me the money back on pay day. She adamantly refused, saying that's how you get in the habit of being in debt, and got angry with me. She said she'd rather suffer for 10 days than get a $13 sanity-saving bottle of nigella oil from me. I get where she's coming from: as she was growing up she watched her family go deeper and deeper into debt and their standard dropping. But still. It's a $13 bottle that can drastically improve her life.

What can I do and/or how can I convince her to let me get her a bottle?",05Nov2018,1

175,"So, while I was a depressed senior in high school, I met someone. Ended up gaming almost daily and talking daily, voice and video calling, ocassionally hanging out in person. We agreed we could never have a ""thing"", but still sent somewhat revealing pictures to each other one day. We werent attracted to each other, it was just a ""felt like shit and compliments felt nice"" moment. She got a boyfriend a couple weeks later, I was happy for her. 

4 years later, we were still gaming and talking, close friends that knew everything about each other. Pretty much my only friend for a while. Always supported each other. After 3 failed relationships, I finally got into a real relationship with someone I could truly love. Friend was pissed, accused me of being showy with my girlfriend, telling me I was gunna get played again, and mentioned the pictures, which we had never talked about it since it happened. Said her boyfriend was fine with knowing that whole time (who she was still with for all these years.)

So I felt like shit in both ways... this chick's irl boyfriend put up with me being her close friend all this time knowing we had a bit of past history.  And also, ive been dating this girl who i told i'd invest everything into our relationship, no worries of ""old news"". 

So, in the end, I completely blocked the friend from my life, abruptly and without a word, going against what Id told her our entire friendship. Ended a 4 year friendship for a 2 month relationship. 

Now 2 YEARS later, i couldnt be happier with my girlfriend, even talking about kids and marriage. I didnt mean to put my past friend through emotional turmoil or even more trust issues than she already had, me being her only friend for a while too. Buuuut, i wanted to also give my girlfriend a happy, stress-free relationship, as she was a person that had been through a lot too, and I cared about her. I know I wouldnt want my girlfriend to be in constant contact with a dude she sent pictures to, no matter how long ago. 

Ive gotten some shit from other friends about this, and was wondering if I should feel like a guilty or manipulative person? If I am one? I'd like to see other people's take on the situation. I wouldnt change my choice regardless, as me and my girlfriend are the best things that have ever happened to each other. ",05Nov2018,1

187,"So there is a girl from my school, and I've known her since freshman year, and we have been taking some classes together. For almost 3 years in high school, she was just like any other girl to me. We would talk sometimes, but it was really just regular small talks. But somewhere near the end of 3rd year of high school (junior?) I texted her about some test or whatever, and she told me everything about it, and she was still just a regular girl for me. But a day after that, she texted me, and we were texting for a few hours. Since then (it was like June 2018) we've been texting almost every day. In last 2 months it is every day for sure, and it can be like 4 hours a day, because we both don't sleep much and then talk over night. 

So honestly, now I really like her. But the problem is I have no idea if she likes me. We don't get to talk much in school, but again we are pretty close. Conversations are pretty normal when we talk live, but we never like went out together. Although she did ask me to go out with her and some of her friends, but I was busy then and had to reject the offer, and that is the only time she asked me that. She never really gave some clear signs of friend zone but she is not flirting either. She does send some hearts and love shit but it doesn't have to mean anything. 

She looks like an average girl, pretty but nothing special. I know she rejected a lot of guys (almost every one of them is a retard though) and sometimes she mentions she feels lame or something because she doesn't have a boyfriend, and she mentioned that she never liked anyone from our school. Actually, she never mentioned any guy she liked in like last few years.

Anyway, a lot of mixed feelings and i really can't conclude anything. Our conversations are really nice, long and interesting, but it's really hard to say anything.

189,"**trigger warning** sexual violence.


My friend 'J' is a high up member of staff at a religious organisation in London. Their boss 'K', the head of this religious organisation, is the adult child of a very high profile celebrity 'L' who was accused of historic sex offences as part of Operation Yewtree. He died before he could be convicted but the CPS said he would have been charged otherwise and that there was significant evidence of a high level conspiracy to cover up his crimes. His children, including my friend's boss 'L', publicly defended him and smeared the victims in the press. When he died it all blew over after a while. 

Back to my friend who is working in this organisation and who has safeguarding concerns about the children. A volunteer 'R' at the place has been behaving inappropriately towards the girls aged 11-13, he received an informal warning from the head of education and was advised to modify his behaviour in case of ""misunderstandings"". Three of the girls was confided to my friend that 'R' makes he uncomfortable.

Since then my friend discovered that the volunteer 'R' was kicked out of the Scouts in 2001 for inappropriate (but non criminal) behaviour towards a 12 year old girl that included making comments about her breasts to other scout leaders who reported him. We also found out that the volunteers father was extremely good life long friends with the guy 'L' who died before he could be charged with historic sex offences. Just to thicken the plot the head of education who gave the warning to 'R' is the childhood best friend of 'K', my friends boss, and had 'L' give her away at her wedding, 'R' was a groomsman.

When my friend tried to speak to 'L' about her safeguarding concerns the response was ""I've personally known 'R' for years and years, he's completely harmless, just a bit eccentric"". When my friend tried to press the issue they were actually given a verbal warning by their boss not to pursue this as it would be unnecessary and damaging to their career. My friend has a mortgage, in London, not to mention a career they've given their life and soul to. I understand their hesitation to rock the boat but at the same time we've lost a lot of sleep over this guy and our concerns of a cover up. It's a hot topic right now and there's no way we could look back at this in ten or twenty years and say ""we didn't know"". It's common knowledge now that sexual abusers get away with their crimes by having other people cover for them,often elaborate networks of complicity. I don't think it's a stretch to imagine there's something rotten going on here. Not to mention the children. 


What would you do in this situation? 


TL;DR my friend has safeguarding concerns about a potential sex offender and suspects their boss is covering for him.

190,"About 5 or so months ago my best friends (jack and lily)both began dating(Lily has been my close friend for about 6 years)When they first started dating they were the “perfect couple”. They both had a long history of flirting with one another so when they began dating it really came as no surprise. A few months into them dating I noticed a slight shift in their relation shift but nothing significant.

A few days later lily and I were chatting when she told me one of his female friends had put her hand on his dick (over his pants)and kissed him. And he didn’t pull away. My obvious response was shock and anger on how he could do that and why she was still dating him. After I calmed down she responded that she loved him too much to let him go and that it was ok since he apologized and told her the truth. 

At least a month later I began noticing jack and another girl who had been suddenly hanging out with our friend group getting close with one another always play fighting and grabbing one another. Fast foreword a few days later he begins grabbing her from the back and holding her from behind which is personally a pretty intimate way to hold your “friend”. Especially when you already have a girlfriend. I pulled Lily aside and explained to her that I felt jack and this girl were getting a little close and she agreed she noticed as well. At first I was glad she agreed with me but when she replied I was shocked she said “I’ve told jack no matter what even if he cheats on me I’ll never leave him” I have never felt the need to use the word flabbergasted but it fit perfectly in this instance. 

I personally can’t even fathom being so in love with someone else that I would allow them to cheat on me more than once. I suppose I’m on this subreddit because I’ve never been in a relationship (lmao should mention we’re juniors in high school ) and don’t know the feeling and if it would be strong enough to justify her actions. 

I don’t know how I can support this extremely toxic relationship with out seeming like I’m not there for her. On the other hand if it were any other boy I would be furious and ready to kill him but I’ve been friends with Jack almost as long as Lily (6 years) and I know he’s a good person. On one hand I feel like I should just let their relationship ride out by itself but I also feel like if I see my best friend in a negative relationship it’s my job to make her almost see the light or understand what she isn’t seeing.

191,"I've been with my fiance for 4 years now. He proposed to me a year ago and we both agreed that while we didn't want a big wedding, we still wanted a quaint ceremony and reception to follow. About 6 months ago my sister got into some BIG trouble.  I can't go into it for legal reasons because it's still not really over but her lawyer told her she could get 7-10 years.  

We thought about having the wedding before she would leave (her final court date is in January)but his family is mostly from the midwest and they don't have enough money to drop that fast. I'm getting really frustrated because my family is seeming to make it all about her. My fiance wanted to get married before his mother passes (she has ALS and is not doing well) when I bring it up to my family they get extremely upset. They said they would tell the rest of our family not to come and would basically disown me if we went through with it without my sister. 
I might get off topic here but I'm literally crying while typing this out. My sister has always been coddled and enabled growing up which can explain why she is the way she is today.

We wouldnt have to tell my family we got married and then we could have a ceremony when she gets out of prison.

193,"Dear Reddit,

  I apologize for any grammar mistakes (I really like commas :) ), it is currently 1:21 AM.  Alright, now that we got that out of the way, let me unload my angst upon the innocent reader. I am in a dark place right now: My dad cheated on my mom, I am overwhelmed with school, and I constantly feel an ungodly amount of stress.

   So, I suppose we should dive into the juice first and foremost. My father. My father recently (august) went on a trip with his father and his uncle to Greece and I believe Germany. While he was there, he began to friend strange women on Facebook; this prompted an immediate reaction from my mother. During this time, my mother and I had just got back from watching my grandfather die of Pancreatic cancer, he had gone into delirium and was a very tragic experience for both of us. Nonetheless, my father vehemently denies he had any sexual contact with these people he had friended on Facebook. So, my mother backs off, and after further pressing, he provides evidence that he hadn't with testimonies from the women he had friended. At that point, my father hadn't had cheated yet. Flash-forward a week and I receive a phone call from my father, informing me he was going to be staying another week in Germany, while his father and brother would be heading back. Obviously, I recognized a problem so I reported the information to my mother. She was baffled by this and immediately called my father. He claimed he had taken too many sick days off and would waste them at home, which was extremely fishy. Anyways, flash-forward again another week and my father comes home; right off the bat, I could tell something was off. He seemed happier, more energetic, and generally excited. He had also purchased a new phone, which had a series of pass-codes on it. At this point, I kinda knew something was up. My mother was fine that night, talking to my father and us like nothing had happened, for we didn't know the truth at this point. On his third night back, my mom had obviously gone into some sort of peril, not talking to me or anyone in my house and crying, crying a lot. She later informed us that night that my father was going to be moving out by the end of the week. She claimed it was due to her not trusting my father, and I fell for it. What I am about to type next, I regret so unbelievably much it hurts. When I got home from school after my mother had told me this, I yelled at her for kicking my dad out, believing it was some sort of marriage squabble. She eventually told me the truth, the truth being that my father had slept with a much younger woman (Who probably wanted his green-card) in Germany, hence why he stayed an extra week. He moved out immediately once I confronted him, although it was peaceful, I guess he couldn't handle it. He left. A week went by, and I handled it surprisingly well, but it didn't hit me until he sent me an email, detailing why he did it, why he still talks to her, and why my mother was the cause of this whole problem. I went into panic, dry heaving and everything (weak moment, I don't normally cry - ever). Well that is stress #1, barely any contact with my dad since, I don't answer his phone calls or texts. This just turned into a sob story, sorry about that. Part 2 will come when I finish APUSH work. Please help me cope.",05Nov2018,1

I do not know why she does this, but she tries so pretend that her life is as/more hard than mine (?) in all instances; if I am talking about a assignment that's giving me trouble, she will start to talk about how hard she has it regarding the one presentation she has in this semester, or it can even be things like ""my knee hurts because I stomped it on something"" and stuff like that. I don't know how to respond to this. She is a person who needs A LOT of recognition and sympathy always, but it feels as if she cannot handle when she thinks someone is trying to get it in stead of her? I don't quite know, because I've never strived to get recognition or sympathy from people, I find it quite annoying when they wanna feel pity for me because that is not constructive. But I really want to stop feeling annoyed by my roommate. This is a huge issue for me, and I have tried rationalizing it when I am feeling annoyed, but it doesn't help the feeling of annoyance go away. I hope you will be able to give me some advice! And if you need any clarification, just ask, as English is my second language (and I'm on mobile)

I do not want to come off as rude but if I’m smelling it other people are smelling it and it’s just crazy how she doesn’t realize.

199,"So my boyfriend 22 and I 22 had had a pretty great relationship. I had learnt during conversations where one of us may be upset he gets so stressed that he wants to escape the conversation in any way, including breaking up. He just doesn’t like confrontation. So we were all good, I was boosting my boyfriends confidence by saying how fit he looked all the time and he began looking after himself better and such as a result. This caught some girls eyes and he did not mind that. He invited me to stay the day of a party, we kissed and flirted and was pretty cute. But he was drinking quite a lot and we went outside to smoke. When outside he had his hand on my waist and we were chatting and I struck up a conversation, when will I next see him one on one? His body language instantly changed and he was saying how busy he was but I kept pushing the point saying but you can make time for me? He had been. But he works at a bar where he gets back at 3am probably 5/7 nights. That day he had spoken to his dad which he doesn’t have such a great relationship with. His dad cheated on his mum and has been a pretty bad relationship model ever since. He told me as he was breaking up with me that I deserved better as he was going to end up like his father and cheat on me and he did not want to hurt me. He was essentially looking at all those other women and thinking he wanted that. He said sex was too easy for him with me, he wanted me and more. I am far from an unattractive girl, I am very pretty and sexy. We were together for 8 months which is first he has ever been with someone for that long. He has been so down recently with this pub job, he wants to move on but has no motivation. He is in bed all day everyday, plays games, goes to work and gets back so early in the morning,plays more games, he never sees his friends as he doesn’t have the time. 
I cannot help but think that this break up he will regret. Will he be back? 
I wonder if his sadness and stuck in a rut since he left university (he got with me at the same time as that), these new girls seem the right path to go. But when he is there, will he realise he lost the girl he did care for and gave so much more than these girls? How do I get him to realise his mistakes? Can I get him back?",05Nov2018,1

202,"Hi everyone 

I have had a really not good past, I was groomed online when I was around 12 and was abused by my dad and uncle. And bullying at school, After being groomed, I started to date people online which resulted in me involving with a few online people, in sexual ways. I am still a virgin, but I have done stuff online which I have heavy regret for. I have only had one irl bf and I did do some sexual stuff, but I didn't want sex because I wasn't ready. We broke up. But yeah I met this guy that I really love and I've never felt this way before, and we've been friends for 6 months now, I told him about my grooming just not the sexual shit I did afterwards and he was very supportive of me saying it wasn't my fault and he doesn't think any differently of me and that h as cares about me. But I am worried I'm not good enough for him, I don't do this online sexual stuff anymore but I still feel a lot of shame.

204,"I feel like this is kind of a pathetic post quite frankly but I'm just totally lost on where to go from here and I'm hoping maybe someone's got some advice on what to do. Long story short: I met a guy and we hit it off really well, but I low key feel like I'm being ghosted and something feels incredibly fishy now. I'm just incredibly confused on, well, everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the story (sorry it's long):

We started talking on Reddit about 4 months ago and moved the conversation to Snapchat shortly after. We've talked just about all day every since with the exception of a few days here and there. After \~3 weeks of chatting we agreed to meet up and spent the entire day together, like 10-12 hours. We ended up hooking up that day although we later established that that was not something either of us had expected/planned to happen. That said, we met up 4 more times after that and hooked up every time. Feelings developed on my part and I was under the very strong impression that they had developed on his part as well. There was lots of heavy flirting, cutesy nicknames, *all the works except for the official label honestly*. He also told me he loved me a few times but they all could easily have been meant as more platonic than romantic I think, and he referred to me as ""his friend"" any time he had to talk about me. Neither of us have met any of the people in each other's lives, but my parents and most of my friends know about him. Meanwhile he's only told me one of his friends knows about me (might be more, he's only mentioned one though). 

The whole time I've known him he's been nothing but kind, polite, respectful, really all around a wonderful person. However he's got some baggage, or at least what I'd call baggage if he had been looking for anything more than just a friendship. He wasn't really up front with said baggage and let the smaller stuff slip out in casual conversation instead of just straight up telling me. He always provided what sounded like a sensible reason for why he didn't share sooner though. Considering we didn't initially start talking with the intention of dating, I let it go because there wasn't really a reason to spill all the beans right off the bat and friendships aren't affected by the smaller baggage he has. But eventually he shared some bigger baggage with me, telling me he didn't share sooner because he was afraid of what I'd think of him and wasn't really sure how to bring it up in the first place (completely understandable, and it didn't change my view of him). 

This is where things start to get weird though. His big baggage story has holes in it. Lots and lots of holes. At least from the pieces he's shared with me. I'd ask for clarification and I'd either get the run around or just come out of it with more questions than I came in with. Prior to this I've never had a good reason not to believe him or otherwise trust him so I kind of just (cautiously) went along with what he said. Regarding said ""big baggage"", it involves him being pretty much unreachable by phone for an unknown but extended amount of time. He warned me of this, told me about it with plenty of time to spare before he's supposed to leave, but was super vague about it. Given the situation (I won't publicly share specifics of why he'll be unreachable), I understood why he wouldn't know how long he'd be gone for. He left me the contact information for someone in his life who would be able to reach him if I needed to reach him (after I asked if we could keep in touch another way) but he pretty much left the ball in my court in that regard, which didn't leave me feeling much like he actually wanted to keep in touch. If he wanted to keep in touch wouldn't he be the one to reach out? He also told me I could continue messaging him and assured/promised me (without my prompting) that he would respond when he comes back, then pretty much said his goodbyes. 

I responded to his last message with a pretty lengthy message that involved some feelings and a few questions just to clear the air a bit because a) I'm under the impression he'll be gone for a very extended period, like 1+ years, and b) I'm not really comfortable leaving things as open ended as they are between us. *Note: he said his goodbyes 2 days before he's scheduled to leave and has not yet left.* He never opened my message but has still been using that app to talk to other people, who he would have no reason to be communicating with via that app at this time-- according to things he's told me, not my own assumptions/judgments. 

&amp;#x200B;

I realize I sound kind of obsessive and insane right now but I genuinely did feel like there was something between us and his behavior right now is not only really uncharacteristic but also really stressing me out because I **hate** being left in the dark like he's doing to me. I'm also kind of offended knowing that he's intentionally going out of his way to ignore me like that. Being busy is fine and totally understandable especially in this situation, assuming he wasn't lying to me about it altogether, but blatantly ignoring me is totally unnecessary and kind of a dick move I think? I just feel like there's something really fishy going on with him but I have no idea what it could be. I've been ghosted before so I know what that's like and this doesn't feel like that, but it still feels really... *off*. 

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do in this situation? Should I just write him off as gone for good? Reach out to the other person at some point and see if I can get in touch with him through them? Just let it go and see if he reaches out somehow first? Something else? Help?",05Nov2018,1
205,"So I met this girl around the start of the college semester, and thought she was nice so we exchanged numbers. Thing is, I don’t see her around and I’m starting to wonder if it’s even worth talking to her. 

I know how this might make me sound, so I’ll say it right now: I am NOT trying to do anything weird or perverted. I simply want to keep in touch with this girl because she’s sweet and nice and I definitely want to stay friends at least. But our schedules are different and I don’t even see her on campus because of that.

I want to know from other people if I should keep trying to stay friends, and how to go about this the right way if so.

211,"Hi all,

My grandma is a lovely 80 yo lady who has been though a lot. And I mean a lot. Im not going to deep into that.
Since her last birthday, she's acting out of the ordinairy. She did tell my mom she wasnt feeling good, also talked to a psychologist (for the first time ever in her life) because she was feeling this way. She didnt like it very much, but this quite fits her personality ;) 
Whats worrying me is that shes putting a lot of thought into ""what if I die"", like fixing financial things and stuff. We were planning to go on a holiday in a few months but she thinks its to early to book now (which is odd, we did the same thing last year). Because of all this I just feel something is very wrong and she is not telling how bad it really is. Im a psychology student and I've worked with highly suicidal patients (the ones that are on 24/7 watch) and all my spidey alarm senses are going wild.
Even though I have this experience, I have zero knowledge of being in this situation myself. But I am worried sick. I dont want to tell this to my mother, because she is very anxious and Im not sure of course. But Im so scared to do nothing because I will blame myself. I want to talk to my grandma but Im scared she will get angry. I really dont know what to do but I cant miss her already. On the other hand I find it difficult because I completely understand why she would feel this way.

214," 

So my dad's been an alcoholic my whole life, but hid it from me as a child, which made me feel like he was nice and caring. But when i got to around 12-14 he started showing his dark side more and more especially around my older brother. I would console him almost every night while he cried in a drunken stupor.

Eventually i moved in full time with my mother, but he refused to pay child support. at the beginning of this year i found out that my father had been growing weed in the house i used to stay in with him, and not only that but he had been getting my older brother to deal the weed for him since he was 15. This lead to someone breaking into my fathers house looking for the weed and ending up stabbing my brother through the shoulder with a crowbar. and since my father was a drunken smoking weed grower he needed money. so who did he decide to rent out a room too? the guy who stabbed my brother with a crow bar...

My father would often purposely harass and wind up my brother to the point he became violent and would then call the police on him, it got to the point that he called the police 12 times in a year, they knew us by name... He has tried to quite his alcohol addiction several times but either relapses or pretends to be sober and lies to me for months. He thinks that he can make me trust him by buying me things. he thinks if he buys me stuff then i will trust him and that it means he loves me. which it does not...

this brings us to now, almost Christmas time and i haven't really talked to my father since last Christmas, when i have i try and end it quickly, and have stopped talking to him outright in the past few months. Now i feel like with Christmas coming around I should at least talk to him online or text him. But I don't really want to see him i don't trust him. I want to ask him for money to help with things in my life since he hasn't been paying child support but at the same time I don't want to talk to him. I really need a new phone as my current one is 5 years old and is dying. would it be rude to ask for some money to help with that? ( i am teen with no job)

Finally, I opened the door for her to get out, but she just pranced around for a second and looked at me.

Why was she trying to get out so bad? I kinda thought its because she was thristy, since this has happened before and she just seemingly wanted water, but I tried giving her water and she just kinda looked at me. I went back into my room and now I'm here, not able to sleep because I'm shook by what happened.

Again, why did she want out so bad? She wasn't hungry, didn't seemingly want to go outside, and didn't want water. We give her a treat in the morning every day and she's been known to complain and whine at the family's doors to get said treat. Maybe she just REALLY wanted it? Addiction or something?

TL;DR: Dog - known for begging for treats and has done this before - clawed at my brother's door just to try to get out. She wasn't hungry or anything when I let her out. Why was she clawing away?

222,"The mostly revolves around a girl I used to go out with. We ended on a bit of a sour note and I never spoke to her for months but recently I started talking to her again and learned that most of the negative things I thought about her were wrong.

Things seemed to be going well apart from the fact that she was still in love with her ex and liked this other guy she’d known for a few years, though I did talk to her and express how I felt like I should probably just leave her alone but she told me that I still had a chance with her. 

Her closest friend who I got to tell me things that they’d been talking about and she brought up the movies, saying that she didn’t want to lead me on but didn’t want to say anything.

Bearing in mind that she was cuddling me during the film and encouraged me to keep trying with her. But her friend said that I asked her if I still had a chance with her back around the first time I hung around her even though I asked her again the week before and she told me yes.

That’s screwing with me but I have my suspicions of my own mental state, as soon and I start to think about leaving her I’m instantly thinking about how to find another girl. I’m becoming aggravated more easily and at one point nearly violent.

223,"Alright, this is my first post here, so I'll try to be as short as I can (even though it probably won't turn out that way). Basically I'm falling for a girl from my university (we're both 20) that I probably can't be. She's from another town but she quickly found her ground here and started hanging out with my friends and me and in the last couple of weeks it's been like every day or every other day (talking about time spent outside the university). Since this is our second year together, I can say I know her okay by now and honestly never found her that appealing even though she is pretty good looking. I found out that I have feelings for her a couple of days back when we were at a friend's place and she was cuddling with one of our friends which of course I didn't think anything of because she's like that with pretty much all of her male friends (even with me hey!). So yeah, after that we head home, that friend she was just cuddling with was supposed to drive and she and I were battling for the front seat for some reason. We come to an agreement that nobody gets it and that we both sit in the back and then she changes her mind and goes for the front instead (I'm like okay whatever). But then the 3 of us while travelling start talking about it. Why does she have to sit in the front etc. And then she says to our friend something like well who's gonna help you find a parking spot and he replies to her like yeah, you're right I need you in the front. I comment sarcastically ""what parking spot, it's not like you're gonna have sex there"" and he replies with something like ""hah, yeah right"". So a few hours later, there I am laying in bed overthinking the shit out of the scenes in the car. Are they in a secret relationship? That's when I get that I'm falling for her because I wouldn't be so agitated about something like that otherwise. The problem is now if I say something to her and it turns out they are in a relationship that would be really awkward and if I say something and they're not in a relationship I could get denied because of our friendship (probably stuck in the friendzone...). Worst thing is I went out with another girl last night that I know would want to be with me (and I thought I wanted to be with her too) but now I find myself in a situation where I don't want what I can have.

We’ve done all the standard things you do when looking for a lost pet (put up signs, alert vets/pound, post in Facebook groups etc.) but I have a horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach that we’ll never see her again.

The bush she ran into is full of highly venomous snakes (in Australia) and the chance she has been bitten is very high, as she would try to play with one if she saw one. There’s a possibility she got lost in there for a day or two, but there are houses all around the perimeter of the forest and she is so friendly she would up to the first person/house she saw. There’s always the possibility that someone has her and isn’t i intending on giving her back, but the chances are small, and it’s a nice neighbourhood she went missing in. We tried to actually go into the forest to find her but it is too dense and too dangerous with the snakes and spiders.

I am completely devastated. My partner is blaming himself because he didn’t tie her up, but it isn’t his fault, it was an accident.

The problem isn't that he was offended but I thought we were good enough friends for him to ask us to stop.

He also seems to be developing functional alcoholism, as he seems to get drunk every night. I actually can't remember a night he was completely sober. He says its to deal with his anxiety but it's making him into an asshole some nights and I just don't know what to say to make him realize that.

This also the second incident where he's suddenly blown up about something. The first time around he was angry at a friend of ours and left the PSN party, made his own and invited only me. I told him to wait because I was in the middle of helping someone and I wanted him to cool off, but he got even more pissed off, ending in him deleting, blocking me in every way possible.

235,"so my dad recently returnee from overseas. things were pretty chill except every night he keeps trying to get me to off my phone too early. things escalated and eventually he tried walking off and i mentioned some shit that happened last year with me suicidal and a lot of counseling and police involvement 

he then walks back into my room and starts trying to beat me (he hasnt attempted this in ages, it isnt nornal)

I get really possed and adrenaline rising and shit, get up, tackle him across the room to my brothers bed, kick him while were both down and then kick him of the bed. a small grapple after and then my mom splits is us up. he walks off trying to get a weapon, and im preparing. my mom stops him and he doesnt do anything more, but he says he will disown me. my parents are traditional so actually getting physical is way beyond taboo for them.

so well now hes telling me not to return when i get out tomorrow morning. i dont have any special attachment to my family so i dont mind personally, but what the fuck am i supposed to do now?

I need advice for a good name for my twitch account I want to stream on. I kept thinking about a name for hours but I just can't seem to get a good one.

239,"So this probably asked a lot on Reddit (I am very new to Reddit) but I need some advice if I should ask this girl out. Let's call her Jessica. Jessica is amazing, she works hard, she is driven, she loves dogs and fosters them, she loves art, we make each other laugh so much, and she loves memes y'all. I hang out at her place sometimes and it's great. Honestly as friends it's amazing, I  wouldn't be upset if we stayed friends because she is just so awesome. But since last year I have had a crush on Jessica. We actually met the day my ex broke up with me, which was weird tbh. After like 7 weeks I even told her that I liked her, I asked her out on a date (she said yes) and she left the country like a week after that for school, so it never happened. She came back for work and we text each other a lot and we try to hang when we can. She is very busy, bc of work and other stuff too. But I still have a huge crush on her and I want to tell her. Though I have this feeling that I feel like I shouldn't bother her with this because she is so busy all the time and it just seems like my feelings would get in the way or a relationship isn't what she needs rn. I am not saying I know what she needs, but I feel like I shouldn't have to take up more of her time that she already does. In the end I just want her to be happy. But if anyone could give me some advice on whether or not it might be a good idea to ask her out or not? Maybe even tell her how I feel.

P.S. Jessica is gorgeous and super out of my league. I am going to be generous with myself, but I am overweight, but I dont necessarily have a big gut, I am 6 foot but I would say I am full guy? Not fat but dense if that makes sense. Totally out of her league though. Like she is this super attractive person and I am me lol

240,"I've realized lately that with my depression, I've gotten into a bad habit of stress/binge eating, and since I usually don't have the motivation to drag myself to the Cafeteria, it's mostly junk from the vending machines. I used to be a very tiny girl, weighing around 90-110 lbs (though 90 was underweight) and now alternate between 140-145 lbs at any given time. I'm 5'2 and have a naturally short torso/stomach so the weight I've put on has become pretty noticeable to me  and everyday when I look in the mirror, all I can think about is how much I hate what I see. Some people tell me I'm overexaggerating, but the effect it has on my self esteem isn't an illusion. I'd like to drop atleast 25-30 pounds total, but don't what timeframe or regimen is most realistic for that.

Number one thing I'm gonna do is only drink water (which I should technically do anyway with my kidney disease, something that somewhat contributes to the weight gain), and I'm gonna try to stop with the junk food. Aside from yogurt, I'm going to try to avoid excess sugar, or sugar at all if I can help it, though that's also gonna be difficult with my stress-induced sleep schedule. I figure I'll try to hold to this for a month, hard as it'll be, and figure out where to go from there.

The thing I need the most advice on is a little more information about possible dietary and exercise routines. I wanna try to get some healthier alternatives for my snacking habit like fruit or yogurt, but don't know what else would be optimal. Exercise is another thing. I actually have access to a Free Gym (well, free if you're not counting all the debt I'm in to be here), but I don't know what kind of exercise or duration would be good for achieving my goals. I was hoping to hit the gym for atleast 30 minutes between classes on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday this week, and maybe move up to an hour depending on how I feel (my asthma, anemia, back/hip problems and occasional kidney pain sometimes make strenuous activity pretty painful/tiring/difficult). I'm not sure if that's a decent schedule or not. 

If you can't tell I'm pretty uneducated on how all of this works because for most of my life, my main issue has been GAINING weight rather than losing it, so this is relatively new territory for me. On top of the fact that I'm finally gonna try out some counseling for my mental health issues, I figure this is just **something** I can do to hate myself a little less. At the end of the day, I'm still gonna have my small boobs, cleft chin, and stubby stomach, among other things, but maybe I'll be able to look at myself and feel a little bit better about who I am. For all I know, I could get out of class today, give into my shitty tendencies, and convince myself it's not worth it. But I want to try. Anyway, sorry for the book. I'd appreciate any advice you can offer!

243,"I'm a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it so idk. Also when I only got a pub job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me horribly. All this in a bad way? When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘how did you apply for there then?’ 

Edit: she started saying the ‘awww’when I’d get up to leave after I failed an interview for not having enough confidence but I usually would say ‘oh ok thank you’ is maybe why? ",05Nov2018,1

245,"For 2 years now I talk on a daily basis with a really great friend [36M] who lives in another state. We have met in 2013 on social media but from 2016 till now we talk basically everyday, almost all day. When we met he had a girlfriend and I never acted like I wanted more than friendship and neither did him. He broke up last year and well, friendship continued. I realized I was a bit in love with him but never acted on it, just convinced myself I was really attached to the habit of talking to him because he is a really nice person. 

In the beginning of this year I started to feel we were closer, but still really good friends only. He is an introvert and he never made a move on me and I used to think its because of that. Out of a sudden he starts getting distant. He one day tells me he got back with his ex and was then living in my state, really near me, with her. Only then I realized I liked him because I spent about 3 hours crying and was really hurt by the fact that he never made an attempt to see me in person but was now near me because of his girlfriend.

well, they then breakup (3 months later) because he is a celibatary (i am also a catholic so its ok for me) but the ex was not. We then got closer than ever, with him frequently saying we would do things together when he is around and acting like the sweetest person ever. Again, no REAL moves from my side or his. He mentioned wanting to come back to my state and that he would want to see me and stuff. I was really happy and engaged and now... he is distant again. 

I honestly dont know what to do anymore and feel 0 comfortable asking about it because we never reached the kind of intimacy where we would just ask the other clearly this kind of thing. He didnt even tell me he broke up with the ex, I just knew on the Internet. I honestly dont understand his feelings, what he is after, whether he likes me or not etc etc. Its all a blur and I dont WANT to ask because I dont want to ruin our friendship. But my anxiety is killing me now that he is all distant again. I imagine a hundred of scenarios and possibilities :( 

I also feel like this whole thing blocks me from trying to meet and like other guys because i feel he  is ""the perfect one"" for me. So now I basically am spending the days really anxious checking my phone and trying to figure out if I should talk or should not, what to say, how to try and make him engage on talking to me like 1 week ago he was doing. All this constant worrying is suffocating me.

How can I get rid of the passion part and just keep a nice, stable friendship with no feelings attached? :(",05Nov2018,1

So when I(21F) was 15 I met John(24M) and he was 18. I was shunned by him and his friends because I got drunk and they had sex with me. John was really nice to me before all that happened then ignored me. I was bullied at school by the popular kids that partied. They would pick apart my looks daily 


I still feel like I’m ugly. That’s why I kept hooking up with John. He wouldn’t respond much to me and only contact me for sex. He joined the military left for boot camp. When he got back we hooked up and hung out. I would send him photos and we would talk once a week.

But I knew that he didn’t want me telling people I talk to him because his friends said I was gross. He would always say I was pretty or attractive. When we first had sex that time I was drunk he said mean things about me after.

It’s been six years he would try to cheat on his girlfriends with me. One time he did but I didn’t know they were dating. He took photos of me while we were hooking up. He still keeps them.

Two and half years in I left the country. My phone broke, when I get back I see he sent me 30 messages. He also posted passive aggressive things online “ if you have to think if I care about you I probably don’t. Fuck everyone “ is what he posted. He got a new girlfriend. He told me he felt no connection to me that he wanted me for sex and nothing more.


I still feel worthless because of this . I haven’t seen him in person since. I would talk to him sometimes then put my foot down and go no contact. He got a new girlfriend and left me alone for seven months.  Then he starts blowing up my phone. I tell him I don’t feel comfortable talking to him with a girlfriend.

He sends me a messages everyday for weeks begging me to talk to him. He asks if he was single if we would be cool. Two weeks later he actually breaks up with his girlfriend and texts me that. I keep ignoring. He sends me the photos from two years ago of us hooking up saying “don’t you miss this”. I’m scared I talk to him a little a couple weeks later.


He then has a new girlfriend and doesn’t want to talk to me. He leaves me alone for eight months. He was getting out of the military. I hear that he is moving to a new state with his girlfriend. Before he moves he sends me a ton of messages asking me to just talk to him one last time. He still keeps the photos of me. Then he try’s to FaceTime 23 times and I just do it so he’ll leave me alone. That was three months ago.


Now he’s messaging me to email him. He keeps saying just send him photos then he’ll leave me alone. I say I don’t want to hookup. He says he just wants photos. I haven’t seen him in three years. I’m scared to block him because he has photos of me and acts crazy. He has a girlfriend and she’s pretty.


I think I’m damaged goods because of the bullying. I think no guy would want a girl that’s done “that”. I think that if I was prettier or not a slut he would treat me better. I think I deserve the way he’s treating me because I’m weird and not attractive.




Does he treat me this way because I’m ugly? Is it my fault because of the way I look? Why does he do this? What’s wrong with me?

249,"Hello there! 
I have an issue regarding my Airbnb stay of last week and before asking for resolution I wanted to check here if someone might be able to give me a hint if this is stupid or not.

So I had rented an Airbnb in Boston for 2 nights last week, where I wanted to spend my fiancés birthday with her and just have a nice time. She is studying in Boston, I’m from Germany.
So we arrived roughly at 1 am on her birthday and decided to get a good night of sleep. When we entered the room, we immediately noticed the high room temperature and the hissing noise in the air. I did not record the temperature, but I would guess it was at least around 24 degrees Celsius. After investigating, we found that it came from the heater. I’m not an expert on heaters at all, but in the place where there would normally be a valve there was just the nozzle with a stream of hot steam coming out of it and very hot water dripping down the whole thing. I made a video of the thing, yet the steam and the water are not really visible but you can definitely hear them in the footage.
There was no way to turn it off and the temperature and the noise made sleeping impossible. Opening the window to cool down the room was also not an option, as the room was facing the highway, furthermore increasing the noise in the room.
I immediately messaged the Airbnb owner and asked them about the situation (and whether the heater was actually broken).
Since it was in the middle of the night, they didn’t reply straight away.
No where had been any information on either the noise nor the broken heater beforehand.
Since it was too loud to fall asleep and we were very exhausted from working that day, we had to find another place to stay. Luckily my fiancés coop gave us the option of using the guest room. We arrived at around 3 am and needless to say the birthday mood was sort of ruined. When I returned the next day to fetch my stuff the heater was still running.
Later that day I also got a reply by the owner that the heater was broken and that that was ”how it works“.
I only arrived back at home yesterday and I didn’t have data while being in the US. 

Maybe some of you could help me out what to do next as I’m ignorant about Airbnb‘s customer policy.
What are my options now? 
What is your advice on this?

I’ve been absolute best friends with this girl for a while now.  We play games together, hang out at each others houses, talk about things we’d never share with another soul, etc.  We’re the classic best bud duo.

We are both 20 years old. I have zero relationship experience prior to my boyfriend of 1 year.

 A few months back I teased him that I could find him on Twitter very easily bullying people or whatever. I couldn't sleep and I was bored so I thought I could try finding him by looking up his old highschool and finding people that graduated the same year as him.

Well, I found him pretty easily and curiosity got the better of me so I kept reading his old tweets until I eventually came to some photos and tweets at his ex girlfriend. They were really sweet and I think that this is the first point in our relationship where I genuinely felt jealous. I recognize that there were issues in the relationship that caused the relationship to end in the first place but still. 

I feel guilty for snooping around. I've done something similar as a joke to a friend once and they found it very creepy. I want to bring it up to him because I don't think it's fair for me to think of things like ""hey, let's not go this beach for no reason at all"" when in reality it's because I saw a picture of them together there. It also feels hard because that relationship is still a bit of a sore spot for him.

3 weeks ago I had 1 short 3 hour shift and the last 2 weeks I've had none at all. At my last shift my coworker said to expect less work because business dies down during the colder months.

I'm a bit intimidated to ask my employer because almost all of the staff speak a non-English language, that I don't understand.

I have an hour to kill, why not. So I did. I felt like she was a little bit odd and maybe she just needs someone to talk to. At the end, she asked for my number. I reluctantly gave it to her. Then she texted me the next day and the next day and the next asking me how I was, what I was doing, etc... I really hate those kinds of conversations. I hate talking on the phone when I am trying to get to know someone... I think that stuff should be done in person or over a common interest. But we really didn’t have a common interest. But what bothered me the most was that she was being really clingy. And if I didn’t answer her back, I felt rude, because she was very persistent. In hind sight I probably shouldn’t have given her my number. But I ended up blocking her number because it was getting annoying. Same thing is happening to me with another girl... 4 years younger than me. I feel like she maybe has a hard time making friends and I’ve been there too. Honestly making friends is hard so I tried to be there for her and talk with her. But every now and then she messages me. “Hey I haven’t talked to you in a while. How are you?” Or like, “hey I missed you.” And my response to that is really that I don’t care. It sounds mean, but I don’t want to be fake. I don’t like those conversations. “Hi how are you... I’m fine how are you... I’m good.... school is good. Hbu? Etc...” it is a drag.

I've been told when I turned 18 that I would be put on waitressing shifts, which i've wanted to do for a long time. So when my birthday ROLLS AROUND, nobody at my job acknowledges it, even though we are allfriends on facebook and they get a notification that its my birthday. Kinda hurts, bur whatever. My bosses never acknowledged that I turned 18, so I kept bussing for a few months, hoping theyd notice and possibly need someone to serve. I've mentioned it a few times that I was interested in serving. So eventually i get the opportunity to cover another servers shift and i make over 20% tips on average which is good, and my boss congratulates me and a few days later asks me for my avalibility (which is pretty much everyday ) so she can start me on serving shifts. At this point i am VERY HAPPY, i feel like my work has paid off. Then i see my boss post that my job is looking for a server. I brush it by, thinking its in addition to the shifts i'll be working. So I cover a sunday shift, make over $200. Very happy. I'm a college student so this money is needed. And my boss tells me (last week) that she wants me to work permanently on sundays. at this point, she still hasnt put me on any serving shifts so i express that i'm happy and continue my bussing shift.

So I drive 2 hours in the dark home on saturday, giving up time with my boyfriend who i rarely see and a party i really wanted to go to. I come in to work at 9, and I see the new server there. I get sent home, and i'm told that my boss ""redid the schedule"" and i dont work until 4. At this point i'm PISSED. Because i work two days a week and theyre both bussing. I keep calm and go home thinking i'll talk to my boss later about it. I'm very let down. Basically, she told me i was getting a shift and then put the newly hired person on that shift (she works other days as well). So my later shift goes by and me and my boss dont talk at all. I'm pretty scared to talk to her - i dont know what it is, but i've never been able to be close with someone in authority. I'm also very scared of confronting people. I know i should but its often difficult for me. I don't know what to do. I need money, its hard to find other places hiring - especially servers, they usually require you to bus first - but the new girl didnt have to bus and i heard her interview was basically nonexistent.

The other person is a total nightmare. She sings. She dances. She whistles. She loudly talks to herself about anything and everything. Everything she does is conducted at maximum volume. Last week she burst in through the door, threw her notebook across the room and then proceeded to sing and dance across the room to her desk. Occasionally she’s made some pretty inappropriate comments about her pussy and her ass and it make me kinda uncomfortable. 

My nerves are shot. I’ve hardly been here but the constant noise is making me really miserable. Especially since I’m new and trying to concentrate on what I’m doing. 

I spoke to my line manager and they told me that I should speak to the loud person myself and ask them to please try and limit their volume. 

Any advice on how to go about this is greatly appreciated. ",05Nov2018,1
264,"On Saturday night myself and friends were out celebrating a birthday. I was extremely drunk to the point where I can’t really remember much about the night however I bumped into a group of guys and said something about one of their mothers. 

Things got heated and a fight broke out, I got knocked clean out and now have a chipped tooth but my friend has 3 chipped teeth and a fractured nose. 

Obviously I felt like complete shit for causing this to happen and have apologised profusely to all of my friends involved. 

Come Sunday night I get a message on Facebook from the guy who we got into the fight with apologising for it, saying things got heated and when I walked away he should have left it at that. 

I told my friends that he sent this and they are wanting to go to the police with this information so he can be dealt with by the authorities. 

However the guy who beat us up and his mates are the local hard nuts who think they’re gangsters and will get into a scrap for the sake of it so if they found out that I screenshotted the messages he sent to me and my friends go to the police with them there’s a chance that they’ll come after us again. 

Is it worth it? I’m from the UK if that is of any relevance. ",05Nov2018,1
265,"I am a team truck driver (one person sleeps while the other drives and swap every 12 hours or so). I recently got a new partner about two weeks ago. The first trip we took we went to her house so she could pick up the rest of her belongings. I walk in on her doing heroin. She didn't try to hide it or anything and claims it's a once every couple of months type of thing. I made sure it was over 24 hours before she drove again. A day later I caught her doing it while I was driving. I stopped and am kind of freaked out. My original plan was the next time we're at the terminal to just pack up my stuff and refuse to drive with her again and not say why. I don't really want to tell on someone and get them fired, but is it the morally right thing to do?",05Nov2018,1
266,"So I just told the girl I like that I had feelings for her. And they’ve been there for a number of years. However, I knew how she felt but felt it wasn’t fair to me or to her to hide it any longer. 
She said that I mean a lot to her, but I fit in really well with her family and she sees me as more of a brother than anything. She said I mean a lot to her but not in that way. 

I’m pretty cut up even though I knew it was coming. I’m not angry at her in any way at all because I know that’s her decision and I totally respect it. 

At the same time, I’m angry at myself but I don’t know why. I’m just having a pretty bad time dealing with it. 

So to my main point, how do you get over it? I can’t help thinking of the what if’s and maybes and I know it ain’t doing me any good.

“It  is pending status and payment just be blocked now.

280,"So I share a house with a friend of mine, and it has a single garage, and two bedrooms (the master has an ensuite bathroom). Originally, in a previous place we shared my friend got the master bedroom (larger, +ensuite) as well as a single garage lockup for $10 more weekly rent than I paid. I knew of a few people also house sharing who paid $10 or so more for just the master bedroom, so when our lease expired and we moved to a new place I broached the idea that seeing as we both have cars, and he made it quite clear he still wanted to master bedroom (even though I suggested that I wouldn't mind having it this time around), perhaps we could re-evaluate the split. He suggest then that we keep the same money contribution, but I get the garage this time around (as his vehicle wouldn't fit anyway).

Great, I think.

Problem is, he has something of a project bike. So when we first move in, he says, ""Hey, just for a few days until I can get this thing back together can I store it in the garage?"" to which I say ""Sure'. Problem is, now he's kind of realised he doesn't have a place to put it, and despite saying originally that he'd just park it outside or leave it at his parent's place, its now got permanent residence inside the garage, which does not have space for anything else.

Including my car.

And in the one or two times I've brought up how I'm still in the same situation I was before, he goes ""Oh well I mean I pay $10 more/week anyway so yeah"".

My best friend of 8 years was the first person I tried to talk to, I asked if we could talk and I didn’t even check the message until 5 days latter where  I told him it was something stupid and I was drunk. We chatted to a bit and something seemed off he just was acting weird so I leveled with him and asked how good are friend are we, I thought we were best friends still since it’s been 2 months since we last hung out but we were just busy. I was taken back when he said goodish friends, I was kinda confused. and inquired, he told me that’s it’s weird we never hang out any more and I don’t really have any time college my job and my girlfriend don’t leave any time for me to hang out, I tried suggesting that we can plan ahead or something, he told me that  he doesn’t know, literally all his time is. Occupied, I kinda then realized that he had to many things to manage and not enough time , so. He cut me out. I was not mad at him because I can’t fault him for making a decision as it’s his life but it hurt pretty bad.

My dad was having a memorial and I asked him if he wanted to come with  since I could really use a friend. I did not tell him it was my dads memorial. He kept asking more and more questions and I was trying to avoid them, eventually I snapped, I told him how my dad died in the hospital and that’s why I hit him up five days ago, but I didn’t. Tell you since I knew something was off. I told him how, all I wanted was for us to be the team of bestfriends  that we were back in highschool. I even told him something that even my family doesn’t know, I had a chance to visit my dad but since he was in critical condition, I didn’t want to see him like that because I was scared and selfish. The doc told me the next day that he is getting better, so I planned to see him on  Monday, my mom told me that my dad  was waiting for me and was excited to see me since we always talk about music. That never happened, I got a call at 1 am it was my sister and all she said was “dads dead”. And I told him how I feel overwhelming guilt, my dads died waiting. For me, I let him down and  I can’t forgive myself for not seeing him sooner. My friend was supporting me and trying to comfort me.

He begin talking about how even though we aren’t. As close as we were I’m still one of his best friends since our history together. He eventually told me that we should talk in person sometime.  He began talking about how he wants to help and that he cares. I told him that I’m not interested In help if it’s pity, just let me know so we now know there will be no hard feelings. But he assured me he genuinely cares and wants to help me get though this.  

He began talking about how we should hang and talk sometime. And that if I need anything to let him know. Eventuality he told me that He will do his best to help me but he is dealing with some problems of his own. I told him that even though I’m a angry mess I would be more than happy to listen and try and help him with his problems. 

I want to believe that his is sincere and means it when he says he cares, but I’m not blind to the possibility of pity. Anyone have advice on how to handle this or if you think its Pity or caring,? Both advice and  thoughts are greatly appreciated.

293,"This is really long... I am still trying to process everything. If you feel like reading a saga  I could really use your help. 

I went to a really intense arts school- it was like a pressure cooker. I have two best girlfriends that I made at school, let's call them Chrissy and Jemma. A lot happened at school, but as a quick round up-

Chrissy dates Zach, he breaks up with her and breaks her heart. She cries about it with me and Jemma every day for weeks. 

I walk out of my room in the apartment I share with Jemma one morning to discover a pair of Zach's shoes... and then Zach, coming out of Jemma's room half naked. He and Jemma are pretty relaxed and giggly about me finding out. I feel... less relaxed. I talk to Jemma later that day and tell her she has to tell Chrissy, because it is definitely going to be a big deal to her. Jemma brushes me off, and continues to do so for weeks. I warn her that if she doesn't tell Chrissy, I will- as her friend I can't keep something like this for her, and in a similar situation I would do the same for Jemma. Another week or so passes, and I keep my word. Everything goes nuclear, and our circle of friends splits into team Chrissy and team Jemma. It sucks.

The next year - Chrissy and Jemma are still not talking, and over this school year Jemma's mental health deteriorates to the point that she is kicking holes in the doors in our apartment and shoving an entire broken glass down the drain rather than dealing with it (a long story on its own - like I said, we were in a pressure cooker and it got to all of us in different ways. I ended up moving out for our senior year). 

Chrissy starts dating our mutual friend Tom and I am all for it! They are electric together, so much fun to be around, and my best friends. We spend all of our time together, inside and outside of school. However, after a few months, Chrissy and Tom start to fight. It isn't normal fighting. I was there for a lot of it, and I saw the text messages. Tom was calling her a slut, a cunt, a bitch. He was telling her she was overweight and ugly, that she was a slut for not wearing a bra. One night he was dropping us off at her house in the middle of an argument and as she tried to leave the passenger side door (I was still sitting in the back) he gunned it. I'm not exaggerating when I saw she could have died that night. Textbook abuse.

It all comes to a head in the last week of classes. Chrissy had already been wanting to break up with him, and had been encouraged by me and others to do so, but it hadn't happened yet. She and Tom had plans to study abroad together the next semester and they leave in the middle of the summer, so time is ticking. The three of us got lunch at a little burger joint, where Tom decided to have a screaming fit. It was so out of nowhere I can't even remember what he was mad about. Chrissy and I got out of there and she broke down. She and I spent the day with another friend, Brielle, making a plan to get Chrissy safe and away from Tom. I leave Chrissy and Brielle at their apartment, feeling hopeful. 

The next day Chrissy and Tom show up at my doorstep. With her head down, Chrissy tells me that I don't have the right impression of their relationship, that she's ""done fucked up shit too"" and that they are working it out. I tell them point plank that I can't support their relationship anymore when it is clearly so bad for them, and that I don't think they should go abroad together. They leave. Chrissy sends me the most hurtful text I have ever received, telling me how it is my fault that she and Nick are having relationship problems and that I am a bad friend. The next time I hear from her is when she called me to tearfully apologize on New Year's Eve.

Okay WOW so that is some of the background... Fast forward to a few months ago. Chrissy and Jemma live in the same city, I live on the opposite coast. I go to visit them each independently, and some other friends and family. And then in an awesome surprise, Jemma and Chrissy have made up, and they greet me together to hang out!! These girls, two of my best friends who I have been through so much with, are finally friends with each other again, 4 years after the Zach debacle. We are all over the moon. I return home and see all of the social media posts they make together. They are really hanging out!!

I return to their city for another visit a few months later. My boyfriend James and I meet them at a super hip bar past 1 in the morning. We have to wait 35 minutes to get in- not really something we are used to doing! We find Chrissy, her cousins, our other friend Lucy, and a perturbed Jemma in the crowded bar. Another friend, Brooke, had already left. Jemma says to me ""This has been a weird night... Chrissy and her cousins took us to a super fratty bar. Brooke had to leave cause the vibes were so bad. I'm glad you're here."" Not a great sign. But everything goes well at the first bar. Alcohol is consumed. So is a little blow.

We get outside to the street and suddenly Chrissy and her cousins are getting into a cab, and Chrissy is yelling instructions to us to meet at a bar halfway across town. It is past 2 am, the rest of us were expecting to grab some food and head home. I yell back that we can go that far from where we are staying, and we're gonna stay here and get food if they want to come. They abandon the cab.

We all make our way up the block and into a group of fun, drunk strangers. I split off to talk to Lucy, who it turns out is not in a good place, and starts to cry. For the next 2 hours Jemma and I comfort and console Lucy on the street, while the rest of our group has joined the impromptu street party. At one point Chrissy comes up to us and we start to explain what Lucy has been going through but she just... Doesn't hear it. She laughs to us about the girl she just made out with and then leaves, without even acknowledging her friend in hysterics in front of her. The next time we see her she is in the back of a cab driving away.

Jemma is pissed, Brooke was so pissed she left early, Lucy is heartbroken. I text Chrissy and explain why people are upset, and that I totally understand getting blackout and that we have all been there, but that she wasn't acting like herself at all, and it really scared us. We are more worried than anything, we want to make sure that she is okay, and that the booze and cocaine aren't messing with her. I was careful to tell her how much I love her, and that  this didn't have an effect on the way I feel about her. I texted Jemma to update her, because we had agreed that I would try to talk to Chrissy first, and then Jemma would.

It's a month later and I haven't gotten a response from either of them, even after checking in multiple times. They post a new picture together on Instagram every day. I feel like a total jackass for putting so much effort in, and I simultaneously worry that I am the bad friend in all of this. Right now I am just staying quiet, even though I want to ask them what is going on, and if they are mad at me.

She doesn’t know I have depression, but lately is has gotten so bad that I’ve been having suicidal thoughts and depression is affecting my daily life.

299,"I'm trying to lose weight. I've tried before, but I was never really too bothered, now my weight is starting to make my knees hurt, and is causing me back pains, though, which I really don't like, and I don't want a heart attack, and I want to look hotter, and I'm going to need to fit into my brother's old Halloween costume, so...

I'm trying to make exercising a habit, and I'm trying to do a lot of it, but I can't diet, I have terrible self control, and it doesn't help that my mum buys extremely unhealthy foods, I asked her to stop buying them, and to buy healthier things, but she won't. So I'll just have to work on that self control thing.

When I started highschool, before I was homeschooled, I lost weight really, really fast, (My mum had to keep buying smaller clothes for me. It made me really happy.) but that's because I had to walk from one side of a large school to the other multiple times every day, which I can't do anymore because I'm home schooled.

Anyway, it's going to take ages to lose weight, yes, I have the time, but I reeeeeeally don't want it to take that long. So how do I speed this whole thing up?",05Nov2018,1

303,"I apologize if this may be long, I’ll try to condense it. I really don’t have anyone to give me advice on this, as all of my friends are not independent, still live at home, or are in school.

I’m 22, my bf is 26. I recently graduated, and just got a job in my career (33k starting). My bf has a stable career, and makes 55k. While we are a team, I like to be as financially independent from him as possible. We currently live with one of his friends/co workers in a condo. We each have our own floor/private bath, and a shared kitchen. Since we are friends, we only pay $700/month in rent, split between my bf and I. Aka, VERY affordable putting me in a good position to save. Only downside is we both commute 1hr+ back and forth to work each day.

Our roommate is a toxic person. He has anger issues and is very unkind when angered. He also has relationship issues and cheats on each gf he has. To make things worse, my bf has gotten several promotions, while he still hasn’t gotten his first, making him VERY bitter towards my bf due to being insecure. Typically we mind our own business and live as roommates, not friends. Occasionally, the boys get into an argument, and the first thing our roommate does is to threaten to kick us out in 30 days. He also says hurtful things to try and interfere with our relationship (ie. accusing people of cheating). He really isn’t the best, but if we stay as distant as we can, the living situation is fine. 

Recently he crossed the line and we are tired of the constant threats to be kicked out over things that don’t even involve our living situation (like work life/jealousy). After each argument, 2 days later he acts like it never happened without and confrontation or apology. We started looking at other places, and found a nice place with great perks, such as 10min away from work,  for $1200 including utilities. It’s doable, but we are both really nervous to leave out currently very cheap living situation where we can easily pay other liabilities and still save.

Would I be able to get some advice on the situation? We aren’t sure if we should suck it up and ignore him, or move to a nicer, better/MUCH closer place, but doubling our price in rent each. ",05Nov2018,1
304,"So, some background - this year I joined a summer internship program with a major tech corporation, and later extended my contract.

Before the internship I had no work experience at all, and I accepted a really low wage. After the internship I got a 40% raise, but I've done some research, and people with my level of competence still make 30-40% more then me.

Now I have tasks that require more skill and responsibility then before, so I think I'm justified to ask for a raise to at least match the mean level, but I'm not sure if it's possible 2 months after the first raise.

306," 
I'm looking for honest opinions and thoughts. Thank you in advance!

background on the friendship: I'm a 22y male and my friend is a 22y female. We've been close friends for five years. three years ago we had a fling. we admitted our feelings for each other. We would flirt, hang out all the time, and have a lot of sex. this fling eventually came to an end a few months after because her and her boyfriend got back together (they were broken up while we had a thing). Our friendship suffered for a little bit, but after some time we talked things out and our friendship was stronger than ever. 

It wasn't until a few weeks ago that things changed. We were hanging out, ended up getting drunk, and began talking about how we have both been craving sex lately. My friend also mentioned how her relationship with her bf wasn't really a relationship anymore and that they were more like friends. She said that they haven't had sex in months and how things are just weird with him.

After that night, I began thinking that if we both have been craving sex, we could have sex with each other. I decided that it would be best to talk to her in person about this. we lightly talked about it over snapchat and she said she was interested in hooking up with me but that we should definitely talk in person. So we made plans to talk in person.

The day came for us to talk. we went to my place and made drinks. we were both feeling a bit buzzed when we finally began talking about the whole sex thing. i jokingly told her how i didn't want to talk about this while under the influence but we were already here so.. why not! 
 i remember her saying that she was down to hook up, she just didn't want our friendship to change (like it did years ago) and that she didn't want anyone to find out. i told her i felt the same way and that this would stay between us.

we began making out until we decided to go to the nearest room and have sex. by this time we were both pretty drunk. I was nervous because i hadn't sex in a while and i wanted to make sure she felt comfortable and safe. I asked her multiple times if she was okay with us doing this. she told me that she wanted this and was pretty persistent on us doing it (as was i). 

so we had sex and that was that. 

The next day after she'd gone home, i messaged her telling her that I was sorry that I couldn’t get her off and that I don’t want her to think I was trying to hook up just because I was drunk. She replied telling me that I had nothing to worry about and that I was “wonderful” last night.

The following days is when things got complicated. She messaged me telling me that she was SEVERELY concerned about me telling people about our hook up. She struggles with anxiety so I was trying to give her a lot of reassurance about how I wouldn’t tell anyone our business and that everything would be okay. As the days went on she became more concerned. We met up to talk one afternoon because she said she was having a breakdown. 

When we met up to talk, she was really anxious and it broke my heart. She vented about how she usually doesn’t do hook ups and how she wouldn’t have done it if she was sober.

This is when it all kind of came full circle for me. We clearly were not on the same page about the hook up. I hooked up with her because I wanted to have sex and because I’m comfortable with her. She hooked up with me because she was drunk (?). She told me that we didn’t do anything wrong and that none of this was my fault but that the timing and circumstances of it all weren’t “ideal.”

I could tell that this was eating her alive so I told her that I was sorry if I overstepped any boundaries or hurt her in any way. She reminded me that I had nothing to worry about.

The days went on and we decided to meet up to talk about the situation later in the week for one last time so that we could put it to rest and move on. This conversation never happened.

The last day I talked to her we were having a casual chat over snapchat. I replied to something she said and noticed that she hadn’t replied in 2-3 hours. This was odd because she was usually really quick to respond. Eventually, I saw that I couldn’t click on our chat for some reason. I decided to message her on facebook but then I realized that I couldn’t look her up either. I got worried so I texted her asking if everything was okay. 

She replied saying “Hey, I really need to take some time to focus on myself and take care of myself. I’m taking a break from social media to focus on getting better. This friendship isn’t healthy right now and I need to be by myself. I’m sorry to be doing it this way. I wish you the best” i was confused but also understood her in a way. I replied with “okay. If you ever need anything, I’m here for you. Take care.”

That was the last time we talked. 
I was reflecting on how everything went down and wanted to see if she was active again on social media. I tried looking her up on Facebook and she still wouldn’t come up. I asked another friend to look her up for me to see if she had blocked me. When my friend looked her up, her account appeared. This mean she blocked me. Out of curiosity, I looked up her bf (?) And couldn’t find his account either so I had my friend look him up as well. My friend looked him up and there he was. This means he blocked me as well. This is when I began getting really worried. I found it really odd that my friend AND her bf had both blocked me (mind you I have never been friends with her bf because he doesn’t like me because he knows of our history from years ago). 

I began thinking about what could’ve possibly happened that morning that we last talked that made her cut off contact with me so quickly ESPECIALLY since we had plans to meet up a few days later. Did she have a breakdown and confessed to her bf? 

Even her sister deleted me off facebook, which is really odd considering NO ONE was supposed to know about the hook up and my friend was incredibly concerned about me telling others?

One of my friends could tell that I was stressed and asked me what was going on. This friend lives in another state so I decided to tell her the truth. I explained what went down and she was pretty disappointed in me. 

She says that she’s surprised I can’t see what went wrong. She said that she wouldn’t be surprised if my friend decides to say I sexually abused her or something like that?!

Now I’m left wondering if I really fucked up or if this was just two friends who made the wrong decision while under the influence. I really don’t want to hurt my friend and I’m afraid that the friendship could be ruined. I don’t have plans to reach out to her anytime soon because I know she needs time to heal. I hope that a few months down the line I can reach out and try to mend things.

Should I keep giving her time? Did I really mess up? What should I even do? Thank you the help friends.",05Nov2018,1

308,"Hi everyone, I’m currently a sophomore in nursing school at a pretty big college in New England and I’m really struggling to get through. I decided I wanted to be a nurse when I was about 16. My mom is a nurse so I think that definitely influenced my decision to go into nursing. Last year, I completely convinced myself that nursing wasn’t the profession for me and I was going to switch my major. I set up an advising appointment and everything, but I changed my mind at the last minute. Everyone was telling me that they think I’m truly meant to be a nurse, but it was my own decision. Later on, I was glad that I changed my mind and stuck with nursing. Ever since then, I go through periods where I get really down and stressed and think that I’m just not meant to be a nurse. I’m now a little more than halfway through my first semester of sophomore year and really questioning myself again. When I think about clinicals, I get so anxious and terrified. I’m not even sure I’ll pass physiological chem. I feel I’m not personable enough. I don’t know if I can get through such long, hard work days. So many reasons to drop nursing cross my mind all day. I’m scared that if I do drop it, I’ll regret it and there is no going back. All of my family and friends say that they truly believe that I am meant to be a nurse, and in a way I believe that too, but I just don’t know. If I changed my major I would switch to criminal justice with a concentration in mental health, but that also proposes more issues for me to worry about such as fewer job options and far less pay. I know that a huge weight would be lifted off my shoulders because the course work would not be as heavy, but what if a huge weight is put ON my shoulders because I regret my decision? I feel like I’m wasting time by continuing in the nursing program if I’m just going to end up dropping out of it, so I want to have my decision by 2nd semester. I just feel so stuck.",05Nov2018,1

311," Long rant written from my phone ahead

&amp;#x200B;

   My mom and dad divorced 5 or 6 years ago after 32 years of marriage. They both were seeing different people and sold my childhood home and moved in with their new partners. My mom met a guy online on a popular gaming website where you have Avatar's interacting and socializing. After taking over a year on the game they started talking on Skype. He seemed like a really nice guy, lots of stories and life experiences he talked about. My mom really enjoyed talking with him. He lived in Kentucky with his wife and my mom in Pennsylvania. He claimed his marriage was fractured like my moms. Said his wife was very mentally abusive and he was looking to get away. Eventually he found a job in PA as a post master at the post office right near where we lived

. Once the house sold my mom stayed in his apartment and then they eventually moved into a condo he bought, where they lived for 2 to 3 years. Slowly over the years my mom realized she really wasn't into him the way she originally. She realized he was very immature for his age, not too bright at all, and felt like a lot of the things he said we're made up just to impress. Meanwhile he was going to family functions and holidays. He was part of my 4 kids life. They loved him because he was very child like in his mannerisms. He would sit and play school with them for a long time, take them to the park and the movies. Bought them candy and gifts for Christmas and birthdays. He was not one to spend money. He was known to be very fickle but he didn't mind spending money on them. He even started helping my oldest daughter practice softball. My mom wanted to put and end to the relationship but she was scared. My mom is a very nice person and timid and didn't want to ruin him. She knew he was very in love with her. He told her all the time how much he loved her, how attracted to her he was. My mom is a very good looking lady especially compared to him. She felt guilt, she knew he had nothing really in his life and he moved away from what he had left for her. She worried he might become suicidal. But she knew that she couldn't bare being with him that much longer because he drove her crazy. She secretly started looking for an apartment for her self closer to her work and me. She got the apartment and then knew she had to tell him it was over. My mom was always a little scared of him, since this one instance when she broke up with him when they first were together. Back when she was still with my dad. It was a secret and he drove all the way to our house from his first apartment and threatened to tell our whole family about there relationship. Saying that they will know he was her dirty little secret. The look in his eyes she said scared the crap out of her. I later convinced her to stay with him because I still felt he was a nice guy. My mom had a tendency to flee when things get hard so I didn't want her to throw away something I thought at the time was a good guy. So it was time to tell him she was done. She said she froze up and just said "" I need to move out"" he immediately responded, (as if he was waiting for this day) ""GET OUT GET OUT!"" yelling and calling her names. She went to her room started packing her things and shaking. She messaged me and told me how he reacted. I told her to come stay here. She later said he came and apologized, and said that she can stay until she moved and he would help her pack. So she stayed and the move was 2 weeks later. They talked and apparently he was understanding. He did help her pack and move. He did say to me he was sad and he will always love my mom, and he will try and win her back. We told him to just give up it's done but he didn't want to hear it. I told him he can still see my kids and my mom said he can still be her friend. 

After awhile of living on her own he asked if she could come to his condo and they could talk. He accused her of taking my dads money and being an evil and bad person in general. She walked out not wanting to deal with his crazy antics him yelling at her as she walked out the door a chicken. She jumped into her car where he ran after her but she drove home and immediately ignored any and all messages from him on all social media. A few days later my mom got up early around 6:30am to go to work to find all the air had been let out of her tires. She called the police and filed a report, which nothing came of. Keep in mind he lives about an hour from where she currently lives. She knew it was him. Later on im guessing that week he started trashing her on a public forum in the game that they originally met. She still goes on the game daily and so does he but they aren't in the same rooms. Mutual friends of them both are appalled at his behavior and forward and report what he wrote in the game getting it removed. My mom still does not respond to him in any fashion. A few days later, he writes her a message asking her to marry him. She is thinking he losing it and decides to block him on facebook and messenger. My timeline is pretty screwy and I'm not sure exact time in between events but I'd say it's a few days. A few days later I get a message from him saying he is sorry and to tell the kids he loves them. That he loves my mom but she doesn't love him.

 Then he sends me a picture of a rifle and says bye. I asked where he was and said if he is serious ill have to call the cops. He said no don't do that I'm not home and you will never find me. He also sent the same messages to my mom. My mom decided to reply and said ""stop this now!! ""I call the cops anyway, and they searched his house. They didn't find him or the rifle. They ended up finding him a half hour later in a movie theater parking lot, with the gun. They talked with him, where he agreed to be 302d. (mental hospital) . He stayed in there for about a week and a half where he spoke with my mom maybe once. He needed a ride home and she agreed to pick him up but her online friends convinced her that wasn't a great idea. He ended up finding another ride home. After this stunt I told him I can't have him around my children anymore because I cannot trust him. Ib told him I still cared and hoped he could find peace in his life, but I'm going to have to stop talking to him as well. He was upset and thought it was mom making me block him too, which it was my own choice. So I blocked him too

. A month or so goes by and it's Easter. My mom and I woke up to Easter baskets outside our front doors, left to us (and my 4 kids) from ""the Easter Bunny"". My mom told me to throw them away because she was worried about possible candy contamination. He also sent a basket to my sister who had just had a new baby all the way in New Jersey! Which means he drove almost 2 hours to drop off the basket there, at who knows what time. Also there was a basket with homemade dyed eggs. Which means he sat there and dyed eggs.... My sister was furious and seriously worried about her safety. She had no idea of all the things that had been going on with them up until now. He left a card with his number with the basket for her, in which she called him to figure out who sent them and to say thank you. But after hearing his craziness she wasn't happy. A little while later, he apparently sent my sister a letter explaining why my mom is a bad person but it was written as a ""friend"" of his. My mom being a nurse he continually writes that he is worried of the well being of her patients. Saying she is mentally un stable to take care of them. That's what he wrote on that online forum and also in that letter to my sister. Also explained there whole sexual relationship. We just found out that this was a 60 page typed letter that was sent to her. My sister immediately went to the police where she made a report. Police called him and said he is not to have any contact with my moms children, and he agreed. My mom still hasn't received the letter from my sister, even after asking her for it numerous times. Every year around October my mom would go on vacation to the beach with her best friend and her best friends husband. 

Recently in the past few years her husband passed away and my mom would still go and bring ""him"" with. So he has gone with a couple years in a row. Then sadly my moms best friend passed away. My mom went to the beach that year with just ""him"" that being the last time they went when still together. Then this year, Around the time they would usually go to the beach she received a post card saying "" I wish you and ""him"" would come visit me at the beach"" and it was signed her best friends name. She knew it was him. He changed his handwriting too so it didn't look like his. Now not hearing from him in a few months, I figured he was done with his antics, but now my mom is just waiting. And then it happened. My dad lives close by as well with his gf. So I get a call from her last week. She said she got a letter in the mail, addressed to ""current resident "". In the letter was a picture of my mom, and it said that she was a nurse, looking to have sex and she could get and supply drugs because she has access from her work. That to call her for a good time, and then her number was listed. The next page had a picture of myself, stating, that I am looking for sex and my husband likes to watch and then my husband's number was listed. Then the next page was a picture of my sister and her number stating the same things. The next page had 3 pictures of my moms and his online mutual friends and there numbers. We immediately went to the police station and filed a report. My sister did the same in New Jersey. The police said they would look into it, and if found anything he could maybe get a misdemeanor for harassment. We later found he mailed these letters to all of my neighbors and my dads neighbors and I'm still not sure how many people. Since he is the post master at the post office he has access to a lot of info. It's been about 2 weeks and the police haven't contacted us. My mom called to follow up but they said there wasn't anything filed, and it could take 10 to 12 days. My mom my sister and I have not reached out or acknowledged him for what he did at all. As much as we all wanted to give him a piece of our minds, and our fists we know he wants a reaction. My mom is scared. I just want to know if she has reason to worry, and should we worry that he will escalate to violent behavior next. My mom told me if she ends up dead it's because of him. Should she be even thinking that way. Now we are just waiting for the next thing. Thoughts? ",05Nov2018,1

313,"I am a 23 year old female who will be graduating of fall 2019. I have been with my boyfriend for over a year now, and several months ago we had an unplanned pregnancy and I was not able to CTT. We have been in the healing process for 6 months, but through this dark time, we always knew we would have our future, and a family together. I have always wanted to teach abroad, to gain perspective and live my life to the fullest extent. I have done a fair bit of traveling, and I know this is entirely what I want to do. My boyfriend and I have spoken of doing this together, and this seemed like the plan until recently. Due to his circumstances, it doesn't seem feasible for him to go. He cares for his severely mentally disabled brother, and his father is never around. Mom is not alive, and putting him in a group facility is likely not possible. We talk about marriage, and children , and have a plan that by 27, we would like to start trying for another children. He is entirely supportive of me going, and he wants me to live my life to the fullest extent after the loss we both suffered. I always imagined he would be right there beside me, but now it seems nearly impossible. I'm terrified of the long distance, whereas he doesn't seem to be worried. He thinks its a great way for us to save up some money for our own place when I get back (planning on 1 year), and ill be able to live out my dream. He says we could plan visits well in advance so we have something to look forward to. We love each other endlessly, but I fear that the distance will make us become emotionally distant.

315,"Hi. 
This happened 2 years ago during the summer (16f) and the guy I was with was 17. before I go in depth whether I think i was sexually assaulted or not , I don’t know if I was since. Let me just explain and please don’t judge. 
so i’d tell the back story with how we met but to cut it short from a friend. So one day he brings up kissing me and stuff and i was honestly uncomfortable about it at first then i guess i just went along since I didn’t want him to stop talking to me (dumb i know ..) so the day comes when we were supposed to kiss in his car (romantic huh lol) and i honestly thought we were just going to kiss. no touchy feels shit like him touching my boobs and stuff. But it happened and I did it back because i didn’t know what to do. When he first started touching me i was kind of thrown off and pulled back but then i went back in to just kiss then he started going under my shirt and bra and just touched my boob ( now i was totally thrown off by this because that’s never happened to me before) then he went to touch my butt and even felt up on me down there through my clothes.  what makes me think i was assaulted was that i didn’t say anything about stopping and even did it back to him! ( which he didn’t mind of course he literally said next time u should finish me off :/ )my stupid mind was frozen and then i just touched his thigh which led to his dick and that’s all that happened. I tell myself that i’m stupid for even questioning if i was assaulted since i didn’t say anything and did touch him back but another part of me is like he didn’t ask beforehand or at the moment if it was ok to go under my shirt and stuff. I get people get all touchy when kissing/making out so i thought it was normal for him to touch my boobs and stuff , but idk i’m having mixed feelings about it and to be honest after i was done i felt weird , like i wanted to throw up but i don’t know why and now i kinda think i do know why.  after that he found a gf and we stopped talking because we weren’t fit for each other which i didn’t care about. but 2 years have passed and we’re just acquaintances because my friends r friends with him so lol. 

If you read it to the bottom thank you, means a lot and also sorry if there’s any errors it’s pretty late where i am in europe haha. ",05Nov2018,1
316,"I’m a recovering addict who admittedly still drinks a pretty decent amount from time to time. I’ve moved to a city where my only close friend is really depressed and drinks a lot. He just came out of a nasty divorce and doesn’t have many other friends to lean on. My oldest friend, who will be moving here soon, is also a depressed alcoholic with a propensity for substance abuse. His mother passed recently and has left him mostly homeless and more unstable than ever. He seems to think that the change of scenery will magically make everything better. He also is planning on crashing with me till he finds a place, which would be ok except he’s so down he can’t or won’t look for a place of his own. They both bring up suicide a lot and it always leaves me at a loss for what to say. I really try to be there for them both, but it really weighs on me and I don’t know what to do. I’ve battled depression for years now and try so hard everyday to be positive and create a world I want to live in. I just feel like it’s so hard to keep my head above water and their issues just make it that much harder. I don’t really know what advice I expect, I just wondered if anyone had been through something similar and could impart some wisdom. Thanks in advance!

Am I an alcoholic? I drink beer everyday (craft beer), sometimes starting at 11:30am. I'm not trying to get drunk, it's almost like how people drink coca cola so often, craft beers are just a drink of choice. I obviously do get buzzed, but never am trying to get fucked up.

Dependancy wise, is where I'm mostly lost. I'm never CRAVING ALCOHOL, although some mornings, I think how I could go for a beer (usually because I have new beers I haven't tried in my fridge).

Am I an alcoholic, or do I just enjoy the flavors and different styles of specialty beer which isn't as bad of a thing? ",05Nov2018,1
320,"So, I used to have this friend that was very close and dear to me. She always used to have peaks of depression, and I was always there for her. Threats of suicide were constant unless you were in constant contact with her, trying to calm her down. Very emotionally draining.

&amp;#x200B;

Always in self depreciating humor mode, she would complain and accuse everyone close to him. Her mother, her father, her family, her closest friends. As years passed by, we grew closer, and I got to know his family. To me, them always seemed to care for her and to be supportive, but that was not what she used to say about them. Unless, of course, when we were sharing space with to them; in that case she treated them normally.

&amp;#x200B;

After a while, I noticed that despite their problems, they were a normal family. She had an inconsistent behavior with them, sometimes hating some individuals like they were the devil, and after sometimes directing her hatred toward other family members.

Then, finally, we found ourselves in huge fight, in which I drew the line. Without entering in details: She got drunk, made scene and me and other friends had to take care of the fallout. We stopped talking to each other, and I was fine with that. As the years passed by, I noticed I wasn't the only one.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, skip 4 years, she reconnected with me. Said she was sorry, that she was going through some stuff at the time, but she wanted to reconnect because she was feeling lonely cuz' she broke all her friendships. I said sure, but, the thing is, she still lives far away and the only thing she calls me for is ""hey do you want to come here at home so we can drink a few beers and have a talk?"". I'd gladly do that with any other friend, but, I don't know, I just don't feel it. I don't feel like we have much more in common anymore. I have plenty of fun memories from our previous years as friends, but she doesn't seem to have improved at all. Her twitter is still filled with suicide threats and hatred. So I always postpone it.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, recently, me and some other friends started to notice that something might be going wrong. She was engaged to this guy I never met, and it seems like they broke. She shredded her own hair, dyed it, and started announcing that she became a webcam girl. She started posting more aggressive suicide stuff, like ""working so I can buy my own poison"", and etc. She is constantly seems in her social media smoking tons of pot and drinking pure liquor.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I don't have any contact with any of her friends. I don't even know who they are. I don't talk to anyone in her family for years. I just have her as a contact. But I'm a bit afraid to get caught in some emotional trap. I had problems with depressive people who promote you to the level of ""reason of my existence"", and when you try to leave or tend to your own business, you become the ""another proof the world sucks and everybody would be better of if I died"". Also, I don't even now if it is in my place to do anything. It's just, since other people started commentating, and I used to be one of her closest friends, it seems like I have some sort of responsibility. I don't know what to do.",05Nov2018,1
321,"When I started dating my boyfriend, we both already knew that I’d be moving 1,000 miles away after a few months. I did so, and he decided to move down a month and a half later. He works at a national store so he transferred easily, but had to take a demotion/pay cut to come down when he wanted to.

He’s been here for a month and a half now, and he hates it. He hated our apartment at first, he hates being at the lowest position in the store, and he hasn’t made any friends. He keeps telling me that he’s fine if he has me but I can’t stop feeling like it’s my fault and that he ruined his life.

As a result, I’m not happy in the relationship out of guilt. I don’t know if I should try to explain this to him, he already knows that I feel bad for his situation.

327,"I started a new job in October, one that I didn't really want to work at because of stories and their track record with employees quitting soon after starting and such.

The head manager had asked me what days specifically I would like off and when I told her she said she would try and work the schedules around for it.

She ended up giving me two different days off for a while, split ones, and I was okay with that and dealt with them.

She finally had changed the whole schedule around and gave me my days off I asked for. One of the days off had been another co-worker's day off for the past two weeks, and she had apparently had plans that day for her bf's birthday, so when she saw that she didn't have it off she had called and texted our head manager over 18 times while she was at home. Got so annoying that the head manager had to put her phone on Do Not Disturb mode. I was on my day off this night and in the movie theater when I felt my phone buzz. I checked it for a moment and it was a missed call from said co-worker. I told her I was in the theater and so she texted me asking if I would switch that specific day off with her and then she would work on one of her days off and I would take it off. I didn't give her an answer because I was watching the movie and then had to drive an hour home and I don't mess with my phone. (I had been visiting my best friend in her town.)

The next day I went to work and the head manager and her son asked me if I was going to switch with the girl. I didn't really want to but because they asked me I felt like I had to. But I told them it was only once because she had been so dramatic about it. And they said the same thing.

So, the girl comes into work and when I tried to talk to her she acted stand-offish and pissy towards me, like...yeah cool whatever.

Which I knew would happen because she is still a literal kid.

And I tell her that I was going to let her have that day off and all that. I was annoyed though because I had finally gotten the days off I wanted and had to give one up.

The next week, which was this past week, I got those two days off. No one asking me to switch. Then last night the schedule for this week came out and the head manager said she would be making changes to it today to fix it.

I went to look and I noticed she had given that girl my two days off and me hers. I hope those are the things she is fixing because it is unfair. Especially since this girl had yesterday and Saturday off, will work today, and then have two days off again while I have to work all week to get to the days off this weekend.

I'm not trying to sound like a brat myself, but this is annoying considering she annoyed us into switching days that one week. And if the head manager isn't switching them today, then she is giving her both of my days off.

It's also annoying how I told the manager I had things that always needed to be done.on those two days because they are the only times that they can be done and she pretty much is ignoring it.",05Nov2018,1

329,"I loaned my mom $2200 for the down payment for a car. So far she's given me less than $300. This all happened back in May. She actually told me she had majority of it in cash at home and would give that to me but that turned out to be a lie. 

I'm only 23 and just got my first real great paying job a year ago. I had around $6,000 in savings at the time. I could've given it to her in cash but didn't want to take such a large chunk out of my savings. I ended up putting it on one of my credit cards. I figured I'd get some points and she'd pay me back before the due date.

Clearly that hasn't happened. She said she would make payments to me. I ended up switching it to a 0% interest card because the card I originally put it on had a high interest rate and I figured this would be good for when she pays me monthly. After a couple of months of her not paying me I just paid the balance off. It was messing with my credit score. 

I didn't tell my mom when I moved the balance to a new card or even when I paid it off. As far as she knows it's still collecting interest on the other card. I've had multiple talks with her about paying me back. It's always so awkward. I feel like I always have to tip toe around her feelings.

334,"I don’t know how it all happened. I really don’t. I am 21 in college with a few years to go until I finish. I am a finance major so the situation I am in is rather ironic. It gives me massive anxiety thinking or talking about but at this point I just don’t know what to do. 

It started in 2016 when I got my first credit card. I had a $600 limit, and it was nice when it came to paying for things I needed and could stager the payments. I always kept a small hosting job working small hours 15-20 a week while working in my degree so I could pay it off in reasonable amounts every time I got a paycheck. 

After displaying relatively good credit habits, the creditor upped my limit to $1,100 a month, which I thought was a good thing, but knowing myself now it was probably the worst thing that could have happened to me. That limit increase happened around late summer of last year (2017) and since then I have managed to max it out several times. I still was employed, not making the amount of money I wished I was, but in college and what I needed it for, it worked. 

Fast forward to summer of this year (2018). I managed to keep my head above water and stayed consistent around a 700 credit score. It wasn’t the best but I kept telling myself I had a while to get it together before shit hit the fan. Boy was I wrong. My roommate moved out when the spring semester ended and although I kind of hated her, the loneliness I experienced and still experience have put me in one of the deepest depressions I’ve ever gone through in life so far. I have NPD (Narcissistic Personality Disorder) so I always feel like I have to compete with other people, which led to my next atrocious actions. 

In light of my depression and NPD, I started to feel like I was in competition with with everyone around me when this new semester started. These weren’t even people I knew, or talked to, I just felt like since I felt bad I needed to be better than everyone else. Since my credit was decent, I opened up two new credit cards, both totaling to $2,500 worth of limits, on top of the $1,100 I already had (and owed), I now had $3,600 worth of limits... which I ended up maxing within the first few weeks I had the two new cards. Shoes, cloths, fancy meals, new technology. You name it, I bought it. Funny thing is, I knew it wouldn’t make me feel better, because I still feel like shit, but at the time it’s probably one of the only things I knew how to do to keep myself from either self harming or going deeper into my depression. 

I know it sounds like I have a woe is me attitude, but I’m genuinely asking for help. I don’t know what to do. I have over $3,600 owing on credit card bills and I feel like I’m drowning. It’s making my anxiety and depression worse than they already are, and I feel so stuck in life that my grades, my social life, and everything else is slipping between my fingers. I’ve dealt with thoughts of suicide before (I’m too scared to actually do it, big bark small bite kind of thing) but I don’t think it’s ever been worse in my life. I am currently unemployed and I get about $600-700 a month from my parents for an allowance. I could blame this on my upbringing, being babied and fed with a silver spoon, but I cannot deny these actions are my own. Any advice is well received and appreciated. 

tl;dr - I have $3600 worth of credit card debt at 21 years old, I’m unemployed, I get a reasonable amount in an allowance from my parents but I don’t know what to do. ",05Nov2018,1

He also mentioned that he has his own  problems, I told him I’m willing to listen and do my best to help him with his problems. But when I asked about them he dodged the question completely, I shrugged it off.

I asked  again later and he said its relationship problem  and I asked if he meant his girlfriend or someone else. He said someone else it is a group of people, then followed by him saying he can’t explain it through text, I kinda pushed the question and he said it was a loneliness thing, I felt it for a while.

338,"I work for like 43K/year and i want to buy a house soon with my GF. The plan is for the house to be in my name, and the GF will simply pay a rent. Our plan is to potentially have roommates in order to be able to save a lot of money, and eventually maybe get into buying apartments and rent those. I have 30K saved up but my dad is willing to back me up for bank mortgage.


We currently have 2 options.


**Option 1**


The first option is something my dad thought of. Its a company that builds condo. We would buy one with 2 rooms in it for around 250K. The company would lend us 15% of it. Its very well located (close to downtown) in a high value area. I believe a room can easily be rented for 700-800.


The upside of this is, we believe if we buy this, the value of it will increase more than an house. Also i'd be closer to my work (like 20 min). Also less trouble renting to a single person. The downside is its obviously smaller than an house, and also, it might feel a bit tight with a roommate.


**Option 2**


I also thought of buying a house with around 3 bedrooms. I would rent it to 2 persons. Ideally, we would buy a house where the 2 rooms we rent are in the basement, so we can't be annoyed too much by roomates. I have seen some decent houses that accomplish this for around 250K


The downsides to this option is its a bit further away from downtown (like 40 min), it can take more time to handle a house (grass, snow, etc), it might gain less value than the first option. The upside is the rent would be higher since we rent to 2 people, a house is much bigger so the roommates might be less annoying.



TLDR: I have around 30K Saved up and i want to stop renting appartments and instead buy something of my own, and help pay off mortgage faster by renting a room or 2 to roomates. Is it smarter to go for a condo or an house? Any general tips?",05Nov2018,1

So I said I wanted to cancel that ""subscription"" and she told me she needed my address to send me the forms. Luckily, I never gave her my bank account or something along those lines, at least.

344,"I (21F Trans) ended up at my bf’s (21M) house after a small weekend vacation with him and his parents. His parents and siblings are all cool with me. They met me before I began transitioning. My bf, his brother, and I were all chilling in their room when his great grandma comes in and begins to tell them not to bring that “fucking faggot” into the house ever again or else she’d kick me out herself. All while pretending I wasn’t in the room with them. 

Now, before we went on vacation, she had been gendering me female and asked me who I was because she didn’t remember me. So before I could answer, my bf’s mother answered for me “Oh, that’s ————“. I still go by the name I used before I transitioned so I’m guessing she put one and one together.

Now the house, from what I’ve gathered before, is under her name so she definitely has the right to kick me out under whatever pretense she likes. I understand that. I didn’t really try to reason with her because I ended up crying like a baby. I also guess I also expected my bf to maybe not necessarily stand up for me but intervene with something small.

I was facing away from the door and on the ground as she walked in while I was repairing my bfs brother’s computer. All he did was rub his foot on my back while he sat on his chair without even looking at me. I felt so humiliated, I don’t even know how he could even think that was comforting. I finished repairing the computer and left. My bf walked me home but didn’t really offer anything to say other than “I didn’t know I had someone in the family like that.”

I wanted to talk to him about it but it didn’t really feel like my place to talk to him about anything that happened, especially with me crying at the time and barely being able to talk. This all happened yesterday, and today he’s acted like nothing happened. 

While I was hurt that she said that, I guess my bf’s reaction to that upset me the most? I don’t know how to bring it up to him or if I should even bother him with that. I don’t know if I’m just overthinking everything. 

We’ve been dating for four years now, since we were 17. We’ve known each other for even longer than that. I guess I just expected him to stand up for me given the amount of time we’ve been together. But that’s still his family after all. Any input?",05Nov2018,1
345,"First, my wife is a wonderful person and mother. She is loving, caring, thoughtful and generous to both me, her husband, and her 4 kids(26, 21, 9 and 6. The last two are mine).

The title itself is a bit misleading as she does the lions share(75/25) around the house for our family(cook, clean etc). We both work full time, although my job has longer hours plus a much longer commute, which prevents me from being home much earlier than 7-7:30pm most nights.

All this to say that my role with our children is generally to discipline, or hold accountable, aka be the bad guy. I don’t actually have a problem with this in and of itself, however, the issue is that I receive little to no back up from my wife.

As much as I love her she has never been able to hold her kids, old and young accountable. In her older kids this has resulted in a now recovering addict(no curfews, no punishments when caught stealing, no rules of any kind). The 21 yr old is a good kid but was never challenged or pressed to do more. After 2 1/2 yrs of  community college she is just now figuring out what she wants to do. Anytime I would attempt to help I was just looked at as the mean ogre and told, “they’re my kids, I know what’s best for them.” Fine, so be it. Not my kids.

The problem is that I see her take the same the approach with our children and am now seeing the same initial bad behavior/habits. There are two primary areas with our children that we are most often at odds over:

Screen time and eating habits.

If not for my intervention our girls would be on their tablets, or watching TV, upwards of 6-8 hrs a day. They actually still reach this most days as I’m gone a lot due to work(see above). Plus, anytime I do stop this activity, and tell them to read a book, they run to mom who will tell them, “it’s ok. Just go play for a little bit and you can do what you want.” 

Same with food. My wife will make a wonderfully balanced meal for the two of us and separately cook the same Mac and cheese, or pizza, or whatever crap for the kids. Our oldest hasn’t even eaten a vegetable in years. I get yelled at if I force the issue and have mostly given up. On the few occasions I stand up and say, “NO, finish your dinner(Mac and cheese dinner, not even a healthy one), they’ll wait it out until I leave the room and are then eating a bag of chips that mom said was ok to have(both her older kids have serious weight issues).

I’m sure I’m leaving a lot out and if I’m being honest with myself I could spend more time/focus on this when I am home but am usually so exhausted from my work and drive that I don’t hold myself accountable... that said even if I make that extra time I’m not sure what to do. 

Any questions, comments, concerns are all welcome. Thank you.

346,"To preface this, my dad is an amazing father. We live in the US and he's always prioritized me my entire life. I'm currently 20 years old and I come here for advice because I'm so stressed about this and this is looking for advice, to rant, and to clear my mind. I don't know if this is the right place to go but here we go.

My dad had a rough life. He never had a chance at a good education. Due to his lack of a good education, he's had to do labor jobs to support me and my mom since I was a baby. It's hard work and now he's almost 60 and wants to quit and play stocks. He claims to be absolutely **miserable** at his job.

Stocks has always been the problem in my family. My parents struck it big when I was very little. They made a good amount and were able to buy a house and have savings. But since then they've been unsuccessful and my mom quit a long time ago but my **dad is so fixated on stocks. He looks at them every single day.**

13 years ago he tried again and lost. 7 years ago he tried again and lost. Then 4 years ago he tried again and lost. He always claims to have this brilliant strategy to win but has lost every time except the first time he played. **Mind you, my dad, if he had it his way, would play every year after his lost but my mom fights with him ridiculously hard to prevent him from playing.** 

Here's thing: He's hounded my mom to let him play again over the past 3 years and **my mom is letting him win.** This is because he's worked really hard over the past 3 years and has saved up a sizeable amount of savings. He wants to use a portion of those savings to try to play because he has another great strategy.

I talked to my mom about it and her reasoning is this: I'm graduating college now and I have a very good shot at getting into medical school and becoming a doctor. This is usually a stable financial path in the US and so my mom has given up trying to protect me financially because she believes it's fine now. She said she's fought all those years to try to control my dad's habits so it wouldn't bankrupt us. Now that we have decent savings and my dad is only playing with a portion, she wants to let him play because **1. We have decent savings even if he loses his portion. 2. In her eyes, I'm financially secure and can take care of him down the road if he loses it all.** 

**Third and most important reason: It gives him hope.** My dad is close to sixty and abhors his job but due to a lack of education and age there isn't much to do. The only thing that gets him through the days is his hope to strike it big again on the stock market. **If he doesn't have this, he's claimed he'll kill himself if he doesn't get to play.**

**So overall my mom wants to let him play.** He's earned the money and we have extra savings if it goes bad and I have a future in medicine to support them.

**MY QUESTION IS:** Do I give up and just let him play like my mom. We've tried over and over and over and over to explain to him but he never wants to listen. I feel this is a cycle. He'll play. He'll lose. Then work hard again to try to save up and cover the loss through his job and then he'll try again and again and again. My mom says it's a way to just let him be happy but IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE I CAN DO? I give up. I've read to go to a therapist. Treat this as a gambling addiction disease but he will not listen. I'm okay if he loses the portion he plans to invest as I plan to work hard in the future and take care of them anyways but I feel hopeless. Stocks have always been annoying for me. They gave me a house and a decent future but so much family drama that I can't even that I've resorted to asking the opinions of strangers to figure out a way to cope.

tl;dr: Dad and mom struck it big first time in stocks. Dad has tried 3 times in the past 17 years but failed each time. Wants to try again. Mom wants to give it to him because we're technically financially ""stable"" enough to afford it if he loses.

347,"As the title says, my best friend and roommate has recently come into money, at the start 20 grand to be exact. His grandmother had saved that up for him since he was little, and after her recent passing it was all given back to him. Rather than putting it aside or setting up college though, he's been splurging. New high power gaming PC which he's constantly buying new flashy parts for, top of the line headphones, mouse, keyboard, and even a professional desk mounted mic. He's also gotten me things admittedly, which, I appreciate immensely but didn't ask for such as a 100 dollar MIDI controller and a 250 dollar Keyboard.

Fair enough, one was only a potentially ideal situation that later (when it was already too late) turned out to be one. But the other time she was alone in the hallway and instead of going up to her I decided to go talk to my friend who was nearby as well. Anyways, point is, I really wanna talk to her but as soon as I actually get a chance I'll think to myself ""oh you can talk to her later, you'll get another chance"". Wtf brain? Like, the situation couldn't be easier, I think she even likes me too (we constantly make eyecontact and she has talked to me about 3 times out of the blue). I don't know what the problem is, it's not that I have low confidence or something. I just get kinda nervous when I see her even though I'm not really a nervous person.

350,"Title sums it up but I'll be a little more thorough.

I've been friends with this girl for almost 3 years now and we really match up with each other about what we're interested in doing and pursuing, and there are other quirks about each other that are unique and I think we could really work together.

Only thing is that I am not attracted to her sexually. Over this past summer we thought something could work out so we honestly tried and I was so hesitant and back and forth because the few times we'd start to make out or get anywhere I was turned off. Not feeling it. We decided to just leave it as friends and that's what we've been since and all is pretty back to normal as if that didn't happen.

I'm not asking for a catch-all answer but advice on the situation. I enjoy a monogamous sexual relationship, I've only ever had one serious relationship before and it lasted 3 years and we had to break up because it wasn't working out eventually, even though we both still liked each other :/ (Don't want to get back together with that one though, turned crazy after the breakup and it was an eye-opener/never saw that side of her so that was lucky).

Granted I have found myself to be ok with other partners, I engaged in some group things after that 3 year relationship but nothing hookup like, it was all with friends. So finding that need outside of a relationship is a possibility but I'm still young and don't want to do or think about that right now.

354,"Long***I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls (only 2 of them are in this , a blonde girl and a brunette girl) were there for a few hours in the night at the end before closing time the blonde girl walked up stairs with another girl to the toilet she kept looking back at me down the stairs and laughing/giggling . but couldn’t make it out fully. later I walked around the corner towards by where they were sitting and one of them (that same blonde girl) was looking at me and pressed her lips together in a polite/pleasant way and she didn’t look away and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say whispered excitedly to her friend the brunette girl 'eh that lads just been staring at me'. another while later I was cleaning a table nearby  (they were the last customers left in there it was late before closing) and it went quiet and then it went like:

Brunette: “excuse  me...excuse me” 

Me: *stops to look over*

Brunette: “how do yer get a job in here?” 

Me: “oh just online application form and sent it from there”

Then they asked me about a girl who worked in there (where I work) i walked over t their table and I said yes and she was saying they don’t know her that well just by sight and then said ‘yea she’s bit weird like’ (which she is tbh) as she was talking with the blonde girl too but the blonde girl was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ or something like that then the brunette then said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know’ and then looked at me after she sipped her drink with a straw then grew a smile and said 'she likes you' quipped and they all burst out laughing I just walked away (she meant the girl at work who said she likes me. She doesn’t as these girls never seen me before) then I then went back to finish cleaning the table and it went quiet again: 

Brunette: “excuse me”

Me: *looked over*

Brunette: “can I ask you a serious question” (she pointed at me saying it nervously and politely) 

Me: “yeah”

Brunette; “have you got a gf?” (she said it really pleasantly )

Me: ***ignored her because I didn’t know what to think of it***

Blonde: *watching the whole thing and after a pause between anyone talking again*  “awww leave him alone, he’s dead cute” looking over smiling and “he probably has” (probably has a gf) (she said it out loud while looking over at me like as if she made sure I heard her idk)

Brunette: “have yer, have yer got a gf?” (Pleasantly in a wanted to know way)

Me: *ignored again wiping the table looking annoyed because I didn’t know how else to act*

Blonde: laughs a bit  and says ‘aww leave it, he’s fuming now’ laughing a bit (I wasn’t fuming it was the coffee stain on the table I was wiping was not coming out lol) 



 . On their way out by the door when I was cleaning other tables the brown girl looked a bit drunk walking out with her hand on her head and the blonde girl who seemed normal walked towards me and went out of her way a little to say ‘byyyeee’ loudly smiling politely idk they looked like pleasant well spoken girls not loud drunk girls

Basically what happened was I had just returned to the office after dropping something off at another hosptial. I went about doing my daily stuff when my supervisor came in with the one of my coworkers. She wanted us to collaborate on going over to another location for something. He hadn't gone to another location yet so she was explaining the procedure of billing hours while traveling.

I was really confused and was like a deer in headlights. When I asked what that was for she said because I had said something along the lines of ""left the office at 12 and arrived in the city at 1"" on one of my daily reports. 

I'm fairly certain she meant it as a joke but even still it made both my coworker and myself very uncomfortable and made me feel totally disrespected. I sent an email to my agency's recruiter asking what I should do about it and she wants to talk in like 30 minutes about what happened.

So I have dated since high school, but never with especially attractive women. And that was partially due to how I looked and how I acted in social situations. Well within the last year, I have put on a good amount of muscle, started my new job, and shed a lot of the insecurities I had about handling myself in social situations. Basically I got way more confident, and with that, started having better success with women. 

This was all great and all, until I found someone I really liked on multiple levels and we started dating. Now I was still my confident self, and this resulted in me getting into a different type of friend group than I used to be in through high school and college, generally my new friends were more physically attractive and more openly sociable. This has caused a couple problems since I started dating, mainly with me resisting the advances of my female friends (has happened once now while my current relationship is long distance, and once before we had officially started dating). Both times we stopped at second base, for full disclosure. But also both times I was drunk. I never initiate, but I'm having issues because I never had experienced this or had to reject women before I got more confident, and have very little training on how to resist these things. I should also mention this never happens with strangers, only close friends. Like I will always reject a random girl at a bar before anything has a chance of happening. Obviously I am physically attracted to these girls, and I don't see an issue with being physically attracted to others while I'm in a relationship as long as nothing happens, but I wouldn't date them because we don't connect on other levels.

365,"Hello. first-time poster to this subreddit, a casual lurker on my not-so-utilized account. Looking for information I can relay to my boyfriend and his family before they go ahead and try to do this. Sorry if this is rambly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just this last weekend, my boyfriend (M23) found out from his mom that his older brother (M26) cheated on his girlfriend. 

&amp;#x200B;

His mom had gotten a text from the girlfriend that she wouldn't be joining us for the holidays because, sadly, he had gotten black-out drunk the Friday before and ended up cheating on her. Idk if he told her or she found out. This was a first-time offense that any of us know about and can confirm that this is pretty out of the ordinary despite his attitude (he's a pretty outgoing guy with a lot of friends, hates just sitting around, wants to go out all the time with friends after work, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

Mom is very disappointed, felt like she raised her son better than this, my boyfriend is just confused and trying to put together the pieces of what the hell is going on with his brother. This is when a lot more things started to become clear. 

&amp;#x200B;

Girlfriend (well, now ex) was able to fill their mom in with more about what was going on. She confirmed that yes, he had been drinking more excessively lately, even to the point that he's drinking at work during the day. He constantly goes out with friends after work (who won't be helpful at all), drinks more, and then **definitely** drives himself home drunk and blacks out. She had tried to get him to cut back. (When my boyfriend and I first met her back in August, she seemed pretty pushy about his drinking and we actually considered her kind of controlling right off the bat. Looking back at that now, it was **actually for reason**.) 

&amp;#x200B;

**We have tried to make him cut back** \- he has terrible cholesterol because of genetics, but doesn't take care of himself, get himself to the doctor regularly, and doesn't often take his medication. So, obviously, drinking is something he shouldn't be doing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Among other things, he has two dogs that he doesn't really take care of (no walks, small apartment, etc), he is always unresponsive to phone calls and texts from their parents and even his own brother, he doesn't want to make plans for family vacations 7-months in advance. The list sort of goes on and on. He's an adult, of course, but at this point, my boyfriend thinks he is purposely sabotaging his life and it scares the heck out of him. 

&amp;#x200B;

All of this just reminds their mom when she had to put on an intervention **for her own father** and force him to go to rehab without much help from her sister and mother. Alcoholism definitely runs in the family and she's fearing the worst. Because of that, they want to take immediate action before this ""spiraling"" gets more out of control. This means getting a plane ticket immediately and flying out to Austin, TX, show up at his apartment, stage an intervention, and get him to voluntarily get the in the car and go to a rehab facility. 

&amp;#x200B;

From there, I'm not sure what will happen. In fact, I don't think they really know what will happen, either. His ex-girlfriend has been very helpful and wants to be supportive, but we think the relationship is over for good. He currently lives alone and my boyfriend is thinking the worst until either him or their mom can get there. For the next 4-5 days, he'll probably be alone, unless his ex-GF decides to stick around and play it cool. **Is there anything I can do or say to them to help alleviate the situation?** I can't go with my boyfriend because of work, but it breaks my heart that he and his family are going through this terrible situation and I want to be as helpful as possible. We've been together for 6+ years, so everyone here means a lot to me.

Just this Saturday I was at a Latino party where they were playing some awesome Spanish trap and some deep house music. Everyone was dancing having an amazing time. Unfortunately I can’t really dance; the times I’ve tried to I just get laughs from people. I lost an amazing opportunity this weekend to dance with quite possibly the most gorgeous girl I’ve ever met. So I’m coming to you guys in hopes of finally learning how to dance. Well I guess I’m here to learn where/how to learn how to dance. I’m done having this problem of mine put a halt on my fun. Thanks to any answers ,05Nov2018,1

372,"I recently moved out of my parents house to live with my boyfriend in a totally new province. (more space and better paying jobs here) But since I have been here his sister has been nothing but trouble for their whole family and I want to do something to help but I have no idea what to do. 

Examples of what she has done

- smokes weed in the house and makes the whole basement reek and all the cats barf (i live in a room in the basement and my cats are the ones getting sick) 
- she complains about the smallest of things constantly and when someone says that shes in the wrong she throws a huge fit and has broken multiple things like the front door and her moms nose
- she calls her mom a slut and says nasty things to her 

The worst part is how the mom deals with it as after the freak outs instead of letting her know just how wrong she is behaving is she takes her out for dinner and treats her to stuff. She also never believes us (me and my bf) when we tell her that they are infact smoking weed and even when she has smelt is just blew it off with 'if we cant catch them doing it what can we do'

Its not my family and the mom does complain about the sister and has kicked her out before and given her rules for moving back but she completely ignores them and the mom ends up just giving in and not caring. There are also two young kids that keep getting caught up in all this and i feel like she is just very unsafe and needs help. Shes also 18 and has her 19 year old bf living here too and neither of them have a job and do nothing to help around the house. 

What should i do? It seems to only be getting worse. Ive thought about moving out but I like my job here.

373,"My boyfriend is friends with another female. They hung out at her house twice (alone) for the first time and a few weeks later they were texting and she was like;

*So do you want to hear about my tinder story or* ??🤭😂😂

They are friends for like a year. She tells him all random personal crap without ever asking if he's fine with it - now suddenly after they hang out alone at her house (they never did before) she asks permission if she can tell about her tinder story? Is this shady? She neverrr asks permission . It feels like; *yo we banged once but im looking further now so do you want to hear my crap, or is that too awkward.*

\[Btw the fact that shes on tinder means nothing regarding if she has an affair, a friend of mine has like 3 fuckbuddys and is still on tinder. She can also try to make him jealous for whatever reason.\]

374,"I have a really good friend/roommate who’s in his late 20s and who seems to have a child-like view of the world still. For some context he just moved out for the first time earlier this year with a couple other friends and myself. He’s the oldest in the house but the one who struggles the most to hold a job, the one who has been stuck at a jc for ten years, the one who has separation anxiety with his toxic gf, and I (nor the other roommates) noticed how bad it was until we saw things unravel for him when he moved out from his parents. 

Within the first couple months he quit his job for being too fast paced and demanding, and within another month got a seasonal job that he’s had before. He left the first time because once the season is over they might hire you on but the hours can be few and far between. He also lost his snake inside the house luckily he found it within a couple months. He also started failing his one and only class this semester and instead of dropping the class he’s going to just take the F. And lastly, the snake just died, after only a couple years of owning it, and it’s not the type of snake to die easy. 

On top of all of this his gf has been slowly isolating him for the last several years. He used to be the type that had a reason to be friends with everyone but now he talks badly about his oldest and closest friends and family members. Recently they’ve been talking about moving out to a big city like LA where he can transfer to a university and she can become an actress. 

My other roommates and I have no idea what he’s talking about anymore regarding most things. He talks about the world as if he were entitled to whatever he wants, and he’s never really been like this before. It might also be worth noting that his little brother has had a similar much more dramatic issue that he has taken so far as to try to convince people he is capable of flight. The problem for us is do we just support him and let him do what he’s going to do, or should we intervene and risk setting him off the friendships entirely?",05Nov2018,1

Hello  all...so i was thinking about asking a young lady who works in the same  building as me but not same company or floor. I occasionally say hi to  her but have never had a full conversation. Long ago i asked her to join  me for some coffee but she declined because she already had one so i  never asked her again but still say hi to her when i see her. I have a  show coming up and was wondering if i should ask her to come if she  wants...just casual just to break some ice and just talk she seems like a  cool person so i wouldn't mind getting to know her.

any advice if i should proceed or not or just any advice on the situation in general?

Fast forward a couple of months , we again had some drunken kisses and he stayed the night though we did nothing more than kiss. 
 A week or so later I told him I felt really confused about everything and he again said he was being stubborn on this that he needs to sort a house out before starting anything, though he did say if it wasn’t for that it would probably be different.

I was inebriated but in so much pain my boyfriend wanted to call an ambulance. I really didn’t want that (the ride alone costs $1000+) so he helped me limp to the bus and we went home. 

Now this morning I can’t walk. I can barely turn over without pain but I definitely can’t walk without help. My boyfriend had to help me use the bathroom. 

My question is: could this be a really bad bruise since I can sort of walk just not without excruciating pain? Or is it most likely a fracture in which case I should probably go to the ER. Its not bruising visibly but it’s a bit swollen.

388,"So I was abruptly logged out of my account on my phone and my computer, an account I've had for well over 6 years and has the username I associate with almost everything.

At first I attempted to login again, using different passwords, nothing worked. I attempted to do the forgot password method, but after waiting for the email for hours I received nothing. I thought that maybe I had listed the wrong email account with my reddit account, so I used every other email I have created and still, nothing, after waiting for multiple hours.

I contacted reddit support and received an automated message that told me that my account was locked out due to 'suspect logins' and claimed that there was no email attatched to the account so they couldn't verify me as the owner and I can't reset the password.

I have incredibly extensive knowledge and virtual/physical proof of ownership of the account only the owner could know, and verification from other accounts from friends that only the owner of the account could have. I feel as though an email is not the only sufficient way to prove ownership, and not even the best way.

I was wondering what options I may have to regain access to my account, I have specific people followed that I was interested in and tons of saved posts of things I was following and specific types of posts that I wanted to put into a giant collection for someone. They claim the only method is through email verification, but if I were able to communicate with a human I could clearly display my proof of ownership.

4 years ago my mom (77) had a stroke and a family friend (f57) took it upon herself to be my mom's caretaker. She helps pay bills and take her to appointments and cleans her house a bit for her. The lady is unemployed and spends most of her time with my parents or sitting her own granddaughter. 

My dad (80) who is also ailing in health, often goes to UC Davis to see a VA doc there and leaves my mom in the hands of the lady. He has gone on 3 other occasions in the past 2 years and every single trip this lady has gotten black out drunk the entire time. All three times my mom has had to find her and call the ambulance and get her taken to the hospital. Which leaves her all alone and bawling her eyes out to me. 

Noteworthy: I work full time and on the weekends so I'm not as available as I can be. My wife is a full time student and we have three kids so our time is super limited, if anyone is curious why I haven't stepped up. I took a couple days off work last time this happened, but it is very embarrassing using that excuse more than 0 times. I have other siblings but they all live out of state. 

My parents have known this lady and her extended family their entire lives so ghosting her isn't an option. And they want to help her... She needs help they say.

392," 

For 2 years now I talk on a daily basis with a really great friend \[36M\] who lives in another state. We have met in 2013 on social media but from 2016 till now we talk basically everyday, almost all day. When we met he had a girlfriend and I never acted like I wanted more than friendship and neither did him. He broke up last year and well, friendship continued. I realized I was a bit in love with him but never acted on it, just convinced myself I was really attached to the habit of talking to him because he is a really nice person.

In the beginning of this year I started to feel we were closer, but still really good friends only. He is an introvert and he never made a move on me and I used to think its because of that. Out of a sudden he starts getting distant. He one day tells me he got back with his ex and was then living in my state, really near me, with her. Only then I realized I liked him because I spent about 3 hours crying and was really hurt by the fact that he never made an attempt to see me in person but was now near me because of his girlfriend.

well, they then breakup (3 months later) because he is a celibatary (i am also a catholic so its ok for me) but the ex was not. We then got closer than ever, with him frequently saying we would do things together when he is around and acting like the sweetest person ever. Again, no REAL moves from my side or his. He mentioned wanting to come back to my state and that he would want to see me and stuff. I was really happy and engaged and now... he is distant again.

I honestly dont know what to do anymore and feel 0 comfortable asking about it because we never reached the kind of intimacy where we would just ask the other clearly this kind of thing. He didnt even tell me he broke up with the ex, I just knew on the Internet. I honestly dont understand his feelings, what he is after, whether he likes me or not etc etc. Its all a blur and I dont WANT to ask because I dont want to ruin our friendship. But my anxiety is killing me now that he is all distant again. I imagine a hundred of scenarios and possibilities :(

I also feel like this whole thing blocks me from trying to meet and like other guys because i feel he is ""the perfect one"" for me. So now I basically am spending the days really anxious checking my phone and trying to figure out if I should talk or should not, what to say, how to try and make him engage on talking to me like 1 week ago he was doing. All this constant worrying is suffocating me.

How can I get rid of the passion part and just keep a nice, stable friendship with no feelings attached? :(",05Nov2018,1

396,"So I'm in the last month of this group project and almost everyone has no idea what we're doing. This project is for a CS course in Artificial Intelligence and the group leader formed the group saying she had a past project she wanted to improve on. However, she has never helped us or responded to texts when we ask her specific questions about her project (which is horribly document and unclear), and at the meetings when we voice concerns she kinda brushes them aside. I'm not sure what her deal is, but I'm basically thinking to recommend to the group we change our project to something more manageable since at this point all we're doing is fidgeting around not knowing what we're doing.

Thing is, even though the group leader doesn't do shit she's oddly confrontational. If we make a suggestion at a meeting she gets scathing and argues for no reason. It's so weird because I feel me recommending an easier, more manageable project (that allows an equal division of workload and hence equal contribution per team) would be in the best interest of everyone at this point, but idk, if she debates it the group dynamic will kinda be fucked (not that it isn't already).

So yeah, so far the group is me, my friend, two other girls and then the group leader. I asked my friend and one of the girls how they felt about changing our project to something like a chess game or something, and they were down with it (and the other girl is pretty chill so I assume she'd be fine with it as well, although I sent her a text asking for her input). So I'm planning to send the group leader something along the lines of:

""Hey ____, hope everything's going well. Since we've only got a few weeks until the project is due, I was wondering if it might be better if we shift our attention to another project, maybe a chess AI? This way we all have an equal workload and we can probably get the project done before Thanksgiving break, (maybe put some stuff here about how the group is kinda lost on the current project or something). Just wondering what your thoughts would be on this""

397,"I'll start by setting up my current situation and my struggle within my degree. I am a undergrad engineering student in a midwest school. I was an excellent student in high school and was able to maintain above a 4.0 with little stress or pressure to succeed. Because of this and a relatively solid ACT score, I was fortunate to receive a full ride scholarship to my local university for either engineering or computer science related degrees. I went through two years of computer engineering and my grades slowly started slip. It has only gotten more difficult to stay motivated to do my work and study. I don't find the content itself that difficult, and I have held leadership roles throughout high school, so I was elected President of the IEEE chapter at my college. Eventually my gpa dropped to about a 3.0 and I lost half my scholarship while on probation for the other half. I am now in the fall of my third year, and while I find the field of my major fascinating, I am struggling to engage with the content and motivate myself to work on the projects and study for exams. I am more behind than ever this semester, and it may hurt my gpa even more and push me back a year. My parents were able to save enough for about 4 years of tuition, and I have worked part time since the end of high school, so I can afford a new major if needed.

Side note: I began to struggle with depression and mental health at the beginning of college as well. I had a pretty easy childhood growing up, but my family dynamic is relatively broken. My mother was able to go unchecked in the way she treated me and added a lot of external pressure along with some occasional verbal abuse when I started to struggle (I just recently confronted her over this and the situation is improving).

I am still the President, and three years into computer engineering I am struggling to decide whether or not I should switch majors. I am fearful of throwing away all that I worked for, and the reputation it may leave with me. I initially chose computer engineering because I enjoy building and working with computers in both hardware and software. I also have creative desires (usually pertaining video game related work), and an interest in helping protect the world from climate change by learning about renewable energy. I seem to have a knack for high level-language programming as well (as opposed to writing assembly instructions).

Am I just lazy and need to get my act together, or should I seriously consider switching majors?

She doesn’t as these girls never seen me before) then I then went back to finish cleaning the table and it went quiet again:

Me: *looked over*

I realize that these topics are not also meaningful to her and I definitely don't enjoy what she is interested in discussing. The difference is when we are in a group discussion I put up with the small talk and participate despite my lack of interest. If I really don't like the discussion, I don't complain I just keep quiet until the conversation shifts to something I can tolerate. Whenever I bring up something ever so slightly more complex than surface level conversation she will mock me by saying something like, ""oh, you're so deep"".  I have a generous temperament and can usually just let things slide, but this really beginning to get under my skin. She is even more dismissive of any character flaw you point out in her and always turns it back on you. Has anyone dealt with a similar situation to this?",05Nov2018,1
404,"Hey, so my significant other has cheated on me a couple of times now and always feels terrible afterward. Somehow we have still managed to work it out. A few days ago they got drunk and cheated on me once again. While I can see this is a toxic relationship for me to be in, they have verbally expressed to me that if I leave them, they will kill themselves. I am one of the only people she's close to, and they have been admitted to the hospital for being suicidal before so I have no doubt she will legitimately do it. I'm not sure I am ready to leave them yet either even if I know I should. What am I supposed to do in this situation to best help them through this? I dont think I can bring myself to leave them right now.",05Nov2018,1

407,"So my brother is being bullied in school and from what I'm hearing, it's fairly bad. For example, he had another kid on top of him last Thursday closed fist hitting him and now the school finally wants to do something. The school isn't really doing much to the other kid. My brother has timidly admitted a few times to this kid hitting him but it took a teacher seeing that assault to finally care. This has been happening for months mind you. 

Now how is this getting ridiculous? Well turns out the school wants to blame this abuse on us and not the bully. That led to us getting a visit from CPS today. Turns out they took a conversation where my mother tried to give him different examples of why what the other kid is doing is wrong and turned it on its head. I rough house with my brother, I wont lie. But nothing that ever ends in bruising or any real pain for him. I never attempt or even unconsciously try and hurt him. But from that example of why he tells on me when I try to mess with him when he doesnt want it, they got abuse and neglect. 

While the CPS woman said that she didnt see any signs of abuse or neglect, we're still fairly pissed at the school for doing nothing for my brother. And while I understand mandatory reporting and the sort, I'm not upset with the CPS or the report. I'm frustrated and want real change from the school. Change him classes, separate the kids, do something. My mother has had several meetings and dozens of emails and nothing. What do we do next? How can we help him?

A couple nights ago I was waiting in the car to go home because I had been volunteering with the patients because they were a bit understaffed so I was just hanging out with them. I saw this one CNA walking to her car with a bag. From what my mom told me she's tight on money. She's trying to support her thirty-year-old son who was/is a drug addict and her husband, on a fourteen dollar an hour salary. Her son always wants to eat out he's emotionally abusive towards her. My mom's boyfriend has caught her stealing before and other coworkers as well. I went with my mom's boyfriend to drop off my mom's lunch last night and as it turns out the day after I saw her suspiciously walking with a bag of something, a bag of shrimp and popsicles were missing from the resident fridge. It's really suspicious especially because she has been caught before. My problem is with morals. If I report her and she gets fired and can't support her family I'd feel extremely guilty but the problem is that it's morally wrong for her to be stealing from people with little money, who can't work, don't feel good, and often times don't have immediate family they can turn to. At this point, it's not even about needing food it's like compulsive. I mean shrimp and popsicles, seriously? What do I do? It's such a difficult position.

However in the space of a week it all went to shit, my friends made other mates who they all got into relationships with and basically left me for them and my other mate just found another group and seems to rarely have time for me anymore. 

Now I still have friends at uni, but no group or anyone I feel I could get close to like I thought I had before.

However I’m seriously concerned about things such as knowledge of history, historic figures, things like vocabulary and attention span. I had terrible ADHD growing up and my brain was hardly in attendance during school so I blame it partially on this. I find I also spend most of my time ( when I’m not working night shift at work) on the computer or my phone, looking at mind numbing pointless things. I was thinking I should try to start reading, I haven’t read a book since elementary and I’m now two years graduated from high school. I REALLY feel like I want to learn more and enhance my brain power.  To be completely honest my father is the smartest guy I know, he knows at least a little about every subject brought up and I really wish I could be like this. My mom is more simple minded, isn’t much of a deep thinker, and isn’t well educated on most subjects (which is completely fine) I feel as though I am a mix between the two. I want people to see me as a guy like my dad, the guy who teaches people things, and can add more depth into any conversation. Not the guy who can hardly hold up a conversation, and gives responses like “yeah” or “oh really?” far to often. Anyway I know this is abit of a pointless spiel but any advice will do.  ",05Nov2018,1
414,"I'm not really sure what I'm expecting to get out of this but I guess I'm looking for a fresh perspective. Here's the deal:

I \[30M\] have been dating a girl \[27F\] for over 2 years, we live together, and for periods of time things will go well. The issue is her past. When we first started dating she insisted on having the ""how many people have you been with"" talk. Against my better judgement we went down this horrible rabbit hole. Turns out she had been with A LOT of dudes. This bugged me. I don't know why, I'm not sure I have a right for it to bother me, but it does.

Some time went by and she could tell that it was bugging me, I would ask questions about the different encounters hoping that this would put my mind at ease. As we would dig into it she would slowly tell me that she didn't actually sleep with all these people, she just wanted me to think she was cool.

Basically, I partially believe her, but I also don't. There is no way to know what the actual truth is. There are periods of time where it will just be an out of site out of mind sort of thing, but then something will set me off and I'll go off the deep end thinking about weather or not she is this ex-slut or not.

Recently we went to a wedding where one of her college friends was getting married. The stories being told and the way she was acting around them just really set me off and I'm leaning towards the ex-slut verdict currently. Is this relationship just broken? I understand that only I can make that decision, but some fresh perspective could be helpful.

TL;DR: Girlfriend says she has slept with a lot of people then backtracks saying she just wanted me to think she was cool. Do I believe her? Is this relationship just broken? Is there a way to verify which version is the actual truth?",05Nov2018,1

416,"Hi, first things first, try not to get too amused reading this, even though it seems like nothing, it's fucked me up mentally and i've been borderline suicidal thinking about it. Another thing, i have no problem with gay people, live and let live. So when i was about 14/15 (I'm 18 now), i had read that masturbation can be more enjoyable if you put something up your butt. Well basically i tried it with my finger and then used a pencil instead so i would have both my hands free. I simply put the pencil in my ass and rubbed one out. From what i remember, i didn't enjoy it that much because it just felt kind of awkward but i still went through with it anyways. The fact i did this is killing me inside just thinking about it. I'm a straight guy and i love women, definitely not sexually attracted to men either. Well i searched how common it is online and it seems that most guys think it's gay and anyone who does it is a closeted homosexual or has homosexual tendencies. They were calling anyone who did it 'fags'. This has caused me great discomfort. I even mentioned it in a roundabout way to my friends and they all though that only someone gay would do something like that. It's hard to describe how i feel right now, intense shame and self-disgust, regret (i was in tears earlier because i'd do anything to go back and not do what i did) and i feel like i have some sort of horrible secret that i can't tell anybody and everybody would judge me for.

428,"This is a long story so thank you so much to anyone who takes the time to read and respond.  I’m a 21 year old female whose in college right now. Recently my mom has been incredibly sick, in and out of the hospital, I’ve been struggling to keep up with grades and rent, and I’m recently going through a painful breakup. I may have to move home and leave school so I can help take care of my six younger siblings in case things don’t end okay with my mom. The emotion surrounding these situations really blew up this past weekend. I’ve been thinking about suicide for about a month, I feel pretty hopeless on a day to day basis and don’t feel like I have any source of happiness. I went through this similarly in high school, and I knew from experience that people don’t like to be friends with depressed and negative people. So, I’ve held it in, I haven’t told my friend how dark my thoughts are. I have three very close best friends, we will call them A, S and T (first two are females, second is male).  We’ve all been through very dark times together but have helped eachother through it, never anything this serious though. Additionally I should mention that all four of us work together at a restaurant. This last Saturday night, them three went to a concert and I had to work because I needed to make money for rent that I was already late on (their parents pay for all of their rent and groceries so they never really understand the financial stress I’m under). Once I got home from work, it hit me that this was the night I wanted to do it. I started gathering pills, looking up ways to make it look like an accident. My friends were about to be on the way home from the concert and I started panicking. I broke a mirror and layed on the floor bawling my eyes out because i knew if I went through with this I would be hurting my friends and my family, so even if pain was existing, it would be fucked up to force the people I love to feel as sad as I do.  So I picked up my phone and texted A and S. I told them I was feeling incredibly unstable and suicidal and that I was going to go to the hospital to check myself in. Of course they showed up at the apartment 15 minutes later as I was grabbing my things. T (the guy) started screaming at me about how I needed to get help, and how awful it was that I was putting them through this and how traumatic it was. They told me that I “just should have told them how i was feeling.” I reiterated to them that from experience, people tend to slowly cut off friends who act sad all the time, they even agreed with me. The rest of the night felt like a very awkward lecture on how they were there for me, but the only one who spoke was T. A and S stared blankly at the wall, just seeming very shaken up. 

The next morning, S T and I were supposed to work together, therefor drive together (S and I live together, but that night,  T stayed over. A went home).

I woke up that day to them leaving the apartment. No one came in my room to say bye, or ask how i was feeling. They left for work without me when we were all meant to drive together. I got to work thirty minutes later and they would not even look at me. Eventually T came to me and told me that they weren’t trying to ignore me, but that this was traumatic and they didn’t know what to say or do. He proceeded to get incredibly angry and go off on how i “needed professional help” and how this was too much for them to handle. We ended up screaming at each other at work, and he ended the argument by saying he didn’t care what happened to me anyway. 

According to S (my roommate), the rest of the shift T was holding back tears. This shift was yesterday morning. S didn’t even stay at home with me last night. T has not tried to reach out to me at all, I haven’t seen or spoken to A.

I’m heading through gossip that people don’t even believe I’m suicidal and it was for attention. This is why I never wanted to tell my friends what was going on, I knew this was going to happen. Now I’m alone and my friends hate me. I think they’re being incredibly unfair, and my gut tells me that I should cut them out of my life. 

I feel so lost and angry. I’ve never spoken out about feeling sad, I’m always the one in the group who keeps things positive, I have a lot more responsibilities and bills to pay than my three friends, so I’ve always been known as the one who perseveres. But right now I’m not strong at all.... things are so hard and I’m so scared and unhappy. I never knew that telling my friends how i was feeling would push them away. They are making me feel so guilty about how i feel. What should I do? Any advice is appreciated, thank you for reading ",05Nov2018,1

431,"I have a really good friend/roommate who’s in his late 20s and who seems to have a child-like view of the world still. For some context he just moved out for the first time earlier this year with a couple other friends and myself. He’s the oldest in the house but the one who struggles the most to hold a job, the one who has been stuck at a jc for ten years, the one who has separation anxiety with his toxic gf, and I (nor the other roommates) noticed how bad it was until we saw things unravel for him when he moved out from his parents. 

Within the first couple months he quit his job for being too fast paced and demanding, and within another month got a seasonal job that he’s had before. He left the first time because once the season is over they might hire you on but the hours can be few and far between. He also lost his snake inside the house luckily he found it within a couple months. He also started failing his one and only class this semester and instead of dropping the class he’s going to just take the F. And lastly, the snake just died, after only a couple years of owning it, and it’s not the type of snake to die easy. 

On top of all of this his gf has been slowly isolating him for the last several years. He used to be the type that had a reason to be friends with everyone but now he talks badly about his oldest and closest friends and family members. Recently they’ve been talking about moving out to a big city like LA where he can transfer to a university and she can become an actress. 

My other roommates and I have no idea what he’s talking about anymore regarding most things. He talks about the world as if he were entitled to whatever he wants, and he’s never really been like this before. It might also be worth noting that his little brother has had a similar much more dramatic issue that he has taken so far as to try to convince people he is capable of flight.

432,"In short, I am taking a year off from school after receiving my BA before going to grad school. I got a job in the town in which I completed my BA with the hopes of keeping said job until summer of 2019. This place I was working at had a very blue collar attitude, but I largely ignored the animated and expressive, but not overtly violent or offensive antics of my coworkers. This became impossible when a coworker repeatedly made fun of me for being Jewish, talked about me getting beat up by neo-Nazis, and made light of the Synagogue attack in Pittsburgh. He did so with multiple ""joking"" Nazi salutes and in a manner that made me fear for my safety. This was last Tuesday.

&amp;#x200B;

Multiple coworkers saw this exchange, nobody said a word. I quit on the spot. This business is independently owned, and the owner showed essentially no interest in doing anything about what happened. Upon hearing that I had quit, he said he would give me a good reference and ""would let me know if he heard about any openings in town"" but left it that. Oh, and a not overwhelmingly sincere apology. Because I quit so abruptly, I am having to look for a job from scratch, and I am quickly running out of money while I search. I am fortunate enough to have parents that likely would help me financially if need be, but I really would like to avoid that. Would it be unreasonable if I asked my former boss for some kind of severance pay? My last (half of a) check comes this week, and it seems entirely unjust that I am having to struggle with unemployment and loss of income because of somebody else's hatred. Should I spread the word (online and/or in town) that this business owner is, at least tacitly, condoning racism and hate speech? I just do not feel comfortable letting everybody but me not have any consequences for what happened. Thanks for any insight.

TL;DR

&amp;#x200B;

Last Tuesday my (now former) coworker made violent anti-Semitic comments and gestures. I quit, the owner of the business did nothing, and now I am unemployed and quickly running out of money (broke college kid between undergrad and grad school). It seems unfair that the perpetrator of hate speech, and the business owner who allows it to happen get away with zero consequences. While I did nothing wrong and am now out of a job. Do I ask for some kind of severance pay? Do I spread the word about what happened?",05Nov2018,1

434,"My younger sister spent last year in a poor mental state and was borderline suicidal. Not only that, but she has multiple friends with ED's, ptsd, depression/anxiety, and a whole host of mental illnesses. My mother discovered last year that imessage is still up on my sisters login on the family laptop, and logs in as her and reads them live. She used to justify this as a way of keeping an eye on her in case she starts hinting at attempting suicide to people. I never loved the idea but couldn't really do anything. 

Since then, my sister's been doing better, but she's not perfect (though she is no longer suicidal afaik - she's much better in that regard) - but my mother is still continuing to read my sisters texts and logs into her facebook profile ""to see what the other kids are doing and to try to understand them."" 

My mom tends towards obsessiveness about things, and is reading my sister's private conversations and trying to figure out everything with her and her friends. It's becoming extremely unhealthy, to the point where she's getting invested in drama that doesn't involve her at all. However, my mom strictly told me not to inform my younger sister. My sister is aware texts have been seen, but I don't think she's aware how deeply my mother is combing through conversations. 

I want to intervene without causing a shitstorm at my house. I have three options that I can think of:

1. Tip off my sister about the texts via snapchat (mom can't read those) or phone call and get her to disable imessage on that laptop. I'm worried this knowledge may increase my sister's distrust of my mother, and may completely sever any chances of them having a totally healthy relationship towards one another. My sister is no angel, but she deserves some privacy. 
2. Disable imessage myself without anyone's knowledge when I come home this weekend, and make it seem like ""computer did an oops"". My mom isn't the most tech savvy, and would rather me do computer setup for her than just google something. 
3. Tell my mother to stop reading them. I'll be honest, this is the least likely option to work, as she believes invading my sister's privacy is the right thing to do \*for her sake.\*

I can tell this is a really unhealthy thing for my mom to be doing, as she's obsessing over things she really has no business obsessing about. I genuinely think it will ease things in the house if she is no longer able to read them.

437,"Just some more information, right now I'm a server, I usually work a between 35 to 45 hours a week delending on my schedual. My shifts usually start after 4:45pm and I live with two servers from work. Because our shifts are so late in the day usually we sleep all day, go to work, and stay up late to do our errands or to hang out and have guests ect. 

At the new job they're in mandatory overtime and have been for 2 years now so I should be working around 50+ hours a week in a warehouse and I have to wake up at 4:30am to be on work on time at 6 in the next town over. 

I already have trouble going to sleep before 3am even when I want to and if I flip my schedual my roommates will still be loud and want me to hang out and make it difficult to get sleep. I'm 18 and already worried about taking on this amount of work and not be able to socialize with my roommates and friends much anymore, but I'll be making a lot of money and it will give me versital field experience for the different (but similar) careers I'm considering. I don't care for the socializing as much as my loss of sleep and mental health from working 6 days a week. I already struggle with mental health and I don't know how this will affect me.

440,"Whoa boy here it goes, Thanksgiving again. My least favorite holiday. Always has been. But this year it might reach a shrieking crescendo.

Let's look at the pros and cons:

PROS:
-Will get to see my sisters and mom.

CONS:
-Will have to see my grandfather who hates us all now because he thinks we ""betrayed"" him by trying to send him and my grandmother to a retirement community
-Will have to see my grandmother who is now fully in the throes of dementia, but my grandfather refuses to get her a caretaker
-Will have to see my mom's aunt, uncle, and cousins who are members of a small, fringe, extremist sect of evangelical Protestantism that has been denounced by many evangelical religious leaders as a ""cult"" and ""hate group"" and who have also legit stolen money and valuables from my grandparents and mother
-I have converted to a new faith that the above family *cannot* find out I'm a part of
-Oh yeah, will have to see my father, who while recently divorced from my mother, my mother feels obligated to invite him. He is a violent, psychotic individual who is addicted to hard drugs, a crippling alcoholic, and is inconsistent in taking his psych meds. Last time he was invited to a family event he took LSD and smashed a bunch of portraits of my mom around my grandparents' house. But oh yes, my mom simply MUST invite her ex-husband to these events because ""otherwise he'd be completely alone"" (he's disowned by his own family)
-I am financially tight on funds and cannot drop a large amount of money for cross-country plane tickets (I recently moved to the opposite coast where my family lives) when I'd only be spending 2, maybe 3 days out there.

""Just don't go!"" seems like the proper response, right? Well that's easier said than done because I *know* my mother will be devastated. A few Thanksgivings ago, one of my sisters refused to attend Thanksgiving with this same set of grandparents because she was sick of their abusive behavior and instead went and spent Thanksgiving with our other grandparents... this did NOT go over well with my mother, who spent the entirety of that Thanksgiving crying and lashing out at me, saying I was at fault for not convincing my sister to come. One year I too considered not going and my mother had a meltdown saying ""You have to go! You HAVE  to! You can't do that to your grandparents, that's just heartless, and you can't leave ME alone to deal with them!"" and so I gave in and went: that Thanksgiving, I spent Thanksgiving night on a suicide hotline because I didn't know how to handle my grandparents, dad, and my mom's family any longer.

I don't want to put myself in an emotionally (and possibly physically) abusive environment which will have a huge dark cloud over it the entire time, not to mention it'd require me spending hundreds of dollars that I simply just do not have. If I go home for Thanksgiving, I can't guarantee I can go home for Christmas. My mother isn't going to hear any of that though, so that's not going to fly as an excuse to not come. She's going to continue to tell me I have to come because she can't handle them alone, what with my grandfather's significantly deteriorating physical health and my grandmother and father's significantly deteriorated mental health.

I really don't want a repeat of the Thanksgiving that my sister boycotted NOR the Thanksgiving that I myself almost boycotted, but I don't know how to break it to my mother that I just can't go.

What can I say to my mom to minimize this damage without long-lasting consequences? (Cuz trust me, it took a good year or so to fix the damage of my sister boycotting Thanksgiving that one time)",05Nov2018,1
441,"Okay, so here's the gist.

-I've known this guy since I was around 12 (I'm 21 now)

-He gets tons of great friends while I wallow in loneliness for the last few years

-He is now on the verge of getting a girlfriend, and has an overall great social life

-I spend all my time drinking alone or on the internet

-Jealousy and depression grows to the point where I admit it all to him last night

I don't know what to do. I won't be able to go to uni until I'm almost 24 because of the rules here, and I don't know what else to do. I can't keep being jealous, as I'm genuinely happy for him too.

443,"So last night, I passed out in the girls bathroom in my dorm building. I had just taken a shower and was looking at a bruise on my knee with my friend when all of a sudden I started feeling nauseous and dizzy. This has happened before, so I looked at my friend and said ""I think I might pass out."" She quickly took my arm and wrapped it around her shoulders so she could support me, and a few seconds later, my ears were flooded with really loud ringing and my vision was entirely gone. The next thing I remember was waking up on the floor of the girls bathroom with her and my other friend standing over me asking if I need water or want to go to the hospital. They went with me to the ER shortly after that.   
The reason I'm so concerned is because this time was very different from the other times I've passed out. Usually, my face and lips go white and my muscles become weak and I just go limp and unconscious. This time, my two friends who were there said that my face was turning bright bright red, my muscles were extremely tense (she said my arms were stiff and shaking), my eyes were wide open, and my veins were popping out. My friends said they were worried that I was about to have a seizure. This time was also different because usually I have a few minutes to realize what's about to happen before it happens, but last night it was just a matter of seconds between the first wave of dizziness and me completely blacking out. 

I've only passed out twice before (once in August and once a couple weeks ago) and both were presumably caused by extreme pain, but last night I wasn't experiencing any sort of pain, it just happened. I told the doctor that I've passed out three times in the last 3-4 months and that it's really starting to concern me, and he did all the blood/urine tests and an EKG test and everything was completely fine. He said that sometimes people just pass out due to any number of things and that it's very common and completely benign, but for some reason I feel like it's a bigger deal than that. Am I being paranoid? Or do some people just consistently pass out at any given moment like I seem to be doing lately? Also is there any sort of reason that there were so many differences in my body when it was happening than the previous times? The doctor I went to last night didn't really give a clear explanation for that and I'm seeing my primary doctor on Friday, but until then any advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.",05Nov2018,1

Almost every month she meets someone, he’s the love of her life after 3 dates, she talks him up to everyone and anyone including herself to make them out to be Prince Charming. After about 2 or so weeks they will even start talking about Marriage, and then that fizzles out and she meets someone else.

447,"Okay this may be all over the place but I am going to try and type out all the overwhelming thoughts and sadness I have right now.  So I've had a pretty rough go at life so far. I struggled with addiction for years and major depression.  I was in rehab several times and had to lean on my parents a lot! My parents basically had a ""teenager"" until I was 26.  I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for them.  2 years ago they paid 15,000 for me to go to rehab and also helped out me and my husband when we were trying to get back on our feet a ton! Once again, don't know what we would have done without them.  

But their inheritance from my grandfathers death has run out and they spent all of it on me and my brother (older than me and also still dependent on my parents) They often have to pay his rent, his phone bill etc.  Well somehow (no idea how ) I finally escaped my addiction after 10 years of trying.  I used to be an IV drug user and a very bad alcoholic since I was 17.  I am 28 now. My husband has also gotten clean. 

We were living with them up until about a month ago and had been for 5 months during which they took care of us mostly while we tried to make any money we could we contribute.  They pretty much are in the hole --DEEP from helping us and my brother.

A month ago my husband got a job in the Bay Area and we recently moved from my parents on the east coast out to California. We went from making no money and living at my parents to collectively making a little over 200,000 a year.  

We flew out here with hardly any belongings so it's going to take a lot of money to (not only rent a house in the bay area) but also buy all new things.  I imagine it will take us at least 9 months to get completely on our feet with everything we need, I am also in lots of therapy that is also a large chunk of money. 

My mom called me today crying and my heart is broken.  She is a saint and is just going through so much and I want to help her so bad.  So, I got clean and now my brother (31) has gotten really bad off.  He is drinking everyday all day and doing uppers and kratom. He got beat up 2 nights ago and got all his meds stolen from him--his BAC was .38 and now he is staying at my parents. About to lose his job, so they have him to worry about with money now too.  My moms brother paid their rent and they wrote a check to pay him back and it bounced. He called her today very angry and asking her how they are so broke at their age (he's an ass) their electric is also way overdue and their electric will probably be shut off.  My dad takes klonopin (prescribed) and just doesn't care about anything so my mom carries all of this by herself.

She called me today bawling and saying she doesn't know what to do and I know she wants us to help her and I want to more than anything but we just don't have the money yet.  As soon as we get paid the money is going to things we need to slowly get on our feet (since we flew we just had to buy a car for example)  

My husband gives 350 direct deposit into his grandparents account every paycheck and I really want to do the same thing for my parents but I don't know how to ask him or why he hasn't suggested it.  My mom is truly a saint and deserves to me happy--this is truly breaking my heart.  Any advice would be amazing--I feel so helpless.",05Nov2018,1

My problem is that I'm often too nice. I always end up giving discounts and not charging what I should. It hurts me financially, but I keep doing it. I have a daughter now so it's even more important for me to be making more money and saving for her future. 

Many of my customers are friends and family, so it makes it even tougher. The only times I actually charge full price are when I don't like the person that I'm working for.

I have watched YouTube videos, tried self talk, listened to audio books, etc etc and I still can't get past this ""block"" I have.

One factor that I have noticed is that customers will end up talking to me for 30 minutes about life, so I feel that I should not charge them for that time. The problem is that I'm so busy, I can't afford the time wasted on small talk. Other factors are customers who refer me to people and expect a discount and customers who give me gifts etc.

2 and a half years ago, I decided to move to NYC to start college. I’m 25 now, and I was in the military before. For the first 2 semesters, I was kicking ass. I was getting all A’s, part of the deans list, and volunteering at school as well. One night, I went out in the Bronx and got drugged and raped outside of a club. I woke up to the sounds of an old guy moaning on top of me inside of his car.. it fucking haunts me still. When I came to the following morning, I booked a flight home and fled. I became a mess, I was angry, depressed, thought about dying everyday. Eventually, I thought that I was fine enough to go back to NYC.. but that semester was a shit show. I failed a class, and got a C and another D. My GPA plummeted, obviously. On top of that, I had a brain tumor scare that turned out to be a micro-adenoma. Flash forward to this semester. I thought I would do better, as I found the love of my life and I am generally happy now.. but I can’t find motivation for anything. I can’t even summon up the will to do any of the school work that I used to fly through. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’m so mad at myself. What do I do?

Randomly, I ended up linking as first cousins with people from California who were mutually related and knew each other as family.  

For background, I am a 36 yo F only child of my mom’s and third of my dad’s.  Both parents were military and in a long distance relationship when I was concieved and born.  I was born while my mom was stationed in (you guessed it) California.   

Im trying not to jump to conclusions but I also strongly believe in the science of DNA. I look exactly like my mother so it would be hard to compare resemblance wise to my mom.

 I bought the whole family Ancestry DNA kits and my mom refused to participate. While my dad got sick before I could get his sample.  I may have another shot at it this Thanksgiving but he is still ill and it may be difficult to get that much saliva.

456,"Odd question but my whole life (28yr old female) I’ve had terrible monthly breast pain about a week before my period since puberty. I was told it’s just fiber cystic breasts. I went on adderall 5 months ago
for adhd. I noticed I had hardly no any breast pain or absolutely none but still got my period every 28 days. I’ve been taking breaks from it on the weekends sometimes as it’s 30mg ER. This last time it just so happened to fall when it was a week before my period ..horrible breast pain. I went Saturday and Sunday without adderall and just wore two sports bras. I was still in pain Monday morning but within an hour or so of taking adderall, again I hardly noticed  the pain. Reduced it by 80-90%. I had tried every over the counter pain medication for this before and nothing worked including holistic treatments. I’m 5’3, 115lbs and 32D so my weight is healthy and I’m active. I’ve had hormones levels tested (all healthy), the only birth control that stopped the breast pain was the Depo shot (because it shuts down the cycle entirely) I had before modified my diet to include no sugar, caffeine or diary with maybe only a 10-20% reduction in monthly breast pain overall. I was told by my OBGYN after a mammogram at 23 that I have almost all dense breast tissue and as my mother and grandmother has it as well, it’s simply genetic. Also, as there’s no history of any cancer including breast cancer in my family, it’s not of concern to them. I am shocked that adderall acts almost as an analgesic to my breast pain. How does adderall have a pain numbing effect? I swear this isn’t a placebo effect as I would never have  thought this would occur. Is it the large increase in dopamine? ",05Nov2018,1

I started college as a music education major, but bailed after two years after I came to understand that I can't live off circus peanuts for the rest of my life. I've since changed to major in business, but once again feel unfulfilled. My dad is an alcoholic, and my mom makes a *tremendous* amount of money.

We introduced them slowly first by letting the dog (named Azra) walk into the same room as the cat on a leash. It went well. We kept the cat in one room for most of the first few days and letting the dog come in and see the cat from time to time. Now the kitten is still most of the time in the chosen room (our bedroom, its pretty big) but we let her walk around the apartment for a few hours every day while keeping a close eye on both her and the dog.

The obvious problem is that Azra is a hunting dog. She has her instincts and sadly she tried to hurt her twice. One time after a walk i was talking to my mother and she was still on the leash and Azra jumped on the cat but i held her luckily. The second time i was out shopping and when i came back i heard that she tried to hurt her again, by grabbing her in her mouth. The other details i dont know, i wasnt there.

462,"Ok so, during my first year of uni, I lied to my friends telling them I had a one night stand with this girl. I'm now in my second year and one of my friends is friends with this girl now. 

I'm afraid that I'll come up in a conversation and this girl will tell my friend that we didn't actually have sex.

It's been a year since that lie and I've continued the lie whenever it came up in between (this one time they were asking about my experience with her). 

Is my friend does find out that we never had sex and brings it up, what should I do?? Should I admit it was a lie before she finds out? Also what should I say in such a scenario.

I'm really afraid that they'll lose trust in me and think I'm a loser since I lied about sex but the lie has been ongoing for so long that it's hard to come out with he truth.",05Nov2018,1
463,"Massive argument that's tearing my family and friends apart.

Basically, I have had a dentist appointment booked for 3 weeks, to pick up and fit a retainer.

Then within 24 hours of the appointment, a place im applying to wants to have an interview with me. Since my dentist has a cancel within 24 hours, pay full price policy, I sent a respectful letter back saying I am unable to make that time, Here are available times within a week of the original time, I hope I didn't cause any inconvenience.

Later at about 7 O clock in the evening, I get another email saying the interviewer has to leave at 12 the day of the appointment and asks whether I can do it an hour later, which is cutting it close but possible.

So I tell my friends and family I thought that was a little insensitive of the interviewer pressing a time slot that is hard for me with very little warning.

The argument then devolved into two sides

I am an idiot for not cancelling the dentist because it shows I'm not motivated enough for the position and this will now cause a mark on my profile saying I'm not motivated enough and inflexible.

They are insensitive for assuming I can take a time slot with less than 24 hours warning.

Basically, I am in the number two slot, thinking I acted correctly and should there be a mark added I think that is just slightly insensitive marking someone up for caring about their health.

But my parents and some friends are saying its just common sense that you cancel the dentist and make time for the interviewer.",05Nov2018,1
464,"This may or may not be the right sub--please confirm. I am at a serious crossroads and could use some suggestions as to where to take my life. I am 41 and been in music academia for the last 13yrs. I enjoy teaching, however I do not agree with or function well in traditional academic settings at all. I have been teaching freelance lessons and enjoy the ability to really help create change outside the barriers of bureaucracy. I have a music degree from a conservatory that is considered vocational, and for this reason I cannot move upward into any formal teaching environment, and to be honest, I have very mixed feelings about doing so anyway.

Recently I enrolled in an online undergraduate program to start all over again (given the limitations of my current degree) with the intention of just hacking through it to then possibly go about grad school. I am constantly asking myself ""What's it all for?"". I really like (but don't love) what I'm learning about (geography--GIS major), but I hate the teachers (they are unclear and don't care) and entire school experience thus far. To think that I've got several YEARS of sacrifice all to bag groceries while I mull over next steps draws a caution flag as to if this is really how great minds are made, potential manifested, fulfillment achieved.

Over the last five years I have tried different career paths, as either potential supplements to my part-time music or full-time career changes, were it to feel right. I went to college for one semester when I was living back east thinking I'd major in the earth sciences and hated the passionless, impersonal, unfair experience of traditional higher education, but enjoyed most of the material. I stopped going after that.

Then I did a web development bootcamp, a 16wk long, 100hr workweek ""immersive"", and did rather well in that.I got hired right out of school (I was one of three students who did, and the only one of which who did not have connections prior). After two years in the field I ended up hating the tech industry for various reasons: the cold-hearted business overlap, stress of knowing my job is always in jeopardy if I could not fix a line of code, people were arrogant and approached work as know-it-alls instead of curious individuals. It wasn't creative so much as it was technical/mildly creative. I wanted to like my coworkers. I am a community-minded person and there was no real community there, just sterile 9-5. I wanted to help people.

After that I tried prereqs for occupational therapy (OT), again in a traditional setting. I enjoyed learning what I could, however I wasn't really into the people in my classes--I felt fundamentally different, lacking the analytical, competitive nature, the ego. It was unbalanced for my needs--purely academic in nature, no creativity.

I have a problem with things that don't immediately ""click"" with me. I am sensitive to the character of others to a critical fault, although I consider it to be a strength when and if I can find my field. I was born to be a craftsman, but I now exist in a world where craftsman are not valued and rarely succeed.

After OT I tried building a career in fitness as a personal trainer--I enjoy working out and thought I could teach fitness and music and together maybe squeak by with rent. I was working for the YMCA, but I found this industry too corrupt, vain, and shallow for me, and the pay was absolute garbage. The corporate heads were making six figure salaries while the rest of the staff made close to minimum wage, and all the budget was spent on marketing, new TVs, and keeping the external image of the business luxurious for members to justify the upper head's salaries. This wasn't the deal-breaker, however. Watching 80% of all certified ""professionals"" teaching their clients exercises with horribly incorrect form was what slowly drove me to leave. Knowing that this lack of competency was caused by the lack of regulation of the industry itself--because the industry only cares about money and will allow anyone to pass their certification exams, bro science at best and at all levels of operation--this made me upset at work by default. I was the only person at work who asked ""why"" things work the way they do, who needed to know answers; my questions led to deeper levels of understanding and posed more questions. To me this is how learning works, and I felt like an alien again since no one around me seemed to care about knowing ""why"".

Now I am going to school in an online setting. I thought that maybe if I were to go at it online that I would be able to see it through to completion, however I find the online environment, although convenient and less stressful in many regards, to be an utter fail. Without the ability to ask questions as lessons move along context cannot be built effectively, and I am doing A effort for C work. I fucking hate it. I am paying out of state tuition for all of this as well, and it's just an undergrad--the new GED. It is clear, in my school with over 300 students per class, videotaped classes, no support platform, and TAs doing all the grading, that it's all about preserving and expanding the institution (ca$h cow), but never improving the approach to learning. I've had it with being taken advantage of. I am worth more than this pathetic system called ""higher education"".

Prior to the last five years I was living in NYC teaching music, and overall (sans city stress) happy with my path. But I wanted to do more than scrape by, and this wasn't a possibility.

Rewinding all the way back to jr college days it was more of the same scenario: feeling traditional academia wasn't a good fit for my learning style, preferring vocational/skill-based, hands-on programs. I loved every minute of my music school because I was actually playing music! I wish I could have worked for that school, but that wasn't a possibility. I also feel that I am sensitive to the balance life is trying to impose on me, almost immediately aware; I'm not the type to teach 40hr weeks and have anything left in the way of passion for the craft. I've learned teaching music should be more of a supplemental endeavor.

I am talking Reddit's ears off because I am desperate to figure out how to find my path. I was meant for great influence. I have very strong convictions of the heart and want to give myself to my work, but I also need to be loved by it in return, and I don't know where to search for this anymore. I am seriously depressed, deeply in debt, struggling financially, and without friends to confide in. I just moved across the country to set myself up in place affordable enough to live while going to this school I currently don't see panning out in my favor. Said several times this post: I feel as if I am living in a world that I do not belong in, a world that is constructed for mechanized economical success and designed to institutionalize those who see the world fundamentally different. I am an artist. I am a born leader, but only if I believe where I am going is best for those I am to lead. I am unique, and I feel like this world only seems to value individuals like myself after they have obtained great success, but finding one's way takes more than determination, intelligence, and passion: it takes a lot of luck, and a little help from friends, perspective, wisdom, and those things are presently lacking.

I fantasize about being part of a music venue coop, a mountaineer guiding others to unknown places (more for the fun imagery here), a teacher of some new creative approach to education traveling throughout the world while building relationships with others from different backgrounds, but I don't have the credentials to do any of these things (except the coop), and it seems like I'm not cut out to survive the institutional educational process that awards the credentials I would need to do such things because I am that fundamentally different in how I think, learn, view our world, and in what I value. So I am trapped outside the realm of influence.

Worth noting: I am a very HSP. If you don't know about that feel free to research. I suspect this will be common knowledge at every dinner table in 10 years. I am very much into the subjective experience of whatever. I have re-read and re-edited this post countless times, for instance. Being immersed in something (anything) is what I live for. I love the experience of experiencing.

\~\~\~

I want to know from those who can personally relate to my plight, those further along than myself: What other paths are available? Where do I go to find a sense of purpose, community, possibly find my way into these dreams?

To those who are entrepreneurs: What did it take to push you over the edge and just ""do it""? How did you begin? How did you find the help you required? Could you have done it completely alone? What would you say to someone like myself?

For those who feel they are finally on the right path now, who didn't know it was coming, who have finally found their peace with what they do: Looking back, did you know it was right in the beginning? How did you know? Were there any identifiable attributes in that small voice of intuition that helped you take those seemingly insignificant steps towards what has now manifested into your destiny?

Or was a lot of it just luck?",05Nov2018,1
465,"Me and my boyfriend broke up earlier this summer (about June), due to something very small.

466,"Hey!

I'll just jump right into it. Every time I got close to a girl I was romantically interested in, she became my life's purpose. No matter who it was or how long I've known them for, I started getting more and more attached to them, dependant on them. I stopped being myself and became who I thought they wanted me to be. Did what they did. Got up at the same time as them. Constantly stalked all social media. Whenever they were available but not spending time with me, I'd feel down - like my life's purpose was gone for a while. This was even stronger when they spent time with another guy, I felt the need to constantly check what they're doing. Doing so, I ruined many friendships (that I wanted to become more than that) and I ended up mostly refraining from asking about it, but I still feel the need to check. Whenever the person I'm interested in at that moment is online but not talking to me, I lose the ability to focus on anything else than seeing if she's still spending time with another person than me. I check every few seconds. I literally just sit there unable to do anything else. 

Before this issue arose, or in between obsessions, I have no purpose - I live on a day to day basis, not planning anything, just burning time with whatever the hell I can burn time doing. 

It's making me feel absolutely miserable and has negative impacts on my life. I don't do anything besides trying to get as much time as possible with them. If it's likely they'll come online soon, I'll refuse to do anything except stare at the online status and wait. If I try to do something else, even if it's usually fun, I instantly get bored and force myself to just sit there waiting. I can't really fight it, it just doesn't work.

After doing some research, I've come to the conclusion that I've obsessive jealousy and that I lack a purpose in life. It's a dangerous combination. I am aware that I need help. 

I've found this, and it mostly describes me:
https://www.ipitia.com/obsessive-jealousy 

I consider myself neither a niceguy, nor anything similar. I can't really describe it, I'm just not like them and understand that constantly being fake-nice instead of being yourself won't lead to anything, and even less lets one expect anything in return, after all being generally respectful with everyone is basic human decency. 

Anyway, let's get to the point. I've talked to one of my psychiatrists about this one time, haven't seen her since (it's been 2 years). Back then she helped me to not have panic attacks when the person I was interested in didn't spend time with me and instead other people. I'm wondering: should I talk to that psychiatrist about it again? Or should I find a new one? Should I tell her what I said here, or something different? 

[In the middle of me writing this the person I'm currently so attached to came online. I found myself unable to write any more, I had a pushing feeling... I paused writing for a while. 
I can't sit still. I'm just sitting around and checking if she's coming to me or not... I feel an abundance of energy, it's like I'm on adrenaline...

Okay, we spent about 1.5h together, now she's heading to bed and I'm calm, in a condition to write, again.]


That's all.
What do you think?
Again, I know that I'm doing a lot wrong and that I need help. I'm going to get help, but I not sure from whom.

Thanks. ",05Nov2018,1

I'm leaving my job (receptionist in the tech industry) on hopefully amicable terms.  I accepted a job in Australia and I've always wanted to do a working holiday.  While I'm happy at my job, it has left me quite unfulfilled, and as a contract worker I've noticed a decline in my rights as a team member.  Little things such as no longer being allowed to participate in team events, or listen in on Lunch and Learns.  I'm not over the moon in love with my job anymore, but I like it enough that I want to stay until I have to leave for Australia, essentially December 21st.

468,"Hello everyone!

I have a friend that I've known for about two years through chatting online and we've had pretty deep conversations about our families, minds, etc. I've noticed there's a been shift in our friendship because the other day, I'd asked about her upcoming exam and what it was on. She was quite rude and tried to deflect away from the conversation and say how she doesn't want to be texting a lot…it kills her brain. I understand that.

Yesterday, I wanted to send a small token of appreciation/X-mas card and whatnot, which she was fine with. She wanted to send me something back and I told her not to. I told her that I feel the love and she's my best bro. Basically, stating our friendship is enough for me.

Today, she sends me a message about she's uncomfortable with stating me I feel the love and whatnot. It makes her realize that I don't know her. I understand how she can be uncomfortable. The only reason why I'm upset is that I've said I love you bro and best bro numerous times months ago and she never said anything about it. If she knows me well enough is that I take a long time to open up and if we've connected on a deeper level, I become comfortable with showing my emotions. It just hurt me that she couldn't be honest about it earlier and said how she didn't want to hurt me, which is complete shit. I'm not someone that you have to shield from feelings; I'm a strong person, just don't be fake with me. 

A part of me wants to cut off this friendship because I've also realized that she doesn't know me either but my question is am I wrong? Should I air my stance on it about how I dislike how she wasn't honest? I'm also started to reevaluate my friends because this is the third sort of dispute I've had with friends and I'm noticing that we're both on the same pages or that their integrities are different than mine, etc. ",05Nov2018,1
469,"Hello fellow Redditors,

I think my Mom has a problem with compulsive hoarding and its definitely dragging my Dads, Sisters an my mood down. Also it's pretty embarrassing when other people visit our house and just a pain in the arse to live with. I just read up a bit on that topic and got some shallow knowledge of different fields of psychology. We (Dad, Sister and I) try to clean up after her, but not only is that an exercise in futility, it also is really tiring and making us frustrated and angry. 
It seems like my mom checks out with quite a few symptoms (severe problems with punctuality [and even pretending to be proud of it], collecting of useless stuff, missing of social obligations, slight social incompetence, not the best hygiene)

It looks to me like she's believing in some meta-narrative of saving the world by being the anti-consumerist all in one mother who needs no help. Afaik it can also be a cause, to be anti-consumerist, which seems very much true for my mom. She's collecting rooms full of old clothes with nobody of our family and friends will ever wear, and wont donate it. She's collecting newspapers and magazines and she's wearing ripped clothes at home and using clearly worn out and broken equipment in the kitchen.
I'm not quite sure if she is ashamed of it, but she definitely pretending that there's no problem with our untidiness, or just talks around it and gets angry. Also she's very stressed working part time, taking extensive care of her mother, cooking and washing our clothes.
I proposed multiple times to do the laundry and my dad tries to do the dishes and clean the house whenever he can, but again she's just getting angry and makes a mess again. Also her mother is really untidy too, and hoards stuff, but that may as well be just a symptom of surviving WWII, since my uncle and aunt (so her younger siblings) are pretty tidy and more successful.

We tried talking to her multiple times about this issue to her, but she just get's angry and stops talking to us. We want to get her to go to a counselor, but this is quite a challenge since she refuses every help. I read to compliment her for small improvements, so I'll also try that in the future.

I would greatly appreciate any feedback, similar experiences, ideas or educated guesses.

470,"My wife and I are soon to be forty years old, we have 5 children together, and still rent our house. We chose many years ago for her to stay home with our children while I work, and so far, this has been wonderful. But in so doing, we've not had much opportunity to save towards a home purchase, but to be totally honest, the ability to call a landlord when the A/C breaks and not have to pay for it has been worth it to us. We in live in Phoenix, AZ, and likely could not have afforded to repair the A/C units as often as they have failed, and it is simply not realistic to live here without A/C.

Finally, we are interested in purchasing a home... the ability to call for repair is now being outweighed by the desire to make the home ours and do those things we'd like to do that landlords don't approve of. Before I sign up my email to everlasting bombardment and abuse from online home mortgage sites, what should I look for, or where do I begin?

We are not interested in staying in Arizona, so we want to purchase a home out of state. Should we move to the state we are interested in first, then apply for home financing?

From what she’s saying she’s going thru hard times. She is always sad, alone and doesn’t really know why. 

I tried offering help, but she says she has to solve this by herself. From what she writes in those messages, I mean a lot to her and stuff.

The conflicting thing is that the way she acts tells me otherwise. Sometimes she doesn’t reply to me, even though she’s online and she doesn’t even bother replying to my “good night”s and “good morning”s.

It’s been a week now and maybe she has replied twice to my good nights.

I am not really sure what to do here. Writing goodnight and hitting send is literally the easiest thing in the world, yet she doesn’t even bother. 

If you look at it from this point of view you’d definitely say “she doesn’t care about you”, but apparently, from what she’s saying, it’s the other way around.

She's all I can think about lately, ever since I started debating with myself if I should tell her, back in April (about a year crushing on her at that point). I don't want to sound over dramatic, but it's tearing me apart. I'm afraid that if I tell her, it would strain our relationship and make things awkward when we hang out with mutual friends, and possibly put an end to our friendship, at least as it stands right now.

482,"TL;DR I like my job, have a few hobbies, no girlfriend/wife, reasonably happy, not sure what I want from life.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hi Everyone,

I’m 23, male and I currently work as a Technical Writer for a Pharmaceutical company.

I live in London and drive to work every day as I own a car. My hometown is about 180 Km away and I go home about once a month. I live with a couple right now but I’m moving to a different house in December.

My work involves me being in charge of the paper work at my company. I basically perform various writing &amp; editing tasks for different documents. I really like the job and everyone there. The only downside is that I do not get paid over-time.

I have a BSc and a Masters. I finished the Masters in November 2017. I never saw myself in this line of work but I enjoy it. I’ve been working since March 2018 and I’m a bit scared of what to do when my contract ends in February but that’s a different story.

Basically I work Monday-Friday ( 7:30am – 4pm) and then I just drive home about 10 minutes away. Usually I cook some dinner and then just doss about until bed time.

In my spare time I listen to music, watch a film, go for a 5K run, practice bodyweight exercises, go to a boxing gym, study history/quiz facts, read a book or do the usual chores such as laundry, cleaning, shaving etc. My main hobby at the moment is learning Latin which I’ve been doing for 6 months now.

At weekends I generally just do the same thing. I usually don’t really get bored or lonely. I’ve never had a girlfriend before or kissed a girl. It bothers me sometimes but I’ve learned to live with it. (I kind of fancy my housemates girlfriend but I don’t love her.)

I have two main friends from University who I phone and meet quite regularly. Other than that I’m friends with an old high school teacher of mine and I phone my parents at least once a week. I’m the youngest kid in my house. I have two older sisters who I text every now and then. Other than my housemates (the couple) and my work colleagues I don’t see anyone else on a daily basis however.

In general I enjoy my life and much more than I did at school. My only worry at the moment is getting a job after my contract ends and what to do as a career. I have a few options in mind like Quality Assurance, Supply Chain or Science Writing.

Sometimes I feel my life is a bit stale or that I’m boring but I don’t mind what others think. I’m just so glad that I’m not bullied or have homework/exams anymore like at school. I guess what I mean is that I am more content with simplicity and a quiet life rather than taking on extra hobbies for fear of a workload (I don’t have much spare money either right now).

But maybe should I change this. I’d love to move to Germany but don’t know if it’s a wise choice for now. I’m still getting to grips with making my own decision as an adult.

Overall however I feel I’ve made progress. This might seem trivial but I’m finally living independently away from home and college. I paid all my car bills myself this year and even went on a week’s holiday to Italy by myself.

Sorry for that ramble, just wanted to get people’s opinions on my life.

485,"Basically my ex from back in highschool wanted to help me plan a party for my friend for when he come back to our home town. The first day we talked she was nice very helpful and overall pleasant to talk to  we managed to get a lot of planing done,.

The next day I realized why I broke up with her and always though she was annoying, I’m joking around saying some joke about capitalism and she said that it was cringy and the whitest thing she ever heard, earlier she said normie to refer to someone who doesn’t smoke weed all that much, so I just said “well to be fair you can’t really talk shit when you used normie in a sentence”  then she just gets aggressive saying “I love how you get butthurt at my comment and I don’t care about yours”  I was confused and told her “it was a joke, the  hell are you on about” and she just telling me how I get angry so easily but I was confused it was clearly a joke and she just kept pushing the fact how she made me angry from one comment. At this point my memories of why I didn’t like her all came back. 

She is annoying rude, and just a overall instigator, I made it clear that I don’t want any drama and only actually fun people and when I made a small joke she kept on telling me “oh I guess I will just won’t bring my friends”  it’s fucking  annoying, I don’t know how she went from so likable to such a obnoxious, rude, asshole. I don’t want her at the party, she helped plan it so it kinda makes it a bit hard, but it’s my house and I know a couple people at the party who would be glad she was not there.  How do I cut her out from this party? I’ve heard how she is extremely mean to people while under the influence but I figured it was in the past.  

She also wants me to supply drugs for the party which I never agreed on and I didn’t even want people taking drugs at my place. Along with me buying the damn liquor and she said she will buy 1 bag of chips for 25 people.  I can’t stand this shit, this is my house and I don’t want her acting like she has authority where she does not, how can I deal with this preferably in a manner that does not start drama?  But if push comes to shove I can and will be confrontational about this.",05Nov2018,1

487,"I have a really good friend/roommate who’s in his late 20s and who seems to have a child-like view of the world still. For some context he just moved out for the first time earlier this year with a couple other friends and myself. He’s the oldest in the house but the one who struggles the most to hold a job, the one who has been stuck at a jc for ten years, the one who has separation anxiety with his toxic gf, and I (nor the other roommates) noticed how bad it was until we saw things unravel for him when he moved out from his parents. 

Within the first couple months he quit his job for being too fast paced and demanding, and within another month got a seasonal job that he’s had before. He left the first time because once the season is over they might hire you on but the hours can be few and far between. He also lost his snake inside the house luckily he found it within a couple months. He also started failing his one and only class this semester and instead of dropping the class he’s going to just take the F. And lastly, the snake just died, after only a couple years of owning it, and it’s not the type of snake to die easy. 

On top of all of this his gf has been slowly isolating him for the last several years. He used to be the type that had a reason to be friends with everyone but now he talks badly about his oldest and closest friends and family members. Recently they’ve been talking about moving out to a big city like LA where he can transfer to a university and she can become an actress. 

My other roommates and I have no idea what he’s talking about anymore regarding most things. He talks about the world as if he were entitled to whatever he wants, and he’s never really been like this before. It might also be worth noting that his little brother has had a similar much more dramatic issue that he has taken so far as to try to convince people he is capable of flight. The problem for us is do we just support him and let him do what he’s going to do, or should we intervene and risk setting him off the friendships entirely?",05Nov2018,1
489,"So i started working in this company for over 2 months.


Beside my position's duties, i was supposed to help the receptionist when it was necessary. At the beginning of the last month i quickly learned that she's going to be working on different position in this company so they're looking for someone to replace her. Fine by me!

​

The end of previous month was... frustrating because she'd come to me almost everyday asking ""hey, can you replace me because X and Y?"". I started to feel like she's asking me to replace her whenever she didn't feel like sitting on her position and working. She could easily ask the driver for things she needs to have but instead, she'd ask me to replace her and go by herself. It honestly didn't feel like it's necessarybut instead she'd pull me from my other duties. Not nice at all.

​

Last week i learned from HR that i will be replacing the receptionist completely due to inabilty to find anyone else to replace her. The HR lady was surprised that my supervisor didn't tell me a word about it. He (supervisor) told her that he talked to me! No, he didn't at all and suddenly i'm learning all of this a few days in advance.

​

To add more, whole company has big financial problems. It's so bad that we're mentioned in the media (of course not in a good way) which influences the inabilty to find the replacement for the receptionist but also it's so bad that other services that provide, for example: shipping mails, buying coffe and office assortment are cutting the services completely for us. It feels like it's a matter of time that other companies will cut servies for us.

​

I'm currently in trial contract till the end of the month and thinking about not extending that.

Am I the asshole for wanting to quit? Are the things i listed above, legitmate reasons to quit?

492,"Long time viewer, first time poster.  I will try to present the facts as neutral as I can in hopes of getting feedback from the community to finalize this long term decision will likely impact me for 20 years. 

  
Background:

We entered into an agreement last month with a home builder to build a spec home. Our ""forever home"" to raise the kids in.  The area is relatively hot and the builder had (1) lot left in their section.  They were planning on building the house and selling it. We showed interest and they said we could make changes.  We went through two design sessions and made our changes. We had two - three  weeks finalize decisions because they were proceeding with the build one way or the other.  We all agreed to the changes, paid a small deposit (.005%) to lock it in. They started building.  Everything was going fine and I had to write a check for 5%.  I wrote they check, experienced two red flags in one week and put a hold on the check before they could cash it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Red Flag # 1 -  In the past two weeks they have made lots of errors (wrong door, wrong fireplace, wrong shingles, wrong size garage, wrong HVAC unit, wrong framing in the basement and wrong windows).  Our contact says it's was to be expected since they had already ordered everything.  They claim that they fix all the errors and deliver on what we agreed to.  My concern is that instead of slowing down and building it right the first time, they proceeded to install all the wrong stuff and fix it later.  It's clear they are rushing the build, so I am concerned about what else I am missing? Am I going to finding more issues and mistakes later? Are they skipping steps in the process.  I hired a 3rd party inspector to come onsite Thursday. 

  
Red Flag #2 - We went by the house on Saturday to look at some of the electric work that need to be changed. During that time we noticed that we missed a detail in the kitchen. We wanted the fridge on the other side of the cabinets. Same space, no change in cabinet design. They would have to rerun the water line, but it would require no major changes.  When requested, we were told a hard no. I offered to pay money and was told no. They have a policy in place saying they will not change anything going forward.  I know it's a small detail but I will have to live with this decision every day for the next 20 years.  It was my mistake for not catching it earlier, but we were rushed, had never built before and there was lots of other decisions to make.   Clearly it was ok for them to fix their mistakes, but I was not allow to make a mistake. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was fired up on Saturday so I checked and they had not cashed the check from \~9 business days ago for the 5%.  I called the bank and put a hold on it. I told the builder what I did, shared my concerns about the mistakes, and explained how important this change request was to me. They were very aggressive, made us feel that we owed them as they went out of their way to accommodate original changes to the home (the same changes they said we could make) and that I should have made this decision earlier. Moreover, they didn't see their errors as mistake, since they said they were to be expected and I should call them ""changes"".  Well, we just found out today (Monday) they will they will make the change for $1,025.  I think they are only making the change because I put the check on hold. 

  
I've never built a home before, so am learning through the process, but I am genuinely concerned about all the mistakes, their unwillingness to be flexible, and overall bad customer experience.  Why not slow down and do it right. I get stuff was already ordered, but why install it, then tear it out to fix it again later?    Should I be concerned about how quickly they are rushing the project?  Could it lead to future issues?   How about the bad customer experience?  Getting the fridge move got nasty. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is this normal and to be expected?  Are this red flags enough to walk away?   I am fine looking the .005% but the 5% would really hurt.  

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR:  I put a hold on check before the builder could cash it due some red flags that pop'd up over the past week. I am questioning if I should proceed with the purchase or walk way...please help! ",05Nov2018,1

494,"Very recently, my friend won a bookstore in a raffle. Yes. An entire bookshop in Wales just because he bought £20 of books and his name went in a hat. He was first shocked, then very excited. It's being covered in the news around the world. However, someone is planning to follow him and another mutual friend for 3 months and make a documentary,  then sell it to, well, we aren't sure. We all met online, never in person, except for one if us who moved from Iceland to Wales to help him with the bookshop.  Up until then, none of us have met in person for the 8-9 years we've known each other. 
The reason I'm the one asking is because the two of them are busy giving interviews left and right. That's awesome, I think and will help them tremendously with exposure for the bookstore.  The documentary however is another question to us. Being the super nice guy he is, CJ, the winner if the store didn't know how to approach the lady doing the documentary about possible compensation.  I however believe (and he confirmed this) that some compensation would be a huge help to pay for the move from Iceland, renting an appartment near the store, start up money  and so on. Please understand that his income until now came mostly from housesitting, etc.  So to come back to my question:
Should someone in his situation get compensated for being in a documentary that will take 3 months of filming on a daily basis? He was told the story will then be sold to a TV station (I think to the BBC but not 100% sure). Again, interview are great exposure but this is a little different. If someone has any insight in this, please let me know. Also, if he should ask for some sort of compensation, how does one go about raising this question to the film maker?

495,"I've no friends locally, but had a social group I met via Meetup I'd go out to gigs/bars/clubs with.

This guy Mark started coming to the group and he very quickly became friends with the core members, not just another Meetup member like myself, I still don't know how he managed to get so popular so quickly but everyone thinks he's a great harmless guy. Mark and I got on amazingly too so we ended up dating, it was a whirlwind but he seemed committed to us long-term, however he became abusive and when I wouldn't take it he dumped me.

Now I feel I can't go out to this Meetup group any more, even if I go when Mark isn't there he's so close with the others that they're now *his friends*. Not to mention I've no idea what he may have told them...even if he hasn't bad-mouthed me he hasn't told them the truth, we looked happy and from their perspective they thought I was 'out of his league' so for him to break up with me they'd assume something was wrong with me.

I'm left with no social life, I can't use Meetup to meet new people as Mark is in all the local groups, and it's going to take time to establish a big social group on my scene again - being in my thirties it's not like I've many club-going years left in me either. There are places I'd normally be okay going to alone but I feel I can't go to any more as I might run into Mark and/or the group - I feel like I can't go until I have a social group to go with so I don't look like a loser, any time I try to go there on my own I end-up anxious. Meanwhile he gets this group of friends, I see from mutual friends or venue pages I follow posting photos on Facebook that he's out with this group regularly having fun.

At weekends I end-up depressed not just as it's hard to make friends so I don't see myself establishing a social group I can go out with again any time soon, thus my weekends are spent bored and alone, but because it feels so unfair he treat me so badly yet sees no repercussions while I end-up losing so much from our breakup.

I've never had a problem with them until recently. 

A week ago I had a ""90 day inspection"" which was weird but whatever. I emailed the receptionist to tell whoever is coming, that there's freshly made danishes by the door for them. I went to sleep because I work overnights.

I get a letter that says my house violates sanitation standards or something. Why? I had 1 garbage bag and 2 Wal-Mart bags of trash behind my house. I put it out there an hour before the inspection. I also filled the sink with water and dumped Fabuloso in it, because I like the smell. I had a wine bottle by the stairs leading to the basement with an inch of wine in it. I didn't vacuum 2 feet of carpet under my coffee table and they got mad. And I have cardboard boxes.

They literally said I'm not allowed to have cardboard boxes. I have stuff in boxes because I don't want to unpack completely because I'm moving in a few months.

So they send this 7 day fix it or evict letter. Literally sent 2 by mail and 1 on my door.

I cleaned like a mad woman even though I work overnights. Today I was ready. I've been up since like.. idk 30+ hours making everything perfect. I didn't get rid of the cardboard boxes tho.

Anyway!!

So I've been waiting all morning for them... they never showed up. Not only do I only get 2 hours of sleep before work tonight, but I also have to stay up another day, all day, for them to do the inspection. 

They know I work overnights and honestly I've shown pictures of my place to friends etc, they don't understand why my landlord is upset. They say my landlord is sketchy. Especially for not showing up after sending two certified mail letters letting me know that my inspection is today.

I took photos and documented everything. I don't know what to do at this point and I really feel like they're jerking me around. I asked for an estimated time for today and I never got an email back. I lost my voice because I have bronchitis otherwise I would call.

Is this even legal in Iowa? To tell someone they can't even have cardboard boxes or a bottle of wine by stairs to the back door/trash? They even said I'm not allowed to have dirty dishes in the sink, ever.

504,"Ok, before you judge me, please hear me out. Tell me if I’m harassing this guy.

So, eh, to explain the pronouns a little, I’m gay, and I’m interested in this guy - let’s just call him K. K is a little effeminate, so I guess it’s kind of similar to if it was a girl.

K and I met on short-lived teenage dating app Yellow back in 2016. I was just turned 17, he was not long 16. We went on a date, and it went ok. It was my first ever date with a guy. I asked him for a kiss at the end but he said he didn’t want to in public.

We texted after that, and our conversation turned sexual - him being sexual as much as I was, if not more. We organised a second date which was really a hookup. Anyway, an hour before we were due to meet, he messages me saying his mum saw our messages and that he can’t come. Three days later he blocked me on everything except, for some reason, Instagram.

I really liked him, so I gave it a couple of months and then I messaged him. Initially he was still being sexual, but we ended up just talking platonically, because he wouldn’t come to my city to meet up with me, and it’s hard to keep up sexual conversation for that long. We messaged on and off for the next two years, sometimes every day, sometimes we could go months without talking. December of 2017, I sent him a message sort of awkwardly telling him I liked him - like, LIKE liked him. He just kind of obfuscated and ignored it. 

Anyway we kept up like this, and we ended up going to the same uni. I met him in a club, and I ended up kind of hanging around with him and his friends for four nights in a row. I had my own group but I kind of ditched them to go with his. 

Anyway, I tell one of his friends I like him, and she says she’ll find out for me how he feels (they all got the taxi back to their hometown together). She said something like ‘he said he didn’t really think you were his type’. I was heartbroken obviously. We ended up alone, and I kind of awkwardly said ‘Nicole told me what you said. I didn’t think you liked me...’ to which he was like ‘what?’ And then I just chickened out and said ‘never mind’ and he said ‘ok’ and left.

Like a day later I messaged him and he asked why I liked him and I told him and he did that thing where he said ‘oh I’m not all that’ (that really pisses me off by the way). We ended up talking again for like a week and he got coffee with me one afternoon. I didn’t say anything over coffee, because I’m a dumb coward, and because I really hoped he would get coffee with me again. 

Anyway, we organised another coffee date for the next week. Our convo over that weekend turned a bit weird - he accidentally said he habitually slept with like, MUCH older guys (40’s and 50’s when he would have been 17), and I suggested he might have slept with my dad, who I’m pretty sure is closeted and is about the age that K said he had slept with. I tried to keep it jocular, but I don’t know if he got that.

Anyway, literally a minute before our second coffee, he said he got told he had an Italian essay to do and cancelled, and I was like ‘sure no worries’. 

I gave it a week and tried to reschedule, but he has a major, major talent for obfuscation, and he never gave me a straight answer. Like a week after that, I was drunk one night and just came out and said that I really really liked him. Again, I kind of had to press him for an answer, but he said we were better just being friends. That night, I sent him a slightly poetic message saying I couldn’t be friends with him, somewhat due to my friends saying I had to cut contact with him because I was only hurting myself.

He said he kind of got it and I haven’t messaged him since. It’s been three weeks.

My questions are:

1) was this harassing, or at least unreasonable behaviour?

2) do I meet the definition of a nice guy?

3) if neither of these is true, is it ever ok for me to message him again?

And, a slightly different one to finish off:

4) I’m writing a book right now that is on schedule to be finished early next year, and I want to dedicate it to him if I publish it. Should I ask him first?

If I sound completely deranged, PLEASE tell me. I’m considering seeing a counsellor - I’ve been struggling to sleep, and almost every time I do fall asleep I dream about him (not sexually, just about him). I’ve been missing lectures and assignments, I’ve only left my flat to see my family, and for one I’ll-fated attempt at a night out.

Im a 20 year old male who has been dating a 23 year old female. We have been dating for about a year and a half. In June she got a pap smear and she tested positive for chlamydia. I have never been tested before and that was her first time. She told me and accused me of cheating. In her defense, we were on and off for the first 4 or 5 months we were dating and I told her that I had other sexual partners while we were broken up. Some I used a condom with some I didnt. She claims she hasnt had any other partners but who knows. She got treatment for it and cleared up and I made an appt to get it cleared up too but if it wasn't one thing it was another. 

She got tested again recently and tested positive for gonorrhea. I think she was clear of chlamydia. Shes accusing me of cheating which I haven't done. If we both had chlamydia, she got it cleared up, I didnt and we continue having unprotected sex wouldnt she develop the infection again? I havent had any symptoms at all but I have an appt next week to get it diagnosed and get treatment. 

So, what do you think of the whole ordeal? Is someone being unfaithful?

507,"Looking for some advice on anyone who’s failed a grade or several in elementary school. Had to be held back etc.. 
Were you actually trying to make good grades and just felt you weren’t capable of remembering the material or learning the words and math? Or was it something else? 
Did you just feel defeated and give up, and if you did why? What stands out as the biggest factor as why you didn’t try or care? 

My son was held back in 2nd and for the second time he’s failing it again. He says he’s trying and when we go over the material he knows it but you can see on his tests he just doesn’t care and rushes through things. I got through elementary with flying colors and I just can’t understand it. He’s got a good home life. He’s definitely got some anger issues and gets emotional very easily. He loves to be outdoors and is all around a good kid though. But yeah anyways, just looking forward to what you guys went through while failing so maybe I can understand more. ",05Nov2018,1
508,"So here goes nothing. I didn't really have a normal childhood but I always managed. Very poor background, couldn't really fit in in school and never finished it the normal way. I never went out partying or do drugs, I was only interested in reading books and learning on my own tempo. But I didn't really get all of that get me down and started life.  
About 5 years ago I was living a relatively normal life. I was working 2 jobs, had a stable relationship, gym was my hobby,  plans on buying a property and maybe even start a family. 2 years ago all of the sudden something in my mind switched and I ended my relationship, couldn't keep a job and I lost myself to booze and drugs. I never did that in my life and I was drunk almost 24/7. Lot's of social and family ties watered down and half a year ago I sorta 'woke up' and went to therapy for my depression. Over the course of the 2 years of heavy drinking I gained almost double my weight. I have no energy to do anything and yet am frustrated to become the person again I once was. To be honest I have the feeling that this is impossible.   
I am wondering if someone here has tips on how to turn your life back on tracks again, I'm clean and sober and don't feel like going back to that dark place of repressing everything with booze.

Poor Bob.  I wish girls would dress more appropriately for teenage boys.

I’m sorry Ann!  I was sending this to my mother (who is very conservative).  You are very pretty.  Maybe you will understand when you have a teenage boy.  I didn’t mean to offend you.  We like you very much. (And so does Bob!)

We talked some and she was nice and was very attractive, but I wasn’t really interested in her like that because I had a girlfriend at the time and she had a boyfriend. We both went on to different colleges and she’s about an hour away. My girlfriend at the time was still in high school but we continued to date. My girlfriend graduated high school last year and went to the same college as me this year. We were both very excited because we could experience college together. This September she broke up with me and later revealed to me she had cheated on me. I was heartbroken and I was extremely sad for a month. For whatever reason I felt something telling me to message the girl I had previously met at church, so I did. I had not even seen her since we met, but for some reason she always stayed in my head. She told me she thought I was cute when we met and was disappointed I had a girlfriend, so it wasn’t just her who made an impact on me as apparently I made one on her too. We both talked about getting cheated on because she had been cheated on by her ex too. We have been talking for 3 weeks now but every once in a while she will leave me on read.

514,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I've never asked for advice on this sub, but I thought i'd give it a go. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like my previous A level results are defining me too much, and that I need to do something to improve my situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

My story sofar: 

&amp;#x200B;

I went to two particularly bad schools and only achieved five GCSEs (C - B)  and 3 BTECs (All merit). I then went to the same sixth form, and  I can't really remember how it happened, but I ended up at the end of sixth form (year 2) with only two full A levels (Grade C in both, Mathematics and History), and 2 AS levels (A in Religious Studies, C in General Studies). 

&amp;#x200B;

This got me enough UCAS points (260) to get into the university of my choosing to study Mathematics. However, I hated it and withdrew from that course. I then went into an Apprenticeship (and studied AAT at a night college), but it wasn't as advertised and so I had left that to work for a local council's social housing sector call centre. I've worked there for the last two years (full time, and now part time)

&amp;#x200B;

Last year I decided I wanted to go back to University, and went to my local university (which doesn't have a fantastic reputation) to study Ba (Hons) Accounting and Finance. I was among the highest achieving students in the year, averaging a 80% grade overall (70% is a first). Due to volunteering with a local first aid charity at university, and my grades, I won a business award and bursary. I even made the local newspaper. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have always faced adversary due to  my poor grades and my drop outs (University first time, apprenticeship) however the biggest issue I seem to face now is that my A levels just aren't good enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've started to apply for industry placements as part of a sandwich year - however no one is interested in taking on someone who didn't achieve three A levels worth at least 96(?) ucas points. I have 96 \*with\* general studies, but a lot of firms aren't interested in that. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I really need advise on is whether I can do anything about this situation - I don't think I can go back and take any additional A-levels,  and I don't think there are any additional qualifications that could help me right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

After university, I want to pursue ACCA (if that helps at all). 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking just for any input or advice anyone could fofer. ",05Nov2018,1
515,"  

TL;DR: I’ve just been sent to a remote location for the holidays and I have several issues. 

Can I start off with a disclaimer? I’m a 34 yr male that has served in the Army AND the Navy for 16 years, I’m not a complainer and I realize some of my issues might sound very childish. 

I live in Salt Lake City, I travel neighboring states for my civilian job. I got divorced earlier this year so I was already expecting to have a quiet Christmas. I was just informed that a coworker in Casper, WY just quit and I was being assigned to cover his area from mid-December to mid-January. That covers Christmas, New Year’s, and my birthday…in a hotel, in a town I’ve never been in, surrounded by people I don’t know. My boss says that I can have four days off to come home for Christmas; that’s Saturday through Tuesday, but the day after Christmas I have to drive back to Casper. I have so many thoughts on this. 

1) Would it be better to spend Christmas in a hotel room? Or risk driving 6-8 hours on the highway in WY in the winter just to come home to an empty house, not decorated, without even a Christmas tree and no food? Both of those options sound depressing as fuck, and I’ve spent several holidays deployed (every holiday I was deployed, I had a Christmas tree and people that cared about me). 

2) If you were staying alone in a foreign place through the holidays, what would you do to make it better? Do you try to Tinder another person that is alone on Christmas so you can be lonely together? Do you hit the bar scene and hope to find spontaneous fun? Do you meditate in your room alone, reflecting on your life and wondering how the fuck you got into this position? 

3) I have a co-worker that will take care of my house, collect my mail, etc. My brother just told me that he better run all of the water faucets to make sure the seals don’t break and flood my house, I didn’t know that. What maintenance needs to be performed so my house doesn’t get destroyed? 

4) I don’t want my house to get broken into while I’m gone, it seems like that happens during the holidays. I guess I need to pack up my guns and put a couple lamps on timers so someone looking at my house thinks I’m at home. Any other LPTs on that one? 

Thank you guys for reading this and any advice you might have. ",05Nov2018,1
516,"I am fairly young and currently a full time working as an actuary. I have a bachelor and master in accounting.

I enjoy my job and it has relatively okay pay and benefits but I have thoughts of the grass is greener on the other side and I have several options. There is a job opening at this organization in auditing that I am interested in but the pay is only a bit higher(maybe?) than my current pay. I believe the benefits would be the same.

Option 1 - Go back to school, either bachelor for actuary or something else (My other interests are in law and business or public administration).

518,"Things at my internship have been rocky at best lately. I desperately want to quit, but I don't know if it's the right move. I \*know\* some of this isn't normal... and some of it is wrong. But how do I balance that with the need to have an internship on my resume?

Context: I'm 24 years old, I'm a graduate student, this is my first internship.

I'm supposed to be working at this sort-of art museum as a ""librarian"" - basically, they need someone to catalogue their book collection. However, it's been week since I've worked with books. Mostly, they have me give guests tours or help out with their events, which really means waitressing.

Here are the reasons I'm considering quitting:

1. The payment stuff is shady. I started as an unpaid intern, but they asked me to come in for extra paid shifts. When they pay us, they do it from three separate bank accounts. I don't know much about accounting or finance, but that seems wrong. I wonder if it's connected to their status as a ""nonprofit,"" even though I know for a fact they turn a profit?
2. My boss is crazy. I mean literally crazy. Everyone who works for her says she's crazy. Past employees (who I've just now started to find online and in real life) say she's crazy. Two interns recently quit because... you guessed it. She's crazy. She yells at me for not doing stuff she never TOLD me to do. Some days, she's extremely kind to me. Others she says horrible, inappropriate things. When I come in to work, I can never tell if she's going to scream at me or tell me she loves me. I'm anxious about it constantly.
3. One of my male coworkers is being inappropriate towards me. I liked him a lot at first - he seemed nice, we got along. But recently he keeps touching me. Specifically, he keeps touching my ass - but he acts like it's accidental and at this point, I can't tell if he's actually purposely being a creep or if I'm just fucking crazy.
4. I have another job and am trying to get through my last semester of grad school. I feel like I don't have enough time to do this anymore, especially because every day here feels more and more discouraging.

So my question is: do I quit? Or do I tough it out so I have an internship on my resume? I have a lot of other impressive stuff on my resume... but at the same time, this is the only internship I've ever done. And the woman who runs this place is powerful. I mean really REALLY powerful. I think she could ruin my life if she wants to.

Do I apply for full time jobs and when I get an interview let them know I can't work Tuesdays? Or look for part time jobs and hope that they don't need me on a Tuesday? Ideally I'd work Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday but I have a feeling I'm not going to find that, feeling really stuck here. Need the money of a full time job really!

I'd like to think of myself as a good, honest student who has a good circle of friends. I never realized how common sex, drugs, alcohol, and cheating (both academically and relationship-wise) were in my school. I'm not ""sheltered"" from these things, I've just never participated in them. I've never been to a ""High School Party"" although I probably could have been to one if I reached out. (I don't want to do any of the above things mentioned, but rather just experience it and see what people are talking about)

You know when you're at a table with a bunch of people, and someone starts whispering to other people, usually when showing them something on their phone? It's such a small little thing, but that has never happened to me. I feel like I'm the reason they're doing that in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

For the first time ever, I recently asked this girl I liked out to our school dance coming in December, and she said yes! I'm super hyped, but I've never been in a relationship before (and yes, I know asking a girl out to a dance doesn't mean she is your girlfriend), so I don't know what to do. Do I act as IF we are in a relationship at the dance, then stop when it is over?

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea what she expects of me before and during the dance. She is interested in going to a party afterward, but I don't know how she wants me to act, if I should make a move, and how big of a move she expects me to make if so. I don't want to be too clingy, but I also don't want her to get bored of me.

People talk so casually about doing things I would never do. I'm not bullied or disliked, but more just excluded I'd say, and naive as a result.
