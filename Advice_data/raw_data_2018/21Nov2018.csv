I need to get out their. I can’t be in school forever. School isn’t going to always be a safe spot for me from the outside world. I’m the eldest son, my dad’s getting old, we’ve had financial troubles for forever, and things are just getting worse. I know all of this, but I still can’t push myself to apply for a simple part-time job that I need because of the interview and other grown-up things.

1,"My girlfriend (23F) lives by herself in Northern Ontario, Canada. The Place is a two story building devided into four seperate appartment units. Hers is on the ground floor.

When she got home and checked her mailbox today, there was [this](https://i.imgur.com/NWEVeqS.jpg) little handwritten note in it. It has no name on it, nor did it come in any sort of envolepe, meaning the person placed it in there personally.

My girlfriend doesn't know the other tenants and she doesn't have any friends living in her area. So our immidiate thought was that this might be some creep watching her.

Does the note seem sketchy and alarming or is that a rather common and bening thing? If the former is the case, what measures should be taken?

I currently don't live with her or even in the same country and won't be able to be with her until mid December. Right now I'm looking into a security system with intrusion monitoring for her.

2,"Hi, so I'm a young dude who is currently facing a dilemma as to which of my family's meals I should attend for the big day. The two options are:

My dad and stepmom's house

My aunt and uncle's house

(This is the same side of the family)

Every year for as long as I can remember I've gone to my aunt and uncle's house for Thanksgiving. For the past few years, it's just been me who goes out of my immediate family. My dad and stepmom usually go out of town or something, but this year they're planning on having Thanksgiving at roughly the same time as my aunt and uncle. My aunt and uncle are like my stand-in grandparents on that side (since my actual paternal grandparents passed away when I was young) and I'm very close to all of them - cousins, etc. I don't understand why my dad never thinks of things like this when the planning happens. I'm leaning towards my aunt and uncle's but I don't want to offend my stepmom, who is really the opposite of easygoing when it comes to stuff like this. So, what do you think? I'm not really asking anyone to pick for me, just advice on how to deal with it. Thanks.",21Nov2018,1

He has two kids, 9 and 5, that are amazing. I love them and love spending time around them. I’ve never really wanted kids of my own, but the idea of being a step parent or of children in general has never bothered me. I like kids. The mother and I get along and there’s no emotion or anything left between him and her. My boyfriend and I have a great, loving and honest relationship, and have been together just about a year. Me and my parents aren’t close and don’t have the best relationship, so maybe that’s relevant? And he doesn’t see his kids a WHOLE lot because he works 7 days a week, morning till night starting his own business. And when he does see them, he wants me to be involved and his kids do seem to really like me. 

So why is it that I always feel this weird kind of empty, sad nagging feeling after we hang out with his kids? I have no idea where it comes from or how to address it because I honestly am not sure what makes me feel this way. Anyone have any insight? Anyone ever experienced something similar? ",21Nov2018,1

13,"So my dad and I haven’t spoken full sentences in ~4 years. He’s an asshole, to put it bluntly. 

My father was the spanker. The “you’re not sick it’s all in your head” guy (which almost killed my mom when her appendix was bursting). The anal retentive, we eat lunch at 12 and dinner at 5  (a trait given by my grandparents). The guy who writes, “may you find courage to overcome your failures” in his daughters birthday card. The guy who approaches his son with an axe because I wanted to take my brother for ice cream. 

5 years ago the kettle boiled over and I got mad at him. The next day, I moved away for an internship. I then took a job right away, so I stayed away. 

I had no need nor desire to talk to him, so I didn’t. And I didn’t talk to his parents either, because they are very protective of him. 

Days turned to months, and I started dating a woman and we had plans to travel to Maine - my home state. So I made plans with my grandparents for dinner. Being her, my GM made a big dinner and invited my dad. 
Due to traffic, we were late to our 5pm dinner and the first words from my GM were “where the hell have you been?”  The entire dinner my father did not speak to me. Not even “hi”. 

Things boiled over that night between me and my GPs after dinner (we were going to spend the night) and my GF and I drove 4 hours home in tears and anger. 

Days turned to months again. Now we were engaged. I “manned up” and called my dad to say we were engaged. “Congrats” and then my stepmom took over the conversation. 

A year and a half later, after zero contact from him, and processing feelings in therapy for months, I did not invite him to my wedding. This really brought out the worse in my family. That I should give him a chance. 

Every Christmas, birthday, etc. during the “no speaking” years, I texted him. I got no responses. So I told them all that I gave him these chances. “He never responds to his kids texts. That’s just who he is”. Well, “I don’t like who he is.”  

I had to write a letter to my GPs about why I wasn’t inviting him, and my feelings. “Your father read the letter and is crying. He says he will write you an apology after your wedding”. 

My wedding was a year ago in October. I have not received a letter. I have not received a text, email, or any sign that he wants to actually communicate with me. 

Throughout these years, he sends me birthday and Christmas cards. 

I got the usual birthday card yesterday. 

I’m sitting here wondering two things:
1. Should I open the card, take the $10 or w/e might be inside and toss it out
Or
2. Should I write “Return to Sender” and open Pandora’s box. 

My heart and brain say send it back. I’ve had enough. Enough neglect, enough of not being/feeling loved. But my brain also says “once it’s in the mail you might regret this. ...But will I?” 

So I turn to Reddit Advice column to find any kind of input from my peers.

My doggo is old. His name is Casey and he’s been with me since we were both five. He’s now turning fifteen this summer, and he’s... old. The stairs are a challenge, his medication for Addison’s is working less and less with each coming month, and he’s sleeping much more. It’s gotten to the point where he’ll barely get up when I come home from school. He’ll haul himself up and trudge over to me, giving me a lick on my calf and standing next to me, waiting for me to pick him up so we can go chill on the couch and watch Netflix. 
Right now, he’s on the floor next to the couch, lying down and resting his head on that ratty monkey plush he’s had for as long as I can remember. 
So here’s my question- what’s the humane thing to do? I want him to be happy. I don’t want him suffering, and he’s not, per say, but I can see that he’s tired. He’s such a good boy. He’s the best boy.

16,"Okay, so when leaving a group of my (drunk) friends home, late one night after work (as i usually do, i'm a bartender). 

One in particular seemed to try and pick an argument with  me. The first half of the journey was totally fine, he kept thanking me for a ride etc. But when we were alone (I left him home last) he all of a sudden changed and become quite malicious accusing me of making him feel indebted to me for giving him a ride and that I always hold it against them.

He then launched into a triad of abuse saying that this was a terrible sad way to be, to never ask a favour of him again, and kept saying to drop him off anywhere and he would walk. He was totally inebriated so I decided to ignore him for the rest of the journey to avoid a full on argument. This I mostly attributed to him being drunk. 

The next day however he tells our group of friends that *I* was bearing an unbearable asshole, This I vehemently deny, I cant see what I did wrong other than not let him control the AC and turn of the radio when he kept putting it to max volume (Admittedly I did lash out a bit and smack the off button but it was getting very distracting.)

Its been a few days now and he has been giving me the silent treatment, neither of us have attempted contact since.

so should I swallow my pride and just apologise for whatever it is he's accusing me of to avoid any strain on our friendship or ignore him and give him a good cooling off?

(I probably would have apologised by now, but once before he has accused me of having an overwhelming need to please everyone).

19,"I'm long-term unemployed, due to disability I need support to get back into work but there's very little support available. 

I've been with this support company for a year, with this specific employment coach about four months (when I switched to a new area I got a new team, one of he guys made me really hopeful but this guy I have is useless) - although I only get an appointment every 3 weeks - so far they've only helped me find one job to apply for, even then they didn't actually help me apply like they said they would. Currently we meet, have a coffee, and then job search for maybe 15 minutes - even then it's pretty useless as I need his help to job search, and 15 minutes isn't enough time to apply for jobs either. 

15 minutes job search every 3 weeks isn't anywhere near enough! 

This employment coach isn't very competent either, for example I'd like to look into whether I could go back into higher education and if so I'd need support with that too. When he got back to me he just showed me two web pages for the qualification I was interested in from one university - no information on how to apply, what was needed to get onto the course, financial details, disabled support, any other courses or universities - despite my being almost completely incapable of understanding the application process...I actually had to explain part of the application process to him!

With so little support I don't want to stop this and be left with no one, but they're not helping me at all. 

This guy helped me apply for disability, I may need further help with this in future but I'm not sure I can continue to humor him for that long. He creeps me out a little bit is a nice guy so I'd feel bad telling him he's not helping me.

22,"Hi everyone, 

I (24/F) met him (25)/M) in early 2017. We have been communicating long distance ever since. There are a few things about his lifestyle that concern me. These are patterns observed over time. I don’t want to post in a mental health forum because I’m not sure if these traits are signs of a mental issue or just a character issues. 

1. He has had irregular sleep patterns since he turned 18. Some weeks, he stays up until 2 AM, some he can’t stay awake and must sleep at 9 PM. Sometimes he goes to sleep and wakes up at odd hours. He has overslept when he needed to be places, and he has la lacked sleep and acted like a zombie all day. 

2. He lacks organization skills, big time. He is often making lists and abandoning them, forgetting things to do, or missing appointments sometimes. He often gets distracted by other, trivial things. 

3. Sometimes he becomes obsessive in doing trivial things, and will do them for hours. For example, he should be preparing to move and studying for an exam, but he has been researching phones to buy for 4 days now. When I check in on him he’s looking at articles. He now knows basically everything about the phone market. 

4. He has admitted to wanting to avoid doing things. He will put off a seemingly easy task for no apparent reason other than, “I’m dreading it.” This happened a lot while he was still deep in university. He is just finishing up now after roughly 5 years of retaking exams and classes. As you can probably see by now, these are all interconnected points. 

5. He *knows* these are bad habits/traits/whatever you want to call them, but he seems to lack motivation to do anything about changing. He is self-aware. 

Anyone have any advice? I’m starting to become worried because I’m seeing that these are patterns, not events. Obviously it takes some time to recognize patterns, hence why I’m now reaching out. Any feedback on how I should treat this, or what he may be experiencing, or how I could adjust my perspective would be very much appreciated. Thank you all. ",21Nov2018,1

27,"[Sorry if this is rambly, I'm a bit buzzed]

Hey reddit, here's my situation.

I'm currently at a four-year college in MA. I transferred in from a community college (two-year college) this past Fall. However, recently I've realized the mistake I made.

I have mental illnesses- anxiety and depression, both pretty severe. I am very isolated at my school: I'm in a single-room, and I've made one friend on campus, who's graduating in January. My roommates don't talk to me, no matter how hard I try to strike up conversations, and I have a lot of trouble making friends, as I'm somewhat shy and awkward (I talk like a 60 y/o professor- not great). I'm also a very serious student, and a workaholic perfectionist: I have A's in the majority of my classes, but the grades came at the expense of my mental health.

I went inpatient last week for coming very close to killing myself (I was talked down, thank god), and realized that the school may not be the best fit for me. The things that put me *in* the hospital were all connected to the school I'm at: the social isolation, pushing myself too hard to make all A's, and having a meltdown for getting a B on a test, along with a B in another class. I developed a quazi-eating disorder, and have lost more sleep than I can even talk about, simply because my mind races too much for me to sleep. I'm two hours from home, where my support systems are- my mom, my therapist, my psychiatrist, and all my friends. I decided that my plan should be: take a semester off, and transfer to a new school in the fall.

So I decided that I wanted to transfer- I did it before, how hard could it be to do it again? Apparently, it's gonna be harder than I thought.

I'm 21, and I have ~68 credits to my name. My credits from my first college (the community college) can all transfer, but half of them are attributed incorrectly on the program they use to look at how the credits will transfer. For example, my First Year Seminar class is attributed as an elective. This happened to most of the credits I plugged into the program.

I would like to finish my degree in four semesters- meaning I would graduate ~Fall 2020. Originally I wanted to graduate in the Spring, but I realize now that that may be a pipe-dream, unless I stay at my current school.

I'm worried that if I go through with my plan- a semester off, then back to school- I'll be further behind than I ever thought before. Half of the credits aren't allocating where I want them to! Do I talk to an adviser about possibly fixing it? Should I stay at my current school and try to stick it out for four more semesters, possibly at the expense of my mental health? I'm trying so hard to make myself relax enough so I can take care of my mental health, but it's almost impossible. I can't distance myself from my anxieties, no matter how hard I work with my therapist. I think a transfer would help, but I don't want to spend any more time in college than I have to.",21Nov2018,1
28,"Hey. I am need of advice. I can’t tell if I’m overreacting or if I have a right to be angry. Basically, here’s what’s got me so upset: 
I’ve got this friend, let’s call her Alex. Alex and I have known each other  since middle school but have become close friends in the past few years. We often refer to each other as best friends and she has even told me she wants to get matching tattoos! In this past September she went off to college as an incoming freshman and I stayed in our hometown to work full time. We text every single day, if not every other day. Since she went away I’ve been reaching out to make plans with her once she comes home, whenever that would be, since I do consider her my best friend and I’ve never had a friend so close to me go so far  away. Because thanksgiving is this week, Alex has a week off from school. She told me she’d be bringing a friend home with her, which made me kind of weary considering weeks prior we had already made plans to meet up once she came home. I texted her again a week and a half ago, seeing if we could solidify a time. Alex said we would hang out once she came home thanksgiving weekend, and of course, I was excited. But then, yesterday, she told me she didn’t know when she was free. It just so happens that Alex and one of her friends is hanging out tonight. I asked her if she was free Sunday and that’s the day she’s going back to school. 

I’m upset and a bit angry because I had asked her so long ago to make plans and she told me we would hang once she came home for thanksgiving, now suddenly she’s with someone else. How come if she considers me her “best friend in the entire world” she wouldn’t want to see me once she came home after I literally asked her multiple times?! I feel like I’m putting in all the work in this friendship, and I’ve felt like that for a while. Maybe it’s just worth it to let this go. Trust me, there’s a lot more to this but I feel like I’d bore your head off. To me, she’s being incredibly selfish. ",21Nov2018,1
29,"Hi, we have an elderly Schnauzer and a youngish (not a puppy) little mutt.  I have no idea what he is, he's a rescue.  He's small, brown and black.

We fell on hard times financially recently and also had some behavioral issues with the dogs, and thought we were going to have to get rid of them.  We drove all the way out to the humane society to do it, and found that we couldn't.  We sat outside crying and holding them for an hour and came back home.  

Behavioral issues include them using the bathroom inside suddenly all the time, and barking 24/7 from the Schnauzer and high pitched whining from the little one.  The barking isn't new, but it is worse than ever and happening more frequently.  We are both working a lot more to make up for the financial difficulties, so we don't have as much time to devote to the dogs as we used to, which I think is the main cause behind the behavioral changes.

Our neighbors have called animal control about the barking and we've gotten a few warnings.  Plus, I work from home sometimes, and the barking has become a real problem when I'm on client phone calls or trying to listen to recorded meetings and memos.  So we got a collar that buzzes and beeps him when he barks.  It worked for two weeks, now he ignores it.  So, I hear nonstop barking, buzzing AND beeping.

I want to be a good pet parent.  I love my guys and we are very close.  But it is now affecting my work and income, and my sleep.  The Schnauzer has started barking on and off all night, every night.  We are spending an obscene amount of money (to us, based on what we bring in) on his special food and his grooming to keep him comfortable and healthy.  

I know it sounds crazy, but I feel like I am on the brink of insanity and hopelessness.  I reached out to some local Schnauzer rescues for help and was told by every one of them that they couldn't help me.  I can't afford training for them, I can honestly not afford to even keep them at this point but am making a lot of sacrifices to do so.  I don't know how long I can do it.

She doesn't want help in that she just wants to die and I try to help her and talk to her but she doesn't want help nor does she want other people to know because she's scared that her parents are going to be mad and abuse her emotionally because her mom has abused her emotionally for example her mom calls her slut and stupid and things like that and she pours it all out to me and threatens to kill herself and says that no one wants her and she feels like everyone hates her but I am constantly talking to her and stay up and spend my time to try to get her to get out of that mindstate and she says that she doesn't feel happy she just feels numb she has tried to overdose multiple times she cuts herself she just tells me that she wants to die in that she has a super bad and anxiety and depression and I'm guessing she uses joking around as a coping mechanism because on her Instagram it's a bunch of memes and things like that that's just joking about depression and stuff which I'm guessing she uses it as a way to hide and cope with her problems but she'll tells me that like she doesn't feel herself and that she disassociate a lot and I try to tell her that she can talk to the school counselor but she said that she doesn't trust them and it's stressing me out because I don't want her to harm herself to the point to where I lose my best friend and i don't want to leave her and have the blame be put on for her death i couldn't live with myself if i were to just let her die but i also don't think she understands the emotional burden she's putting on me. please help me out thank you.

34,"Hey Reddit,

I'm a 23 year old (m) who recently moved to a new city. My friend (31m) brought me out here to work for him for 4 weeks. We will call him G.

We both live in a prestigious university town (He works for Corporate Relations for this university) and he hired me as a salesman to operate a booth for a university corporate relations project, in which I operate the technology and sell the product to potential customers. We agreed through verbage and text that I would receive 30% of total sales.

That was 3 months ago. He has been stringing me along, making me believe that I would receive pay, but he has not paid me. Yesterday, I reached out to the company (whom he licensed the materials from), and they claimed that they processed the orders, then sent G a check **ten** days ago. G is still lying to me, saying that he is waiting for the check.

I work around some of his superiors, one being the head of university relations (it is an ivy league school). Should I round up all proof and show her evidence that G is scamming people to work for him? How do I go about this, and receive my money?",21Nov2018,1

38,"Hello, this is my first post, but I've been a Kurier for a while. I'm a male in my mid 20's and my life for the last ~3 years was a gigantic ball of shit, so I'm used to having to deal with bad situations, but I kinda need help with this one. April this year I took a huge step forward and broke up with my first girlfriend ever, mostly because she was abusive, agressive, didn't let me have other friends other than hers, didn't allow me to go to any activities that she wasn't involved and threatened commiting suicide if I discussed anything on that matter. Thing is, when I broke up with her, I lost all my friends (bc they were _her_ friends). I have anxiety and depression (because other stuff that happened to me, and my past relationship pulled that a tone higher), and for me is really hard to open up to people, make friends or simply talk to someone I don't know, so I did what every other person with social anxiety do when they *need* to socialize and installed a few apps for meeting new people. It worked ok, I made a nice friend, we talked a lot and I told her a bit of what happened to me, and she was very sympathetic towards my past experiences, and after about three weeks talking online we decided to meet (she lives on the same city as I do). We met on her place and needless to say she was expecting us to have sex and I wasn't expecting it at all. We've been dating for a few months now, and she asked to be my gf on October, and I said yes because I'm terrified of being alone with no friends again, and that's about it: she wants a relationship, and I just want a friend, and I know that had I said no to her she would have disappeared from my life, and the same will happen if I break up with her, but I still feel like a bag of trash for lying to her. I'm ""healthier"" now and I even made a few friends at uni, but she's still my best friend, and I don't want to lose her, but I don't want to continue with this relationship anymore. Send helpz plis
obs:
-i don't want to have sex with anyone
-i feel horrible for using her as a ""emotional clutch""
-my ex is still a bad person and I will not go back to her
-i can't go to therapy for financial reasons (and I don't want money donations)

I kinda laughed it off, but after looking at her profile, I really believe that I have a younger half sister. I don't know if my dad is with her mom anymore so that leaves another family he may be not apart of lol. 

Growing up not knowing ANYTHING about that side of my family and heritage, I don't know that to do. I really dislike my father from what my mom told me about him, but I really want to know more, and she is my sister.

Should I tell my mom about this, or keep it under wraps? I'm nervous as we never really spoke about it, and I don't want my real ""dad"" my step dad, to feel like he means nothing or something, as he is a much better father then my real one is or was.

I have never posted reddit but this whole thing is really weighing on me and I dont quite know what to do. 3 days ago my nineteen year old sister-in-law was casually talking to my husband about a guy who has been visiting her work for roughly a year. He is 37 years old and of middle eastern descent. She said he doesnt speak english well but has been buying her things and bringing them to her work for quite some time. Not just flowers or flirtatious gifts but also food and clothing. She went on to explain she met this guy for dinner with his brother and he offered to buy her anything she wants (she is in college and he offered to help her through it) if she continues to see him. The only stipulation being she cannot date anyone else. Come to find out he is also married to a woman he says was the result of a family arrangement. Supposidily this dude is devotely religious and says he is allowed three wives. Their relationship, she says, cannot be intimate according to his beliefs. From what i understand, he is giving her money for her car payment every month. But im not sure what else he is providing aside from gifts. I am very concerned for a variety of reasons. He is older, married, and the cultural difference may play a role in some gross misunderstanding of the parameters of the relationship. She also mentioned she has recently stayed the night at his house and ""nothing happened."" I assume she has stayed multiple times by the way she discussed it. I have been unable to get this out of my mind for days. I did tell her i thought this was a bad and potentially dangerous situation and that she should not stay at his place. She seemed to shrug it off altogether, saying its not a big deal and she will ""use her best judgement."" She means alot to me since i have known her since she was 8 years old. I dont want to drive her away... and i already feel i was too harsh when i told her how i felt. What is your perspective on the situation or what do u think i should do?",21Nov2018,1

64,"Okay so this is more advice on what advice to give my girlfriend. We are both very involved in the situation and I need an outside source.

So, my girlfriend “Alex” lives with four other roommates, “Sammy, Kayla, Allison, Kelcie.” We are all very good friends and all go to the same university. I live on campus, I have an RA job that covers half of my schooling with scholarships, so I don’t live with them but I’m there very often and very involved in our friend group.

There is an issue with one of the roommates. Sammy has been our friend for a while, her girlfriend Kayla is the worst person we’ve ever met. Because of Kayla, everyone living in the house is moving out at the end of next semester (May 2019).

For context: Kayla is rude and will interrupt and offend anyone no matter who it is. She’s disgusting in the sense that she never cleans up after herself, she throws her clothes on the floor in shares living areas, if she doesn’t leave her dishes all over the house then she just lets them pile on the sink. One time she flung her socks off when we were all watching a movie and they landed on Alex and I.

Kayla will barge into other people’s rooms without asking, she’ll eat and drink food that is labeled, she will smoke one of the roommates weed without asking. Basically if your things aren’t deeply hidden or locked up, it’s not safe. She will invite herself to private outings and is deeply offended when you tell her no.

Alex, Kelcie, and Allison are constantly discussing their mutual unhappiness and will bring some occasional things up to both Kayla and Sammy about Kayla’s actions.

What makes it worse, and where the real issue lies, is that Sammy excuses it based on the fact that “she was raised like that.” Sammy will tell you that she’s “working on it” and that she’s “fixing it” if you bring up an issue with her. And we only bring up issues with Sammy when we’ve addressed Kayla far too many times.

Alex is fed up. She already plans on moving out but is having a hard time living in the house while the lease is still in place. She spends a lot of time with me and as much as I love her, I know she needs to face her roommates and have a real conversation about their issues, not just here-and-there tidbits.

I want her to be at least comfortable in the house she pays to live in. She’s asked my advice on how to talk to her roommates but she’s afraid that Sammy is so wrapped up in Kayla that confrontation of any kind besides the small things the roommates have talked about will cause huge issues. 

So the advice I’m asking for is does it even seem worth it to talk to Sammy? And if Alex talks to her, what advice would you give to someone if everyone in their entire house ended up angry with each other of the actions of one person? ",21Nov2018,1

Last year I met this girl that I like too and started talking to her (as a friend) this year. I later learned that my current girlfriend and the other girl are best friends. The other girl and I became good friends until two months ago. When I accidentally slapped her across the face. There are these assholes in my class who are always teasing me, which doesn't bother me that much usually but they were yelling at me to apologize and I froze completely and when she was looking at me for an apology, I froze and got defensive and said something along the lines of ""It was an accident, I don't need to apologize"". We have three classes together and in our final class of the day I said: ""Are you going to allow me to apologize?"" and she basically said that I was only trying to apologize because of my girlfriend, which kind of hurt my feelings because I really was sorry.

I'm overweight, have no identification outside of my social security card, and have little in the way of clothing or goods. My options among extended family are very limited at well so I'm not sure what to do.

I let myself get complacent while living with my mother and didn't realize that they, my mother and step father, were slowly strangling me of resources. I've tried to have conversations with my mother about getting me an ID so that I could become self sufficient and it's always put off or there's a reason we can't make it work. I don't drive in large part due to them not seeing a point for me to. My mother has health issues and for a long time now I've acted basically as a live in nurse but she refuses to try and help herself and I'm very exhausted. She also knows I'm trans but has largely refused to awknowledge anything.

I need to leave as I feel that otherwise I'll be unable to actually have and start a life of my own, but I'm battling the feeling that it's selfish of me to leave my mother here with only my step father.

I guess I'm just wondering if people here have battled back from a similar position or have any advice? What do I need to take with me besides my social security card? Is it wrong to take some of my mother's clothing if I have very little of my own?

75," So ive been talking with this guy for about 2 years now as just regular friends. We met a weightlifting and just started talking like acquaintances after that. 

The thing is thay he's popular, on the bodybuilding team, good looking, charismatic, and everyone loves him. And hes about 3 years older. Me on other hand, i'm extremely goth and introverted. I've got the black dyed hair, thick but nice eyeliner, pentagrams, stockings, and all of it. Im shy and i keep to myself. I don't have alot of friends and all i do is play video games. So i'm shit compared to this dude.

 Throughout the year he's been talking to me as if he could tell me anything. Telling me about his worries and insecurities and all that. Last time we hung out, i snuck out at 12 am and went to the beach until 3 just listening to music. When he dropped me off, he wanted a hug and so he did and lifted me up and held me really close. Like it was oddly emotional? Then when i turned my head i almost brushed it into a kiss but i caught myself and got really embarrassed but he just laughed. So that freaked me out.

 Now just a couple days ago he asked if we could hang again and i said sure next week. So he asked me what i wanted to do and i dont know what the hell to do so he suggested we just nap. Kinda odd but i said okay. But he wants to cuddle. Legitimately wants to cuddle and hang. 

 I dont know if hes fucking with my head or if hes actually trying to make a move. Cause every guy who was interested in me just flat out said they wanted a big tiddy goth gf so my hopes aren't that high. But i really like this dude and my heart gets heavy when i see him but hes too good for me. He has chicks on his dick every day but he always turns them down and im just scared. ",21Nov2018,1

79,"So, my boyfriend was talking to me today, and he asked me if I wanted a promise ring. He asked me because 1. He knows I hate it when people buy me things, so that was actually very considerate of him. 2. He doesn't know my ring size. 3. He doesn't want me to get mad if he were to get one and not tell me beforehand (which I wouldn't, seriously, but I'd be slightly mad, which I'll explain further). Here's the thing, I sort of ""hate it"" when people buy me anything. Like sure, I absolutely appreciate the act and the item and the idea, but I feel guilty because they've spent time and money on me. It might be a self esteem thing because I don't think I'm worth the money, time, and thought, but I could also just be overthinking it. I really want to get over this guilt because I think it could really help me in all of my relationships, not just this one. But for now, I have a few questions about promise rings. 

If I were to agree to letting him get me one, how do I figure out my ring size? I can't go with him and I don't know if the how-to that pops up on Google is entirely reliable, but if anything, I'd go with that anyways I guess. 

Another thing, do guys wear promise rings? Or is that just a thing that guys do for girls and guys don't wear them? I know he wears rings, he wears his class ring all the time. When I was looking up ""male promise rings"" or ""guys promise rings"" the only thing that would come up were wedding bands, and that'd be kind of weird in my opinion. So I'm not entirely sure about what to do there. 

And my final question, a completely and totally opinionated question that I want someone's true opinion on, would it be the lamest thing in the world if I said yes to the promise ring, but just asked for a simple band? I couldn't really find just that, but I also didn't really look that hard either.

I'm probably overthinking this way too much, but that's what I do best apparently. ",21Nov2018,1
81,Hi I am searching for a roommate to move into a place I’m buying to help me with the mortgage and was wondering if it would be okay to ask them for a background check,21Nov2018,1
82,"I'll preface this by saying that I'm aware i'm not responsible for my father and how he lives his life/his mistakes. I am protective of my family and friends and sometimes I guess a little over-protective to where it can be appearing as controlling. Im also aware that you can't change people who don't want to change and that your parent is their own person and an adult. That being said, I'm my father currently lives with me (im 23) because he got laid off about 2 years ago and has had a hard time finding a better job than his job. Hopefully he will be getting a higher paying job soon and is  probably/hopefully going to be moving out to a different town/state.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, he has also been struggling with depression for pretty much his whole adult life since he divorced my mother. He had been going to therapy but stopped due to not having time to go because of his new job conflicting with office hours. He is hesitant to go to a new one because he says he can't afford to pay a co-pay each visit. So he has been prescribed anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication, including xanax for a long time. I don't believe he has ever had a problem with xanax other than relying on it when he needs to have a good night sleep sometimes (less than three times a month).  I'm aware that xanax is highly addictive if taken for a long period of time.

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed recently he has been acting weird. He has been acting sketchy/odd and I caught him in a few lies about where he was going/who he was meeting. For example, one time He said he was going to be meeting someone from LetGo (an app similar to Craigslist where people meet up to sell their old stuff) to sell his old clock. I volunteered to go with him because I needed something at the store he supposedly was meeting them at and he was brushing me off saying there was no reason to go with him and he was just going to be there for two minutes, etc.  (He usually tries to get me to go with him places because I rarely see him due to my work schedule). There has also always been a financial issue with not having enough money, yet he has been not watching what he is spending (he gambles online all the time) and all of a sudden is not concerned with money.  One day, he had left his phone behind and I noticed texts from someone about buying pills (when he supposedly was meeting with the LetGo person). (I know it's an invasion of privacy but IMO that is forfeited when that person is lying and committing illegal activities. I also doubt that he has respected my privacy, and at the beginning I just wanted to see if it was just my paranoia or if my intuition was right). So basically I find out that he has been selling his prescribed Xanax to this woman (I dont know her age but it's a female name). According to the texts, she was complaining about how hard her life is and how she doesn't have any money (but she keeps buying xanax for like $60 at a time). It appears he met her recently but she knows that he is lying to me (He told her that he was going to tell me that he was meeting someone from the LetGo site at one point). She also mentioned at one point that ""someone else was interested"", so I'm not sure if she is acting as a distributor or what. I don't think he is selling it to anyone else (at least not directly). I don't see why she couldn't get Xanax on her own since even with bad insurance it's like $5 for a month supply here. That's why i believe she is an addict.

&amp;#x200B;

My main issue with this is I'm worried what is going to happen if he gets caught (he puts the xanax to empty pill bottles or small bags (like that's not a red flag)), or if she gets caught and gives up his name or if she ODs and he blames himself or the police decide to investigate and they find his info in her phone. There's also obviously the matter of right/wrong and honestly I'm very disappointed in him for endangering a lot of peoples lives by doing something so stupid and unnecessary. I used to give him money each month but he has since refused to take any. There's a lot of alternatives that he could do to get money than this. It's not even a matter of pride. I tried talking to him but he claims that he doesn't need financial help. (He received some money after selling his home before he moved in with me, which he still has in the bank). He is not in danger of starving or being out on the street. He claims he doesn't have any outstanding debt. I don't know why he's doing this and what to do. I'm trying to move in a couple of months as well, so I'm not sure if I should not do anything because I won't have to live with him soon so maybe I'll be less anxious and I could separate myself from the situation. I do feel a little bad/concerned for the woman in this situation as well since she clearly has an abuse problem. I just don't want her to drag him into that. He is better person than that. 

It just sucks because I'm not really close with anyone else in my family and I thought he would want to be someone I could look up to. We have other issues as well that don't have anything to do with this (he could be a bit narcissistic at times and likes to try to do guilt trips with me about how he'll be gone soon and how I'm so mean to him if I disagree with something he says, etc).  This situation is definitely not helping and is causing a bigger strain. I honestly don't know if I'm over-reacting or under-reacting.  Should I wait until he messes up and then confront him? Should I try to get more info on the woman and try to stop it? Right now I just have her name and phone number (I wanted to have it in case something goes wrong). I was willing to wait until he ran out of spare pills but I checked around the house and found he has a bunch stock piled (he got them refilled every month for the past few months and he also has some old bottles from a few years ago). Is there anyway I can call the pharmacy and get the refills flagged or stopped? His doctor prescribes them. Should I mention something to her?

&amp;#x200B;

It's gotten to the point where I'm on edge and anxious every time he gets a text or acts suspicious. I hate that he's lying to me. I just don't want anything bad to happen to him. I also want him to be a better person, this isn't him...Any help would be appreciated.

83,"Hi all,  
  
I recently had a big meeting so I ""cleaned myself up"" and shaved and got a hair cut and all. I hadn't shaved in around a month and a half at that point and was giving a beard a shot. My mom didn't like it, but I'm not really that worried about that. I liked it. My boss made some comments like ""what's going on here"" and basically kind of just generally commenting on it. When I shaved he seemed kind of relieved/glad.   
  
After I shaved I feel like I look weird and kind of want to grow my beard back. I'm basically just trying to ask whether or not that sounds like a bad idea? I don't have to go in big meetings that often. I just don't know if growing it is unprofessional and my boss is hinting towards that or if he's just kind of playing around.",21Nov2018,1
84,"tl;dr: coworker, mother of three, threatening to abandon her family and seems increasingly unstable at work. I don't know how to respond. 

&amp;#x200B;

She's a professional in her late 30s, and recently had her third child, which came by surprise. After the baby was born, she struggled with some postpartum depression, but in the last couple months, she's been coming around. Over the last couple weeks, however, she's gone beyond ""feeling better"" and straying into ""full-on manic episode.""  

  

I've noticed that she's extremely excitable, much more talkative than normal, interjects more often, and with all that extra speech has come considerable conflict. She blames her husband for the accidental pregnancy, she's holding a grudge against teammates for decisions she doesn't agree with, and she told me her old manager ""ruined her career"" because he gave her a promotion she didn't want (which did come with a raise btw).     



At first, I thought it was just her kind of snapping out of the funk she'd been in, but then she told me she visited a divorce attorney. Her husband is an unemployed, deadbeat stoner that doesn't even help with the kids so it didn't come as a surprise. ""At least then he'll have to pay child support,"" I said.     

   

""I want him to take the kids,"" she said.     



That threw up a red flag for me, but then today she had a meeting to resolve some conflict between her teammates at work. I asked her how it went and she raved about how good it was. Another coworker in the meeting said it was, ""Top 1 most bizarre meeting i’ve ever been a part of."" They'd ended the meeting early because there was so much tension.     



I was talking to a different coworker about the meeting, and independently he said, ""Do you think she's mentally stable?"" I told him I had had my concerns. Later, he was talking to a different person that was in the meeting, and again, completely independently, that person said he was worried that she was mentally unstable. Three of us have had this feeling, and felt it strongly enough to confide in someone else about it. That seems like a big deal.   

   

Last week I asked her about a conference and the only thing she said was, ""The simulation has been super obvious today."" I'm not sure if she's kidding anymore.    



I don't really know what to do. If I go to HR, I think there may be some steps that they're legally required to take, and I don't really want to be responsible for that outcome if it's really just that she's having a weird week and not getting along with her husband or something. We're not friends outside of work, so I don't know any of her friends or family to contact.

So I go to university in a pretty conservative country and one of the girls here wears a full face veil, like this. Anyway she texted me once for some help and we just kicked it off right away. We had things in common, we made fun of each other, talking to her was so easy.

After that we'd text almost everyday for 10 months, sometimes we'd talk for hours and hours about all kinds of things.

Jump a few years back, my parents separate. Not official like an actual divorce cause we're Asian (lol).  So financial responsibility is all to my mom. Paying the bills and even payments to the house we had bought.

I went to a real college for a semester but left cause of the money and half cause I wanted to become a marine instead.

I'm 19 now going through my second year of college at a community college. My initial plan was to take a few community college course while going through the enlistment process until I finally ship for boot camp. (Working at a job as well to be more independent)

Still living at home. The house just has the essentials like water, electricity and etc.  However, no internet, no computer, no car. 

pay to go phone (its a real money saver tbh, but no data)

IT major (computer kinda important) and I bike/ walk a bit, about an hour to get to school. (could be worse, not complaining) gets kinda cold in the winter though (snowy state)

Jump to this summer. driver falls alseep at the wheel, basically runs me over while I was waiting to cross the road at the crosswalk. in the house for about 1-2 months before i could walk normally.  (lawsuit is in progress, but we're just asking for what we deserve, medical bills etc. not trying to milk the man out of his life savings) also was taking online courses in the summer and with no computer at home, I'm screwed in those classes (my mom thinks i did alright in those classes) spend a lot of money on ubers to get to places cause i wasnt feeling the need to walk extremely far distances 

currently not a lot of money in checkings. saving it for classes next semester, there goes the car dream XD

Now to the present, currently disqualified from the military cause of health issues. Feelsbadman cause being a marine was like the only thing I wanted to do. (still trying to get waivers to join, but wont know for sure if i can join or not) 

basically a years worth of wasted time.

So now... trying to bust through school. feeling unmotivated. no internet at home = cant really keep a nice social life. (i'm lucky to have use my neighbors wifi, but I have to be stuck in an uncomfortable corner to use get a bar of connection) i hang out with friends sometimes, but its hard when thats the only time you talk to them. no car, feeling out of place, cause im in a kinda wealthy neighborhood with everyone having cars going about. parents pay for insurance and all. (lucky them) in such a place where some places i walk dont even have sidewalks, so i have to zigzag through neighborhoods to get to where im going. the only places i know are about a five mile radius from my house thats it.

all other friends have cars, but im sometimes blessed to catch a ride to hangout/school/work. too ashamed to mention my financial differences.

""when are you gonna get a car?"" ""you should totally game online with us"" ""wait, you dont have internet at home?""

Want to save for a computer now. but whats good a computer, withour internet.

wanting to ask mom to see if she could help me out, but not going to ask.

Been working out at the college gym recently, (real small gym, but it get the job done).mind set is still that i can be a marine :)

proud of my progress but thats the only progess ive made this year, HS friends are all in nice colleges. feeling real ashamed.

Spending late nights at the college doing work and trying to stay current with the world (internet) and walk home after while everyone has the their own luxuries at home. 

At least this is some motivation to work harder for my future.

This is just the tip of the iceberg and in real quick bursts of information too.

110,"X-posted at legaladvice before I realized that's the wrong sub since she's not really breaking any laws. Surely at least some sort of HR violation?

My manager at our small location (of a much larger state organization) has gone through 4 employees in the last year alone, in a single position that should last years. They leave because she's insane. People are shocked I've lasted this long, but I'm afraid if I report her I won't get another position in the system (great org, awful boss), and/or that she'll make things even more difficult if nothing happens (since there's no way she wouldn't know who reported her due to our size). I'm asking this here because we really want to be sure we have something actionable before we throw away what's left of our mediocre workplace environment. The last employee that left finally filed a report. HR took it seriously, but from what we can see she's been to a meeting about it that she laughed off, and will have to talk to a mentor(?). There could be more behind the scenes but I doubt it.

* Micro-management. Ex: She had a task for me that was done quarterly by the last employee and said I could do it quarterly or monthly, she didn't care either way. So sometimes I did it every month, sometimes it would be a couple months and then I'd do it (we're talking decorations, people. LOW priority). Since then I've gotten several emails about how it needs to be done monthly, by a specific date, as if I've done something wrong by waiting a month. This is an example of the many LOW priority tasks that she gives arbitrary deadlines for, despite telling us it's not important, or that we can pick our own schedule with it. Doesn't sound like a huge issue but I've got SO MANY examples like this I could give. It piles up.
* Cowardice/Going back on past decisions. Another example of telling us one thing and then getting onto us for doing it that way; she hated one of my jackets. Said it wasn't business casual and so was not appropriate. So I got a new jacket. I wear this jacket, and **at work, she looks at my jacket and says she likes it and asks where I bought it**. There's a whole, weird conversation about how much she **likes** this jacket. At work. **2 months later, I get a TEXT at 10PM on a SUNDAY saying the jacket is not work appropriate and I cannot wear it any more.** This is a very 8-5, M-F type place, and she had no reason to text me at that kind of hour. She won't talk to us about this kind of thing face-to-face. I had to call her out in a meeting just to get her to talk to me about the jacket and why I found the whole situation inappropriate, and her excuse was that she (the manager) was afraid that I (her employee) would fight her.
* EMAILS. The cowardice and micromanagement have ugly email babies CONSTANTLY. We get emails from her constantly about the smallest things, especially when that thing should be between her and the employee. A new staff person used the wrong paper yesterday. Manager proceeds to email the **entire** building about the right kind of paper to use. This is the shortest section but we shouldn't have ANXIETY about pulling up our email just because we're wondering what we've done this time, because it's not **if**, it's **what**.
* Gossip. She's constantly gossiping. HOURS wasted because she gets touchy if we hint that maybe we should be working instead. People will come in from other companies, presumably for work collaboration, and they just sit and gossip for hours. We can't even avoid it because we're all in the same tiny room as an office. She'll even gossip about her own boss. Not to mention the uncomfortable things she says about my work peers TO ME.
* Unprofessional. The number of times I've seen this woman cry, just to get out of having an actual discussion with me about an issue. How the hell she got a management position is so far beyond me.

I'm sure there's more. Do we have anything? HR seemed to take the complaint from the last employee seriously but then nothing happened. Would more of us help? Is she even breaking any rules? Taken individually we sound like whiners, but this stuff is constant. We think it's an authority thing, that she doesn't feel powerful so she creates new rules for us all the time, or she feels insecure in her position, or all of the above. I know my degree intimidates her from the many comments I get from her about how it's not important, to justify her not having one herself. She's an insecure control freak.

That's my question: What rules, if any, can we report her for? We're afraid that it looks like we just don't like doing our jobs or getting direction in emails or something. We LOVE our jobs, and I've been praised extensively, even given an award for my work by others in the organization, while at the same time I'm ""not living up to expectations"" from my boss. So it's not that we don't like our jobs, or that we don't do our jobs well, it's that our boss is up our asses so much we have freaking anxiety to just come in but we don't know what to do.",21Nov2018,1

112,"Throw away btw. Little bit of backstory is that this family member has few friends and is very self conscience and a private person, which is why she has few friends. So I have a family member that is in a vicious cycle. She was having trouble dealing with anxiety and so she went to see a therapist. When the therapist started diagnosing her, it made her worse and she then stopped seeing the therapist. She then had an anxiety attack where she couldn’t sleep for a few days and had to be taken to the hospital to be treated and talk to a psychiatrist. She then decided she did not want to see the psychiatrist anymore. The other members of my family and I believe that she has very low self esteem and is sensitive because she cannot deal with her imperfections and she keeps her emotions bottled up. And this creates her anxiety.And so the psychologist and psychiatrist would discover the imperfections she has and she would not be able to cope. As a result, she is afraid to put herself out there and meet new people because of the imperfections she may have. Because she is not meeting new people, she thinks there is something wrong with her. She doesn’t want to see the doctors because it might confirm her suspicions. And so on. She’s buried herself in books because it is an escape she has developed. How do I convince her to try therapy again to get her out of this cycle?(She’s very stubborn btw)

My neighbors have left their dog alone alone in their apartment for at least two and a half days so far. I only know this because the apartment new letter is still stuck in their door. It’s in there barking- I’m not sure if it’s distressed or not.

I’m about to go on vacation for the holidays, so I won’t be home to make sure they come back for the dog. We live in a gated complex which is technically considered private property so anytime I’ve had issues, the police haven’t been able to help. I don’t think I can turn to law enforcement for this issue, but I’m so worried about the dog. I’ve also never seen the owners take the dog on a walk since they moved in two months ago.

114,"My girlfriend and I have been seeing each other for a few months now but we only made things official a few weeks ago. Things have been going perfect up until this past Saturday. She flew back home for thanksgiving break (we are both in grad school) and did warn me that she wasn’t gonna be on her phone much and apologized early if she was bad a responding. No problem, I don’t care really. What I didn’t expect was flat out no contact for 2 days. She finally got to me this morning and all it said was “had a really bad weekend”. Of course I immediately ask if things are okay and they are not. I’ve only been able to get a couple replies all day but basically a close family member is really sick and now she doesn’t wanna even come back here and is having all these doubts about her choices in life (kinda sounds dramatic but this person is a VERY important person in her life). 

What worries me is she kinda was already talking about these doubts last week and how she wasn’t sure she even wanted to live out here anymore. Knowing that, accompanied with the things she’s said today; I get the feeling like she’s gonna completely change paths in life, resulting in us breaking up because she knows exactly what my plans are and that I’ve already committed to them. Plus, we haven’t been together long so dumping me wouldn’t be too much of a loss to her. 

I don’t know, I could be worried about nothing and I hate thinking like this because it seems like I’m being selfing and only thinking about myself here.

117,"Every year my sister posts on Facebook that she is “___ years cancer free” but she never had cancer.

This bothers me every time I see her post, and I really want to say something to her but I don’t know how. 

A few years ago, my sister had an abnormal mammogram and had to have pre-cancerous cells removed. There was no cancer. The cells most likely would have not turned into cancer. It was a simple procedure and she was fine afterwards and has been fine ever since. 

For those not familiar, here is a little snippet about precancerous cells: “Precancerous cells are abnormal cells that are found on the continuum between normal cells and cancer cells, but unlike cancer cells, do not invade nearby tissues or spread to distant regions of the body. There are many potential causes of precancerous cells ranging from infection to chronic inflammation. Not all precancerous cells turn into cancer. In fact, most do not.”

So my sister did not have cancer. At all. Yet every year, she posts that she is “cancer free” and receives sympathy and words of support from people who have no idea she never had cancer. What further infuriates me is when people who actually had cancer reply to her post sharing their stories, and my sister says things like  “Thank you all for the kind words and overwhelming response. It means the world to me. Some days can be a challenge, then I get strength from my best friends and family.” And “It's a hard fight, but worth doing.”

I find this an insult to actual cancer survivors. My family and I are embarrassed and outraged that she would blatantly lie on Facebook to garner sympathy or attention or whatever she is looking for. To make the situation even worse, her husband is an ACTUAL cancer survivor. He had cancer twice and had to go through chemo and is now in remission.

Should I just continue to ignore her posts or finally say something to her about it?",21Nov2018,1
118,"Sorry for the convoluted title, first of all. 

So, I work as a host in a restaurant/bar. I'm the only host currently working there after the other one quit a few months ago. My manager said, when asked if we should hire another one, ""nah, it'll save on labor costs,"" meaning that every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday I have to work, and am always the only host on. 
So, today I found out that some family of mine is traveling up near me for thanksgiving, and was able to make plans to drive to where they're going on Friday-Saturday. Haven't seen any of them in a long time, so naturally this is of greater importance to me than working. So, I called my manager today to tell him I would only be able to work Sunday next week due to visiting family for thanksgiving. He immediately chewed me out, 1) for calling him while he's visiting family for thanksgiving (specifically, his ""very sick"" mother) and 2) because it's 2 days beforehand, and how did I possibly not know my travel plans that soon before the holidays? Also went on about how ridiculous it was that I had to call off. Also said that I needed to text one of the other lower managers instead of him, but I don't have her number, or anyone's who works there,  and don't know how I should get ahold of her. 

I feel awful for bothering him while he's dealing with something like that of course, but I also feel that it's incredibly unfair for him to be that upset. I think  that it may be because I had to take one whole weekend off in the last month, as well as Friday &amp; Sunday of one weekend &amp; Friday of another due to a pretty debilitating back injury. (Which I had a cane, and 2 doctors notes for!) but that's not fair for him to be upset really about either in my opinion, given that it was an injury. 

I also find it very hypocritical and awful that he flipped out on me for calling off to visit family but is himself visiting family. Like, okay. 

I also am never given a schedule, am just expected to come in every weekend at the same times. When there was another host working, she would only ever be able to work limited hours so I would still be expected to cover whatever she couldn't. If she couldn't work all weekend, it was never an issue because *I* was always there to cover. I don't find it fair that because I'm the only host now, I have no luxury of taking any weekends off at all, which I have not even at all since I've started working there, except for this &amp; the times due to my back injury. 

Working there causes me lots of anxiety &amp; I had been considering quitting beforehand anyway... this instance will only further that anxiety I am sure. My only drawback is that I do really enjoy having a tipped job, &amp; that an old friend of mine basically got me that job so I don't want to make things awkward for her there if I quit in such a circumstance. 

Should I quit? Is my manager in the wrong? (I know 3 days is not long beforehand to have to call off, but even so.. it is the holidays..) or is this all my fault? Should I not see my family &amp; just go into work? I'm very anxious and conflicted about this so any thoughts are appreciated. 

TLDR: called off to see family for the holidays, manager freaked out unnecessarily, had been thinking of quitting before this incidence, should I? ",21Nov2018,1

When he did that this Sunday it made me tear up but I didn’t wanna cry. That’s when the super sadness started and I’ve been that way ever since. I don’t hate the girl because she seems like a nice person and I even wish to befriend her.

Boyfriend and I are together for 5 years. We went to the restaurant (me, boyfriend, two male friends of him)

I have suspicions of my bf cheating on me with a colleague named Janna but not sure. He met Janna after we got together. Boyfriend told us the colleagues at work earlier complained about his beard growing too long. He said only Maria wasn't complaining.

Male friend said; **Maria likes those hairy feel between her legs. Was she that girl with which you..** silence. He stopped his sentence. (Maria is not the girl i am concerned about but this friend tends to swap people and dont remember names correctly). I asked him what does he mean. He says it's just a joke. I ask him; do you talk about Janna. No answer. Bf jumps in and tells me it's all joking.

Currently I've got my exams coming and I'm not even thinking of interning next semester because I was bogged down with personal issues. Out of the blue, my boss from the last company hits me up and asks me if I am available to work this January. They've changed a few things about my job role, instead of working there I work from home, my pay is halved (since I have no expenses now) + 15% commission of all the business I bring to the company.

Also I could ask them for more to move into that city, they are offering 8x the money to someone who is willing to take up a full time job with the same job role.

123,"I posted on here a while back about an argument my sister and I had. To sum it up : my sister became antivax 2 1/2 years ago, while I was pregnant. She continued to tag me in vaccine posts on Facebook, to which I never replied to nor talked about when we were together. I'm for vaccines and I made that very clear, but the posts didn't stop. Once my daughter was born everything was great until my sister told me to stay away from her house until my daughter's shot shed through her body because my sister didn't want to get sick being in contact with her or us, for a week. This pissed me off at the mere ignorance of that. It was downhill from there from her pretty much telling me I was a bad parent and I'm ignorant, can't read a thing, and shoving poison into my child. Needless to say, we haven't spoken, and this was December of last year. Now with the holidays coming up, my mom wants to have Thanksgiving at her house as usual, but my father refuses because we are feuding. I'm a civil person, I can fake a happy smile for their sake, as can my sister(she is a pro) but the thing is, he seems to be putting the blame on me, she is the oldest and he told me I should just make up with her and move on. But I wasn't the one in the wrong. He is a passivist and will avoid any uncomfortable situation if possible. I guess my question is, how to handle him? Or maybe I'm just trying to vent, this has been on my chest for a long time. Im the middle child and the saying has lived up to the truth. Should I just say eff it too?

124,"Hi. I’m a pretty awkward and nervous kid, so bear with me here. I never had any kind of friends who connected with me, or really any friends at all until high school rolled around. I met this girl and we hit it off. I eventually grew to have a crush on her, and as a year went by of not telling her, I started to come to my senses. Despite my few friends being positive that she did like me back and that I should just go for it, I realized I’m totally unprepared for a relationship. My life has been at a low point for awhile now and I don’t want to be a burden to this girl, more than I already am. The problem is that one of my friends has told her about my feelings, but she’s never mentioned it whatsoever.

The question is, how do I get over it? I know that I’ll never be able to do it, so I just want these feelings gone. I don’t want to straight up ghost her, as I enjoy her company and overall her as a person. I don’t know how to give the vibes that I’m not interested anymore.

125,"So first off as my username may suggest my boyfriend is very much aware of my day to day Reddit account (we are active posters/commenters on the same sort of threads) so simply for the sake of some anonymity I’ve set up this new account to try avoid any potentially awkward situations. 

But now down to business.

Myself (29) and my boyfriend (32) have been in a relationship for coming up to a decade as of next year. For the last three or so we have been long distance due to work and some tension with money due to my circumstances - but before that we actually lived together happily for four to five years. 

Despite a rough spell after the initial move twelve hours apart (by car) I’d say all in all we have come to terms with the situation and have still managed to have a healthy happy relationship together in spite of the distance.

Or at least we did. 

The idea of moving to the US was dropped on me suddenly one day while I was down visiting him in France almost two years ago and I was as confused about it then as I am now.

Before this point the idea of him wanting to move abroad for work had never come up, so at the time I had just sort of shut down at the prospect of not seeing him even bi-monthly anymore as we currently are in our long distance set up. As that just seemed like such a BIG escalation to the whole distance thing.

Now the thing is, what really hurt me about this was that I was never asked to join him. I was simply left out of his new plans from the get go. When I asked “so are you looking at me joining you out there?” he said it was something he wanted to do for himself. 

I understood, he never got a chance to go off and travel after studying as we’ve been together for so long now.

But he has a good career in a job he’s great at, so I knew that by going abroad he wasn’t simply going to do the regular old “work part time to sustain yourself” type set up. He was going to find another job in engineering.

So immediately this “one year” away concept was quickly upped to two when I called him on such matters and I was in awe at his ability to double our time apart without so much as a moments thought about it.

Time passes, there’s a few mentions of the move until nearly a whole year goes by with no word on the matter. Then one day he sends me some flat listings in the area he’s looking to move to. 

He suddenly mentions his boss has been really supportive and has helped him to find a great job out there and he is looking to go right after new year. He has given notice to his current landlord and has already looked into flights.

I was in shock to say the least.

We had a talk about it at the time last month and the only thing I told him that I really needed to know moving forward was that despite this move he was still interested in us having a future together at the end of all of this. No stipulation if that meant me moving over, him coming back. Just that we had some sort of future. He said, “I don’t know.”

I just really felt like things were back on track despite our current distance lately and in my mind we were even heading towards a move back together.

But I get it, he can’t know for sure whether things will work out, no one knows the future but Raven, but that’s not what I asked. I just wanted to know how he felt about us moving forward.

But we are now with me looking at another two years on my own with no guarantee of a relationship at the end. I am fully aware that I made it quite hard for him for a while (health/finances) but we’ve discussed that time in our lives and I was to believe all was well.

Now I feel like this is him trying to force an end to the relationship without having to dump me directly.

I really just don’t know what to do as until now I have been so happy. He is my best friend and I have honestly pictured our lives together, heck we have already spent almost a third of them together so it was my much of a stretch.

Am I being unreasonable? Or is he simply being cruel at this point? Has any one ever done anything similar or had this sort of situation before?

As I am at a total loss.

My friends and family say to end it, my younger brother even threatening to go to the US to “punch him in the throat” but I still don’t feel that sort of anger towards him. I just feel so sad.

No single part of me wants things to end between us but I feel like if I don’t at this point I am just going to be dragging out the inevitable. ",21Nov2018,1
126,"I live in a cheap studio apartment with thin walls.  My neighbors have constant, veeery loud sex (constant moaning, banging on my wall) and always have their windows open, so the whole floor can hear it.  When they're not having sex they're yelling at each other.

The other day I was woken up around 7am to loud sex, so I decided to learn a short note on their door.  It said 'please keep your noise down during inappropriate hours, the walls are thin, thank you'.  I heard them laughing about it and talking about how they're basically just going to disregard it, and then heard them talking badly about me.

I know the walls are thin, but it's really extreme and at all hours of the day.  I don't really want to knock on their door and tell them because they seem kind of aggressive.

128,"It’s pretty much in the title, but for example, if we’re out to a dinner party with my grandma, we’ll greet her, and even though I did bow, my sister will say (and not in a whisper) “Bow to grandma.” There was one instance at my birthday, my grandma was talking to me, and I was listening, but my sister thought I wasn’t so she physically grabbed my head and spun it completely in my grandma’s direction. It makes me feel humiliated because from an outside standpoint, it can look like I wasn’t being respectful to my grandma and that my sister has to tell me what to do when I know basic customs like greeting elders with a bow. It makes me feel like she thinks I’m 6 and doesn’t know how to do anything. When she does things like that, I’ll either just tolerate it because I’ve been used to it for so long or if I’m really fed up, I turn to her and say things like “Stop bossing me around. I know what to do/say.” The reason why I don’t confront her that much is because she takes offense by it and gets mad at ME, and I don’t want to deal with the tension. She doesn’t only boss me around, but also my mom, who has expressed annoyance at this. At the same birthday dinner, told my mom to help my grandma up the stairs. Basically telling my mom what to do with her own mom even though my grandma was already being helped by my aunt. 
In all honesty, I don’t think she has bad intentions, and that she just wants to help people out, but to always think that she’s right and say what to do openly, not in a private way can come off as awkward and stuck up. I don’t really know what to do because if I confront her, then she gets mad at me, which imo makes no sense? There was one time where I basically kind of blew up and confronted her sternly because she has instances where she makes comments to me making me feel not smart (in this instance, our Korean speaking ability), and I told her that we’re at the same level of Korean so stop making me feel humiliated or thinking she’s better than me.

130,"I'm sorry for how choppy this post probably is going to be but, I just I feel so mentally shaken from it.

I work in a home improvement store you could say, and I have been there a year now. Over the year I have gotten accustomed to older men hitting on me and I uncomfortably ignore it, or brush it off as awkwardly as I can. Over time customers have gotten familiar with me, so they know me. Today took a turn I could have never expected.

I think it's worth to mention that I have been sexually assaulted in the past, and lately at the store I have been scared of being left alone due. I have had a bad feeling in my gut consistently when I am left by myself in the store for various reasons. The town I live in is sketchy due to the people most of all.

So I am on the cash register checking people out and this older man (in his 70s) gets in line and asks me to come to the back of the store to unlock an item in a case for him to purchase. There was a couple waiting on me, so I called a coworker to help them. I went to help the older guy because I carry the keys to unlock said case.

So I go to the back and he is waiting on me, but has evidently found what he wanted. I asked him, ""Guess you don't need me to unlock anything, is there something else you may need help with?""
He replied and told me that he needed me, which when he said this I was like ""wat""

He stepped closer to me and told me that right here and right now that he was about to rape me. I can't forget the smile he gave me as he said this, and I think it is part of the reason why I am so bothered right now.

It was like I processed what he said in slow motion due to the fact of sheer disbelief that a person would say this. Given my past a switch flipped in me and I turned and ran away. I ran to my coworker and told him what happened.

He went to look for the guy while I proceeded to have a panic attack in the break room at work. We went back over the cameras and found that he left immediately after I ran away, but we got a clear picture of him. The man is a regular that comes in the store, and we got his name. 

My boss and coworkers are amazing and helped me calm down, and I have been calm since I came home on the outside. I filed a police report too. I'm not sure if I will hear anything back from them, I haven't filed one before. The officer suggested that he was trying to proposition me and see what I was going to say, but given the way he looked at me as he said it, I really don't think so. Him quickly stepping close to me before he said it didn't help either. 

I'm writing this because I am so scared still, even though I'm home and safe. When I told my mother she told me to stop thinking about it over and to get over it. This happened to me this morning and right now it's so fresh I can't help to. I can still hear him saying that he is going to rape me with that disgusting grin on his face.

Given I have had something else happen in the past I don't know if that's what is making it so hard for me. I just feel this heavy sadness on the inside, along with being disgusted with myself because the situation happened to begin with. My mom told me if I need to go to therapy to help that I can, but I honestly don't know if I should or not right now. 

I used to take zoloft and anxiety medication to help with the other thing that happened to me last year, but when I graduated in May I felt okay enough and stopped taking them. I worried that this is going to trigger something. Before anybody says it I know the situation could have been a lot worse, that's what my mom said when she told me to get over it.

Mentally, I feel so strained over this right now. Am I having ration thought and reaction to this or am I overreacting?",21Nov2018,1
131,"Gonna get this off my chest, because I have to at some point.

I've struggled with my sexual feelings for my entire life because by the time I became a teenager I started to realize they weren't normal. I was abused as a child and I always had a crushing feeling of sexual guilt that I still carry to this day. First of all, I'm gay. That's not much on its own, but that's probably the first unusual thing I discovered about myself. Not long after that, the bad stuff started. I discovered that I liked to see others in pain.

It progressed as I got older. I learned that I enjoyed witnessing violence. Then I got into a fight in 10th grade and realized I like to be violent. Then my crush had his appendix taken out and I kept imagining what he'd look like when he'd been cut open, as disgusting as that sounds. What I'd see on the inside, and what it would be like if I were the one cutting him open. With anesthesia, then without anesthesia. A couple days later he went to school still on heavy pain meds, and he was stupid and high basically all day. That day during lunch I went to the bathroom and beat off because it turned me on so much to see him so vulnerable. I wondered what would happen if I spiked his water bottle with sleeping meds. Would he fall asleep? If I kissed him, would he be too tired to fight me off? What if I raped him? Would he be able to get me off of him, or would he be too weak?

Anyway, I kept on wondering. I never did any of this. But I always wondered what would have happened if I had.

It never got any better. My fantasies just get worse and worse. The things I beat off to are fucking insane (no, nothing illegal, just fiction stories and things I manage to conjure up in my head). Mutilation and torture and turning someone into a living zombie. The worst thing is that I can't be sure I'm strong enough to resist these things all my life. I worry. I lay awake at night.

So I've been thinking of killing myself. I just don't want to deal with this anymore. My actual sex life is nonexistent. I once had the opportunity to have sex with a girl, but I couldn't get it up one bit and she left. The same thing happened when I ended up making out with a guy after I graduated. Absolutely nothing, no pleasure, no feeling. And yet all I need to do is think of this fucked up shit and I get hard immediately.

I don't know if I have any other option. It just feels useless to be here. I don't trust myself. I think we're better off without people like me.

I may not have a strong enough will to do that, either. I don't have the balls to do it tonight, or anything like that. But I feel like it's my duty, at some point. I'll gather the willpower eventually. It's better than relying on willpower every fucking day of the week.

132,"Let me set the scene for you first. 

I'm a supervisor. I am in charge of 5 other people, while my Manager is the only person above me at our store. I work with two Sales leads, and three associates. I have Saturdays and Sundays off, and work a regular 9-5, Monday to Friday schedule. 

&amp;#x200B;

Within the past couple of weeks, the communication between my team has taken a nosedive. The main problem that has been happening is that my coworkers have been approaching my boss with problems or drama happening between them without consulting me about it first. Since I am the Manager on duty (My manager's office is at another store down the street under the same company), my team is to approach me first with whatever problems they are having, and I am to take care of it. If the problem continues, then my coworkers can approach my manager and let him know about it. But since my manager is not on the floor, I am the one to take the lead for our store. 

&amp;#x200B;

I came in this morning, returning from a 3 day weekend, when my manager told me about a list of problems my team has alerted him about. He asks me why I haven't taken care of it, and why it is still happening. Told him I can't take care of a problem I have no knowledge of until now.This is not the first time this has happened while away on my days off. Or the third, fourth or fifth time. I communicate well with my team, including them on what current projects are happening, where our numbers are at, what assignments I have ready for them, etc. I ask them to perform basic tasks for the store, like handing out baskets to customers and ask customers if they need assistance or have any questions they can answer. I ask if they have performed the task, not if they can do the task FOR me. I firmly believe in making sure everyone is content with their work environment and busy with work to focus on to make sure they are productive as possible. The success of our store relies on a TEAM EFFORT. I haven't had any negative situations between coworkers happen under my watch within the past few weeks.  I have told all 5 coworkers that if there's a problem that comes up, I am very capable of taking care of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am incredibly frustrated with my team for not addressing me with complications between each other and leaving me completely in the dark. I am frustrated that my boss is angry with me for not being more strict with my team about these problems. I have no reason to be strict if my team is doing their job and listening well to me. I'm confused as to why my team won't consider me as an option for help. Everything runs smoothly until I have my days off on the weekend. I just don't know how to let my team know that I am in charge and their FIRST person to go to with problems. I'm not even sure if I should ask them WHY it is that I'm being overlooked as an option for a solution. The advice I am asking for is HOW DO I  COMMUNICATE TO MY TEAM TO CONSULT WORK RELATED ISSUES WITH ME FIRST? 

Any input is welcome! Thank you.

A little background I was not allowed any friends that weren’t pre-approved children that were members of our church. I was raped at knifepoint when I was 15 and upon telling them I was told it was the way I dressed and acted. FYI at the time I wore jeans, hoodies and tried to hide the best I could and was always home before nightfall. I didn’t manage to escape until I was 18 and went to live with a family member. That’s when I met my oldest daughters dad. He was the light of my life. So smart, had a really great sense of humor and loved me more than words. 

Six months later we were in a car wreck. A driver who was two times over the limit hit us as we were headed to a birthday party.  I survived, barely. He died, in my arms. The daughter I was carrying died due to the trauma I endured. 

Several years later (I was 22) I fell in love with a guy whose humor and compassion lit up my world. We were married for 3 years, on our third anniversary he told me that he had pancreatic cancer. By the time they caught it, we only had eight weeks. I was a month shy of my 25th birthday

I know it’s instinctual for dogs (we always had dogs growing up so I’m not a complete stranger) and I know it can to an extent be trained out of them but how long to I make my cats deal with this while he learns? It’s not fair to them, either. 

I love him, and I want him in my life, but I’ve had these cats for almost 15 years so I know which way I would choose if I was forced to. I also don’t want to get angry and frustrated with him and make him think I resent him because I don’t. Like I said, I know he’s just a puppy.

139,"This will be difficult to summarize, and is going to be missing some details, either due to my own fault, or to save time for the reader. I don't mind elaborating on specifics, if need be.

The short version of my problem is: I live in the bay area and I have an ailing father of whom I have to take care of, a 7-month old son, wife, and I'm not making enough money to take care of all of them. But, there's more to all of this, of which I will still try to summarize in their own categories below.

My dad; can't walk more than a few feet without having to sit down due to injuries, and now a bad hip that he couldn't afford to fix in the past, and now the doctor's say he's too old to be done safely. He also has chronic anxiety issues, that for the time being, are being somewhat handled by Zoloft. I currently live with him in a government-aid (financial) apartment, to take care of him. I make meals, clean, bathe, and try to manage the apartment upkeep. He's not totally invalid; he's able to fold clothes, towels etc, and help manage computer related things like bills, etc. But, it's practically a full-time job for me to do everything else on top of taking care of my wife and son.

About my wife and son; they live with her parents 6 miles away. She works as a contractor for a realty business from home, but gets paid very little; at best $100 a week, at worst $25-30, and sometimes nothing at all. She's recently signed up with Amazon Flex to try and supplement income, but there haven't been any deliveries within 50 miles in the last few days. Every day I go back and forth between my apartment/dad and my wife's parents house to take care of both. It's very taxing to me; I don't get regular meals, and rarely a full night's sleep. All that I can deal with. It's the next part that I need the help with.

We think we're pregnant again. To be clear about this; we had a plan in mind before that we thought was going to work out, but didn't in regards to her income with a job she had. Her employer claimed she would be able to give her full-time work from home, but then it didn't happen because of something related to computer hardware at home (I can elaborate if need be). This plan was for one baby, and while it can be said that it wasn't the best planning, it's really unnecessary to point out now. The second, possible baby (we still have to go to the doctor to confirm, but she took a at-home-test twice, both positive), was not planned, and we were using protection.

I don't know how to fix this. I mean, I need more money, but where I work there isn't any promotions available, and even if there was, I'd need to work at home for this to even work. I don't know of any work-at-home jobs that would make enough money to fix this. When I say more money, I mean that enough to have us all move in together, and I could pay for everything. However, the lowest rent we can find here is $2300 per month, and I just can't afford it. If I made twice as much as I do now (now is $34,000/yr), I \*think\* I could make this work. My other worries is that it's already difficult for my wife to manage one child, let alone two. Plus I have to take care of my dad. I'm trying not to lose my mind. I have some debt that I've been snowballing to pay off, but it's been slow because any extra money I've been able to save has been going to my son.

141,"First time posting, on mobile, and throwaway account so sorry about whatever formatting I’m supposed to have.

Anyways, it’s kinda long so the tldr is at the bottom.

My mom and dad got “divorced” like 4 years ago when I was 13 (they never married) and it was, (what I was told), that my mom found out he has been cheating on her. This didn’t really affect me too much. Well after that we moved and I visited him twice since then, one three years ago and now.

So after not seeing your father for 3 years you need to catch up. Well he had posted some stuff on Facebook about marrying someone he had just met and that he was living with them and would post about them constantly. This was after he found out my mom got a new boyfriend.

So he always tells me how the family can’t break or whatever and we gotta stay together and I agree, well today he told me that only after seeing this girl for half a year he is going to marry her, mind you, my dad is 30 years older than this girl, and she is still in college. Anyways he asks me for advice and I tell him I think it’s too early but for him to do him and blah blah blah.

Anyways this is the juicy part, I told him I didn’t believe this girl existed, his “posts” on Facebook didn’t include her face except for one time. There were just way too many small loose ends that didn’t add up. He has a business in (not real place) California and told me that he lives with her in (not real place) North Carolina. Anyways after telling him I didn’t believe him because there were too many loose ends and then asking him to show me proof he showed me two different texts with two different girls. 

I called him out on it and he said “oh it’s nothing” then told him if it’s nothing to then show his to-be wife and he obviously said no. I asked him what his dad would say and he said his dad would be pissed, I told him, well there you go. 

So after that he tells me that he’s taking my advice and not going with the wedding, I told him to go along with it cause it was his choice and etc. Then he tells me no and that I “spoiled” the wedding.  Then he starts going on a rant about how it’s ok to have a double life and how women are only after money and how when I grow up I’ll understand that it’s basically ok to cheat. 

I tried to knock some sense into him and say “what would your dad think? I think he would slap you” 

I don’t know how else to knock some sense into him. I don’t know if he is depressed since my mom left him or something. I just can’t believe he really thinks that way. He is Arabic so it might be in his culture but still... anyways: was I too harsh? What should I do to knock some sense into him? What about the wedding?

142,"So I feel like I’m at an emotional cross roads right now. I am a 34 years married female, I have two kids aged almost 2 and 4 years old and I live in a very expensive city with crappy childcare options. My husband and I both work full time and we’ve recently decided we want a third child. My mom was just recently diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s. Needless to say I have a lot going on. 

Since going back to work after my second maternity leave (we get a year in Canada) I’ve been feeling a lot of anxiety and having troubles sleeping. I started seeing a counselor and it is helping a bit.  Basically I’m an overachiever and have to-do list anxiety (sounds so ridiculous I know). 

My moms recent diagnosis has me taking a look at my life and how I want to choose to live it. I know I’m lucky to have all that I have...and it makes me feel guilty that I’m too busy to really enjoy it. 

I need help weighing some options:

1. Keep working full time and try and be better at managing this large amount of stress. 

2. Try asking my boss for part time (maybe 4 days a week)

3. Quit my job 

Here are some details of my insane life. I’ll try not to ramble. Skip it and just give me off the cuff advice is you get bored reading. 

- work is not fulfilling anymore. I think it’s partly because of how my boss has treated me since having kids. I’ve experienced some misogyny and I definitely don’t get equal pay to a man. I have a chip on my shoulder about it as I work very hard. 
-my job is pretty kushy and flexible and I can come and go as I please. I love the people I work with apart from my boss that I have hard feelings towards. He’s a good boss just a shitty person. 
- went down the path of getting a different job which paid 35% more but I turned it down. Didn’t feel like a new job would solve anything and feared I would be spending even more time away from my kids. 
- husband is great but does not share the childcare burden as much as I do. 
-We’re not happy with our childcare set up 
-I help out with my mom a lot. 

I think I really want to be a stay at home mom but I have a lot of fears since I’m giving up a lot. I make about $100k and I enjoy having something for myself outside of having kids. We don’t really “need” my salary ad my husband makes at least twice what I do but we’d definitely have to make some major lifestyle changes. I have a ton of guilt over not spending enough time with my kids. The worst part is I feel disconnected from them when I work full time. I feel like I don’t know them as well and my heart aches. I feel like life is going by so fast and I’m going to blink and they’ll be teenagers who don’t need me anymore. 

What should I do? Experiences from other people are welcome

143,"Hello, Reddit! I am a 16 year old AP Student (Junior) from AZ. I would like to preface this post by saying that I do *not* like to throw around the term 'bad teacher' lightly - but this class is pushing me to the edge, and I need some advice on how to deal with a teacher who isn't teaching us er...well, the way he 'should' be. 

So, AP Lang is not my first an AP class. I took AP World last year and passed the class with flying colors, landing a 4 on the exam. The teacher was great, and really good with timing + framework for preparing us for the AP exam. This year is..a completely different story.  This summer, we were asked to do a book report on The Scarlet Letter. Great, no big deal. I did it fine, and this new teacher even gave me a perfect score on it. So, I started out liking the class because this teacher seemed like a cool, respectable guy - he's rather young (millennial, even), 'hip', and seemed to have pretty progressive views. The first 2 weeks of school went relatively smooth with minor hiccups. After all, I didn't expect him to prepare me for the exam within the first 2-3 months of school, but I at least expected him to have...an actual plan on how he would tackle the exam.

Now, it is the end of November, and we have just gotten off for Thanksgiving break. The first semester is nearly over, and what have we done? Well, pretty much nothing. All of our 'assignments' (AKA creating a Google Slides PPT and analyzing an excerpt from an obscure book he has read) have been bogus: he had us spend a whole week watching 'What The Health' (subsequently followed by a '30 day vegan challenge' for the class that the school's administration immediately shut down due to district rules), had us create a 'vision board' (a collage of pictures that represents our personality), and analyze a J-Cole song (4 Your Eyez Only). That is just to name a few. We have not had a single test, read a single book, nor written an actual essay (we did write a personal narrative about 1 event that changed our lives, but it was written in 1st person...not what the AP Exam will ask us to do). 

While most people would call me crazy for complaining about a lack of work, that is not where my qualms lay. This same teacher teaches a Normal English III class. And guess what they have had to do? They have read The Crucible, answered *50* guided reading questions after each act, watched the movie, written an essay, and taken an exam. The AP Class has done absolutely nothing! He gives us 'reset' days where he lets us do whatever we want, and misses at least 1 or 2 days every single week to do God knows what. And the cherry on top is that he absolutely cannot handle grading all of the mindless assignments he gives us, so grades are not updated whatsoever...there is more stuff that I find annoys me, but that is personal. These complaints are strictly based on how he handles the academic portion of the class.

Basically, the question I am asking is *how in the hell do I deal with this guy*? How am I supposed to even fathom taking/passing the AP exam when this man has taught me and my peers absolutely nothing in the course of 4 months? I know we still have a lot of time in the year left, but this is getting ridiculous. I have AP prep books, but I cannot afford tutors and it is difficult to devote 4+ hours a week to studying for one class among all of my other APs. Is his lazy, laissez faire style of teaching worth reporting to admin, or should I suck it up and try my best to help myself? 

(*important note: a friend of mine has already sent him an \*anonymous\* email highlighting what many other students find ineffective about this class, but no response has been given nor has he announced anything to the class.*)

TL;DR - I am an AP Lang student with an incompetent teacher who tries too hard to give us 'fun' and hip assignments that have not taught us anything at all or prepared us for the exam at all. On top of this, he piles mountains of work onto his normal English students. I am frustrated and desperate for a solution to this problem, as I want to take (and pass) the AP exam.",21Nov2018,1

I looked on the internet and it said you can't smell carbon monoxide (which I already knew) but you could smell side effects of combustion (which is what I'm worried about).

We have fire/carbon monoxide alarms in every room of the house, and none are going off, which is why I'm assuming it's just me being paranoid.

146,"_(This was a /r/self rant that turned into an advice post, so I'm posting it here.)_

So this week, I just found out I have a bunch of relatives from the absentee father I never knew. Apparently, he spread his seed far enough to populate the state of West Virginia. I never really knew the guy or cared for him, but was always a little curious as to what kind of person he was, considering how fucked up and inhuman I am. Apparently, he was mostly the opposite of me in all things except weight, looks and skin tone (I'm short at 180 cm and a little overweight). He was just as ugly as me, but was also really successful with (really) ugly women. I couldn't even imagine how many illegitimate children he has out there. 

So, this has been most of my life until recently. I get contacted from three separate strangers on Facebook. The main one, tells me she's my (half) sister and that the guy just died. This person also tells me that my 'father' never liked to share information about his other children to each other or how many children he had out there. So this lady is in her 40's and all the rest of them are way older than me, with the youngest being 36. To be honest, I wished they never contacted me. Because one, I now have to pretend to be ""family"" with this group of strangers. And two, they are all FUCKED UP and extremely embarrassing. It's like that one episode of The Simpsons when Homer tries to show Lisa his extended family one morning and they all end up being losers and even dumber than Homer is. 

So the main one calling herself my (half) sister is morbidly obese. Like 330+. But that's not too bad. But the other two and the rest of them... The youngest oldest (half) sister is creeping me the fuck out. She keeps sending me kissy faces and lipstick emojis on Facebook. Like some incest-level shit. Also, she literally seems barely literate. It's bad even for Facebook and textspeak. And the older brother seems to basically scam people for a living. Just like in that one Simpsons episode, where one of Homer's relatives ""jumps in front of cars to sue people."" This guy is a [Patent troll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_troll) (and yes, I had to look up the actual definition for it) among other ""not-really-illegal-but-still-shitty"" things. And what's worse is how _proud_ they all are of him!

I'm sitting here like ""what the fuck?"" They all legitimately seem like inbred hillbillies and like those Jim Crow stereotypes from the 19th century. Only they're all real and living in 2018. They're all about the ""we r familee"" spiel and stuff and want to reunite all of my father's illegitimate kids. I already have no connection to this man having not known him basically my whole life and not having seen him since I was sixteen and learning how to drive (which he gave up trying to teach me after 45 minutes in). But now I have to deal with these barely literal, barely functional 'half-siblings' as well? No. Just fuck no. 

I'm really not trying to be a dick here. But there's only so much embarrassment I can hold in. I legitimately feel even worse now for having known these people _technically_ come from the same ""bloodline"" as me. They're pretty much the complete opposite of everything I want to be. They're ghetto trash and one of them even seems to be trying to flirt with me! They want me to come over for Thanksgiving (only, they're not eating turkey; they're eating some weird poultry I never even heard of, and no, it's not turducken).

There’s a guy who I’ve see at the university  library almost daily for the past year and a half and I am insanely attracted to him. I didn’t try to shoot my shot because we don’t have any mutual friends, I’m quite shy and anxiety ridden, and I think it would be uncomfortable for him to be approached while studying. I just admired him from afar instead (doing the occasional internet stalk because you know how it be sometimes). Recently, my friend pulled some favours with a friend of hers (who happens to know library boy) tried to set him up with me. They Facebook messaged him that I was interested in him. I didn’t want him to know that I was interested because I just simply wanted to get to know him without the pressure of there being any romantic potential. Library boy just responded by saying he didn’t know who I was (I didn’t expect him to know who I was anyway haha). The conversation just ended there. Should I give it some time before I take this as a rejection? He didn’t say no but he also didn’t say yes. 

The guy who was doing this as a favour to my friend really didn’t care that much about the situation and half-assed it. He is no longer willing to help a sister out so that means of communication is no longer available. I feel too awkward and insecure to approach him in person (also because he is always with his friends).

I have a career that involves traveling and going to a lot of parties and large social gatherings, and I meet a lot of people for very short periods of time before never seeing them again. At an average three day event weekend I hold hundreds of conversations with hundreds of people who are absolutely meaningless to me in the long run. This comes with the territory.

I first learned of this person who goes to some of the events I work through another friend who also barely knew them. A local celebrity of sorts...but a very minor one. Without giving away what they do, they have about 1k-7k followers depending on what platform you look at. Not too big a name to anyone not from the area. Everyone at these events knows them, but doesn’t KNOW them, that sort of thing. My friend hyped me up a bunch about this person, I think that’s what started this whole thing. They talked as if holding a conversation with this person was like meeting a real celebrity. I was intrigued, since I knew I worked the same events this person would be at, but I didn’t think much of it.

Flash forward a few months, I was working an event and I ran into them. We talked for about 15 minutes...shared interests, the fact that we both worked so closely with these events, that sort of thing. They ended up wandering off soon after, seeming incredibly busy with their own tasks at the event. I enjoyed the conversation, but again, thought very little of it. It seemed relatively pleasant.

A few months pass. We’re at another event together. They don’t really remember me from the previous event, and seem kind of put off by me. This person doesn’t really care for me or my sense of humor, I don’t really have a place in their clique or a place in their life beyond one conversation, oh darn, that’s how the job works.

I don’t know when it happened, but months after our last event together I got weirdly...obsessed with them. I don’t think I find them any more or less attractive than anyone else, I just got to this point where even so much as seeing a picture of them on my social media feed triggers this obsessive mindset. I know I only know the version of them they put out there at these events, but my short conversation with them struck me hard and all I can think about are the few things I know we have in common. I see myself with this person, I fantasize about having a life with them when I only know three things about them. I fantasize about them in general...something I never did with anyone before. I have no idea where this mindset came from, or what triggered it, but the intensity to which i fantasize about them is genuinely impacting my day to day life and keeping me from functioning.

I know it’s creepy. I know it’s weird. I know it makes no sense and I know if they even so much as remember me they most likely have a negative opinion of me...but I can’t make the thoughts go away. I know it’s illogical and stupid but I am having an incredibly difficult time not obsessing over this person I know next to nothing about and it’s killing me because I don’t WANT to think this way.

I wish I could’ve stayed by his coffin forever. I didn’t want him to go. I wasn’t ready even though everyone told me he was going to die it never sunk in.

154,"I ordered something for this individual and it was shipped by the company two days late. This means that it might not arrive before he has to move across the country for work. I told him the company would eat the shipping cost to send it to wherever he went, he just would get it a little bit later. 
Said individual has been at the company longer, but holds a junior title to mine since he hasn’t been a manager (for lack of a better term) for as long. He’s been a manager for about 3 years, I’ve been a manager for about 5 1/2. 
When i explained what happened, the challenge we now faced with trying to get the item to him before he left, and a possible solution to this problem (all while apologizing and trying to defuse the situation) he began to yell at me; actually raise his voice. He called me incompetent, told me how shitty a job I’m doing,  called me immature and lazy, and that everything he’s going through is my fault because of this one instance. 
Now I generally think that everyone deserves a mulligan. I’ve definitely said some dumb stuff when I’m annoyed or agitated, and i always try to go back and apologize once I’ve cooled down. 
That’s not the case with this individual. While I never thought that I would have to ‘pull rank’ on someone else in a management role, I also never thought that someone junior to me would actually decide to yell at me. 
I was taken aback at first, but I decided to let them yell for a minute before they stormed out. Many of my peers (same job ranking title) were in the office when this happened. One asked why i didn’t pull rank, one said don’t take it personally. 
The dilemma I’m facing is this. 
Should I not take it personally when someone junior to me raises their voice at me in front of my peers? Should I have pulled rank? Should i speak with them tomorrow before they move over the holiday weekend or just let it go and move on? 
It’s mostly hindsight now, but I know that now i am feeling i will never let that happen again and if it comes down to it i will pull rank if someone acts this way towards me again. Is this the correct way of thinking? 
I know not everyone will like me all the time but i do try and be a decent a human being to everyone and i always try my best to never be malicious or petty. 
Thanks in advance. I know it’s a long write up.

I’m a university student currently living with my dad and he is totally okay with my dog living here and actually loves him too. So my sister is going out of town for a week and doesn’t even ask us to watch her dog, she just assumes we will. So my dog is a lot smaller and older, and he recently have been having health issues like seizures and kidney problems. So of course I don’t want him to be more stressed out and potentially hurt because her dog has attacked my dog a couple times and really hurt him but it doesn’t matter to her because even after I explained to her that it’s not a good idea she said “oh well he’s coming and is going to stay there ”. So I talked to my dad and he also agrees with me not to bring her dog over and has talked to my narcissistic sister herself and said no and she doesn’t care, she’s still bringing her dog over because “dad didn’t say no, I said no” so it doesn’t count. How can someone be so entitled , cruel, and just crazy. This is not the first time she has done this, this has happened many times and I’ve objected but my dad has said to just brush it off and be the bigger person. Well I’m tired of being walked on. My dad has talked to her multiple times and was trying to convince him to watch her dog. So she agreed after hours and hours of bickering but I’m sure she will just show up with her dog anyways or find away around bring her dog over when we’re not around so we have no choice but to watch the dog. What do I do? How do I deal with someone like this?

156,"Often we would face some kind of dilemmas wherein other people (in most cases enemies/trolls) would churn out ""If you don't do X then you're Y"" assertions or challenges against you in an attempt to coerce you to do their bidding with your reputation/honor/face at stake.

I am definitely not some super weird/creepy person, I just am not social so in general, it is very difficult to meet new people. I have started changing this and have now had my first real opportunity in who knows how long, and I really want to make things work.

So the thing is I have known this girl for several months now and we talk quite a bit when we see each other. Often joking around and her telling me more and more about herself every time we do talk. I never asked for her number so the only time we talk is when I actually run into her. I actually really liked her at first but after talking, I thought she viewed me more as a friend then someone she is interested in so I kind of ignored those feelings even though every time we talked I felt more and more attracted to her. 

A few weeks ago, we go to a party together and she gets a bit drunk (though she definitely looked pretty sober and talked quite normally). She starts getting clingy to me and we danced together for most of the night.

Now I want to ask her out but I don't even know if she really does like me or if she just did what she did because she was partially drunk (she definitely wasn't like completely wasted as we were having normal conversations and she just seemed a bit giddy - I was pretty sober myself so I was quite aware).

159,"So there's this guy in my class, let's call him Mark.
Mark and I aren't very close, but he has a lot of friends in class. He's a very influential guy, mostly because he's a smooth talker. Mark can sell ice to an Eskimo.
Mark is fairly attractive, on the shorter side, but lean. 5'9"" 130lbs(60kg). His attitudes toward women are... chauvinistic. He believes in ""banging bitches"" until he's 30 and then settling down with a virgin. He has no qualms about lying, especially when it is to get someone into bed.

Mark and I are undergrad sophomores in India. We study in design school, so we sometimes have parties at night in the department. There's plenty of alcohol and people getting shitfaced. Mark is a teetotaler. 

However.

I've noticed for a while now, when girls are drunk, stoned or incapacitated in any way, he gets very touchy feely with them. Especially with the freshmen. As if this wasn't bad enough, most of these girls are in relationships. Some of these girls are my friends. Each incident is gross enough to make it uncomfortable to look at, but not so explicit that it can't be explained away as clueless friendliness. Over time, however, coupled with his personality and worldview, it suggests that he may be abusing these women.

I've spoken to some of our mutual friends, and they've noticed this pattern of behaviour as well.

I'm worried about escalation. If he's groping them today, how long before he starts molesting or worse, raping these women? Mark is very egotistical, and I'm afraid there's no one he trusts enough to listen to. He's very manipulative by nature, and rarely confides in anyone.

To make a long story short, I live, and have lived for all my life, in Eastern Kentucky, which might as well be called “Sit on Your Thumb and Twiddle Yourself-ville” because that’s all there is to do here. The place is dead and has no future as far as I can see.

As far as attempting to leave, that’s what I’ve been trying to do. My family’s monetary situation isn’t the best, which will come up shortly, and so I’ve been going to a small college about 45 minutes from my house for a degree in Pharmacy. However, it has become apparent that even going here is going to be impossible with my family’s situation, and even if I could continue to attend, I’ve come to the realization that I don’t enjoy the degree that I was going for and so I’ve wasted a year and a half of my life at a place I can no longer afford to go to for a degree that I don’t even want.

I’m stuck at home in a dying place where all the jobs are taken and there is no opportunity here, and I’m unwilling to put myself in unimaginable debt with more student loans to move to a different college just to even begin to know what I want to do with my life. 

I’ve considered being a police officer, which sounds more appealing to me than most things, as well as the military, but I’m fairly unsure of taking that route.

At first, me and my mother and sister where at a real nice hotel on some beautiful island and we were chilling in the pool. My family got out and went to their rooms while I stayed a little longer. A huge mistake.

A pretty shady guy came to me and told me about the dark zone. And I don't remember why, but somehow I ended up there. Imagine it like a small town. Except everything is pitch black, way darker than a normal night. And that was the case 24/7. The only light you would see would be few smartphones in the dark or some cars in the distance. Traffic lights were called by specific people, so that you know when tp cross the street. That alone was pretty creeping me out. Everything was silent in this dark zone, except the people. You could hear people nervously talking, whispering, laughing and whatnot so I began to run in desperation of leaving this nightmare of a realm. For some reason I saw my old teacher in the zone and before I could tip him on the shoulder and ask what the hell this is, I got the grabbed from behind, pulled to the ground and punched to the face from a guy with a purge mask before I woke up.

171,"Hi reddit,

I never really talked about this to anyone, but I guess I always wanted to hear someone else's opinion on this.

I'm 20, male, currently in college.
Before I start describing the title which isn't that descriptive (don't worry though it really isn't a big issue, just something that has been on my mind), I'd just like to preface with a quick TL;DR of my boring life to provide some kind of context.

First of all, while some people could think of ""having had a bad childhood"" could be a reason for what I'm about to describe, it couldn't be further from that. I grew up with my family in a nice area, am quite close with both my parents (before you ask why I then didn't talk to them about this: I'm a pretty emotionally closed off person in general. Don't like showing emotion.), and they seriously always gave and still give their everything for me and my future. My childhood/teenager years were super ""open"", I never really had any rules such as curfews or whatever, was free to do whatever I wanted, but I never abused that lack of rules either, although I do sometimes think that this has made me and my life really boring. In general I'd say that I grew up with honesty and similar as core values, at least I hope I did. I also never had trouble making friends, and while I'm not your super popular self-confident guy, I always had people to hang out with, and got along with literally everybody. I've never been bullied, never had a conflict, nothing. I've never had trouble with anything: not financially, thanks to my parents, not academically, nothing. In high school I didn't even care about romantic relationships so I didn't have any trouble there either.

Now onto my ""issue"": Since as far as I can remember, potentially since I was about 10 years old, I would get ""weird/dark"", random, thoughts when left alone with my thoughts, so mostly when going to sleep (I've always taken a long time to fall asleep, partly due to this). By dark/weird I mean that my brain starts imagining bad things happening (before you ask: I'm a really ""peaceful"" person. I'd never hurt anybody, never did, and hopefully never will. As far as I know I don't lack empathy either. Which makes these thoughts even more uncomfortable.). At first, and for most of my teenage years, this just applied to my brain making ""spin - offs / sequels"" to books or comics I read and films I watched, mostly. In these, my brain would make whoever I guess I considered to be the main characters go through a lot of trouble, harmful stuff, never quite to the point of killing them off, but getting close, whether it was to make them seem badass, attract others characters attention, or something else, I don't know. But that's basically the tldr of most of my earlier thoughts; I still remember for example that when I was about 10-11 I watched this animated tv show about these native american indians, and I do remember that I always continued the stories in my head, making the main character go through some kind of huge ordeal, get deadly sick on the way, and I never really got the stories to what happened after they healed from their sickness or injuries or whatever, it was always kind of stuck at that point, with small modifications on each ""run"" (remember that this is while I'm trying to sleep, so I'm not like a 100% awake and clear in my mind at that point), until I'd get another story to think about. 
The ""darkness"" of the thought got worse over time. Again, never to the point of death or permanent injury(I'd twist the story in some magical way that even some injury that should have meant certain death or whatever would not result in anything permanent) , but pretty darn close, and bloodier and bloodier, with more and more misery (I really don't know how I should describe this otherwise). The ""poor orphan trying to survive growing up in bloody warzones while losing everything and being betrayed by everyone"" kind of story if that makes sense. Besides these more or less dark thoughts, I also have a hard time controlling my brain in general when left alone - I might think about/see something in my head, completely random, and then start ""deforming"" it, and as soon as I have a ""deformed"" image in my head I tell myself to discard it, but that makes it come back even more. One small example of many could be that I, in some random chain of thoughts, think of a face of someone dear to me, and suddenly that face starts deforming (not even in a ""dark/bloody"" way, just like, growing longer/wider, amplified relief, teeth suddenly becoming enormous and pointy, just weird shit). Or if I ever heard/read something bad and remember it, or just have, again, a random thought of something bad (like, I don't know, a finger getting chopped off or something, I'd start thinking of that happening to myself and wouldn't be able to get it out of my head, as much as I tried. Now the last type of weird thought I've had since a long time, and the least weird, are ""loops"" where I just get stuck on one sentence or idea that has been running through my mind and I'm like ""alright, go on, next thought please"", it just keeps looping and looping through my head. This happens to the most random stuff - say I'm in a car, for some reason I'm digging my head for some vocab or something, and one random word just happens to get stuck and literally loops in my thoughts for a long period of time. 

I never really worried about this, and still don't really, but as said earlier over time these thoughts kept getting worse. Now, these thoughts apply more and more to myself. I don't have a particular story - I just think of myself walking through the city at night, suddenly getting stabbed, shot, kidnapped, whatever you can imagine (again, the most random stuff - sometimes I just have an image of myself being impaled by a spear flash through my head really quickly and then disappears, or it just stays there for a while). And same as above, always in a way that I miraculously survive and don't have any permanent damage to any of my organs or anything. But still in a... Painful way. 
Always when I'm going to bed, trying to sleep. And while I consciously obviously don't want these thoughts, I have a hunch that I might be seeking them out unconsciously, trying to continue this macabre mind story. 

Anyway, that's it. Pretty lengthy description of a small problem that doesn't affect anything of my real life besides giving me lack of sleep, sorry for that. 

I'm just not sure why I keep having these thoughts. Am I ""projecting"" some issues I'm not aware of? Do I lack that much self-confidence, and am trying to seek attention or some shit like that? None of the thoughts I come up with are flatteting, obviously, but I'd really appreciate some advice on how to deal with them.

And no, I will not talk to anybody in real life about this. Not my family, not my friends, not a doctor nor a therapist. ",21Nov2018,1
172,"So I tried typing everything out, but it's just too long of a read so I decided to give the short version and answer any questions that may arise.

Basically, my wife of 5 years, who I share two toddlers with, cheated on me multiple times and the last time I decided I'm done. Our relationship wasn't perfect obviously but it worked. I didn't put in as much effort as I should've, but I held on to the cheating really hard and it was difficult for me to show her affection. For the most part she was a great stay at home wife. Every night I came home to a clean house, dinner waiting for me, happy kids, everything looked perfect. I ended up developing a crush on a married coworker, but it never amounted to anything other than flirting and sharing personal details of our lives. My wife ends up getting caught trying to cheat on me again (while drunk) with another one of my coworkers. I decided I'm done and told her to leave. She goes to her mom's house with the kids. When she left I told my coworker how I felt, had to get it off my chest, and to my surprise the feeling is mutual. Turns out her marriage is even more fucked up than mine. We sneak around for a couple months and end up falling in love. We both tell our spouses we want divorces. 4 months later to now: my wife and I live 5 hours apart, and the kids have been going back and forth every month. My coworker is now my girlfriend who lives with me, and things have slowly started to become not so perfect. I found out she was still fucking her husband behind my back. She doesn't really seem to be head over heels in love with me like I blindly believed, although she says she is. I honestly am in love with her and care about her and her son very much. All the while my wife has cleaned up her act, gotten a job, got off the alcohol and medications, and still wants me back. She tells me she's changed and I honestly believe it. My girlfriend has her court date for her divorce coming up soon and I still haven't filed. Here's where my problem lies: I don't know if I should stay with this girl as planned, or call it quits and get back with my wife. I've been thinking about my wife a lot and how much I miss her lately, and it's fucking with my head daily. But I feel so bad for my girlfriend bc we have a pretty good thing and I know she does love me. I don't know what to do.

173,"Hey Reddit, I don’t know whether I should give up on a job that I applied for and need some advice...

So 3 months ago I moved across Europe for my job, but coincidently a new position opened up in another department that I really want to work in. I applied and after two rounds of interviews and two psychometric tests I still haven’t heard anything definitive either way. (One of the interviews was on the day of my leaving party so I had to miss my party which really sucks!)

The manager of the department sits opposite me in our office and so I know that she has hired two new people since I was interviewed so I’ve been assuming I haven’t got the job. 

I’ve emailed the manager a few times asking if I definitely haven’t got the job but I keep getting a very short response of “you are on a waiting list until you hear otherwise”. There’s no reasoning or reassurance in the emails and to be honest I feel a bit angry in her lack of clarity. 

I don’t want to ask her directly whilst in the office as my current manager sits next to her and I don’t want to impact my current role. We don’t have any private rooms where it wouldn’t be obvious that I’m talking to her about a job. 

So should I just give up on this new job? Does it sound like the new manager might be making a job for me, or could I just be held in reserve whilst another candidate negotiates a salary. 

Has anyone heard of this before? The company is Danish so could this be a cultural thing? Any advice here would be appreciated. ",21Nov2018,1
174,"I have a lot of kinks and many of them are based on degrading and masochistic fantasies. After thinking I was asexual for many years, I found out it was my avoiding anything remotely pornographic which suppressed my sexuality. Once I became exposed to more and more, I picked up almost every kink I saw. I’m not into anything typically ridiculed by reddit, such as feet or vore, but I became a hardcore sub. I am horny more often than anyone I have ever met and am legitimately scared of potential bfs or gfs abusing their power as the dominant in our relationship. I sometimes wish I could revert back to not having sexual thoughts. I feel like I couldn’t be attracted to someone who wasn’t into the same things as I am. Do you think this side of me is something I should fix or embrace? How can I work towards this? Is feeling horny 80 - 90% of the time normal?",21Nov2018,1
175,"We have these wonderful ""friends"" that were formerly our neighbours. They've fallen a bit on hard times, as their car broke down, and due to violating health codes and an unruly roommate, they were unable to resign their lease. Thus, they've been forced to stay at a hotel until a new place takes them.

We've been assisting them with occasional food and a little money, but mostly rides. However, lately they've become incredibly needy/dependent and have been stressing us out to the point of exhaustion and putting a lot of stress on our gas budget.

Some of our friends think they're taking advantage of us and that we should drop them and let them figure it out, but we don't think they're bad people. We're just tired of being stressed on their behalf.

176,"So, this year, man oh man *chuckles* been fun eh? Yeah, total sarcasm. Well here’s the thing, obviously, it wasn’t that great for me and I went through things that I don’t think I’m completely over. Meaning, I think there’s still things that trigger me, make me rethink my past and immediately want to shut down or like turn my mind black because I shudder and am like “oh no just no” .. and you know being to healthily accept your past well I don’t think that’s on the list. I know, you don’t have to bring up your past every time but I also know that when I think about mine or think of the people in it that were damaged/caused me damaged, I just break down, my heart starts racing, and the thoughts of guilt, stupidness, stress, fall down all on my shoulder like if I was reliving it. I wish I could get a therapist, at least a cheap one but right now I don’t think that’s an option.. and so well, i know I can’t force recovery but I want to be able to enjoy myself without thinking About the past, for example: my brother wants to get high with me and yeah I could be happy as fuck about it because we get along but 5 months ago we weren’t on speaking terms for a whole year, that means everything shitty I went through he wasn’t even a person I could reach out to because of what was going on with me (My whole family actually but he completely cut me off, I was invisible to him) so, I can’t help but think “Wow there was a time I didn’t have you at all and we’re bonding again like old times before everything happened” and then the tears start to flow, and everything else too. I really want to stop doing that because I feel like I can’t enjoy the moment itself without it triggering me and start feeling all those things again. It makes me nostalgic, sad, anxious and guilty when all we would want is a good time. This not just happens with my brother, because it happens with my parents, cousin, close friends, I feel like I can’t move past it completely and I don’t want to ruin present new good moments with the bad memories.

He first saw this girl about 8 years ago and he is still in love with her. He just had two encounters  but didn't really have conversations.

He sent her a friend request on facebook 3 years ago and she rejected him and he sent another one and then after that he couldn't send again because she blocked it or something like that.

He got to know about her through a guy friend of his because that guy's cousin were friends with her.

The one time he could really talk to her was when he coincidentally bumped onto her in a cafe. She was there with her girlfriends and she stood up to order a drink from the cashier and he was also standing there but when she got next to him, waiting to make her order after him, he was awkwardly looking everywhere around but her eyes. He couldn't make eye contact because that day he was with a friend of his and a girl that his friend was introducing him to and trying to make them get together. He had a lot of short-term relationships with a lot of girls without strong feelings for them because when he would get thoughts about ""The girl"" he would dump them.

About their age gap he is 24 and she is 18

Now he is in the army and she is studying abroad.

He wants some advice on how to possibly win that girl.

179,"Exactly 27 days ago I met a woman online from a little town in Texas. She is everything I've desired in a woman: intelligent, kind, honest, and very beautiful. We talked every day, almost non-stop, and she told me she likes me too, she calls me her ""prince"". She had gotten out of a divorce about 5 months ago, and just recently told me that at her new job she's just started, she wanted to go see this guy from work to have sex, as a purely physical thing. At that point, she told me that she was gonna go do it regardless of my choice considering that I am in another country, and she's saving up to move. Since we haven't ever even met before, I was hesitant to argue but still it gnawed at me, knowing that someone else's hands were on someone I liked. It felt like I was somehow being cuckolded, even though we haven't been together that long. I think the reason for that is because of the regular connection we had every day this month, as well as the fact that we have so much in common personality-wise that it almost feels like I've known her for so much longer. At the beginning we used to call every day, and we even promised to at the very least say good morning/good night to each other, in case we were busy.

Nevertheless, she started work (night shifts), and to be fair I was actually quite proud she stepped up to save after the divorce considering she doesn't have much money up, so I loved her more for it. Then she tells me yesterday out of nowhere, after a couple hour dry spell that she fucked the guy, except once they fucked the guy told her he was married. So she refused to carry on, BUT she told me that if he wasn't married she'd go with him. At this point I started having conflicting feelings: who does she like, me, him? Obviously this guy didn't work out but another guy will eventually come and she'd probably want to fuck. I don't like the feeling that she's open to having sex with other guys whilst her wanting to maintain a close relationship with me at this stage. Then again she'd been married since 18 and only ever been with one guy, her ex husband who had since cheated on her (the irony), which is why they're divorced.

Anyway ever since the night shifts started, she's been distant. I've been patient (or impatient considering the time frame we've been talking for), even though I haven't said anything untoward/bad towards her. I haven't heard her voice in about a week, and basically I just wanted to know how I should deal with my feelings right now. It seems like I'm overplaying this situation in my head and I can't stop thinking about her. In my head I want to go there with the money I've saved up and bring her to London so I can finally know exactly what she's like as a person. But also I feel like it may just be a waste and the feelings I have are more of infatuation rather than love. I've felt like this about a person only once before: an ex that I was with for 2 years before she had to move to another country, so we broke up. She was the first person I'd ever had a burning desire for, and our breakup was out of necessity, not because we didn't love each other (she was abused by her family so we arranged to move her to another country to stay with her close guardian there, to keep her safe because I couldn't take care of her at the time). It's almost like a feeling like I can't breath, deep in my chest. I'm not sad, I just can't stop thinking about her. I want the feeling to go away because I need clarity, it feels like I'm looking through all this with foggy lenses.

So all in all, after reading all that just tell me the hard truth, logically, how, given all the circumstances should I feel for a woman like this, and how should I manage my feelings now?",21Nov2018,1

I think this is all because one time in High School I got really anxious and I read on google on how to breathe and I started to read things that people breathe and i should use my stomach and since then I'm constantly aware of my breathing and that I'm doing damage to myself or I'm not breathing optimally.",21Nov2018,1

He is interested in meeting me irl but I am not ready for that stage yet so we are still talking online. Honestly, we barely know each other at this point. We are still chatting and getting to know each other yet he seems to want to get to know me really quickly.

The thing is if I do meet him irl, I don't know if I will be doxxed or judged based on my internet history. It appears that some people there have recognised me posting with different accounts and have pointed that out to a guy. With my other accounts, I was asking if social classes are really such barriers in relationships, how my parents don't want me to date someone from another social class, and how I struggle to find love. I have included some personal stuff on family and stuff. I guess I was being a devil's advocate. I guess I changed some stuff when asking questions under a different name but I guess it had the same style of writing.

I find this all quite embarrassing. I am not sure if I want a guy I just met to know I've posted that as it includes stuff about my own family. I also realise that meeting him irl means revealing my identity and I guess I don't want to be doxxed. Am I worrying too much?

185,"*Posted this earlier, but I want to rephrase myself after browsing this sub, and giving some of my own advice.*

&amp;#x200B;

My life-long friend is extremely uncomfortable around gay/bi people due to a trauma he went through at a young age,  he can't help it. I can't get talk too much about it, just to ensure his privacy, and the heavy weight on the subject. He is my only true friend, and I comfort him as much as I can in his time of need. He is also there for me in my roughest times; we practically see each-other as supportive big brothers despite being the same age. I can't say the same about him, but he is the **only** person I feel comfortable talking to.

After 17 years, It hurts so much that I can't tell him that I'm bisexual without making him feel betrayed, uncomfortable and the whole works. I'm so conflicted on what to do. At this point, I don't even care about the social whiplash in my school, (it's fairly divided politically), I just don't want to feel this inner turmoil anymore, without losing my friend. There really is no one in my life who has as much of a bond that I have with him; no supportive family, no other true friends, more or less acquaintances.

So I'm looking for advice on what to do when I happen to come out, how to handle the social impacts, or really any advice will help. ",21Nov2018,1

187,"Ok so I am going through a divorce. Neither of us have formally filed but I have left the home and undergone a large scale relocation with our two children. I moved to where my family is and to where his family is close. Our children are three years old and almost one year old. 

Last week he tells me he’s coming home for the holidays and and picking up our kids to take them to HIS family’s home for six days. He didn’t ask what I think or take my thoughts into consideration... he just basically lets me know. I didn’t resist because my divorce lawyer advised me to get out of town while I was still legally allowed to take my children anywhere and I didn’t want to trigger him into filing. Anyway, I told him tonight that I don’t want him taking our kids for that long because they are too young to be away from their mother. He responded by telling me I don’t have a say in the matter and they need their father just as much. 

What pisses me off is that his mom and her siblings have big plans. Her siblings are coming from out of town to be with my kids for these days. By the way, her siblings have never met my kids. I feel like they should know better than to make holiday and travel plans based on my babies being there. I get the importance of family and I want my kids’ father to have time with them too. However, one is still a baby and he won’t understand why mommy isn’t around. He still needs me. They both do. They have never been apart from me and I think to take them away for six days is too long. 

Am I wrong? Should I let them go with the other side of the family? I honestly don’t know if my mind can be changed but it would be nice to hear fro the other side of the aisle.

I then thought ive never seen a video of her so then i asked for that and she sent a video through snap so i was starting to think she might be real at this point and now she wants to meet up to hookup i live about 6 hours from her flight wise and i was just wondering if i am being to paranoid so if there is anything else you guys could think of for redflags or any advice you have would be greatly appreciated.

191,"I am newly married and having an issue regarding holidays with my husband's family. I had a large family that I had to completely disown as a teenager due to abuse. I was pretty much on my own until I met my husband.

Now, years later, I get extremely depressed on the holidays. For a long time, they made me feel suicidal. I spoke with a therapist, who helped me realize that I had better options. I started doing fun things, visiting other cities and camping instead of staying at home being sad.

My husband comes from a large and loving family, with tons of traditions. They have been very welcoming to me, but I don't really feel like they're my family. It's very awkward and I'm always counting down the seconds until I can leave. They have a big party for every major holiday, and we're expected to attend. My husband wants to see his family, and I'm okay going sometimes, but for the holidays that make me the saddest, like Thanksgiving or Christmas, I just want to be alone and distract myself. The last thing I want to do is to be around someone else's big, happy family, and feel like I don't belong. Ideally and realistically, my husband will go to his family's house to celebrate, I will go do something else, and we'll meet up afterwards to talk about our experiences and share some leftovers. My husband is also okay with this. The problem? His family isn't.

Last year, he was uninvited from their Thanksgiving celebration because I had mentioned having other plans for just myself. They said they didn't want to separate us and wouldn't take no for an answer. We were stuck. I cancelled my plans because I wasn't going to leave my husband home alone, and we were both just kind of miserable, and I was so depressed and guilty that I couldn't stop crying.

I feel like my only options are to push my feelings down and spend the holidays with my in-laws, even when I'm feeling sad and suicidal, or to not see them on the holidays, which means that my husband can't see his family either, apparently. I was okay with my original plan, but I feel like they took that option away from me. They will not understand if I explain my reasoning behind wanting to be alone for the holidays.

Is there anything here I'm not seeing? Are there any other solutions?

I'm not worried about the whole 'don't buy her expensive things because it might not work out' thing; we've been together many years and are pretty deep into a relationship. She already has a PS4; it's one of the 1st gens and it's not in great shape. It used to be mine but I got a new one last Black Friday so I gave my old one to her. Her stepdad took it apart one day to clean it (voided warranty) and ruined one thing for sure: the wireless connection to controllers is horrible. You have to be right in front of PS4 for it to work. You can use wired connection since I got her the pro controller, but it's still inconvenient, especially since she loses her cords constantly. Another thing that he might not have caused, just from it being early version: the WiFi on it is pretty bad from her room. It's hard to explain, but basically they have a WiFi extender and her PS4 won't pick up its signal for some reason and mine will. Connecting to original WiFi source is very VERY slow. Unplayable. Ethernet isn't an option. Lastly, 1tb hdd is big step up from her 500gb since she downloads all games. 

Also, she isn't into the Spiderman game (I have it, she played and didn't enjoy it) so that isn't exactly a deciding factor for me. 

It won't exactly break the bank for me, but it's still $200 for something she already has (though still in bad condition). 


tl;dr 

Girlfriend has my hand-me-down 1st Gen 500gb PS4. The wireless controller connectivity is garbage (must be right beside PS4 for it to work) although can use wired connection. WiFi is horrible from her room but not on my PS4 (so I figure newer PS4 = better internet connection). Lastly, going from 500gb to 1tb hdd. Won't break bank, but it's $200 for something she already has, just not in garbage condition. Also, Spiderman is probably gonna be given away.",21Nov2018,1

Well, me being me, all paranoid and sad, I head over to her Instagram and our pictures aren't there anymore. My heart sank quite a bit.

I understand that with most relationships this is normal, but I don't know. I kinda feel betrayed since she said she would keep them up. 

Sorry if this is a weird or random post, but I just need to get my thoughts out. I've never been in love with such a person before and then have it not be obtainable anymore. Is the friendship healthy? I usually find it still fun, but I guess I do feel like I'm trying to grasp onto something that I just can't have anymore.

I know that part of it too was probably that I wasn't giving her the attention and care she deserved.

I don't know. I miss her more than ever and I want to do everything for her right now. ",21Nov2018,1

208,"Some backstory:
I'm a 19 y/o Male. Since I was young (about 12) I knew I was gay. I'm still closeted. I've developed a pretty serious case of depression over the years although I haven't gone to seek professional help. It's becoming a lot for me. And I've been having panic attacks once in a while

I feel like I haven't been a very good friend because of all my personal stuff I've got going on. I mean I dont even like my self most of the time but I try to put all that aside and be the best friend I can be when I'm around my buddies.  

But most of this depression doesnt come from me being scared to come out...its because I've developed pretty strong feelings for a good friend of mine I've known for years. Hes straight though and in a relationship currently.

I haven't talked about any of this to any one I know. But I'm at a point where it's becoming too much for me.
I'm thinking about talking to him soon. At least about  my mental issues I've been having. Idk if I'm ready to come out to him or any one else yet. But I think if I can start with something like my depression and panic attacks then ill feel more comfortable for when I'm really 'ready' to come out. 

Honestly, idk what kind of advice I'm looking for. Just anything really. 

Like When I'm ready to come out, should I tell him about my feelings for him? Or keep that part to myself?

I'm not very emotionally stable lately lol so what would make it easier for me to talk about any of this?
I could text him but I know I should do it in person. I just dont know if I can keep myself together haha. 

I apologize for the rant, and I hope this sort of makes sense (it's been a bad night and I've had some drinks :/) 

I'm just looking for any sort of advice. I love this guy but I dont know what I'm going to do. It hurts. 

If you guys have any questions I'll try to answer asap. Thanks :)

Hello I’m a 17 M. 

the last couple of weeks my brothers mental health has gone down hill. he is shutting me and my parents out so we had no clue why he is so depressed. but the last couple of days it has become worse, he will not eat dinner with us and he spends all his time in his room. my father didn't make the situation easier because he broke one of his miniature statues while cleaning his room. 

yesterday he broke down and threatened to kill himself. he walked to the train tracks and was thinking about jumping in front of a train, he did not do it because I think he was to scared to do it. than he walked home and he got in a fight with my mom and my dad. my mom and dad where trying to convince him that if he kills himself that its really over and that it will make them very sad. he calmed down a bit and went to bed.

   
 

my only concern is that something will happen that pushes him over the line. I know my brother he is not doing this for attention and that he really needs help. the only problem with that is that he doesn't want professional help, he is 19 so we cannot force him to get help.

   
 

what is the best thing me and my parents can do for him in this situation? ",21Nov2018,1
211,"Trying to not make this a wall of text-

My sister and I have had a rocky relationship in the past, but for the last 10 years it has been quite good (we are in our 30s). She came in town and stayed at my house and we had a nice time.

Just before she got in town I got in a major car wreck, have a concussion, and am heavily medicated,

We went out to dinner with our family last night, and everyone was having a nice time, though at one point my father let me know I was being too loud (understanding it was due to the medication).

My sister offered me a ride home. On the ride, she berated me for my behavior, told me I was totally wrong, and when I asked for a chance to give my perspective she flatly refused. I said I would like to get out of the car, as this does not seem fair to me, and she pulled over and sped off. This was 3 miles from my house, While I am on concussion protocol. While on heavy medication. In the rain. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have let my family know this has happened, and they are currently trying to figure out a solution so that we can both attend Thanksgiving. Honestly, this is among the most thoughtless things that has ever happened to me, and I feel very sad about it. I am not sure how I should be handling it- but I am 100% sure I will not simply accept a half assed apology. Those 3 miles in the rain while medicated and without my brain right was.... an exceptionally awful experience in my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading, and I appreciate any advice as I figure out how to manage this family dynamic going forward, especially with a 4 person thanksgiving 2 days away, that I honestly may not attend purely to avoid her. ",21Nov2018,1
212,"Hello. I'm a teenager living in Norway. I'm generally a happy and curious person, asking many questions to everything in life and thinking a lot. I would not consider myself an unstable person in any way. Though, there are sometimes I'm wondering about what's good for me and not.

The other day, I found a really weird connection. I'm a math and science person. I love the subjects that has anything to do with logic and numbers. In the last years, I've gradually started to like it more and more. Now, the connection I found the other day is that the more lonely or sad I get, the more math and science I do. This seems like I'm just pulling together two random things out of my ass, but here's the case. Whenever I get sad, lonely or so, I tend to do a lot of math and science compared to the times where I'm not. I used to think that ""Yeah, it's probably just because I need to think about something else for a while"", but that might not be the entire case. Whenever I feel
sad or lonely, I feel worthless. I feel like people don't like me as a person, I shouldn't assume they do, and I should just keep thoughts to myself. This doesn't sound good right? Neither I think so, but I don't really care about it since it usually goes away whenever I'm not sad again.

But here's the thing. I suspect that the reason I'm doing math whenever I'm sad is because there's a subcounsious reasoning. It goes somewhat like this: people don't like me as a person. I shouldn't assume they do either. My opinions aren't worth anything and no one cares. But whether or not people like my guts, people sure do like people's products/work. I don't need people to like me as long as I'm good at producing something/working. And if people don't like me, subjective work would be bad, so let's go study something that's objectively right and make it so that no one needs to like me, as long as they like what I produce."" This theory also fits with the fact that my social life has
gone really down by the years passing, thus my love for logic and science and anything that includes objectively right answers went up. Is this specific train of thoughts known well? I've never heard of it before.

I also want to admit that I'm really fragile when it comes to why I'm sad. I always overthink stuff. A person telling me to shut up on a bad day, especially people I don't know so well, can end up with me thinking that the person hates me beyond means, and of course that makes me sad.

Here's my concern: If I go study math or science, I'm afraid that I will end up realizing the production idea that I explained over. I'm not even sure if this reasoning is there or not (I usually don't think these thoughts loud in my head. If i follow this reasoning, it's subcounscious somehow), If this reasoning isn't something that I just make up, wouldn't I just make matters worse by studying math or science? It would by no means help me get better at being social, it wouldn't make me less fragile and I don't really know about how that would end up. I can't really put it into words, but it's sounds like it's pointing straight at some kind of spiral that just goes deeper and deeper. Just to connect some other lines too, I might be a bit generalizing and say that some of the reason as to my bad social life might be just because I'm a curious person and likes to ask many questions. I can easily see that from another persons viewpoint I might be really exhausting to talk with. The norm is to talk about politics, last night's football game, whatever's trending on social media or the news which doesn't interest me at all. It's just the same stuff over and over again in a loop that I've heard many times before in different shapes and variants.

Does anyone have any experience like this? What do you suppose I should do?

219,"I’m 21, and I’m technically a college “drop out”. I had a really bad year last year mentally (I stopped going to classes, showering, eating consistently, leaving my apartment, etc. and everything just fell apart academically for me. I got suspended spring of this year, and although it was hard for me to do, I accepted responsibility for my actions that led up to it. This past year has had a couple of mishaps but overall I was able to recover and improve a lot mentally. The issues kind of started again this past fall semester; I was able to return to...well..register for college but I couldn’t afford the tuition so i had to drop my classes. It took a toll on me but again, I was able to accept fault in everything from last year and continue working/supporting myself. I even took up a job on my former campus to help motivate me even more. Well, this past month I’ve been trying to work out how I’d do everything next year. Am I going back to school? If so how will I pay for it (my FA was suspended as well)....Where will I work? Could I handle the possibility that I wouldn’t be returning this coming year? Well, the answer to the last question is no. I’ve been slowly having a mental breakdown over this past week...trying to mentally prepare myself for yet another year of not being able to work towards my degree. Today everything came to a head. My mom and I finally had a talk about everything and it led to me having the worst panic attack I’ve ever had in my entire life. It scared my mom because she’d never seen me have one before, and during it I was shaking uncontrollably/struggling to breathe, crying, hitting myself in the head and pulling my hair just to try and shake the anxiousness off (which is something I’d never done). And it lasted a couple of minutes apparently but it felt like forever to me. I was shocked at how terrible and exhausted I felt after it. My eye sockets were hurting from the pressure I was putting on them. I’m scared that this is a sign that things could get bad again. I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and I don’t want to self-diagnose, but this feels like more than that to me now. The people around me have noticed a slight shift in my personality in recent weeks as well, but I felt decent through all of it. I don’t know what to do.

I haven't even talked about it with my mom. She thinks school is going great and I'll get my Abitur easily. So im basically wasting my time in school.

My sister got her abi as one of the 10 best in her grade and city. I could never meet that expectation. My brother and sister both work, both have partners and both have a flat. Im simply to dumb and lazy to achieve anything in this life.

Also my parents have been divorced since I was 7 or 8 (Im 17 now) so I never had a father figure. I don't know how to act around someone I have feelings for. Or better yet, I know how, but only trough countless posts I already did on this subreddit. Also my father won't give me his okay for having an own account so I can't make one until October 19 when I turn 18. My family is not poor, but we're not living in luxury and I rarely have any money for stuff. I don't have time atm to work either since I do 2 lessons of private tutoring and one lesson of mentoring a week, I also need to study for exams and shit.

I have social anxiety and slight depression. And I have a feeling that the depression is coming back. I legit only have 2 friends I can count on, the rest is just in my course and dont mind me.

And then theres a girl who I really really like, I think she likes me back, maybe even in a romantic way, but she either has problem's expressing that or she just fucks with me. And if I drop out of school now I probably won't see her that often again and were also both in a voluntary mentoring program which you can't simply quit. Im just too far in.

233,"Sorry for the wall of text, but the story is fairly long and requires some background knowledge to understand it. As per reddit rules, this is a throwaway since my friends know my account and I'd prefer to not fuel the already spreading rumors.

So as background to this story, it's important to understand what my [18M] last relationship was like. 

We met in our freshman year of high school and dated for around 2 years in total on-and-off. The relationship itself was fairly toxic and it was in both of our beat interests that it would end, but neither of us had the guts to finally end it until the end of junior year. We had been sexually active up until that point and (while it is extremely stupid in hindsight) we barely ever used protection and instead opted to rely on her birth control to avoid an unwanted pregnancy. Ultimately though, the worst came to be and she became pregnant a few months before we left school for our junior-year summer break. She never told me and instead kept it a secret until she miscarried around 1 month in.

I was only told about the miscarriage a few months after she broke up with me, and she never came to me for support during or after her experience. While I certainly did not want to take care of a baby while in high school, I didn't want for her to have to suffer through the mental and emotional strain of losing a baby either. So when she eventually told me, I tried to comfort her emotionally in any way that I could, even though at that point we had already separated. The miscarriage was also a huge strain on my personal mental health as I was very attached to this girl at this point and I felt helpless to emotionally support her or myself after the miscarraige. Understandably though she didn't want to come back to me for emotional supprt after what had transgressed. Thankfully, she found a new boyfriend who is extremely supportive of her and seems to keep her mentally and emotionally healthy. From what she told me though, she never told him, nor anyone else, that she became pregnant. It was a secret kept between just us. At least up until the end of our senior year.

After we got back into school after summer ended, I started making new friends. One of these friends, (we'll call her L), I became pretty close with. We were strictly mutual friends, but we shared a lot of our emotional baggage with each other. The events of the prior year had been weighing on my conscious for awhile and without someone to talk to about it other than my ex, I was desperate for someone to help me cope with my end of it. Making yet another poor choice, I decided to ask L about what she thought of the whole situation. She tried to help explain her opinion on the matter and give me emotional comfort to assist in my closure on the loss. We were close friends for awhile until she got a boyfriend and began drifting away. Our friendship eventually came to an end after she chose to put more effort into her relationship than our friendship.

L was known for being a part of drama and *surprise* she let loose my secret to some of her friends. Through the grapevine of high school students, it quickly gained momentum until the drama returned to me. Through my ex.

Just yesterday, I received a text from my ex (who I hadn't spoken to in 2 months) saying that L spread a rumor that she aborted the baby. To clarify, I never told L that my ex had aborted. I told her that she miscarried and that the loss greatly impacted both her and mine own mental health. Through a brief conversation with my ex, it became clear that L bad let it slip to her boyfriend who then told some of his friends and so on.

The miscarriage was a very tightly held secret up until now. Only me, my ex, and L had knowledge of it. I am applying to universities right now and in half a year I will be leaving this town and hopefully never seeing any of these high school peers ever again. However as of now, I'm stuck in a place where my cat was let out of the bag. I'm worried that as worse spreads either the reputation of my ex will be tarnished, or that I will be painted as an asshole ex-boyfriend by the rest of the school. None of my friends have brought up the drama to me yet, and no one has asked for clarification so I am worried that they are believing the rumors that my ex had an abortion.

Is there anything that I can do about L spreading the false rumors? Or anything that I can try to do to help save my ex's or mine own reputations?

And before you comment saying ""you've already done enough"", I know that I have. My poor decisions directly led to this situation, but I'm not the only one suffering on their behalf. I don't want for my teachers (if they catch wind of it) to change their opinions of my ex or me, and I especially don't want my teacher recommenders to change their thoughts before they write either of our university recommendation letters.",21Nov2018,1
234,"I’m stuck between letting him work it out or not. He’s been getting into arguments more and has had a lot of social troubles recently (things with his parents and friends outside his inner circle). I’m not sure if these intertwine with each other or not. But I believe they relate to each other, especially since this has happened right after he’s started watching him. He’s also mentioned other people of the same genre, only more extreme, which he seems to enjoy, (don’t know any names off the top of my head except this blonde girl and a guy called Gavin M’Gillis). He’s also (recently) started using words and such from these videos. After he got in an argument with his parents he was upset because he was just “speaking his mind” in a household he knows it very controlling. Which could be normal but he knows his place and disagrees with his mother a lot, but the trivial thing that started the argument seemed like nothing and he isn’t usually one to lose his temper, especially with people he cares about.

I am his closest friend, but I personally disagree with what Ben does and don’t think the impression he gives off is healthy.

I'm not appreciated and they make that known,I don't get shit unless I'm walking with rags on,mind you they can afford to buy a $350 laptop,my Dad is a real piece of shit,I get angry just thinking about him and I'd love to just sock him in the face,he beats me for everything even if I'm right,he thinks he's perfect and that I can't tell him shit,just a few weeks ago he actually tried to kill me,the name calling is ridiculous(faggot, low life,etc)I've considered just killing myself just to end it,if I keep dealing with this I might kill one of them or myself because I can't cope much longer.

I just want to get my life together but I can't because they're so manipulative,seeing my siblings getting treated better than me boils my blood,my mother admitted with glee how much I'll fail and that I'm the black sheep.

What the fuck have I done to deserve this,why can't I be happy? 
I'm like a bird without wings and I'm scared of what might happen from this
,I can't just leave as I'll be homeless,but that's an option I'm willing to take because it's obvious that I'm just their slave smh

236,"I need some advice.  I am so outraged, so livid, that I actually have been spluttering when trying to talk about it.

My little brother died Saturday after a 3 year battle with cancer.

TL;DR:  My brother (and I) hate(d) religion, and his burial ceremony is to be conducted in the Roman Catholic tradition because our mother ""found"" god in the last half decade.  I feel this is an incredible disrespect to his memory.  I will be unable to be a pallbearer unless I participate in the Mass.

Atheists, do *not* downvote those whom are religious.  Religious types, return the favor please, and do not downvote those opinions you disagree with.  Be civil.

Details:

He was exceedingly anti-religious throughout his life.  Not militantly atheist, where he wanted to tear down all religions and etc, but actively detested religion broadly because of the thought control and hypocrisy of it.

He hated how religion preached peace... *except kill all who do not believe the correct way.*

 He hated how religion preached understanding...  *unless someone thought differently*

He hated how religion preached love... *unless you didn't bow down, and then eternal torment*.

He hated how religion always seemed to act exactly like the leaders of North Korea... act like you love me, do what I say, or forever be imprisoned and tortured.

He hated how religion said one could rape, murder, destroy lives... *but as long as you said sorry at some point it was all good*.

He hated how religious ""leaders"" could molest children, but it was all good because they spoke for the ""invisible sky wizard"".

And yet if you lived your life being the most generous, loving, giving person to the point of sacrificing yourself for the betterment of others... you were still allegedly going to be tortured for eternity simply because you did such things because they are the way any of us should be, instead of because Bugs Bunny said we should, and needs must worship Daffy Duck.

My little brother, my best friend throughout my life, the person I have fought beside against the world of both far-right and far-left racism, idiocy, hypocrisy, and hate...

...is to be buried in a Roman Catholic Mass/ceremony, because our mother.  A mother that until 5 years or so was non-religious (not anti, like Brother and I, but scoffed at it) until she moved to Oregon where her sister lives (and whose son is a Roman Catholic Father/priest).

So, the advice I need:

As mentioned... I am outraged and very, very, very, *very*, *VERY* appalled and angry.  I feel that this is an extreme insult to my brother's memory.

I will conduct myself with utmost propriety, despite my inclinations to shout out how much my brother would hate what is going on ""in his honor"".  Heck, if there is ever to be a zombie uprising, this would set it off... as Brother would burst out if his casket if he could.

I will be approached by my mother and asked if I have ""calmed down""/accepted Jesus Christ since being notified that Brother will be laid to rest with full Roman Catholic ceremony.

I plan on asking her if *she* would have ""calmed down"" and accepted Muhammed if Aunt Gail (my aunt, her sister) was buried in the Muslim faith. 

I don't want this to be a shitshow.  The only person I have ever unconditionally loved -and who unconditionally loved me back- is dead.

I do not want to profane his memory... and yet, the very ""ceremony"" for his funeral is exactly that.

I think I will just *seethe*, and go along with it.  Any sort of confrontation would be worse.

I live in germany (have since I was born) I got a somewhat good degree (MSA here in germany next best, and generally best would be the Abitur which is comparable to a levels) and I could either start looking for a job education or stay in school to get my Abitur. Im almost one year into ""Oberstufe"" (college) ony my way to Abitur and I have only okay grades, And I really put in 100% for the grades I have. I don't think I'll be able to get my degree. I haven't even talked about it with my mom. She thinks school is going great and I'll get my Abitur easily. So im basically wasting my time in school.

My sister got her abi as one of the 10 best in her grade and city. I could never meet that expectation. My brother and sister both work, both have partners and both have a flat. Im simply to dumb and lazy to achieve anything in this life.

Also my parents have been divorced since I was 7 or 8 (Im 17 now) so I never had a father figure. I don't know how to act around someone I have feelings for. Or better yet, I know how, but only trough countless posts I already did on this subreddit. Also my father won't give me his okay for having an own account so I can't make one until October 19 when I turn 18. My family is not poor, but we're not living in luxury and I rarely have any money for stuff. I don't have time atm to work either since I do 2 lessons of private tutoring and one lesson of mentoring a week, I also need to study for exams and shit.

I have social anxiety and slight depression. And I have a feeling that the depression is coming back. I legit only have 2 friends I can count on, the rest is just in my course and dont mind me.

And then theres a girl who I really really like, I think she likes me back, maybe even in a romantic way, but she either has problem's expressing that or she just fucks with me. And if I drop out of school now I probably won't see her that often again and were also both in a voluntary mentoring program which you can't simply quit. Im just too far in.

250,"For context, we are studying aerospace engineering in the Netherlands. I’m coming from Spain and she’s from Singapore.

My gf is exceptionally smart and, when I first met her at the start of the academic year, was really motivated and passionate about space. We just finished the first quarter and her results, while not awful (she passed 3/4 subjects, one of which just barely) dont reflect the time she put into it. This hit her pretty hard but I managed to convince keep working hard to then pass the resit in January. After this she definitely wasn’t doing as well as before but she managed well enough. 
During the second quarter we now have weekly tests for an objectively pretty hard subject. She didn’t do well at all in the first one partially due to us being given pretty lackluster information as to what would be on the test. That hit her even harder (despite it being a very low amount of points compared to the final grade of the class).
Ive tried to convince her that this was just an accident, that shes strong enough to keep going, that its only been some minor setbacks. She always tells me it helps but I can tell it really doesn’t. Whats worse is that her friends are all doing better and that really demotivates her.

I told her to talk to the student counselor but hes not available for the next 6 weeks. Also the professors and TAs told her that shes doing well but she wont have it.
What can I do to help her? Shes been having breakdowns and I think its getting worse.

The incident I need advice about: so my father and I were having a debate ( a personal one already) which became a rather more personal when he started targeting my personal life ( y'know things that have nothing to do with the parents ) and when i countered those by targeting his personal life ( which is pretty fucked up and I don't really want to bring that up neither now nor then but he forced me to by targeting my personal life ) he became pretty pissed and now is selling my bike which he gave to me and becoming more restrictive.
For the matter the legal system in our country is pretty weak and i can't legally take him down and i need a more diplomatic approach. He has love for me deep down and so do I so what should I do to recover the loss. Not to mention that the root of this cause (the start of the debate) isn't that big. My father is aware that we are slowly getting further apart so becoming a little emotional and trying to convince him will do. What should I do please help me. I don't want more restrictions or my bike being sold away for this without me getting a single penny from it. Please tell me something that would tick all those points for a wise father to accept and seem much convincing.

She was with someone else without even telling me. And to add insult to injury, at that point i just turned down my dream job offer from another country to settle down in my home country with her. At this point, i already fell like my life is a mess. This is even worse for someone like me who cant really connect with people, she is one of the few that i can connect with.

Year go by, people keep telling me that it will pass, to just live my life. And i did, at least i tried to, to a point where i understand, this kind of thing never really ""pass"". At least in what i experience, it festered and becoming who i am instead. It didnt go away, it's always been there, you just forget about it most of the time. There comes a time that it would just come back, and it is just a fucking awful feeling.

Fast forward to earlier this month, i got a new job offer far away in Warsaw. I decided to take it, and maybe it can act like a reset button in my life. In order to go there i need to stay in my home country for a month to take care of the visa and all that. And this few weeks has been an absolute hell for me. All the memories of me with her just came back in waves. And on top of it, i never realized how lonely i was until this moment. Few friends that i have is busy with their jobs. And living this month without job, friends, and memories with my ex is just fucking sucks. I keep trying to find something else to do, but it just wouldnt do.

I ride my motorbike to god knows where just to keep my mind occupied most of the time, i find it kinda therapeutic. But just this evening when i ride my motorbike, that feeling just suddenly hit me like a truck. And i found myself stopped on the side of the road just crying, i dont even know where i was. At this point i just cant seem to handle it, i feel terrified as well, since i never experience a breakdown like this before. I keep thinking to myself that this would just get worse from now on. And now im also scared about going to Warsaw, knowing that i will be in a foreign country completely alone.

I grew up in a fairly abusive household, ranging from neglect to outright physical abuse in later years, and it definitely plays a part in how I see my family now. Regardless of the fact that they are trying to make amends- I cant move past everything they put me through. I've forgiven them, but I cant seem to let it go and dive into being a family.

I was diagnosed, when I served in the Army, with ADHD, Major Depressive Disorder, and Anxiety. So, in light of that, I got onto medication to help with everything. Unfortunately, my wife at the time, used to make rude comments about how I wasn't really me on the pills and asking why I had to take so many. I grew to resent that and it was the beginning of our eventual divorce.

I spoke to my doctors and therapists, telling them I had no desire to take my medications anymore- I wanted to try full lifestyle changes. It worked for a bit, but the depression came back and it was a tidal wave.

Then, I met my girlfriend- beautiful, caring, generous women that she is. She helps me a lot in talking out my issues to a healthy extent without relying on her for my troubles. Things are better now in the sense that: I got out of a terrible marriage, my family realized and subsequently ceased all kinds of abuse while also apologizing, I have a healthy relationship, and I love my job for the work I do and the money they pay me.

I lead a life better than most with regards to all of the above, however my girlfriend lives several hours away. This means I see her maybe every two weeks. I work in a place where the vast majority of people are twice my age, so I dont really have work friends.

I spend my time either working, sleeping, going to the gym (where nobody wants to talk and I dont want to start a conversation because it's not really the place to do so), or playing video games in a desperate hope that one of my friends will get on so I have a source of human interaction with people I love.

What can I do guys and gals? I'm heavily debating going back on my meds because I believe it's the correct thing to do.

258,"Hi guys never really gone here before but at this point I'm just really conflicted on what to do

I just graduated high school a while back, and while I was there I had to live in a boarding school due to personal reasons.

The people in charge at the (hostel??) Were teachers in the school I was attending, and they were for the most part very very welcoming and nice to all of us. However, there's the source of the problem, let's call them T.

Now, T is a teacher in my school that I have rather frequent contact with, besides that I have friends in his classes that I regularly meet with.
 
T was one of a few teachers that looked after us, but T went above and beyond ""caring for our welfare"". I am very aware of the ""godchildren"" T adopts, as well as his generosity in showering then with miscellaneous gifts and such (eg. Guitars, food, you name it). Now this isn't a bad thing in and of itself. However, I've noticed that when talking to these ""godchildren"" of theirs, T tends to ignore all boundaries between a student and a teacher, often (bordering on intimate) physical contact on the shoulder and the neck, as with his voice.

Now all staff have keys and access to all the rooms in the dorm, and they are allowed to check on us when it is required. T, who is the only one who does this, comes into the room that I shared with 3 other students with strange frequency, two of which are particularly close to T and one of which is a ""godchild"" of theirs.

It struck me as odd at first, but I was put at ease when I asked my roommates whether they minded this treatment from T or whether they were comfortable with T calling them their godchild in the first place, which they then replied with ""well it comes with a lot of perks"", which in hindsight I should have been a lot more concerned about.

This is a dorm where the students are very much comfortable with each other, and certain isolated incidents of full nudity are rather common. I personally was sleeping half naked during one of T's ""routine checkups"" of which I woke up in. Needless to say I was pretty shaken up by, but didn't give much thought to. I learnt from a fellow student in one of the other rooms that T had visited our room that night when we were all supposed to have been sleeping and did not leave until at least 12.

It feels like he's been manipulating students in class as well,  often coming into class angry or singling out individual students, only to treat us like friends merely 30 minutes after as if nothing had happened, asking us personal questions and making jokes, requesting us to sing, etc

I am fully aware that T has not done anything wrong and that there is no legal or formal action that can be taken against him, but above all else it feels like T has been abusing his power as a teacher, as a guardian to international students thousands of miles away from home, but of course there's no definitive proof, merely unsubstantiated rumours of sexual activity between T and students.

Essentially I am a fairly young guy with only 1 or 2 close friends. I work full time in a job that was the best thing to happen to me, however over the last few months things have started to change. Right now, I hate my job, I'm trapped in a dead-end position that isn't going to go anywhere (management issues). The one colleague that I was close with has distanced themselves from me for no apparent reason.


Life feels shit. I have no social life or girlfriend. I do have a loving (but small) family, but that is about all I have right now. 


I don't go out enough to meet new people and I've lost contact with all my old friends. I want to get back in touch, but it's awkward. I just feel trapped and worthless.

267,"New girl at work. She is something else. She is 28 (I’m 27), she came onto me 3 days into working. Drunk texted me and wanted to go drinking and spend the night together knowing I had a girlfriend of 3 years. Then she gave me the option to choose her or my girlfriend. I told her I would forget that night because I have to work with her from now on and I don’t want work to be awkward. She hasn’t come onto me and never brought it up again but she’s been treating me different, being very short with me, sorta aggressive. We work in social work in Residential Treatment for Addiction and even the clients notice her attitude with me and her sorta being mean to me, I assume because I turned her down. 

Now she’s telling me and the clients that she’s been hooking up with guys on POF, she’s not on BC, and I guess the dude she’s been seeing for less than 2 weeks doesn’t know it and is not pulling out because they aren’t using condoms and she thinks she’s pregnant now. 

This girl is something else. She’s a terrible worker in general but she’s not what these clients and I need at work, and I don’t know how to handle her. She seems desperate for attention and especially a man’s attention. She’s looks completely normal, but she’s crazy I guess. We have a man’s house and I want to tell my supervisor the stuff she’s been saying and how she came onto me 3 days of knowing me and she should never be sent to a guy’s treatment center we have. She would probably try to have sex with the clients and in the last 3 months, we had to fire 2 people for hooking up with clients....",21Nov2018,1

269,"Forgive me for the way I type this, but this is how I usually speak and type in person. So I entered college after hoping to start over a new leaf and forget about my shitty experience in high school (college is mandatory from where I live in). Five months in and I'm doing great but something happened recently. So I'm usually the guy in class who would socialise with everyone and some find me friendly but others might find that I'm a dick (which is understandable, some might not like the way I react). So, I'm friends with this girl who we'll call 'A' and also a guy who we'll call 'Z' now they are together not long ago but I thought it wouldn't cause any unwanted attention if I am still friends with her.

So, I was given an assignment that was teamed up with 'A' and of course you have to socialise and talk in a group assignment. Then, I recalled how her hoodie pattern reminded me of my inner wear she laughed it off and I thought that was the end of it. I didn't flirt with her or attempted to approach her or anything, but I guess some people can't take some things easily. Then comes social media, I got a video sent directed to me by 'Z' and it was about my inner wear and who would like themselves that particular inner wear. That was red flag for me then on. I stopped talking to her or even waved at her whenever I saw 'A'. But nooooooo, this dude now thinks it's ok to call me names on social media. Recently, he talked how 'dolphin' walked out on him like his dad. Ok, I know for a fact he is starting some kind of beef with me but I don't want any. I'm gonna get kicked out of college cuz' I put hands on some dude. He's slightly taller than me and although I lift weights, I believe he is naturally stronger than me. 

BTW, I did confront 'Z' earlier about admitting I was wrong for being a bit too close with 'A' and thought that was that and he even said he will take my word for it. But the way I see it, things are going sour again.

I only know my friend (let's call her M) from a game we both play, so we aren't in the same country.
A few weeks ago M's ex killed himself, incidentally the day before her birthday. They have children together.

I only just today found out M has been drinking every day for the past week (at least), as she understandably hasn't been online much in the game. A mutual friend of ours then told me that people have been blaming M for her ex's death, and that she's been drinking for at least 15 days at least. He also says she's been offered a job (as a caregiver) in another location and had urged her to take it, and several times tried to talk to her about the drinking. 

Concerned I write a message to M, most importantly trying to state that ""it was not her fault"" and that she should stop talking to those people. M then said that it was hard not to listen to them and that she was staying away from them; by staying indoors all the time and just crying and drinking. M also said that she'd declines the job offer because she didn't think she could take care of anyone. 


In the message I sent I also tried to urge M to stop drinking and seek professional help but I don't know if those two points got through to her.  I told M to try and stop pleasing people around her but just to do what's best for her and her kids. 

Is there anything else I can do? Anything I should push harder? Any magic phase to make this all better?

My GF has broken up with me a week ago for the fifth time in about a year and every time I want to get back with her, but this time I am really questioning is it worth me wasting my life? 

She thinks life is a fairytale and I am the Villain out to ruin her, she constant throws things at me and me being quite laid back just brushes off the meaningless shit in life. 

However, when I do bite back and sometimes get unnecessarily petty she does not like it and then want to have a go. She has broken up with me for the fact that we are in a poisonous relationship that is going nowhere but days prior indicates how she wants to move in with me and eventually have children. 

I honestly think a lot of the reasoning is bullshit, do not get me wrong I can be out of line sometimes but not to the point where I believe it is worth breaking up for.

I was in bed at home with my current girlfriend when I got a text from my ex boyfriend (I'll call him Bryce) that I broke up with about a year earlier (his mum died exactly 8 years ago to the day), apologizing for how our relationship ended and he told me not to blame myself for his actions. I had barley spoken to him since we broke up and the tone of the text was very concerning and he wouldn't answer any phone calls. My girlfriend was asleep at the time so I got dressed and drove to Bryce's house. When I got there no one answered the door so I walked in and went into his room. He was sitting on the edge of his bed sobbing and there was empty boxes of painkillers on the floor. He tried to talk to me, but he was crying too much. I called the hospital and asked them what to do, I was absolutely terrified, they told me to bring Bryce asap. On the way out I saw 2 handwritten notes on his desk one was addressed to ""anyone who cares"" and the other one just has my name on it. (I've still got that note but I can't bring myself to read it). 

When we got to the hospital the doctors rushed him away to get his stomach pumped and I didn't see him for a few hours. By the time the doctors finished and he'd talked to a physiologist and was allowed to leave it was 7am (I got to the hospital at 10:30pm and hasn't been able to sleep at all). The doctors said I should tell some of his close friends what happened and get them to keep an eye on him because his dad worked long hours and didn't see Bryce often. 

When I dropped him at a close friends house, I sat in my car and just cried, I was absolutely exhausted and scared and I just wanted to climb into bed with my girlfriend and cuddle her and forget all about everything that had happened. 

When I got home my girlfriend confronted me, I'd left my phone at home in the rush to get to Bryce's house and while I was driving to his house, he sent me a message telling me to come and see him. She accused me of cheating on her with Bryce and I every time I tried to explain, she shut me down. It was all too much for me and I started crying again and she took that as me admitting to cheating. She walked to the train station and went home (we live apart because of my work and her education but she stays at my place on weekends). She won't answer any of my calls or texts and I can't get the time off work to see her.

281," Good morning/evening everyone! First of all, I apologise for not being the greatest storyteller.

So, I'm a 24 year old guy, who lives and works in a tiny island in the Mediterranean. I work as a full-time translator, but my job allows me to work from wherever I want. Since the traffic situation in my country is terrible, 4 days out of 5 I work from home. Now the pay I make isn't *great* \- however finding a job in this sector in this country (especially with my language combinations) is very difficult, so I'm telling myself I'm gaining experience so that in the future I could even try to work somewhere else in the EU.

Lately, a thought has been bugging my mind. Theoretically, I can even work from other countries - I guess as long as the timezone isn't several hours different from the one in my country. So I started saying to myself that I should travel to another country, spend 1 month, maybe 2 months there, while keeping my current job, and then move on to another country and rinse and repeat. I was trying to weight the pros and cons of this:

Pros: Travelling; New experiences; More responsibility (in my country usually someone has to get married before he moves out from his parents' house, I mean I can cook, clean and everything but it still would be a huge step forward)

Cons: Since I would work from home, I feel like I wouldn't get to know a lot of people and delve completely inside the adventure; Also, financially this would be a step back (having to pay extra rent, at home I currently buy food for myself etc.); Plus then I'd have to sort out how payments work - I know you can get some sort of temporary visa (up to 180 days I believe), but I'm not 100% sure how taxes and everything would be calculated, I would need to check everything.

I’ve been struggling with a little psychological problem for over many years now, but I have no idea how to approach this problem. Heck, I don’t even really know what it is. I ended up in this sub because I don’t think it really fits in /r/depression. Excuse me if I’m posting in the wrong sub.

I seem to have a problem with experiencing “extreme” emotions. With that I mean that it seems that I have trouble feeling really sad or really happy. I’m convinced I can have those emotions, though! When I’m really in the moment and immersed in whatever I’m doing I can experience both joy (e.g. when I’m having a lot of fun gaming with friends) and sadness (e.g. when I’m watching a really good sad movie I can be moved to tears). However, in a lot of other situations I tend to be extremely “reserved” to the point where I feel like it’s causing some problems in my personal relationships. It hasn’t ever really been a problem to me personally, but now that I’m in a relationship I’m noticing that it’s actually causing some issues.

An example of me not experiencing sadness was when a friend of mine passed away several years ago. Yes, I was sad, but somehow it was extremely muted. I did notice that I wanted to cry at some point, but I automatically stopped myself from having that emotion. I noticed this immediately but I couldn’t retrieve that emotion, much to my frustration.

My partner has noticed that my reactions to both positive and negative things are very muted, which makes it seem like I generally don’t really care. This isn’t true, however. It’s just that somehow there’s something inside of me that keeps me away from extreme emotions. In the past this allowed me to be a very “stable” person, but now I feel like it’s taking me out of the human experience.

By the way: the relationship is fantastic. It’s just that I want to learn how to express myself more freely. I feel like I’m always filtering my responses and the only thing that comes out is an emotionally flat reaction.

I do have a past with depression, but that was some time ago. My case was fairly mild and I worked myself out of it with some therapy, forcing myself to get a job and by means of meditation. I read that having muted emotions is something that can occur post depression. That makes sense to me: part of my recovery process was taking distance from the thoughts I was having. Now I’m just wondering how I get myself out of this situation.

Does anybody have any advice? Is there a name for whatever this is? I feel like I need some leads so I can figure this out.",21Nov2018,1

300,"Hello Everyone,

I'm writing this to get some insight on potential solutions to an issue we're facing with my father.

BACKGROUND-  

My father was in a major motorcycle accident last year that put him in a coma for 3 months and gave him long term traumatic brain injury.  He has made incredible recovery and is slowly getting back to his old self, though we're a ways away from that.  My dad was a major influencer in his career, a seriously effective leader, and regarded as one the best in his field.  He is a work-a-holic and the TBI has brought out the worst in his behavior unfortunately. Right now he is not working and my mother has taken guardianship over him as the doctors and state have deemed him incapable of handling things such as his own finances (which now falls on me...), medical decisions, driving, and having a major job.  That being said he still has the drive to be involved and ""in charge"" as much as possible, despite our efforts to quell his ambitions for the time being.  It isn't that we don't want him to go do all the things he used to do, but rather at this point in time he has the serious potential of being a danger to himself and other (outbursts of anger, lack of critical reasoning skills, etc.).  Because he is unable to recogize and identify his deficiencies, his actions reflect that of his behavior pre-accident.

&amp;#x200B;

ISSUE-  Because he still sees himself as being ""ok"" he is attempting to do things that are outside safe behavior.  He's been sneaking credit cards away from my mother, giving personal and private information away online (signing up for sketchy websites, buying from ads without understanding the dangers in some websites, etc.). Bottom line is that he involved in a lot of dangerous online activity and his impulsivity is driving him to make poor decisions and purchases online.  He has a smart phone with online access and has access to a computer with the capacity to utilize it (though ineffectively).  We want him to retain a sense of autonomy but his actions put both him and my mother in danger of identity theft and potential financial issues.

&amp;#x200B;

CURRENT ACTIONS-  I currently have their computer set up with ad blockers to stimy the urger to click on products and services that pop up for him and I have access to the internet restricted at night so that he doesn't get up in the early hours to surf (he still has cellular access).  My mother is making it a habit to ensure the credit cards are not accessible.  Keys to the car are locked in a safe (for his protection because he wants to drive) and we have a bracelet that he can press for emergency assistance. I have changed all the passwords and access controls for important accounts and regularly monitor emails and account transactions to make sure he's not blowing crazy cash. 

&amp;#x200B;

WHAT I NEED-  I need a way to ensure he's not inadvertantly giving out information that can be damaging to him and my mother or at least to know when he has.  I've been thinking of looking in to some sort of parental (no pun intended) control software but that leaves a gap for the knowledge he has in head (SSN, address etc.). Any advice as to the best way to protect him and my mom better as he continues to recover would be greatly appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading and for your help!

TL;DR - My dad has a TBI and can't reason well.  He's giving personal info away online and buying things online from sketchy websites.  I need to be able to stop/monitor these actions.

303,"TL;DR at the bottom.

I've been struggling with this conflict for a few years now. My parents are both in their mid-60's. They live (by the skin of their teeth) off of social security. 

My dad could work, but he doesn't (long story) he isn't disabled, but I think he suffers from depression. He refuses to go to the doctor unless he absolutely has to. He will always make up an excuse not to go to his appointment. So he may have other issues, but no one knows. 

My mom has tons of health problems, something new always pops up. She has needed a knee replacement for a few years now, but has yet to go through with it. But that's just one issue, there are a lot more. My brother still lives at home and helps out a bit, but his income is very low, and he has no aspirations of improving his situation and has drug problems (he could be the subject of his own post).

They are all broke, and in poor health. But they refuse to quit smoking. They chain smoke inside of the house, just as they have done for 25+ years now. I am a former smoker (quit about 10 years ago) so I know how difficult it is to quit, and how toxic cigarette smoke is to the human body. If the average non-smoker walked into their house, they likely wouldn't last more than 60 seconds before they had to leave. It is that bad. The smell is almost unbearable. There is discoloration on the ceilings, walls, and I am sure every other part of the house. After 10 minutes of being in their house, I can literally feel it in my throat (that scratchy/sore ""I am getting sick"" kinda feeling). 

They rarely ever leave the house for extended periods of time, so they are in that environment 24/7. The smoking, 2nd hand smoke, and everything else that lingers in the air is just constantly pummeling them, and they wonder why they are always sick. I've tried time and time again to tell them to stop, at least quit smoking in the house, but they refuse. ""Quitting is just too hard, you try quitting after smoking for 40+ years"". This is a common excuse, but it's just that, an excuse. 

They would improve their situation by moving into a low maintenance apartment, or condo, but there is no way in hell they are selling their house, they wouldn't even break even in the condition it's in. The house is in okay shape structurally, and functionally, but the smoke smell, tar/staining on the walls and ceiling, and therefore everything else in the house is a massive problem. It is really bad.

I believe that their life, and quality of life depends upon them quitting smoking. I don't think that is a mind blowing concept, but I cannot get this through their thick ass skulls. Literally, every aspect of their lives would improve if they quit smoking. More money, better health, a cleaner house, more visits from the grand kids, etc. But they refuse.

They always need money, I have loaned them money several times, but they are still in the hole trying to pay me back. I'll never see that money, and that's OK. They wont be here on Thanksgiving because they don't have the money to fix their car, and they don't have the money to rent a car. I know my mom probably want's me to volunteer to pay for a rental, but I won't (I think she knows better than to ask at this point). I refuse to give them anything else unless they find the strength to help themselves.

So what do I do? How do I convince them to save their own lives, and find some enjoyment in the short time they may have left? Giving them money would help, but it wont fix the problem. I could help, but it doesn't feel right. I do well for myself, but I have a wife (she is strongly opposed to ever giving them any money) and 2 kids to support. Thus the conflict. I feel like there is a very strong likelihood that they just are the way they are, and won't change for anyone or anything In that case, I guess I am just going to have to accept the situation as it is, but I gotta know that I did everything within my power to try and help them.

Thanks for listening.

TL;DR Smoking is destroying my parents lives, but they refuse to do anything about it. I could help, but they wont help themselves. What, if anything, can I do about it?",21Nov2018,1
304,So basically what happened is a girl was having family issues and was asking for places to stay to get away from her home i offered up my apartment as a place to crash until she found a better place to live or resolved the issue with her family during that time (the time she was at my house) me being 21 consumed alcohol and went to sleep soon after i woke up to this female  inappropriately touching my privates which soon escalated to sex due to intoxication. The issue lies in the fact that my gf now thinks that i committed sexual assault but the law says in my state (PA) that the legal age of sexual consent is 16 and you have to be within 4 years of the person that you are participating in intercourse with which i was me being 21 and her 17. Me being a drinker this happened more than once but both times i was intoxicated she even brought over the alcohol one of the times. So i guess my question is am i in the wrong here or am i ok because all laws were followed other than the fact that she was sober and i was under the influence?,21Nov2018,1
305,"I had an interview on Friday last week where the company flew both my wife and me across the country (USA) and took her on a tour of the area while I met with several people. I was told by the CEO that I should hear back ""next week"", and haven't seen a response yet. 

Normally I would be fine with waiting until next Monday until I followed up, but with the holiday tomorrow I'm not sure if people at the company are even working after today and I'd really like to have some news to give my parents, especially if I'm moving across the country.

Additionally, I currently have until next Monday to accept a formal offer from another company (my second choice).  I don't want to keep them waiting too long and have them withdraw the offer, or accept the offer only to back out if the first company comes through.

I was thinking about sending an email today to the guy who has been taking point on my interview process (not the CEO) saying that I understand that things can be busy right before a holiday but I was wondering if a decision had been made regarding my potential future at the company. I would send the email at their 11am, which is around the time they take lunch. Any thoughts on this? Should I just wait and see what happens? What should I do with company 2's offer while I'm waiting on a response from company 1?",21Nov2018,1

308,"Im gonna start off by saying this is going to be long. Not like 10 sentences long, I mean long long. So bear with me. Or don't.

Today I had a nightmare. It was about a thing called the ""Dark zone"". Sounds fun right? Imagine it like a town. Except everything is more than pitch black. You can only see a few smartphone lights and car lights in the distance. It was completely silent. Except that people laughed all the time, they talked fast and quiet, and whispered nervously. It was pretty creepy. Don't know how I ended up there but I did. I shared it this morning on reddit and someone interpreted it as me being afraid of the ""real world"". And I think I agree. Im scared. Pretty fucking terrified to be more accurate.

I have an okay ish degree (A,C,B,D were my grades) and im my first year into highschool. I live in germany and the end of highschool means getting your Abitur (comparable to a levels). Except my grades are just average. But I worked pretty hard for that. And this year is only repetition, so I'll have shit grades when we learn the ""hard"" stuff and I don't think I'll be able to pass the exams for my Abi. Eventhough it's still 2 years and a bit. I don't wanna look for a job education tho, ill come to that later.

My sister completed her Abitur as one of the 10 best pupils in our city and her grade, I could never live up to such expectations. Both my sister and my brother have jobs. They both also have partners. And both have a flat and a stable life in general. And me? I don't have shit. Im too fucking dumb to make something of myself.

My parents are divorced ever since I was like 8 or so. So I never had a father figure to teach me about girls, about relationships, etc. I had to teach it to myself. Trough the Internet. I know, pretty shitty but it is what it is. Now my father won't give me the legal okay for me to get an own bank account. I have to wait till im 18 (October 2019). I also never talked about a drivers license with my mom. We just don't have the money for it. Meanwhile seemingly everyone in my course is doing theirs.

I legit only have 3 friends who I can count on (including a girl which im probably in love with. We'll call her V. Just in case she reads this: shoot me a message V, now you know how I feel about you). The rest are people in my course. We aren't exactly friends, they just don't mind me. Im neither funny, nor good looking or smart, or rich. Im just a loser.

I also have anxiety and slight depression. Though it's gotten worse recently. I cry a lot when im alone. I don't really have anyone to talk to except my mom. Which is kind of akward.

Now, why don't I just get a job? Well. I do 2 lessons of private tutoring a week. It's a program bound to our school. I do that for 5€ a lesson. Though I'll only get paid after 8 lessons and I currently have a pupil that just never seems to attend. It's been a month and a bit and we only had 2 lessons yet. And I also do a lesson of mentoring a week, though voluntarily. Together with V. Both things + studying for exams and trying to have a private life makes me unable to imagine myself with a job. Plus I won't get to see V as often anymore.

I think im in love with V. All signals say she likes me back. She calls me cute, agreed when I asked her on a date (But I did stupid and let her propose a day, she only said she'll be spontaneous. I know if a girl is ""busy"" means she's not interested. But im conflicted on this because she herself, all the signs and her behavior all say the opposite.) We hug everytime we see each other, she laughs about unfunny jokes I make and its just generally easy to talk to her. We haven't held hands yet or kissed tho. But I want exactly that. I want someone who I can talk to about my problems, who I can hug and who I can make some experience with. I want it to be V.

312," Every year My school holds a variety show and for the past 2 years I did a comedic stand up routine. This year I was basically pressured into doing another stand up act, I went with my close friend and we decided to script our stand up. At the end of this routine I’m supposed to say the words “bazinga”. Everything was going amazing, we did a parent show and mutiple rehearsals yet I was still extremely nervous for the school event.

 In the variety show people are usually forced to pay 5 bucks to watch, but this year they made it free and forced every single student to go. Because of this we had to do 2 shows, we kept on practicing and we debated on if I should even say the word “bazinga” as it’s extremely stupid. But we agreed that I should still say it as we weren’t allowed to change our performances. We went on stage and we absolutely destroyed it, I thought we were so amazing but before we got off stage I said “bazinga” causing a massive uproar in the audience.

 We were congratulated by some student council members and we sat down to practice for the next show. After a few minutes I was pulled by the assistant principal, the sophomore principal and the freshman principal. They and many others apparently thought I said the pus** word at the end of my performance.

  I begged them to listen to me and go out and ask other teachers if they heard it too, apparently they did and I was forced to wait till my parents came to pick me up home and because they were at work I had to talk to the principals all day . Now I am not the Varsity quarterback but my dumb shenanigans were extremely well known, the principals knowing this said that I was “edgy” and “pushed the envelope” when it came to my humor so they had no reason to believe me. Now my parents have to talk to the principal about my bad behavior 

  When I went home I later found out that a lot of students heard the word “bazinga” and many students actually believes that what happened to me was unjust. But teachers, principals and a lot of students still thought I yelled the p word. I feel extremely embarrassed and upset, I need your help reddit I frankly dont know what to do.

313,"Sup bois, i have been thinking about this problem for a while and is really getting me angry for some reason so i thought ill ask the reddit gods for some advice.

I have a friendship of over 6 years, everything smooth till some months ago, in a nuthsell the problem is that im leaving the country ( Im in the shithole of venezuela RN so you dont need to ask why im leaving it ) and i didnt think me leaving was going to be a problem but some months ago she started to be ""busy"" with his job. Busy in quotation marks because we wont event go out to eat ice cream or chill like before, just doing something for fun, and i know jobs can take all the energy in the world but im the kind of person to think about if you really want to do something you will make time for it. 

So we are so far from each other with every day it passes that im just so tired of trying to go out with her, we wont even talk by now and it gets on my nerves to even think of it cause i see it as his fault but who knows. Even if i leave the country i said i would save money to get her out of that shithole of Venezuela if she wanted, some kind of Friends ( the series) bullshit thinking but i would do it since we had that good of a friendship. 

I dont know if i should talk to her or what to do, i dont want a friendship of just talking from facebook and never seen each other, my type of personality is really the kind of man who doesnt beg to anyone but she is so close to me that i would just give an exception to her.

planned to do a long one ft. my whole life but thought it'd be stupid so I'll go with this short one instead.

I am 18 years old.

I 'met' a girl at work (she's been a coworker during her studies and now works in a different city).
And I do like her.
So far so good.
First 'problem' : she is 9 years older than me.

We understand each other pretty good and play Video Games together basically every day. Some Weeks ago I stayed at her place over a weekend and we went to a concert together.
This all sounds good yes but
I'm just a friend. And I'd like to be just that given the fact that I don't think she'd love me in any world and that I don't feel like having a gf since my life is kinda a mess and I should fix that before having a gf.
On the other side, I feel different.
Like - in my Head I'd be fine with being her best friend but my feelings just tell me different, you know?

She just broke up with her Boyfriend like a month or two ago and still has some problems with him that I've been helping her with (not that she still loves him or anything, she hates him)

I just don't know how to move on from here on.
I'd like to just stay her best friend and delete those feelings but I can't.
But I also don't want to ruin this friendship just by telling her about how I feel.

Feels like no matter what I do, I'll mess things up...

(if you need to know more to give proper advice ask in comments, i'll try to answer within an hour if i am not sleeping - once i think i figured it out i'll delete this post and account, thanks to everyone that will try to help me)

oh and you can pm me too if you want or feel like its easier/better that way

thanks x",21Nov2018,1
316,"A bit of a backstory. Have been married for a couple years and dated for a long time before that. Both of our families get along extremely well and we try to split up our holidays fairly evenly between whose side we spend time with on the actual day. This seems to go well for every holiday but Christmas. My side of the family has done very well about having their Christmas on the weekend before or after and have changed their holidays around for us.

This isn't the first time I've been in this situation, but I have in the past just bit the bullet and went to the movies on Christmas.

I'm a pretty religious guy and I enjoy keeping Christmas to a time for family interaction and I just feel like sitting in a dark room not talking to each other experiencing something I could do literally any other day is a waste of my time on this special day (at least to me).

This is one of the few items my wife and I disagree on. What I think it comes down to is she's having a hard time thinking about what Christmas day would be like without that family tradition. I've talked with her about how my family (who we haven't spent Christmas day with for the last few years) had always spent the evening playing board games and keeping the TV turned off.

So I guess really there are two issues I'm looking at. 1) Wife's family goes to the movies on Christmas and it really ruins the day for me. 2) My side of the family (including parents, brothers, their families, etc) wants to have us over for Christmas day since everything aligns perfectly this year, but it was shot down immediately by wife's family because they said what they have been doing has been that way — and I feel a bit hurt by it.

Am I weird for thinking this? Do I need to get over myself? How do I explain this to my in-laws without hurting their feelings? Bestow upon me your wonderful advice!",21Nov2018,1

I’m not against going fast, I like starting off slow then going fast but she wants me to go Mach 5. I’m already using all my muscles and becoming sore and she’s still begging me to “fuck her”. 

When I’m obliterating her uterus in the way she wants, I literally have to have ever muscle in my body flexed and working full time. 

I have now lost my erection twice after a few minutes of Usain Bolting her cervix and it’s embarrassing, she doesn’t know what’s going on and I’m just like I need a break but I’m already out of breath at that point so my erection just doesn’t come back, and once it does we’re already done. 

I just want to chill and enjoy it but I haven’t even come even after all the times we’ve already had sex, but I also really want her to come (If my partner comes I’m more satisfied than if I come) so you can throw on performance anxiety on top of the other shit I already mentioned. 

Idk what to do, it’s gotten to the point where I don’t really want to have sex with her because if I do then I have to go full auto since I NEED her to come. Idk why it has to be like this but it’s either don’t have sex with her or have sex with her uncomfortably, there’s no in between ",21Nov2018,1

322,"I met this girl, she has this ex-boyfriend who is overly attached and still thinks he has a chance. Basically yesterday, the girl and I went on a date at the mall. She went to the mall earlier than I did because she is hanging out with her friends before the date, she happened to bump into his ex-boyfriend's friend; the friend told her ex-boyfriend that the girl is here. The ex-boyfriend came to the mall and looked for her, she tried to run away but failed, he told directly told the girl that he's here because he wanted to stalk her. After the incident, I came to the mall and the ex-boyfriend saw us together He got really mad, he talk to her(as she took her away from me) and he even pulled her aggressively but she tried to resist. She looked terrified and there's is nothing I could do, as some of his friends were around him at the mall. Then, the ex-boyfriend let her go and she's now with me. He got really pissed off, he punched the pillar and broke his fingers which has to be casted on. Afterwards, the date continues and things got back to normal

Today, I texted the girl and asked her about her ex-boyfriend. She told me that her ex-boyfriend is trapping her, she tried to block him on social media but he would find a way to text her or get his friends to text her telling her to unblock him. Or he could even find me in school to cause some problem. I assure you that he's aggressive and his friends are protecting him,  and I we had quite a history with each other. There is no point for the girl to tell her parents because they wouldn't do anything about it (this has to be an option if there's really no other option to solve it). Tomorrow, I am going to school, what can I do to protect myself from the ex-boyfriend to make sure nothing happens? (urgent). And what can the girl do to solve this problem, I really want to help her with this sincerely. Note: we are only 16 years old.",21Nov2018,1
324,"This is my first post on here, please forgive me if I mess up on the format. I will try and fix it if there are any problems later on.

Anyway, to put simply, my brother is disgusting. He’s at the age of 11, but acts like a self-entitled toddler. I understand that he’s not exactly at a mature age yet, but I feel like he’s not exactly at the age of which my family should be mollycoddling him still. He should at least be able to to a degree, practice some good hygiene.

He has a few habits that I can’t help but get increasingly annoyed by. He leaves his dirty clothes all over the floor before he showers, and doesn’t pick them up after he’s done. This leaves me and my helper to pick up after him. When he does shower, he steps out and doesn’t dry properly before leaving the bathroom, leaving puddles of water all over my bedroom floor (the toilet is in my bedroom.) Now this could all be avoided if he used the other toilet outside but he refuses to.

He also has a terrible habit of not lifting up the toilet seat and _peeing_ all over it. Every time I use the toilet I have to wash it and clean it. And when he does put it up, he doesn’t put it back down! Not to mention, after using the toilet, he sometimes “forgets” to flush, leaving me to have to see his disgusting turds. He also likes to leave the toilet without washing his hands, and this grosses me out more than anything.

I will also like to add that we live in a single parent household and my dad works day and night to support us and can’t possibly have time to deal with my brother’s attitude. We have a helper to help around the house since my dad cannot manage on his own, and kind of exacerbates his laziness by cleaning up after him, making him feel like he can just do whatever he wants.

I’ve tried to talk to him on multiple occasions, and obviously had my fair share of quarrels with him after seeing the same old disgusting habits. It’s been bugging me and making me feel so annoyed for ages and I don’t know what to even do. Am I overreacting over this? How should I properly deal with it? 

TL;DR My brother is a slob who doesn’t clean up after himself and my helper and I have to deal with his messes. He also does not practice any personal hygiene.",21Nov2018,1
325,"I grew up poor/working class. My parents and I lived in a one bedroom apartment in the Bronx. My father was extremely abusive, both physically and emotionally up until my mom and I finally left him when I was 17. My mother was always very loving and hardworking, and got her bachelors and masters during all of this. She tried to give me everything that she could with what she had and loved me unconditionally.

I was a smart kid. I started reading at a very young age, got into a bunch of gifted programs and ended up getting a basically full ride to private school when I was 11. I went to school with a bunch of really REALLY rich kids, some whose parents were famous actors. I was easily the poorest kid in my class. They would call me the Mexican (I’m not Mexican), and make fun of the fact that I lived in a poor neighborhood. I think I developed a bit of an inferiority complex as a result.

I suffered from what I thought was ADHD in high school and was taking a lot of really strong prescribed drugs to manage it, but they caused me to become a really anxious and high strung person. I recently was diagnosed with PTSD and depression, and have stopped taking ADHD meds to take medication to help with PTSD/depression, and now my ADHD is being managed as a result. So I think that I may have been misdiagnosed.

I got into a great college, majored in computer science and mathematics, and now I’m a software developer. I have a great job, live in a nice place and have a caring partner.

I provide all this context as kind of an explanation for the way that I am now. I don’t understand why, but I’ve become kind of a shitty, spoiled and judgemental person. 9/10 times I think negative shit about other people's intentions. I can never see the glass as being half-full, only half empty. I’m constantly afraid of fucking up, and so I try to do everything as perfectly as I can. Whenever someone does something to bother me, I assume that they’re doing it because they either don’t respect me or are trying to challenge me. I get very angry, especially when things don’t go my way or when people don’t do what I say. I like things to be a certain way, and get upset when someone messes with my ‘flow.’ I like to tell others what to do, but I don’t like being told what to do. I’m happy to share and to give to others, but only on my terms. I’m happy to offer, but hate being asked to do things or for things. As soon as I get the vibe that someone is trying to take advantage of me, I completely shut them out and cut them off. My instinct is that everyone is ill-intentioned until proven otherwise, and I struggle trusting people. I constantly feel like everyone around me secretly hates me and that I’ve only made it this far because I’m lucky. I like to do things myself because I don’t have confidence that other people will do them correctly. Once someone crosses me they’re out of my good graces. I won’t be mean to them, but we will never be close friends. I’m also EXTREMELY territorial and have trouble letting things go. I’m not an evil person, just a spoiled(?) person that’s used to things going their way I guess.

I do have some redeeming qualities, even though I have trouble seeing them because I only focus on my negative qualities. I’m honest and loyal. I speak my mind and I stand up for what I believe in. I donate to causes/people regularly and as much as I can. I actively try and work to become a better person. I’m very thoughtful and considerate of others and their feelings/comfort (when I’m not in an angry rage). I’m currently in therapy. I used to be way worse, but have gotten a better handle on my anger.

Is anyone else like this? Do you have any advice for self-improvement? Any exercises I can do when I’m feeling territorial or angry or irrationally disrespected? I’ve read a ton of self-help books, and truly try very hard to let things go. I try to be more positive, but always find myself backsliding into my ways. I know that I can change, because there is no such thing as the self and we can be anything that we choose to be, but it is so goddamn hard. I hate being this way. I want to be more carefree, to be less self-centered and spoiled. I hate that I only feel safe and comfortable when I’m in control of every situation that I’m in.",21Nov2018,1
326,"tl;dr at bottom.

A few months ago, this guy who works at a store I shop at frequently began flirting with me. It was cute and fun and I thought nothing of it.

After a few weeks of flirting, I was on a chat app and began chatting with a guy who was funny and endearing. We traded pics and wouldn't you know it, it's the guy who works at that store! We traded numbers and continued chatting. We started meeting up and going for walks, talking and hanging out.

Last night he was having car trouble and so I picked him up from work to bring him home. One thing led to another and we hooked up.

I knew he was younger than me but after chatting more last night, I found out there is a CONSIDERABLE age gap. I am a 32F and he is a 20M.

That's enough for me to stop it right there, even though we're wildly attracted to each other. We talked and he has no problem at all with the age difference. If we did continue hanging out, it would only be as a FWB. I would never date someone that age, nor am I looking for any kind of relationship at all in my life. 

Like I said, I'm super attracted to him, and he is to me. But isn't this wrong? He's so young. I'm really torn on this and I wondered if anyone could shed light on this- maybe you're 20 and can give me insight into that age, maybe you've done this before or know someone who has, maybe you're wise- I just need help clearing my head on this.

Normally I wouldn't post to an advice sub but this isnt something I necessarily want to tell my friends about.

hello, I'm a 27 year old man self-studying to be a web developer in the future (for a job so I can pay off student loan while supporting myself financially) while pursuing music or art on the side as that is my true passion.

The thing is that I just can't make a choice; I love music and I wish to study hard to be able to compose my own epic background music but whenever I think of doing it, I wish to learn to digital draw/paint; when I choose one, the other one makes me hesitate and uneasy, I just can't make a choice.

330,"So a little background, I graduated college in 2017 and have since been working as a lab manager for a research lab at a prestigious university. As an undergrad, I worked for this professor from sophomore year to senior year. He had a lot of students working for him but I was the longest lasting one. I have been gearing up to ask him for a recommendation letter for graduate school and recently had a face to face meeting to ask for his advice in applying. However, he is super unreliable and scatter brained. His memory is horrible and he is extremely disorganized. He has always been this way. He also travels a lot out of the country and doesn’t check email often. I contacted him about a letter but he has not responded and it’s been 3 days. I asked him for a letter a little over a year ago for my current position and he told me to write it myself and he would send it from his email. Ok, no problem. But then....he forgot to send it from his email and went to China for a couple weeks. I had to scramble and get one of his graduate students to write it last minute. I don’t have too many other people I can ask for a letter. I guess I want to know, if I have on my application that I worked for him for 3 years in a capacity directly relating to my intended major, would they think it’s suspicious that he doesn’t write me a recommendation letter?

331,"Hello, I'm probably not going to get any type of response on this but wanted to give it a try. I am 23 years old, dropped out of college because I was mentally drained and depressed living with my dad who is psychotic and does nothing but fight and let everyone done. He's narcissistic and mentally very abusive. My mom submits to home because she's an old school Indian lady who doesn't believe stepping up for herself and putting him in his place and only babies him. So I dropped out of college due to low gpa and being distracted by constant fighting and having no freedom to move out or even go to the library to study. Im not allowed to get a job. They cover all my tax information and have me dependent under them so I can't move out and just get a job and live on my own because I have not even a penny to my name nor do I know anything about the real life when it comes to taxes and stuff. I left college with 2 years of low gpa and an aeronautical science degree that has almost no use unless I want to be a pilot, with a 25k student loan. And decided to go to flight school because that's been my dream, figuring I could travel the world and have an awesome job. 90k more was taken out for the flight school, I managed to get my private pilot license and a multi engine rating. Only to be let down more through my father's pain and drama and abuse. I got kicked out for falling behind and not being able to concentrate in the flight school program. I am now 115k in debt. I can't restart college until I pay off my loan even if I wanted too. A job without a degree or any connection for a well paying job would take years for me to pay off my balance even if I got a minimum wage job somewhere because all my income would just go straight to my loans. 

I know most of you are thinking oh you're 23 you're an adult make your own decisions. But it's not easy to explain the hell hole I live in. It hurts. And has mentally drained and abused me. Where I constantly live in fear. I don't know where to go from here. So Im thinking about enlisting. Thinking maybe the military can put some strength and discipline in me. Help me with allowance and pay me enough to get by and give me shelter and food. Because I can't live here anymore. I know it's all the wrong reasons to join the military but I have no other option left for me. 

Anyone who has enlisted, can you please help me with the process? advice on what branch? What should I do? what job should I go for that doesn't involve a desk job.  

I don't have perfect vision so I can't fly military planes I know. And it's too late to do officer trainning school to be a pilot because I believe you have to be in college for that.

Went out to eat with my sister. An ex coworker of mine worked at the restaurant. She asked us to sit in her section. Awful service to the point we were both severely irritated and late for our plans afterwards. My 2 year old was getting fussy and I gave my sister $20 for my $10 bill and took my daughter to the car. My sister comes out and we get in our separate cars and go to the zoo. Server texts me I need to come back and give her the rest of her tip. Apparently my sister only tipped $3 instead of $6. I told her that I'm really sorry and I didn't pay. I told my sister that she texted me and my sister called the restaurant. 
Then videos, posts etc in my work chat that she never got deleted from persists. She calls me a white skinny crackhead. Tells me I'm too poor to tip and if I can't afford the $3 how can I afford to take care of my child. But calling me a crackhead doesn't effect me bc I don't do crack.

352,"I will try to keep this brief but it probably won’t be.  I have really bad adhd.  It affects me in all the ways you would expect.  Easily distracted, hard to focus,harder to comprehend.  In school i always had a hard time focusing. Nothing exciting there. I got by.  I used to be on medication to help me focus but the downsides of kidney issues or being a zombie without it or just being a laser focused zombie on it did not make it worth it to me.  Eventually i stopped and learned to live with it.  So i have to write down important self memos or set alarms for stuff.  Sometimes i have to repeat things to myself to get them to stick. Life was alright.  
Lately however, i have noticed that things have been getting worse for me.  
For example people frequently bring up things with me like “hey ionsife how come you didn’t do x when i asked you to do x y AND z?”
I didn’t even know they mentioned x to me if that makes sense.  I have many times where people mention details i should know and be familiar with,yet often its honestly the first time i ever hear of them.  It happens often enough now that i cannot say people forgot to tell me these things.
I can be having a conversation with someone,feel like its the most interesting chat of my life and then they say “ so remember earlier when i mentioned that my brother is a serial killer?”
“Of course,continue” when actually No.  No i don’t.  And that seems like a remarkable detail to miss.  How did i when i was so intent on listening to you? Stuff like that happens every day and its happening more.  
Even right now writing this post I’m trying to focus on what i have to say but my thoughts get 3 paragraphs ahead of my fingers and when i try to rewind the thoughts almost get corrupted and garbled. Sometimes my sentences go on and i forgot how they began and must re read themto understand what i was getting at.  at work a patient will tell me a few things, i will immediately go to the doctor to relay this information only to show up without a thought in my head or any recollection of what was just said to me.  This happens in the span of less than a minute most times.  
Lately ive noticed that ive had to do something i call “mentally holding my head still” to focus.  
A part of me has to hold myself still and almost point my minds eyes to the subject and force myself to focus on it.  And sometimes even that is enough distraction in itself to lose focus of what i was doing.

356,"So I got bitten by a street dog in Oaxaca, and am at risk of having rabies. 

&amp;#x200B;

One problem, I don't know exactly how big that risk is, and the PEP treatment is fairly expensive here in Mexico (around $3,000 USD, I've heard, but have not verified).

&amp;#x200B;

If the chances are 1 in 10,000, then paying $3,000 to avoid death means I'm willing to pay $30,000,000 for my life, which seems excessive. However, if the chances are 1 in 100, I would have to value my life at $300,000, which I would do without a doubt. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Risk Factors**

I've done a lot of research lately and found the following from various sources:

* If you do have rabies and don't get the PEP, fatality rate is basically 100% (and it's not a pleasant death either)
* In the region containing Oaxaca, between 80-100% of dogs are vaccinated (though that's an average. Some areas may be less)
* Around 70% of street dogs in Mexico are in good health
* I do not know what the transfer rate of rabies is (it's surprisingly hard to find this data point). If a dog *does* have rabies and bites a human, is it a guaranteed transfer?
* The dog was not displaying advanced symptoms, which based on the incubation period in dogs, means it would have to have contracted the rabies between 0-6 days prior to the bite
* The dog was unreasonably aggressive towards me. I was trying to give it food, and it accidentally bit the end of my index finger - where the nail meets the finger
* The bite was shallow and on my right index finger. It bled a lot, but I think that's primarily due to the location of the bite
* I went to a doctor and washed the wound about 5 minutes after the bite with iodine, ionized water (? something like that, I can't remember the name.) 
* The dog did have a lazy/crossed eye, which can be a result of nerve damage, which can happen in rabies cases. Other than that it was skinny, had it's tail between it's leg and seemed very timid, but would aggressively go for food, probably because it was skinny and very hungry. 

I'm currently taking some antibiotics for infection that the doctor gave me, but really need to consider whether to get the rabies PEP or not, as each day that passes I'm risking showing symptoms, it being too late, and guaranteeing death.

Any advice?",21Nov2018,1
358,"Context, I'm 19M, just finishing my first semester at University. Hate to word it like this, but I'll list off every ""character"" relevant to this whole shenanigan:
- Mom &amp; Stepdad
- Grandpa
- Dad
- George, a close friend of mine.

I've had a horrible relationship with my mom (and stepdad when he was unfortunate enough to exist) since I learned that her way of treating children is abusive, Dad stated out as being okay, up until I noticed he goes in more subtle ways, as does stepmom. 

HIGH SCHOOL:
My mom, the entirety of Senior year, put on tones of pressure to go to University, despite the fact that the State of Missouri's scholarships haven't given enough to cover it, claiming grandpa and her had me covered. They stated that with the scholarships I have, they can cover the remaining bit of it. I initially changed from my plan of University in favor of doing community college, since if I were to do that, the State of Missouri would literally be paying me ~$1,500+/ semester to go to school. Later, my mom actually assaulted me when she got angry that I didn't do this dual-enrollment plan in my last semester of high school. Long story short, I was already stressed as hell, not by a long shot was I wanting to do both High school AND college at the same time, especially since this would require me dropping the classes I had that helped me de-stress from the stressful classes. I moved with my dad the next day.

Dad, he was fine with it and understood my reasoning, only in my opinion he's a bit more subtly abusive, as in not much physical as my mom and stepdad. That, and he's proven just as hard to open about any personal issues as my mom.

COLLEGE DECISION:
My dad and I, per July, had the thought that I'd attend a university that offered similar scholarships as the situation with community college. Around August, mom and grandpa casually let me know that they still were offering they'll pay for me to go where I actually most wanted to go, so I took it up.

NOW:
There's about $3,000 left on the bill towards this Uni, and my mom and grandpa have thrown the idea of going through the process for loans. They seem to have forgotten that this entire time, my reasons for initially not taking the offer, was that I'd be stuck on loans and stuff. I have zero desire to go for loans for houses (I plan to only live in apartments anyways), cars (I was BARELY licensed by the State of Missouri sin), anything really. This is a dealbreaker for me, I hate that I have to leave this uni, but it's financially better. $3,000 for the this semester plus the next 7 is going to amount to $24,000, and that's not even considering interest that'll be on it. I do not want a damn loan to start off with.

I'm not going to register for next semester, I'm opting to get a job for the next would be semester, and just ""raise funds"", settle back home, etc. until I can do classes at my community college.

I'm just not sure how I'd handle the inevitable screaming and yelling from both of them once I leave, since mom and grandpa primarily are the ones that transport me out of my uni's city, thus they'd be here when I get all my stuff out of here, unless my dad somehow stands up and gets me out of there, all the while giving the worst ""I told you so"" of all time. I understand, I fucked up, thus once I see the fact that I did, I'm stopping it.

I don't like any of the environments of these homes, dad &amp; stepmom nor mom &amp; stepdad, so I'm so far opting to move in with the mentioned George. My main grief of that one is how there are literal flies everywhere, and I don't shower here because that includes the bathroom, and the sink, thus I rarely eat here. George (19M) pretty much trashed his house because he seems extremely careless about cleaning anything, and his parents haven't done much to combat this. I know once I move here, they might be a little annoyed by how I'd want to clean the shit out of that bathroom for one, since I can't trust that I'm cleaning myself, if the room itself has flies all over the place, and some brown crap on the bathtub I'd shower in.


**TL;DR
My family's about to get really pissed off (for their own separate reasons) that I'm not continuing university with loans. I'm moving back home with George, since the emotional environment is nicer, however I may annoy them with me not wanting flies sharing the room I'm showering in.
THe biggest issue I'm stuggling with is how to even tell everyone involved that I'm not going back to that Uni, since clearly we can't afford it, since mom and grandpa straight up lied to me about their agreement.**",21Nov2018,1
359,"A few years ago, being the nosy kid I was, picked up my mom’s phone and opened kik. I saw she had been texting another man and she sent him selfies and he said that she “looked yummy.” I asked her about it and she said it was an accidental message, and I knew better than to argue because she would never admit it. My dad saw a text once and she started crying and saying he never acted like he loved her, and then the next day they acted like it never happened. I don’t know what my dad saw, but I know my mom uses the same username and password for everything. Would it be wrong to log into her kik and screenshot the messages and give her the option to tell my dad or I will? Quite honestly my mother sucks, she is so close minded and Christian, but justified her own cheating. ",21Nov2018,1
360,"I am stuck in a decision.  Just a quick background history.  Grandmother raised me, however was emotionally manipulative and I was heading down a path in life where I needed her approval to feel good about myself.  I grew out of that need, however the rest of the family hasn't.  Fast forward to, today.  I've had an arms length relationship with her to avoid the toxic negativity she creates through passive aggressiveness.  Which has also been fostered by my leaving the area and moving 4 hours away.  She has been taken over by cousin who could be spitting image of my grandmother in the same way my grandmother acted.  So, i've been shunned somewhat.  No big deal.  I'm me and if they don't like it, it's their loss.

However.

I have 2 boys, 7 and 9.  A three year old girl.  A wife that just lost her mother to glioblastoma, about 5 mos ago.  The boys are starting their fall break today and have had a rough time with it.  The oldest is still grieving and trying to make sense of his Grandmother dying and his younger brother is a big bully to him (younger brother is bigger, too).  Wife keeps telling me to go but calls me when trouble happens because she needs to vent (don't we all?).

&amp;#x200B;

My brother and uncle are driving up to visit with my grandmother this afternoon.  I was able to visit with my grandmother a few months back and gave her hugs, told her thank you for all she did.  Told her I loved her, etc.  Even spoke to her by phone a couple of weeks ago.  My question is this.

Should I go and visit again, one last time?  My boys are fighting it out.  My wife is on adhd and antidepressants and still having problems coping with her life now with her mother gone.  My daughter wouldn't understand where her Dada went.  It's Thanksgiving weekend....  Any help would be appreciated.",21Nov2018,1
362,"I'll try and be as succint as I can, sorry for my bad English, etc. 

I smoke pot and drink a lot, sure, and I've tried other substances too, once or twice, I mean who didn't, but I have a friend whom I know since we were 4. We did a lot of things for the first time together; weed, alcohol, cigarrettes, LSD, for example. I always kept it somewhat together, but he has been in and out of drugs since we left high school until he started treatment. He went in cyclic periods of cocaine abuse, LSD, ecstasy, heavy drinking, etc. for four-five years until he almost got killed in an incident during a vacation in other country with his drug-buddies. At this time I didn't see him so much anymore, he always preferred to go out with them and I didn't know what to make of it, so I just accepted it. We were very young at the time.

After that incident, his parents forced him into rehab. He seemed to accept it really well, understanding the damage he had been doing and complying with every term the institution put before him. I couldn't even go to his house at this time under the institution orders.  

As time passed, his treatment showed great advances and I became the sole old times friend he was allowed to see, thanks to his family. I was with him through all his rehab process without having even a single beer in front of him, being very careful of not smelling or making crazy-times-related references. I tried to be there for him, without interferring in any way. We had a band together, he even met his current girlfriend in one of our shows, life seemed to be picking up.

One or two years since his first-sober-day, the rehab institution told us (me) that he entered the phase in which he was supposed to try and make a normal life: this meant he was allowed to go to parties (without consuming anything, of course) and pubs and get-togethers and whatnot. Something along the lines of 6 months after this change, he started to smoke pot. He managed to convince me and his other two friends, the other band members, that this was no motive of concern. Everything was ok, weed helped with his depression, etc, and we started to smoke with him. I know I'll probably get a lot of shit because of this, I was naive, I was a total fucking idiot, I know all of this. Please bear in mind that I was 23 at the time, I didn't know nothing, I just wanted to trust him.

The band broke up. Of course, some time later he started to drink. I learned this through his girlfriend, since I entered med-school that summer and stopped being able to hang out as much, and he started to work double shift, so same.

This morning, I woke to a message from his girlfriend that my friend had collapsed emotionally, had been lagging off in practically every aspect of his life and even confessed to have been taking cocaine and ecstasy a couple of times per month lately.

I don't know what to do. This is the first time I'm so desperate as to ask for advice on the internet. I'm too alone on this one. This friday he will come to have dinner at my place. One of the old band members will be there too. 

Should we blatantly confront him? Should we wait until he starts to vent? Should we speak to his parents so they can have him re-enter rehab?

What would you do?

363,"Slight backstory: My sister has been in and out of trouble the majority of her adult life (drugs, mostly). This past year, she got herself cleaned up and finally landed a fantastic job. She's making a LOT of money.  


I invited her to dinner tomorrow. She gave me a call back and asked what we were having. I told her the basics: turkey, potatoes, vegetables, pie, etc. She said that I should buy something fancier for dinner and that she'd pay me back through PayPal once I sent her the receipt. I asked why, and her response was ""I'm making so much money right now, and I know mom and dad would like to be pampered."" I was kind of taken aback by this, because my sister and I have been a little distant due to her legal troubles, so I kind of laughed it off. But she was serious, and kept saying that I should buy some fancy expensive food and that she'd reimburse me.  


I've been thinking about this, and 1) I can't figure out why she'd offer to do this, and 2) we already have dinner planned. I considered suggesting that, if she really felt like doing something nice for our family, she could help my cousin fund his wedding, or give my brother some money for his startup, or help me pay for a car repair. But I don't want to be a choosy beggar. I just don't really want to go out and buy something more for dinner just because my sister wants to burn some cash.  


Should I just drop it, and decline the offer? This is just a really weird situation for me, and I don't want to be an asshole.

But whenever we are with her she talks about her ex boyfriends and how “guys want her” and it gets even my sister(11) annoyed. Next is when they were in college and my brother made a comment that was supposed to be funny but she took it the wrong way and when on Tumblr.

369,"So, I was raised by a single mother who was addicted to meth and also homeless for periods of my childhood. My mother would routinely have 3-day long drug binge sessions with her friends, all houses up in her bedroom.  Aside from being told, ""Don't starve and don't get hurt"" I never really received any guidance in life and rarely interacted with normal adults. 

I'm now 31 and feel like I'm missing many basic life skills. I struggle to form new friendships, and suffer immensely from general stress and anxiety. I don't really have a framework for what's normal, and It's challenging to know, specifically, where my deficiencies lie.

370,"We met on the internet and have been best friends ever since, until 3-4 days ago after a serious conversation he told me he doesn't ""really feel like best friends anymore"". He said that he used to be so close to me just because he needed comfort, and now that he doesn't need that anymore, he can't put that much effort into our friendship anymore. He also said we can still be friends though, as if we broke up, but it just hurts so much to see the person I care about the most not caring at all. I'm probably a fool for holding onto this, but I don't want to see everything just go down the drain.  


I still don't understand why this happened. I don't want to believe that he's the type of person to just use somebody for comfort and then discard them when he no longer needs it. I'm scared that he just got tired of me, since I always tried to talk to him and ask him to hang out with me too. I wrote an angry message full of questions asking about what happened and why, but I don't know if I should send it to him. Part of me hopes that he just needs a bit of time away from me, and if I insist by sending him that message, it will just be the final push for him to leave completely. He has also never seen me angry, so that message might be a bit too much, but I feel like I shouldn't tone it down because he should know what I truly feel like.  


Ever since that happened, we exchanged a few casual messages about nothing important, and it hurts me so much that although he knows me very well and how much it affected me, he hasn't even asked about how I feel and how I'm dealing with it.  


In conclusion, my question is should I send him the message? (Asking him beforehand if he wants to put up with it) Should I wait a bit more? Should I just leave it in my notes until one day I delete it?",21Nov2018,1
371,"I (20F) wanna start off by saying I love my dad more than anything. And he loves me and my siblings very very much. 

So my step family and I are very different in almost every way. They’re preppy, rich, self centered and obnoxious people. They are very much all republicans when I am very much on the left side. No topic is safe for conversation because we disagree on everything. 

We have had a few altercations in the past, because I am not afraid to stand up for myself if I see something isn’t right. Last one happened almost a year ago in December when we all went skiing and they excluded me from everything. Or at least that’s how I felt. Words were said, and I didn’t talk to my step mom for months, and still haven’t talked to her daughter since. 

My step mom invited only my brother to go on a cruise with them then did a shitty job trying to cover it up. I wouldn’t have wanted to go anyways. 

I went to a psychiatric hospital twice this past year, once for seriously contemplating suicide and the other for cutting myself so deep I had to get stitches. No one from that side of the family said any words of condolences to me. My step mom told my dad that she didn’t know what to say so she wasn’t going to say anything. It’s been a few months since my last hospital visit and things haven’t been going so well. I haven’t gotten a single text from my step mom, or two step brothers and 1 step sister. And I know they know. 

I know how this photo shoot is going to go, and no matter what I do I know I’d much rather prefer to just be home and go Black Friday shopping with my mom like we do every year. But this year my dad asked specifically for his birthday that me, my brother, and my sister all go take the photos with his family. 

My sister isn’t going because she hates that side and is still hurt by the divorce. My brother is going but everyone loves him and he can do no wrong. I know I’m just going to be there, with so much anxiety standing awkwardly not talking to anyone. Then they are going to say how I exclude myself. But I don’t feel comfortable talking to people that I know don’t really care about me. 

I know if I go I’ll make my dad happy. If I don’t go then it would just cause more tension. But just thinking about this I’m worried I’m going to get triggered and have a panic attack in front of them, which would be one the most embarrassing things that could ever happen to me.

He would buy Tracfones in bulk and take them downtown where a man would pay him for the cost of the phone plus $20 per phone.  Around this time for some reason, there were limits as to how many phones you could buy (two per day per location), so my stepdad would load the family up in the car and we would drive around the state buying phones.  I was told to tell the cashier, if asked, that the phones were for victims of domestic violence.

Because of this, I'm now receiving benefits, almost all of which go directly on my rent as soon as I get it. I also borrowed some money from family, which I paid back immediately as well.

My main worry is feeding my Cat for the duration of the month, I can buy two boxes of 40 food pouches for £13, which SHOULD last him for nearly a month.

I'm not overly fussed about myself, because I know that I can receive help from my local food bank and whatnot. But an issue with that is that my electricity uses pay-per-use £5 cards, which I pop into my electricity reader, to top up that amount. Even if I do get help from the food bank, I won't be able to cook the food which I do get, though I could realistically get help with cooking the ingredients at a friend's or families place.

I'm very, very worried about not being able to feed my Cat, first and foremost, he's been front and centre in helping with my recovery and I want to make that up to him by giving him all the food he needs and as much love and attention as I could possibly show him.
But I'm also worried about how I'm going to live like this day-by-day, as my job was fairly well paid and I haven't known a financial desperation like this before.

The girl has been slowly pissing me off for the past year or so because she will almost always want to hang out with her annoying ass theatre friends that shes known for like 2 years than me or the other OGs that shes know basically all her life. A few months ago it was homecoming and I was thinking about asking the girl but then decided not too because it was more fun and less pressure going alone. Keep in mind that I don't like her in a love way, but I knew that she liked me since like 6th grade, she also knew that I liked someone else at the time. I was only thinking to ask her because she was my closest friend that was a girl and I figured that she would be really fun and cool and not a lot of pressure and I also wanted to have fun with her during the night instead of her ditching us for her other friends. It was the second to last day to buy tickets and she came up to me and asked me to ask her so I was like alright. Anyways we went to homecoming and danced and I slow danced with her for the last slow song, then the dance was over and we left. Then at school she seemed mad and distant for like and week then it was pretty much back to normal. I just figured whatever but then she wanted to talk. She asked me if I liked her and I said no (which she should have known already, I told her a month ago I liked someone else and have given a mass amounts of hints that Im not into her over the past like 6 years) and then she was like ""then why did you even ask me to homecoming?"" i wanted to say ""because you asked me to dumbass""  but I said ""I wanted to go with you because you wanted me to and I thought it would be fun,"" which then she replies ""Ok well I just need some space to get over you."" Then I made sure we were good and she wasnt ending our friendship or anything and she wasnt and it seemed fine from there. All I had to do was give her space for a while (even though I thought that was shit because she has nothing to get over in the first place, We never dated or had any sort of romantic moments or whatever). Now adays (its been like 2 months since we had that talk and 3 months since homecoming)  it seems like she hates me. I sit next to one of her annoying ass theatre friends and when ever in that class we get work time the friend would tell her to come sit over there so they could work together but she was like ""Well I dont want to sit over there because ya know... "" and  then her theatre friend said ""Ok dont worry thats irrelvant."" Did that bitch just call me irrelevant? When ever shes with her annoying ass theatre friends and I walk by she makes like a throw up noise and Im pretty sure its directed tword me and not just from their conversation. Ive never said anything but if I do it would be along the lines of ""A throw up noise? Bitch your the one that liked me so I know damn well Im not ugly enought to make you throw up."" Anyways Im kinda just done with her but the problem is that she was one of my top people to hang out with along with her brother. I kinda feel very along right now because I dont have that many friends that I actually hang out with, I usually keep just a core friend group with people I really trust and have fun with but now thats kinda fucked up.",21Nov2018,1

I can't focus and I hold my ears and won't take in the information. Please, somebody, tell me there's a cure. Imagine thinking about having nails under your toenails and kicking a stone wall.

393,"So, I've never dealt with these kind of situations before and I would like advice or past experiences that would help me on how to best handle it. Sorry for the long post, TLDR at the bottom. 

I've moved in a house with my best friend a few weeks ago so, and it has 3 occupied rooms. Apart from my friend, I don't know the others very well.
Today, I heard the person in the next room make horrible retching sounds. I knocked on his door to ask if he was okay and he sounded like he was panicking even though he said he was okay. I asked him if he wanted help, or if I could call anyone, or if he needed anything and I could hear him being very upset but he said no that 'he'll be fine', that he just took 3 tablets of ibuprofen on an empty stomach and that he'll throw it up. 

Over the next hour, he has thrown up a few more times, each time sounding very painful. He was obviously very unwell so I offered to take him to the nearest walk-in. He started begging for me not to do so and not to tell anyone. At this point I was freaking out and trying hard not to let him see that so not to aggravate the situation. 

An electrician came in soon after that, this made the housemate panic as that meant a witness and he felt very self-conscious. And he kept repeating he had a 'stomach bug'. I took the opportunity to go to the chemist to ask for advice as I was suspicious he had taken more than 3 tablets. They said to go to the hospital immediately or call emergencies. 

I came back and told him I want to bring him to the hospital because he needs medical advice. He got very scared and panicked every time I started suggesting I would bring him to the doctor or the hospital or would call 111 or 999 (non-emergency medical advice vs emergency). But then he would also start to say that he had taken a lot more tablets (mix of painkillers with alcohol) and wanted to end his life and would start going round and round about all the things he thought were wrong in his life. I put my foot down and said I would dial 999. He freaked out and started panicking and it took a long time for me to convince him to let me call for help. So I called 111 and put them on speaker, as I knew that if they thought it was urgent enough, they'd transfer to an ambulance service. Of course, they did and I stayed with him until the ambulance arrived. 

He was obviously vary shaken and very upset and was intermittently throwing up, although he didn't want me in the room when he was. So I would step out and ask permission to come back in. He would always say yes. He had calmed down a bit by that point and didn't seem on the verge of a panic attack or an angry burst. I'm not gonna lie, he scared me a couple times in the way he would say he did not want to leave the house. 
I did my best to be close to him and soothing at all times. Eventually, ambulance team came, asked questions and took him with them. They said he didn't want me to go with him to the hospital, even though I offered to.

I'm feeling guilty for forcing him to go to the hospital but he clearly needed medical/professional attention. I felt helpless most of the time, and now I'm worried about what happens when he comes back. 

TLDR: housemate said he took a lot of painkillers to end his life. I tried to help him through him being sick for a few hours and until the ambulance arrived.

I guess my question is, what would be the best way to go forward from this? He is adamant he doesn't want to seek professional help but at the same time he is dead set on the idea that he is all alone without support.

396,"I’ve worked in a business with my brother for 3 and a half years. I am not a stakeholder in it or cofounder, just helping to grow it, mainly doing marketing. I trust my brother will pay me what I deserve once we make some money, but I’m doing this for free right now and I can’t do this anymore. I’ve been waiting for a ROI and it’s taking way too long - in the mean time I have a part time job, but I can’t even afford to move out of my parents house right now. I only went to school for two years and a large reason I didn’t go back was because I was helpful the business would turn into something. 

It’s really been a grind and I feel taken advantage of. I should have been more assertive and told him I needed to be paid but the way I thought of it was that if he didn’t pay me then all that money would go back to the business and essentially we would be able to grow it quicker and make more money in the long run. But I can’t live like this anymore. 

I’ve been considering going back to school and either dropping the business altogether or just doing a little on the side here or there. I’ve always had the “entrepreneurial gene” but I just don’t even care at the moment- I just need steady income and maybe I’ll start a business later in life. 

I recently discussed that I needed to get paid and he said he could pay me monthly (a very small amount) and we will check back in three months and see how things are looking. It isn’t promising and all of this gives me anxiety. I just feel stuck. Like this has held me back and if I hadn’t done it I could’ve gone to college and been starting a career by now.

Some back story on my old roommate and I: 
I lived with her for almost a year. She let me move in to a duplex. She neglected to tell me her neighbors had been harassing her for years. Well they started harassing me as well. We got dog poop rubbed on our doors and my tires got slashed. The neighbor also verbally assaulted me. So we moved to a new house. Everything was fine until I had a mental breakdown. She called the cops on me and I was hauled away for a night in the mental hospital (which was not a good time and some questionable shit happened but that’s a whole other story). So when I got home and still not feeling good or remotely in my head she told me I need to leave because of all this. So whatever, I leave and plan to never speak to her again. She also withheld my security deposit from me which I decided to forget about so I would never have to talk to her again. 
But now she is working at this job that I have always wanted to work at and I don’t know how to handle it. I don’t trust this person and she gives me a panic attack just thinking about being around her. I don’t feel remotely safe in her presence. Should I just talk to me boss about her?

Well he is trying to quit again and keeps claiming if he had workout equipment to manage his stress he wouldn't smoke, etc. Well I went out and bought like almost $1000 worth of home gym workout equipment - and he knows I did this, as I was going to give it to him for Christmas but decided I would give it to him early (this coming up weekend to be exact) with the contingency that he stops smoking at the exact moment it was purchased (about a week ago) - in fact he looked me dead in the eye, shook my hand and agreed from that moment on he would never smoke again. Well a few days ago he admitted to me he bought a pack of cigarettes, smoked one and felt bad about the fact he had lied and threw the rest of the pack away (idk if that is true, I have to take his word that he is being honest for the simple fact he told me)  

  

Well today, he said he was putting in gas and I told him don't buy any cigarettes and he just blew up on me, SCREAMING at me for lecturing him and that its his body and he can do whatever the fuck he wants and if he does buy some he wouldn't tell me anyways. Now this gym equipment is due to arrive at my house Friday and then he hung up on me and well he is at work now so he didn't even say anything after that. I am seriously pissed off because 1) IT IS my business he is smoking for the simple fact he made that promise to me and 2) I spent all that money on the workout stuff which was contingent on him not smoking anymore. 3) that is my best friend and of course I want him to quit and be healthy. and 4) he shouldn't be yelling at me like that because I do not deserve that. Do I have a right to be pissed off?  

  

Not to mention that we have been on rocky ground lately as it is because of the way he has been talking to me and putting other people before me which is bullshit because I stuck by him when he got out of jail and I am the only reason he is living in the house he is in and has the car he has because I GAVE him the money for it. He feels I am too needy and pushy and clingy and maybe so but thats my best friend and idk. Any advice please would be very much appreciated.

405,"Hey Guys,
planned to do a long one ft. my whole life but thought it'd be stupid so I'll go with this short one instead.

I am 18 years old.

I 'met' a girl at work (she's been a coworker during her studies and now works in a different city).
And I do like her.
So far so good.
First 'problem' : she is 9 years older than me.

We understand each other pretty good and play Video Games together basically every day. Some Weeks ago I stayed at her place over a weekend and we went to a concert together.
This all sounds good yes but
I'm just a friend. And I'd like to be just that given the fact that I don't think she'd love me in any world and that I don't feel like having a gf since my life is kinda a mess and I should fix that before having a gf.
On the other side, I feel different.
Like - in my Head I'd be fine with being her best friend but my feelings just tell me different, you know?

She just broke up with her Boyfriend like a month or two ago and still has some problems with him that I've been helping her with (not that she still loves him or anything, she hates him)

I just don't know how to move on from here on.
I'd like to just stay her best friend and delete those feelings but I can't.
But I also don't want to ruin this friendship just by telling her about how I feel.

Feels like no matter what I do, I'll mess things up...

(if you need to know more to give proper advice ask in comments, i'll try to answer within an hour if i am not sleeping - once i think i figured it out i'll delete this post and account, thanks to everyone that will try to help me)

408,"Firstly sorry if this is a bad format, I'm mostly a lurker and this is my first time here.

We'll call 
Friend who is being distant; Thomas
Friend who this 'drama' centres around; Robert

So, a little bit of background. We're all 17 and are in our last year of highschool (in the UK after highschool you go to college, university, employment or an apprenticeship). We've been friends for around 5½ years and have had arguments and fallings out but for the most part have been pretty close. We're all pretty nerdy, play lots of video games and play Dungeons and Dragons.

A few weeks after me and Thomas talked and got past some issues mainly about some of my jokes going a bit far without me realising we all started playing D&amp;D again. We play the first session on Thursday and everyone talks about how his character is a bit overly sexual, trying to flirt, seduce or have sex with almost any NPC. Robert, one of my players (and the catalyst of this story) felt a bit awkward about it so brought it up but Thomas got very cagey and defensive. As the game master I saw how my players were feeling so sent Thomas a message asking him to just tone it down a little, he never responded but the next session he was much better and everyone, including him, seemed to enjoy it more.

After a session on Sunday Thomas noticed he had lost two of his dice. I live around 8 miles away and busses are infrequent on Sundays so I had to get home and Thomas knew Robert was already near an hour late to see his schizophrenic mother who he's lucky to see more than once a week. So when Thomas asked Robert to help him find his dark purple dice in the pitch black when he's already late to see his mum Robert says no.

The next day on Monday Robert and Thomas go to the shops for lunch and being head boy, Robert has to go to a pupil council meeting and told Thomas this 3 times. When already late because of waiting for Thomas while he was toy shopping for his little sister, Robert left for the meeting.

On the bus home Thomas called Robert self centered and when Robert asked for examples Thomas said it didn't matter. When we got off the bus Thomas asked if him and Robert should go separate ways and when Robert asked why Thomas said that he didn't want to talk.

Thomas storms off so I walk Robert home and talk with him and we're both concerned he's maybe got something going on in his home life.

Later that night Robert messages Thomas asking what's going on but Thomas didn't reply. 

The following day Thomas blanks the whole friend group, doesn't sit with or talk to us and actively goes out of his way to avoid being near Robert to the point of moving seat in class and lurking around until Robert walks away from someone to talk to them. I talk to Robert alot throughout the day to make sure he's holding up.

Today was the exact same as yesterday. Robert even tried talking to Thomas today asking if he's alright but Thomas just quickly said he was fine then walked away. I know we're teenagers and drama is fairly normal but in nearly six years of friendship Thomas has never been like this, even about things which seem much worse.

Thomas has been distant since Tuesday morning so I've not been able to speak to him as he would ignore my messages. Me and Robert are both worried about our friend, what should we do?",21Nov2018,1

I also realize that I'm not the prettiest girl out there and I'm probably not his type (not that he is a model).

413,"Preface: My boyfriend and I have been happily together for about 2.5 years with a significate age difference (24 and 37). My boyfriend doesn't make much more than I do and we pay all the house bills 50/50. He has helped me once with a down payment on my car but I paid him back for that. We work opposite shifts but it works for us since we are independent people who value alone time, as well as our weekends we get to spend together. I guess our relationship is unconventional but we love each other and work very well together. My mom and I have a good relationship and haven't had a fight or disagreement since I was a teenager. I am also very bad at dealing with confrontation, especially with my mother.

  
Story: My mom has never told me she had a problem with the age difference at any point, but she constantly makes comments/ jokes insinuating I'm a 'golddigger', looking for someone to pay my rent, and that I have daddy issues. Her sense of humor has always been to roast me and my sister on a frequent basis (which is fine I can take a joke and give it back as much as I take it), but I feel like she is breaching on a personal boundary of mine and putting me a bad light with my other family members. 

  
Yesterday we were hanging out with other family members and I mentioned that my boyfriend and I were looking for a bigger house that had 3 bedrooms in order for us to have a master bedroom and both of us to have our own personal rooms for our hobbies. That's when she started in with 'your replacement daddy better get a better paying job if he still plans on supporting you' and 'sounds like you just want to be single since you guys don't even see each other and want separate rooms but then I guess you can't afford rent on your own.' They have made other jokes in the past about me trying to get the 'daddy experience' and whatnot, which is VERY creepy and really hurts my feelings even if they are just joking.

  
I'm normally a very calm and mellow person, but hearing everyone laugh along with her...just made me see red and I felt like I needed to get out of there. I calmly told everyone I was leaving and then came the 'oh throwaway, she's just making a joke don't be such a snowflake.' That's when I raised my voice and told them that it's easy for them to sit there and make daddy issue jokes about me when they have their own fathers laughing alongside them (I'm the only one in the family that doesn't have their father in their life), and that I'm not going to take the constant attacks about my relationship from a woman who hasn't had one in over a decade and left the house. 

  
I went home and stewed over it and feel like a piece of shit and don't really know where to go from here. I could have talked about it privately with her that I don't like those kinds of jokes, but I just snapped and tried to hurt her like I felt she hurt me. She sent me a text a couple of hours ago asking if I was still coming to Thanksgiving, I really want to call and apologize but I don't know if I was being an asshole or just defending myself. Maybe both? What should I say?   


  
TLDR; My mom was making jokes about me being a golddigger and having daddy issues and I snapped and said something mean to her. How do I fix it?",21Nov2018,1
414,"Hi.

I am a graduate student and my director is a postdoc student who keeps claiming that we are in an equal position which is not true per se. We had had a fight previously. For me because of his unorganized instruction and language barrier. For him, he did not like my attitude and said I am emotional. 

I am currently struggling with experimenters' procrastination and nonresponding behavior to my email and any contact. I have been telling the postdoc they don't reply me back. However, last time when I told him I had tried to contact them but never gotten a response, he told me my email tone is negative and offensive which is the point where I do not understand because it is just cold email like you have to do your job - I checked my email with another coworker (English Speaker) and she said it does not sound offensive at all. Anyway, so ever since he told me that I am offensive, I am kind of afraid of telling him I emailed them and no response and being told by him no response due to my offensive attitude.

But I really don't mind emailing the experimenters and dealing with their lack of motivation. Thing is I do my job and there is nothing I can do with the lazy people, I have been asking for help but he is telling me I am offensive, and I am afraid of being told that I am offensive when I ask help.

So I want to ask advice what does he mean when he said ask help if I don't like to email. Also, what should I do with this person? IDK. This work is all confusing and communicating with him is really frustrating.",21Nov2018,1

417,"Hey all thanks for checking this post out. I’m currently a sophomore in college and I’ve decided it’s finally time for me to make a final decision on what I want my major to be. Keep in mind both of these majors have the same requirements and I’ll be on track for both. My choices are in between marketing and computer information systems.
For marketing I’m currently in an internship revolved around social media marketing and I really enjoy it! It’s definitely something I could see myself doing for the rest of my life. But I’m not stupid it’s not a STEM major so I know I won’t make a lot of money unless i move up the corporate ladder quickly. 
For CIS I’ve always had a knack for computers and have been very good at understanding them if I put in effort. Since this is a STEM career there is more money here and the job market is stable. I’m just not sure I’d enjoy it as much as I would marketing. Since I want to decide by next semester I won’t have an internship to tell me which I want to enjoy better.
Any advice or personal experience would be much appreciated!
Thanks!",21Nov2018,1

Hi fellow redditors,

I have gotten myself into quite the dilemma and I need some help making a decision. I'm a recent graduate from a Masters of Health Admin program and I have been applying for executive admin fellowships, as well as other job opportunities within the hospital I currently work at. I'm an admin assistant, and after getting my graduate degree, I have been seeing a lot of interest and feedback from my applications.

I live in NJ with my boyfriend and commute each day into Philadelphia for work. The commute is awful, the city wage tax is awful and my current job is not going anywhere productive.. I was offered a fellowship with a medical center in NJ, about 2 hours away which would require us to move (we rent, have no kids- so not that big of a problem). In addition to this offer, a different department at my current health system is recruiting me heavily for a Laboratory Operations &amp; Compliance Manager position and they are working on an offer letter to send me.

**Fellowship-** 1-year rotational structure program with exposure to senior c-suite executives, strategic operational projects and 6 acute care disciplines within the medical center. Salary is $52,000/yr. Most fellows take a program/project management role upcon completion, with many going on to the Director level within 3 years of completion. Does not start until June

Pros- exposure to senior level executives, wide breadth of experience, clear structure &amp; professional development, proven record of success from previous fellows, opportunity to work on system level projects, Opportunity to move closer to our ideal location

Cons- would be moving about an hour away from my family, will need to find a place to live, would be less money during the first year

**Laboratory Operations &amp; Compliance Manager-** Includes responsibilities to manage team of administrative and laboratory employees (\~30) as well as act as a compliance specialist for all lab operations. Work directly with COO, Clinical Department Director and Administrator. Salary range is anywhere from $65,000-87,000/year. Position could start immediately

Pros- staying within current health system, direct experience managing lab team and compliance regulations, management seems prepared to offer mentorship and operational support, higher starting salary than the fellowship

Cons- unclear direction for professional development, small range of exposure at a department level, will still have the same commute, could take several years to advance beyond role, no clear training structure, many operational challenges that need to be addressed by incumbent

My ultimate goal is to go into Compliance and Strategic Business Development at an executive level, so both positions are great opportunities. My boyfriend and I also want to move into the NJ coastal region, which the fellowship would allow us to do However, I'm fearful that the Manager position will pigeon-hole my career into a specific area instead of allowing me to become well rounded in a number of operational disciplines.

Do I sacrifice the higher salary in the short-term in order to ensure my continued advancement to a higher level? Or do I take the higher salary, which would allow me some financial freedom and worry about my career planning once I'm at the next step? And how wrong is it to accept the Manager position for 6 months and if I don't like it, move on to the Fellowship in June?

Any advice is appreciated!!",21Nov2018,1

I have wrinkles forming at 26...at the corners of my mouth. They make me look like I'm frowning but ironically they're from how my skin moves when I smile. The left side is far worse than the right. I have three in total, but the third is barely noticeable. What can I do to lessen these? I'm open to anything...including fillers and what not. :/

Current Skincare Routine:

Wash my face in the morning, just water. Use Cetaphil moisturizer. Put make up on if I'm feeling it. Come home, shower or wash face to remove make up. Exfoliate with St. Ives. Sometimes moisturize again if my skin is dry. If not, I just use Roc intensive anti wrinkle cream and eye cream (I haven't been doing this religiously though). These have retinol in them. Maybe I've been inconsistently applying these for about 8 months.

My diet is pretty clean. Lost 30 pounds recently. Only drink coffee, water and liqour.

I've used sunscreen all my life but I honestly don't think I ever slathered it around my lips. I have no signs of wrinkles anywhere else on my face.

My skin type is a lovely (sarcasm) combination of dry and oily.

Any help would be appreciated. I'm even open to filler or botox. I feel like I'm way too young for this kind of wrinkle. Crows feet would bother me wayyy less...since they wouldn't give me a frowny look. :[",21Nov2018,1

425,"So.. long story incoming and i don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

So i met a girl in May this year, and the moment i saw her i was in love. So we started talking en became best friends, that friendship with her had been the most real thing i've ever felt in my entire life. But i couldn't do anything with my love feelings, cause she had a boyfriend for 7 years. From a lot of conversations with her i knew that her relationship with that boy wasn't good. the way he treated her was just trash, she didn't deserve that. She actually deserves the world. So i had been helping her when she felt down and stuff. then after 6 or 7 months they broke up. And my love feelings came floating back in at lightning speed. So i admitted to her that i had feelings, then she told me if i would develope more feeling she couldn't resist it anymore and her feelings would come to. So ye guess what happened? So we got into a relationship but now her whole family is against us and me. after 2 weeks i came to introduce myself to them, and at the beginning it looked okay and i really thought they'd like me? 

&amp;#x200B;

But since they still have a good connection with her ex, ( the one that sexually assaulted her multiple times and broke her phone if she wouldn't go down on him.) so the ex got the key to the house from her little brother which is like 9 years old. than he came into her room and started yelling for 30 minutes or more to her. that made me so pissed but i still didn't wanna get involved. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my girlfriend and her sisters made things better between the two of them and started talking again. so they involved me into the convo's to, than after 2 days of talking i used a meme as a joke cause the sister said my boyfriend just woke me up. So i joked ( he woke u up with the D ehhhhhhhhhhhh) 

&amp;#x200B;

And from there on it went downwards, as much as i didn't wanna get involved her mother just pm'ed me on facebook asking me to leave them the fuck alone. And all because of that stupid meme/joke. So my girlfriend went crazy mental on her mom telling her to fuck off and leave her the hell alone, and stuff

&amp;#x200B;

But funny fact, my girl lives with her grandparents cause of the fact that her parents NEVER supported her in stuff and shit so she moved out. she already has a really bad connection with the familly. and im feeling like im making it worse. i don't know what to do anymore and i can't talk about this to other people..

&amp;#x200B;

I REALLY someone here has a good advice for me.. Cause im going crazy, we both love each other so much and this really feels like true love cause of the connection we built up in 8 months. We literally talked EVERYDAY.

Every month the company moves its prices around to create seasonal sales promotions and incentives to buy.

We have around 20 price sheets that need to be printed every month, sorted out, and sent to the stores.

These become very time consuming to print and ship to each of the locations and I know there is a better way to solve the problem of informing our customers with the pricing they can look at and take home to their SO to discuss what they would like to purchase.

My budding idea is to have everything on a single tablet in each store that can display the price sheet you are interested in and be able to send it to your email or something similar so you have access to it at home. It needs to be quick, easy, and simple for the customer to obtain and access this information.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 32, sister is 33. Raised by a single mum, as kids we saw and experienced things no child should go through. We were never sexually assaulted but were present when mother was intimate on several occasions. Mothers partner would lock us in room and turn lights out (knowing we were frightended of the dark). Hit mother infront of us and one of the most powerful memories was when he left and I remember mother screaming out the door ""Don't go please!""

&amp;#x200B;

What followed was many years of fighting and arguments. My mother had a good job but I feel I ruined her Life because when she would come home I'd cause an argument, tear up her paperwork and let the days frustrations out on her. She quit her job and ever since hasn't done anything for herself.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today, my sister and I have good jobs but my mother just sits at home, no gym, not a great diet, back problems, knee problems, bad foot etc. And It saddens me to think that I ruined everything for her. She would have had a pension, a social Life etc.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister and I blamed mother for many years and we still argue, but now the argument is no longer about us trying to hurt each other but to get her back living. I work in fitness so trying to get her to go gym, lose some weight, improve diet but she doesn't want to do anything, just sit and wither away.

431,"Roommate moved out and after my first roommate choice fell through kind of last minute, my roommate suggested her friend, M. I was very hesitant at first because I did not necessarily want someone associated with my roommate (we were quite incompatible), but after meeting this friend and seeing we were essentially on the same page about cleanliness, I let her know the room was hers. The process for this is: I tell my landlord who I’ve chosen and my landlord meets with the person to get approved.

So I met with M on Fri, 11/9 and then on 11/12, I let her know that she can have the space and I got her in contact with the landlord, and in response - 12hrs later - she told me she would like to move in 11/19. But since then, she either continues to respond to my texts 12+hrs later or not at all. For example, last week, I asked her if had she met with the landlord, and she responded a full day later saying she’d meet with them this (past) weekend. On Saturday, I let her know what is due for internet (billed in advance) for the first month - no response. On Monday - 11/18 - after not hearing from her at all, I texted her checking in and kind of reminding her that she said she wanted to move in the next day - no response until just today, 10min ago where she apologized and said she wants to move in 11/28.

She’s always apologizing for her delay (“Pardon my delay!”) in responding, but it rubs me the wrong way. I understand people are busy - I work 80hr days 6 days a week - but no one is too busy to send a text about something as pertinent as shelter/housing, but still find time to update their Instagram. As a future roommate, I’ll often need to contact her with time sensitive stuff or re. bills and I really don’t appreciate waiting days for a reply. And for someone looking for a place to live, it’s strange to me that she doesn’t make communicating with me some kind of priority. I prefer to live with someone who is better with communicating, and I’ve just asked her if there is a better way to reach her and she simply replied, “Phone or text is fine.”

I keep myself pretty open minded but I am also a skeptic and very critical of any information I'm presented with. Here are some points outlining the issue and I'd appreciate any help with grappling with this:

1) Her philosophy basically revolves around a belief that the modern medical industry is a system that deceives the population for financial gain (I don't oppose this idea, actually) and that resources for treatments and cures exist that the mainstream population...just doesn't do? I guess. 

2) I range from being skeptical to outright unconvinced. From *""that's unlikely to be effective otherwise everyone would be doing it""* to *""there's no fucking way running a special brush along your skin will 'brush out' the toxins from your lymph nodes""*

3) Typically her response to my skepticism is that I am close minded, and that if I only did the research for myself, I'd see the truth (paraphrase). My response to this is to not bother wasting my time reading a bunch of quack literature or listening to people speak about medicine that's probably flat out bullshit.

4) But then I catch myself in this pattern of thinking: It's not fair that I immediately write something off as bullshit. I *haven't* actually done the research for myself, so how the hell do I know? Skepticism and critical thinking are important to me and my philosophy; I can't simply accept something just because someone tells me it's so, but by the very nature of that mindset, I can't right something off as fake unless I actually look into it critically. So I guess I'm just lazy cause I don't want to put the work and time in. 

5) I fear one day me or one of my siblings will come down with a serious medical condition or disease, and will be not only battling disease, but also caught in a struggle between whether or not to seek conventional treatments or my mom's treatments, and the emotional and mental stress that will compound the situation",21Nov2018,1

Recently I was able to eliminate some debt and have some wiggle room to use on credit cards. I was thinking of finishing my bachelors degree and began to research what it would take. To finish my undergrad, I need 12 classes- ranging in credit hours, but most are 3 credit classes. I was researching tuition costs and for a 3 credit class, it would cost me $1500 at the university I began to take all my classes at.

My other option would be to transfer all credits to a community college and just receive an associates degree from them. I would be able to take a few CC courses for a much lesser cost, but the bulk of credits would HAVE to be taken at the university. So, is it worth it to take the classes and finish my degree?

She asked if I wanted to room with her, which seemed fine because we are still pretty good friends and I dont know anyone else at that university so it would just be easier. She then proceeded to tell me how shitty her life is going right now and how many people shes had to cut from her life. The thing is she said I'm the only one she still really ever talks to.

About a year ago she had gotten kittens and her landlord was okay with it besides having a no pet policy. Her roommates were okay with having the kittens around too. 
Fast forward to now, one roommate in particular has been complaining about the kittens and how they have too much energy and they are always in the way. The other roommates are completely fine with the cats. Now, the landlord is complaining about the cats. They both have been complaining to my friend and have both said indirectly to get rid of the cats. Personally I think this is completely unfair. Then my friend receives this text message from the landlord

My friend has asked me to keep the cats until she moves out. But, I don’t think this is right of the landlord and the roommate to do. They both were perfectly fine with the cats in the beginning so why now are they complaining and there is this undertone of ‘get rid of the cats or move out’. Is there anything my friend can do?

444,"I'm looking for thoughts on whether or not to quit my job to focus on my family. Background- I was a sahm for 10 years until my youngest was in school full time then I got a MA and started my career. We had another baby who is now 2 and I've been working for four years. I LOVE working and consider it a hobby (that pays!!!) but lately my family is super struggling and one of my children is suicidal to the extent he will likely be admitted for partial hospitalization next week (we are on a trip) My husband has been struggling with anorexia and depression (but can't really quit his job at this moment- another story but it's not really an option for another six months). We do not depend on my career for money at all tho it's a nice bonus and I really do enjoy working, but I think I could find ways to fill my time. Baby would stay in daycare but would likely go for half days. I wouldn't quit forever just for the current school year if things have stabilized by next year.

446,"Hey guys,

Ever since I was young, my dad has had a gambling problem where he would gamble for a day or two and has probably lost close to $300,000 over his life time. Every time he does this, my mum becomes 'suicidal' (I'm not sure how serious she is, but she grabs knives and takes excessive amount of pills but then spits them out). 

In the past five years I've started 'protesting' him whenever he does this. I've yelled and swore to try and get him to realise things but that didn't work. One time, I found him at the pokies and asked him to come home and he rejected me. More recently, I just stopped talking to him because I get really angry and worked up and I'm hoping he stops because of my stance.

My mum gets really angry with me and says I have no right to do this because I'm a kid and he's my father. I know my dad help put me through school and did a lot for me but the way he's fractured our family is a difficult pill to swallow and the fact that he can lose $6000 a night and there are no consequences is really messed up. Sorry if this is really jumbled, if any clarification is needed, please let me know and thanks for reading all this. ",21Nov2018,1
447,"Hi everybody. Throwaway because talking about the abuse my mother has put me through makes me nervous and I don't want friends to possibly trace this to me. This is a long post so there's a TLDR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

So, as the title says, I'm having a lot of trouble. Essentially, I live in a house with my neglectful, emotional and abusive mother, a man who has financially been enabling her for 3 years (since my family moved in after only knowing him for a month. I had no say in the matter.), my brother and my boyfriend. The plan between my boyfriend and I is for me to get my license, get a job and move out. My boyfriend works full time with a good paying job, but it's not enough for us to move out on right now. There are things in his life that need to be fixed or paid off. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 19 and have been unable to get my license. I'm using a car that seriously has something wrong with it every couple of weeks. The parking break, the transmission, possibly the catalytic converter and just today the third gear stopped working. I've said for awhile that this car is becoming unusable though I am grateful for it. Me saying this hasn't really mattered. I went to take my road test twice, and there was something wrong with it both times, though it had been to the mechanic to fix the issues. Every other vehicle in the household is unusable to me, also broken in some way or lacking a parking break which I need for the test.  Not being able to drive anywhere is a huge problem, as there are no jobs I can get to without driving to them. 

&amp;#x200B;

On a non-financial note, I'm tired of the abuse. I've become severely depressed. Due to unfortunate circumstances and me choosing bad friends, I only have one friend other than my boyfriend that I hang out with regularly, and she's actually away at college, so by regularly I mean once a month, if that. There are actually quite a few people interested in hanging out with me, but I've ignored texts and skipped hangouts due to lack of energy from depression, sudden social anxiety I've never had before and the fact that I don't want to be a burden and have people pick me up and drive me everywhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mother, though I don't think she even realizes it all the time, is rude, neglectful, hurtful, and even narcissistic. I'm tired of her, ""I deserve the world because I've been wronged by it for so long, and no, I can't give you grocery money, but I did just buy a $40,000 RV with someone else's money,"" way of living. I'm tired of being around her, but not sure where to go. There is no family I could or would feel comfortable going to. Her attitude has isolated her and consequentially me from old family. I suppose I could reach out, but I'm nervous. I also don't think anyone would have room to house me.

&amp;#x200B;

I've asked for the broken car to be exchanged, as it is technically my mother's and I can't do it without her, but she has been too depressed recently, despite her new trailer and truck (equaling maybe $60,000 if not more) because the man who has been giving her money is now poor and we have to move out. I do NOT want to live with her any longer, here or in another house, apartment, trailer or whatever. I'm beyond tired of this situation.  She has spent decent chunks of these 3 years away from home (leaving myself and my 13 year old autistic brother behind), spending weeks at a time in her camper, or her ""office,"" which is a room in a factory building, coming home for weekends to see us, eventually becoming surprised when no one was excited to see her. '

&amp;#x200B;

I'm severely depressed, as I've said, as well as socially anxious and without enough close family or friends, dependent on a neglectful mother and some guy who pays for her every whim and fancy. (She took a flight down to FL last month because the weather was depressing her. She was going to go again for Thanksgiving and bring my brother, but now they've realized there wasn't enough money.) These past 3 years have been horrible and I am very close to having a nervous breakdown. Not that it would matter. There have been two times I have felt I needed to go to the hospital and I was ignored and told I was overreacting. Anyways, at best, my ""home"" provides me pretend solitude where I can almost daily (on days she's here, of course) hear arguing even from my unfinished basement room which has no door which means no privacy. 

&amp;#x200B;

To paint a little more of a picture of what I've gone through with my mom, here are some stories:

1. She loudly said the name of my sexual abuser on an airplane in an effort to embarrass me after I asked her to not complain so loudly about a crying baby. 
2. I had a conversation with her where I asked her to bring me to the gym as she had said she would the day before, and somehow it turned into a pity party for her and she asked me if it would make me happy if she were to slit her wrists and die. Many other conversations, about her behavior or not turn into a pity party for her. She also seems incapable of realizing she's done wrong, unless she's feeling very down on herself. This is something that has happened once or twice.
3. I once bothered her on the phone when I was 15 or so, and she called me a bitch and told me to be quiet. The first, but not the last of many completely unnecessary reactions and examples of verbal abuse. 
4. Many places that we go, she proudly tells strangers that she had to ""force me to have a non-normal life,"" referring to how she pulled me out of school, which I never wanted. It screwed up my social life and education. She never tells people she pulled me out because I wasn't doing well after a terrible relationship which gave me PTSD.
5. She cancelled her insurance, my brother's and mine. I was unable to see a therapist which I desperately needed, and I didn't go to the doctor or dentist as often as I should have. She also never helped with braces though I was told I had to have them. I now have my own insurance and will be trying to take care of that. 

These are only a few of the obviously disgusting and saddening things that have happened between us over the years. I think I am feeling extra bad about it because of the holidays. On top of everything, financial worries, existential crises, depression, whatever, I feel cheated out of a good family. I'm so jealous of people who have nice, kind, real family to surround themselves with. I am afraid I will never have that.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm looking for advice here. How do I get started living my own life, far away from abuse? Any advice on little ways to deal with/manage depression would be super helpful as well. Thank you very much for reading this far, I appreciate it. I know this is for advice, but I needed to do some venting too, which is why it's so long. I wanted to feel heard, you know?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Living in an abusive household, seemingly without a way out. Car is broken, I'm not making enough money to support myself, and my depression is getting more crippling with each selfish, stupid and/or abusive thing my mother does. I'm at a loss, feeling like I have little support and that nothing will ever get any better. I'm trying to make a plan, but don't know where to start. Looking for advice and support. Thank you!!

449,"So for starters, I’m a college student who lives with his dad. I don’t have a job but my dad lets me stay for free while I’m in classes, he gives me money every week for food and stuff, otherwise I only have Christmas and birthday money

And I know she’ll keep asking for more and then I’ll get in trouble with either her or my dad if I pay it or not. And then with Christmas around the corner I’ll lose the little bit of money I do get for myself ",21Nov2018,1
450,"First things first, I will list down what made me even think of it.  Also, sorry for typos and format on phone. 

I'm not the kind of person that spies on others because tbh it's not my business and it's a waste of my time. 

But here's the deal. Across from my roommate's apartment that I also pay for to live in, is three apartment units. One has a family living in it with their dogs. They seem friendly. The other two are right next to each other. That's about all I noticed at first. 

Second, where I am assigned to park faces their doors. So after repeatedly parking there ever since I movef in, I started to notice things. Let's start with Man 1 or M1. Mostly enters and leaves the apartment on the left, I thought it belonged to him. A white (utility?) van with tinted windows belongs to him. The kind that only had a front and the back has nothing and you can store or move large items around in. He also has a daughter. ~~Or so I thought~~. First little girl I saw with him a few times had dark hair. Whenever I happened to see him, the little girl (they are always around 3-6 ish years old, maybe even 2) would be alseep. 100% of the time. And then he'd walk out and put her in the other seat and then drive off. Or bring her back, always still asleep. At random intervals. I remember feeling sorry for him, raising his daughter all alone and wondering why she was always tired as I'd never seen her awake. And this would be the case whenever I happened to see him, day or night. Didn't think too much of it. One day, the little backpack she had on sometimes fell and I picked it up to hand to him and noticed it was empty. He Didn't say thank you, or anything. He seemed to be in a hurry to leave. 

Again, not my problem. My fussy brain was kind of alarmed how he'd never have a child's carseat in that passenger seat. But again, I felt sorry for him. Like my culture taught me, single dads probably have no clue how to raise a child. He probably didn't know where to start. It's wrong, but that's how I justified it. 

Then one day, the little girl was a different girl. Hair isn't dark, it's light brown. Different weight because the previous one was chubby. This one seemed around the same age too. This caught my interest. So I found myself always paying attention whenever I see him. Again, same patteren. No trace of the previous little girl. I should add that the times he'd come and go with the little girl(s) was odd. No pattern to it. It could even be at night. Some days the van wouldn't come back for days. Slowly, I was growing uneasy. Where was the first little girl? He still didn't have a car seat. No indication of the other girl. So I start thinking, maybe he took her to other relatives? This brings me to the fact that I never see anyone else around. Only him and a little girl. He never took out any trash (we all share a big garbage can and it's close to his apartment). He never gets any mail, he never does anything except to either bring the little girl into his apartment for a few hours then leave with her again and sometimes not come back for a while. And the girl is ALWAYS asleep. ALWAYS. At this point, I wonder if they are asleep or unconscious.

Again, not too much my business. Even though it's starting to be. I am WORIED for these little girls. A father, even a clueless one doesn't behave like this. A guardian doesn't behave like this. And children aren't always unconscious when seen in public. And it is not one child. Also, where are the others? It's been, to the best of my knowledge, at least 5 different little girls since I started to notice it. I haven't lived here long. I won't disclose how long exactly but it is in the space of a few months. Less than half a year, leaning more towards the middle of less than half a year. 5 little girls. No other family members seen, only this man and the ones who come in through his side door, stay for a bit and then leave. I'll get to that part.

Then he switched out to another little girl. The difference is there. This third little girl is blonde. With delicate features. Again, always unconscious. Younger than the last two. He had to put pillows around her every time he straps her in with the seatbelts to keep her up right. Now I start to get worried. No other people just him and now 3 different children who are always asleep. No moms coming to visit, nothing. He never buys food, never does anything else except take a little sleeping girl in and out of his apartment and van. 

One day I see him go in and I go up to knock. I said I'd ask him if I'm bothering him and his daughter with my automatic headlights that shine into their window as I wait for my car to warm up and it usually takes a while. Nothing. He doesn't open and I hear nothing. No child running to check who's at the door or asking, no crying, no sound. He knew I was there because I saw his blinds move. After a while I left. From that day on, he was careful. If I was outside, he'd do his routine quickly. He also changed to another child. 


I had become concerned now so I started positioning my kitchen window blinds so that I could see across but no one would see me. This is when I noticed the other house. And here's what's alarming. Someone would come from the other apartment into M1's apartment through his side doors and then leave after some time.  And I know this Because all the apartment units have side doors. M1's and the other one shared a wall and then each of them had sliding doors on the other side of each apartment. Same layout for the entire complex. 

One night, my roommate got dropped off by her bf and told me she heard a kid crying. I wasn't the only one who'd noticed he was switching kids and the weirdness. I went with her to investigate and sure enough, it was coming from M1's house. You could only hear it when you went to the parking lots infront of his apartment. My first thought is relief that this man wasn't transporting dead children around. And then I wondered why she wouldn't stop crying while me and my roommate debated whether or not to knock. Maybe he was a heavy sleeper and didn't know his (maybe) child isn't crying. 

We decided to go back in after I told her he didn't open the door the first time. I'm finishing up the dishes when I look up and someone leaves M1's side door and goes not back into the second apartment as usual, but into a car in the guest parking and leaves. I'm ready to call the police by then because my mind was screaming that something was wrong. I sat on the counter and kept an eye out the kitchen window. Then M1 comes out about with a sleeping girl (it was too dark to see if he had another one) and hops into his van and leaves.


I'm going to stop here. 

I suspect that those children aren't his. And that whatever he's doing with them is most likely not good. If this happens to be the case, I don't want to go barge in on him or do something that will make him flee or escape. And if this isn't the case, I don't want to invite extra stress and unwanted scrutiny on someone who does not deserve it. I say extra because the children being always sleeping is that maybe they have some type of illness that causes it. But I highly doubt it. 

Is this enough to have him investigated? What else could be going on? I am scared for these little girls. And for myself in case it turns out to be true. I don't want any traffickers after me.",21Nov2018,1
451,"The title kinda says it all, lol. I live on the main floor of an older apartment building.  The walls/ceilings are a little thin, but these upstairs neighbors are still the only other people in the building whose day to day life sounds have ever proved disruptive....and I’ve lived in apartments for over a decade.

They’re an older couple, 40’s or 50’s, neither of whom seem to work or go out much. In the summer time they are both drunk and loud on their balcony much of the time, which does get annoying, but my general position on apartment living is pretty laid back. I prefer to ignore small issues if I can, since down the road, I may need the same kind of consideration.

Problem is, these people are constantly having what sounds like loud, screaming sex, at all times of the day and night. It’s usually the lady I hear (i assume lol)....like, screaming and moaning at the top of her lungs. For 30 it more minutes at a time. 

Now, I get that people have sex, and I’m happy my neighbors have an apparently wonderful sex life. I too have sex in my home, but I try to keep the noise somewhat down lol....The problem is, this has gone from the odd time, to at least a few times a day (??), loud enough that I cannot ignore it. I hate to speculate, but it’s almost as if they are getting off on making a spectacle of their sessions (lol).

I’ve started turning on loud punk music when they get into it, to try to send a message. But blasting the Ramones and NOFX doesn’t seem to be helping much, and to be honest, this approach doesn’t feel properly mature either.

So, fellow Redditors, what would you do in this situation? As I said, I’d prefer not to involve the management company over such a....personal....issue, as my goal isn’t to embarrass my neighbors. I just want them to keep it down to a dull roar, you know? 

What should I do?",21Nov2018,1

453,"I would be really happy if someone had just any idea how I could get my life back up but first let me explain.  (Sorry if the text sounds a bit chaotic.)  


Basically everything dates back to me being in my early teenage years. I met a guy online, who I really enjoyed talking to and stuff and one day he told me that he was going to  commit suicide. Then I did not hear from him for a couple of days. (He did not manage to kill himself but it still impacted me) These were probably the scariest days of my life (back then), I just could not quite understand everything and kind of developed the mindset I am currently in. I was and still kind of am convinced that there is no meaning in living, it's just one painful cycle. Growing up just to work your ass off and then die.  And I just did not want to also be part  of that cycle. That's probably one of the reasons why I started developing suicidal thoughts and I was convinced I would  be dead before turning 18 therefore I did not need to make any  plans for my life because a dead man needs no goals.   
Now let's look at my 18th birthday. I was still alive but with even less of a plan on how to survive. No goals, no particular interests, nothing. The only thing that changed was that I no longer had to go to school, but that did not make things easier. It was quite the contrary. I just could not decide what I wanted to pursue. My suicidal thoughts still existed they just changed my life to end before my 20th birthday. 

I am turning 20 in a few months and right now I feel like I should really start to end this cycle because it won't get any better. I have some hope in my life because I just recently met a great guy, but it has not been long enough to call it anything but a hope. (And I also get attached way too easily, so  it's most likely just a lost hope)

Relationships are another problem. I never had many friends. Most of my friendships have always been of convenience. I am quite introverted (it has gotten better) and shy but despite this quite good at getting along people when there was not way around it. Nowadays I notice that this has left me with no friends whatsoever to talk to when I have a hard time. Therefore I have to solve all conflicts with my feelings on my own and I'm not  particularly good at it. I just tend to avoid any trouble and go the easy  way even if the difficult one might be way better for me. Also whenever I meet new people I would consider to be friends I am just too scared to annoy them with my problems. I just think that they just want to have fun and not give advice all the time (and that if I tell that about my struggles they end the friendship and I have another point to add to my list of problems). I'm not quite sure what a healthy friendship should be about because I think I've never had one.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I feel like I just need to go to another country and restart my life there (if possible with a partner). But after 5 seconds of thinking about it my brain is just full of 'what if's and desperation kicks back in.  
I just feel so stupid. In school I always was quite smart and everyone thought I would have a great job one day, but now I'm just a total failure. I have no aspirations, no friends and often no will to live (although I don't think I would be able to commit suicide).

His family and all of our friends have been waiting for this day since we met and they all fully support us and believe that we were meant for each other. He and I both have a good head on our shoulders and this has not been something that was rushed. We've given it a lot of thought, I studied psychology in college and know all about the most current research on successful relationships and we work hard to maintain these things in our lives. We are very happy and work together very well.

That being said, my parents suck. They always have. They are never supportive of me and I have always had to be happy for myself and have learned to support myself emotionally (until I met my fiancé). They don't understand my life choices.

But, something's got to give and I just am not sure what my next step should be. My Fiancé doesn't know what to do or say because his family was/is so excited and supportive. On the other hand, my family won't talk about it and it feels like a funeral just happened. It's also hard, because I need to have an objective conversation with them but I am so hurt about their reaction.

460," Hello everyone!

I'm in middle school and I have been playing piano for quite a well. I was thinking of switching to either bass guitar or electric guitar. Personally I love the bass guitar more than the electric guitar.

Now, the problem is that, in my school, more people play bass guitar than electric guitar so it would be really hard for me to get into a band I think. I know! That's not what I would expect; in fact I would expect the opposite.

I really want to play bass guitar but all the people who play music in my class are encouraging me to take up electric guitar instead of bass guitar so I can get into a band next year. The thing is, I know we have one good bassist in my year level but I don't know how the rest are. And the good bassist in my year level didn't really get into the best band this year.

What should I do? I really love bass guitar. One of the bass guitars let me play his once and I absolutely loved it, whereas once I got to play the electric guitar and it was OK but I prefer bass guitar. I don't know what to do I really want to get into a band!

Thank you!",21Nov2018,1

463," 

I've been very close to a friend of mine for the past year. We clicked, were interested in the same things, worked at the same place. I thoroughly enjoyed hanging out with her, as a lot of our activities centred around exercise and days out.

I began to develop feelings for her as we were very close. I never made this clear and repressed them due to her having a boyfriend. I talked to her and her boyfriend about this, she said I was good for their relationship as they used to live in separate flats and didn't spend much time together. He said he was cool with me. Again, she has been very close to me, but I did not think at any point that I would be able to be in a relationship with her.

Fast forward about 8 months and now I'm at uni. I've had a super stressful time here, and started to rely on her for support. Things got too heated and we had to take a break from each other. Now since then, whenever we hang out in person, everything seems fine, but as soon as there is an online interaction, I end up saying something that is either misinterpreted or just plain bad, and ends in an argument. A recent example of this was me asking her about anti-depressants which is something she has been open about before. This conversation was what I though, just a chat, but the next day, I was faced with a long message about overstepping boundaries. Because I did not apologise, as I did not understand what was wrong, I said ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" and now she is ignoring me. I've definitely done things wrong with my friend, but each time I have learnt from my mistakes and have asked for advice from other friends on how I can improve. I am at the point where it feels like every week we have an argument or fall out, especially due to the past break we had, and it's not something I can handle much longer after feeling so happy being friends a couple months back. We have both been beneficial for each other, in the sense of advice and mental health. I want to continue the friendship because we are so similar (we literally had a conversation in person about this a week ago and all seemed fine). So at the moment I'm being hit with radio silence. I have apologised after asking for other friend's opinions on what I did wrong, she has seen the messages but hasn't replied. She also seems completely fine with it through her interactions with others online.

What should I do? I've considered not talking or taking a long break, but when we are having an argument, I feel like my entire world is falling apart and always feel completely at fault. I can't tell if I need to grow up and accept that it won't be like it used to be or if I need to just work on myself whilst maintaining this friendship. She has done a lot for me, and has never showed any signs of no longer wanting the friendship. It's worth mentioning that I am seeking medical advice this week on my general low mood and anxiety too.

EDIT: It may be that I've grown to be emotionally dependant, but I believe at one stage she was too. She now lives in a flat with her boyfriend, has different interests (I could see it slowly changing) and generally doesn't seem to find me funny anymore.",21Nov2018,1

School setting. A girl I genuinely like, who I've known for a year, (not just in a 'I want to fuck her' way) messages me, holds eye contact, smiles, is always looking over, separates from her friends to talk to me alone, messages me on Snapchat with compliments when I post a picture of myself but when I ask her out she says ""would love to but I didn't study this whole week so I really need to focus on that. I'll let you know"". She does let me know the next day, to say ""yeah I'm busy, I can't"". I distance myself and don't reciprocate when she is looking across the room and trying to smile - she continues and eventually my feelings come back and we're having deep conversations and relationships and stuff in person and over Snapchat and she's made it clear she's single. Week after, I stop giving her attention and she starts flirting with other guys while looking at me and I act unphased and then she's acting very cold, slow replies and all that. Then I finally speak to her and she's acting warm like how she was before.

&amp;#x200B;

This is my situation and when the topic about how I asked her out came up (brought up by me), I slipped in that I saw that as a rejection and she says ""aww no! I wasn't rejecting you, I was actually going to do work that day."" And I said something along the lines of ""when girls can't make a date on one day, they usually offer an alternative"" and she says ""sorry, well if we go out it can't be until next year (January 2019) because the exams are in 2 weeks and I want to do well in them and I'm going to be in Miami for the whole Christmas holiday"" I said ""what, you're going to be completely busy with schoolwork and not have one break."" She said ""yeah, my friends have been asking me to go out too and I'm saying I can't I need to work"" I said ""okay"". Later that night, she starts snapping me cute selfies and shit and I just reply ""cute blah blah"" and we have a lil convo but that's it.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, today I want to message her and ask her if she wants to get lunch tomorrow because I know for a fact we both have a morning off school until 2:25 when we both have class in which we sit next to each other. Thing is, I've always been taught that no one is too busy if they like you and I hate asking twice. Should I message her tonight and ask? Or should I just move on? I genuinely like her as a person, but I'm not going to be that guy that's so desperate. I'm usually not like this, but fuck this is a rare one - looks, personality, conversation is all just right.

466,"This is the 4th time this particular issue has come up, and it's beyond infuriating.  

For some reason people always ask what is in canned air duster?

The answer is usually R-134a refrigerant like what goes in your car's air conditioner or your refrigerator.

I don't know what it is but it certainly cannot be refrigerant, is a common response.  

When confronted with evidence these people usually buckle down even harder.  

Am I missing something, surely I must be.   It feels surreal to me that people can refuse to accept such a common and self verifiable fact. 


----------------------

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_duster

Common duster gases are 1,1-difluoroethane, 1,1,1-trifluoroethane, or 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane. 

(all of these are refrigerants)

Many gas dusters contain HFC-134a (tetrafluoroethane), which is widely used as a propellant and refrigerant.



------------------------------



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,1-Difluoroethane

This colorless gas is used as a refrigerant, where it is often listed as R-152a (refrigerant-152a) or HFC-152a (hydrofluorocarbon-152a). 


------------------------------


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,1,1-Trifluoroethane
It is used as a refrigerant either by itself or more commonly as a component of blended mixtures. 


---------------------------

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane

R-134a, Freon 134a, Forane 134a, Genetron 134a, Florasol 134a, Suva 134a, or HFC-134a

1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane is a non-flammable gas used primarily as a ""high-temperature"" refrigerant for domestic refrigeration and automobile air conditioners.

The last three and a half year i been really pushing to make my life better and i came such a long way i'm quite proud of myself,  currently paying off all my debt ( i really screwed my credit) to prepare myself to be a home owner one day ect.   Now i find myself stuck at a cross path on rather to obtain my GeD and go to college or enter a trade,  As i'm trying to think long term careers.   Currently make decent money (30k-ish a year) at a global warehouse/factory but i know this isnt what i was ment nor want to do my entire life.

Not sure how i can even decide between a trade or college,  I want something that's good money but least bearable/likable,   Sorta winging this whole thing since no one ever went to college in my family and so forth.   It's honestly seem very daunting since i feel like im sorta old for the whole college thing,  but i know im interested in things such as  robotic, software, tech,  building thing with my hand ect.

468,"I’ll start with some context, I’m a 19 year old male college student, and in general I’ve never been the best at relationships, flirting, etc... I’ve had one relationship in my life that lasted 5 years (from the start of middle school all the way to junior year of high school). That’s a different story however so the tl;dr is that I left her because she made me feel guilty for having any sort of sexual desire or even desire for physical affection because “she was asexual”. (We kissed a handful of times throughout the 5 years and that was the farthest we ever went physically, she even later said she hated kissing and did it just so I wouldn’t be disappointed) I think this might have messed me up and made me feel like physical advances with anyone else are always going to end up poorly like they did with her. In addition my self-esteem was never quite the best, probably partially due to her. 
Anyway, the past year I’ve been hard at work trying to get past all that and reinvent myself. Ive changed my wardrobe, got a new haircut, dropped some bad habits, kept my living spaces clean, and overall just focused on self care. It’s been going great, and my confidence is the highest it’s ever been. I even downloaded tinder and to my surprise I actually get a fair number of matches. I’ve made a near complete 180, but there’s still that one thing I just cannot get over. I still suck at communicating and making moves in a relationship. I’ve had a few dates that generally are very fun and go well, but they never turn into anything because I never am able to treat them as more then a friend. I’m so scared if I make a move or try and flirt they’ll get offended somehow. I’m still a virgin and I’m terrified of getting anywhere with a girl because I feel like I’ll simply embarrass myself because I have no idea what I’m doing. 

I want to get over this hump so badly, college has been lonely and some companionship would be nice. Sorry for the wall of text, I may delete this later when I reread it in a more reasonable state of mind, but I thought I’d throw this out there for the time being and see if the internet could help.

Which, now that I think of it, is kind of a problem, since I always feel uncomfortable around crowds.
I mean it. I have this fear of enclosed spaces. Everything makes me feel trapped all the time.

On Sunday I sent a message on Instagram asking where she would like to go, which she read but didn’t respond too, which is totally normal and fine. 

On Monday I then ask if she saw my message. She replied, “what” and I told her my question. She then replies with “what” again. I then tell her that I’m confused and don’t know what she is talking about, to which she tells me that I’m being difficult, but in a joking way. I then said something along the lines of “seriously do you have any ideas of where you want to go hang out” and she read, the message and didn’t respond. 

As of today (Wednesday) I still have not gotten her to respond, even though she has opened and read all of my messages. I see that she is on Instagram for almost an hour at a time and she still doesn’t respond for some reason.

What happened is basically, we all left college and went our separate ways. Some of us left our hometown for uni and others started looking for work. We were all good friends in college, would see each other every day and text a fair bit. Once we all collected our results and over the final summer break, I lost contact with most people, I was busy looking for jobs and had enough other personal stuff to deal with and if I never text them, they never really initiated any texts to me.
Now here we are 3 years later and there had been no contact at all between most of us, however I really want to get back in contact and try to pick things back up and apologise for the silence on my side for so long. These people were good friends, but both sides are kind of too blame for the lack of contact.

Currently 20 years old studying biology in Germany. I have had 1 year of previous work experience which I enjoyed.

I never enjoyed school and barely managed to finish my Abitur (Highschool certificate). I am going to college I feel because of expectations that were put on me.
Even though I love biology and everything it involves, I hate the tedious studying aspect of it.(serious issues with procrastination and lying to myself). I am considering quitting my college journey and joining the German police force, been a dream of mine ever since I was little. However the application starts next year in fall and I am not guaranteed to be accepted (partially colorblind.)
So I can either continue my college path for one year and try apply for the police force (wasting 1 year to go to college that I won't finish) or I can quit college now and spend the time elsewhere and hope that I will be accepted when the time comes to the police ( if not I can look for another job?).
I am confident I would enjoy a position on the police force however am scared of wasting time in college or not getting accepted.

I'm not going to get into all the details but basically, her grandmother is dying and it's only a matter of time before she passes. Her grandma was like her mom, sister, best friend, etc. all wrapped into one for a major part of her life and she doesn't want to leave her side. She kept saying how guilty she felt for moving away from her like she did and how she's now rethinking all of her recent major life choices. Basically, she wants to stay home now and may want to change career paths (something she has talked about before). 

I really didn't know what to say to any of this. I just tried to be as supportive as possible to whatever she was saying. All in all, this is something she knows she needs to work out herself. I'm just worried she's gonna distance herself a lot through it. I barely got a word out of her in the last few days before she finally talked to me about it last night and she has either just been with her grandma or slept the entire time she's been home. 

Also, I'm kinda worried about the whole ""reconsideration"" of life choices. A lot of what she's thinking about doing would involve us having to break up and, obviously, that's the last thing I want to happen. I'll support her however I can, but if she decides to move back home, it's just not going to work, not at the stages we are at in life.

My parents treat my best friend and their spouse more like their kids than me and my fiancé. We’re all mid twenties. 

Their spouse is rather country, likes country music, has a truck, etc and them and my dad really get along. Which is fine. My parents always ask them how the other is doing, etc. 

My parents aren’t the biggest fans of my fiancé. But they’ve really never tried. He and my dad don’t have much in common, and my dad is socially awkward and doesn’t really take well to criticism or anyone disagreeing with him or really anything he doesn’t like. I love him, he’s my dad and he’s a good one, he’s just him. 

It drains me to see them light up around my best friend and their spouse. Because they act like mine doesn’t exist half the time (there’s a story here that I won’t tell. It was a huge misunderstanding that was resolved and he apologized for. They’re stuck on it. It was never even a big deal) 

If they (bff and spouse) want something or want to do something, my parents are on board immediately. If that’s me or my fiancé, it’s always “no we don’t want to. Don’t feel like it. Don’t have time.” 

I’ve brought this up to my mom multiple times. She denies it. Or she says sorry and that she’ll work on it but nothing ever gets better.

I'm 22 years old and have a year and a half left of college. I feel like this should be the best part of my life, there are people my age all around me but I feel disconnected from them. I feel like I've fucked up my social life in college. I want to change it and I'm ready to do what it takes. 

It's not like I'm weird or anything either. I'm a good looking guy, workout daily, I do well in school most of the time, I play the guitar, snowboard, ride dirt bikes, love listening to lots of different styles of music.. It's just like I'm lacking something socially.

So I guess I'm looking for advice on:

1. How to increase my sense of self worth, self-confidence, and stop putting everyone else above me
2. How to improve my social life, social skills, and stop being a loner

489,title. there’s other stuff involved but it’s not as important. it’s starting to feel a bit suffocating. also i can’t avoid her 100% because we go to the same college. she’s also very stubborn and set in her ways so trying to reason with her probably won’t work either :/,21Nov2018,1
491,"Hey everyone, I'm fairly new to this website. I hear and see a lot of reddit posts going on and noticed it's a pretty popular website where there's plenty of people who have gone through similar situations and for the majority, the audience seems like a pretty nice group, so I hope to get some clearance in the situation and some honest advice from you guys all while done with respect. But let me give you a quick backstory.

\-My ex-girlfriend (28) is a music therapist and teacher. Incredibly beautiful, smart, hardworking, talented, faithful, the entire package. Although this has been the best relationship we have had in our lives, her past has been rough as far as relationships go. She, coming from a Filipino background, has grown up with some strictness in the family. Her parents are very old-school and have been strict with her, even have made her feel guilty for not doing Nursing as a career path. Growing up, she has been bullied and what-not. Her relationship before me, she described to me as manipulative/controlling/not healthy. She had told me that it was a very difficult time for her. She had lost herself, she had lost her identity, she still gets upset about it from time to time. I tried to be as understanding as possible about the situation and try to sympathize it, all while at the same time, try to pick her up when she feels by trying to show her that her ex-boyfriend is in the past and it's important to focus on the now.

\-I am (27M) a Physical Therapist Assistant. I work with people who have had surgery/hurt themselves at work to help regain their function. That's something both my ex and I shared, is that we were both musicians and in the therapy field. We both obviously care about people and their well being. (And we're both Cancer!) I've never really had much experience with serious relationships. This was my longest relationship of a year, so this relationship being my 4th one, I am learning how to deal with women still. I admit, I have work to do and growing up to do. Everyone does, I'm not trying to say I'm perfect, but I'm certainly far from the worst. I am a hard working, caring, fair individual. I try to be as honest as possible when I can be.

Now about the relationship itself:

I can come off as pretty needy at times. I am someone who is able to give someone their space but you'd have to tell me, I love talking to someone nonstop and I can be overwhelming, I'm sure. And you'd have to reassure me that nothing is wrong with me and our relationship. It's a pretty annoying personality trait of mine that I know can be a major turn off. I'm someone who needs constant reassurance. I don't know if it's because I've been screwed over before or maybe my childhood, I don't know, but I'm seeing a therapist for it. I'm hoping it all goes well, because it's something that I hate having to deal with and I'm sure any partner would hate to deal with. With my ex girlfriend, I noticed that she likes things to be a certain way, and is pretty strong-willed (stubborn) about it. She can also play the victim very well for many things.  
This was not something I have seen before or made a lot of sense in my head up until when we broke up when I took a step back and analyzed the relationship. For example, we were planning a trip to Disneyland and I was very much wanting to take an Uber around because I didn't want to drive around in LA traffic, I didn't want to worry about drinking and driving, I didn't want to worry about parking, and I just didn't want to deal with driving period because I'm on vacation. Her and I agreed to a 50/50 split for the bigger costs because we both make very good money. She wanted to rent a car because it was cheaper and she was ""on a budget"" (despite her having $70,000 saved in her bank account). We would have saved some money renting the car but doing Uber would've been ideal. There were pros and cons to both situations, which I understood, so I offered to pay for the transportation out there because I wanted to take an Uber, she didn't have to pitch in 50/50 for that, but she insisted to pay because she didn't want me to have her under her thumb for paying for things (which in her previous relationships, she had boyfriends who tried to control her just because they paid for this and that.) We ended up arguing for a good amount of time about it, I Just gave in and decided ""Fine, let's just rent the car out."" after she felt like she had to yell her brains out about it. I offered to pay for transportation, which she denied, because I wanted to take the Uber, which she denied as well. So I was basically forced to rent the car just to save $100 or else she would have not gone on the trip, which she has used as ammo against me whenever she gets mad during an argument. She would say ""You know what? I'm not going on the trip anymore, you can go on your own."" and there I go, apologizing. Trying to mend things. We both, without a doubt, love each other. We both had plans for the future and everything, but it seems like she just couldn't trust me with over what she thought was me being unfaithful (which I will explain later on)

The first few months were fantastic, as a lot of relationships I'm sure. As every relationship matures, it begins to have arguing in it. We begin to notice our differences. I'm not someone to give up on someone or capitalize on our differences in a negative way. We are allowed to be different people. And despite us having our differences, our similarities that are very important to us are there, such as: family orientation, music, therapy, helping others, etc. My ex-girlfriend is someone who can be overly sensitive with things or take things the wrong way. To my fault, I tend to say things like ""oh I was just kidding"" or ""don't be so sensitive"", which is the message I have conveyed in the past. I apologize afterwards once I see that it really did upset her. Sometimes she doesn't really show to be bothered by it in the moment until it comes up after in an argument. I'm definitely working on it now, since it makes more sense as to her feeling like I'm undermining her feelings. Although sometimes she can be pretty sensitive to the silliest of things, I try to understand as much as I can and change in that aspect. However, recently, things have gotten out of control. 2 months ago, She was over at my house, we were laying down on my bed and asked ""Hey, can we look at your pictures on your phone?"" And I'm thinking ""Okay, she's obviously looking for dirt or something to argue about. But she won't find anything."" We're scrolling through my entire album on my iPhone, laughing at the random things I take pictures of and things I save. Going far back into things from before, she found pictures of old friends I used to talk to on my phone. A few were selfies of other girls, and there was 1 nude in there of a girl I met over Tinder. These were all rooted deep into the early stages of my 1,500 pictures that I had from the past 1-2 years. These pictures of the girls were from before I met my girlfriend, and I had forgotten they were on my phone. My phone mainly consists of memes, pictures of my (ex) girlfriend, or pictures of my family. Anyway, I deleted the pictures right then and there. She thought it was weird and it started an argument. Her main thing was ""How do you not see what you did wrong? Who in the right mind would keep selfies of their friends? Are these girls your fuck buddies/thirst traps/ex hook ups?"" I kept reassuring her that I had no current contact with them and they were from the past from when I was single. She kept insisting that it was weird and not normal and how dare I disrespect our relationship that way. She was also upset at my initial reaction to when she found the pictures while laying on the bed. I had said ""Oh yeah, those are my old friends. I used to talk to them. I'll just delete them now"". Hence, why she feels like I see nothing wrong with what I did, when obviously she did.

A few days after that, she comes over and I am playing piano while she is singing. I have my back turned to her while she is singing and she randomly stops. While she has stopped singing, I am practicing my part which I can't seem to get. 3 minutes into the song, I stop and I take a break from that part I can't get down. When I get up and turn around, I see her laying on my bed with a blanket over her. I take the blanket off, and she's going through my phone. She quickly locks the phone and throws it to her side. I caught her red-handed. I get incredibly upset because she is going through my phone without my permission. It's not like I have anything to hide, but the idea/principle of it is what bothers me. It shows me that she does not trust me. I got upset and did begin to raise my voice (which does not happen often, but when it does, she does not live it down, despite her yelling at me WAY more than I ever have in my life. In a demeaning manner, too.) asking her ""What do you think you're doing going through my phone?!"" And she's like ""Oh, I'm just looking through your pictures of the Disney trip we went to."" when I KNOW I saw the green text message bubbles when I uncovered her from under the sheets. I opened my phone back up and what do you know, my text messages are the first thing to come up. I asked her ""Why the hell did you do that? What are you looking for? Don't you trust me?"" She kept insisting she was not going through my messages although I LITERALLY saw her with them open. Finally, I get her to come forward with what she was doing and she begins to yell even louder than me ""It's because I don't trust you, okay!?"" and puts the blame on the pictures I had on my phone. She also insists that I have a romantic relationship with all of my friends that are girls and that my boss is my ""work wife"", which is non-sense. She keeps saying that I am holding on to these pictures so I can use them for pleasure and as a ""spank bank"", which is also non-sense because they were just random selfies. I ask her ""Why would I keep pictures as masturbating material if 1) there's porn for that and 2) I have a girlfriend whom I love a lot and am faithful to?"" The 1 nude was someone I didn't even consider being in a relationship nor did I keep any contact with her after a few weeks. She broke up with me right then and there. I told her she can leave, and that was it until a week after when she finally cooled down that we got back together. But during that week that we were ""broken up,"" she was sending me pictures and text messages saying ""Oh, where should I throw away your gifts that you gave me?"" and sending me pictures of when we took that trip to Disneyland saying ""This is my favorite picture of us, look at us smiling..."" obviously trying to guilt trip me and trying to get me to change my mind or hurt me in some manner. She knows what gets to me, emotionally. I am an emotional person, but I have improved on making decisions based not on my current emotional state, but on what needs to be done. Regardless, when your'e in love, sometimes you're blinded by the right decisions. We make up and everything is swell until a few weeks after that....

The next/last episode where we broke up happened last month, a month after our first break up. I went over to her house on a Tuesday morning before work for some coffee. We were sitting on the couch, on our phones, just talking and hanging out drinking our coffee. We were talking about how my cousin and his girlfriend were going through some things and my cousins girlfriend cheated on him. We were talking about how toxic she was and how sad the whole situation was. Right after we finished our conversation about her, my cousins girlfriend went live on Instagram. I said ""oh look, speak of the devil, his girlfriend just went live on Instagram."" and my (ex) girlfriend says ""Ohhh, let's watch it!"" so I turn it on. Her and I are watching the live stream and noticed that she was in a McDonalds sweater and it looked like she was in an office with someone else, so we assumed she was at work. We were laughing, so I decided to comment ""lemme get some food!"". I'm a big fan of McDonalds (But I'm not fat, yet...). Then, my cousin's girlfriend replies ""Then come get some"", and that's when my (ex) girlfriend loses her shit. I mean, she goes full out ballistic. I'm confused as to why she's yelling and freaking out, I don't know what happened. As she gets up from the couch and starts yelling ""WHAT THE FUCK, WHAT THE FUCK!!!!"" I'm replying in a panicked manner, ""What? What happened!?"" She yells ""How dare you message her?! How dare you say that!?"" And I am very confused, because I literally was just asking for food, as a joke. I was only being silly because I saw someone with McDonalds uniform. I always do the same to people whenever I see a restaurant uniform on. No intention of actually going to get it or anything. No flirting, absolutely nothing. I made the comment in front of my girlfriend, so why would I do something shady like that? Later that day, we discussed what happened and she was very upset because (this is where she is manipulating and changing what happened), I was ""flirting with her, catcalling her"" and ""could not take my eyes off of her in the live stream for a whole 3 minutes as she sat there and watched in horror trying to snap me out of this 'in love' daze that I was in."" This is where I begin to notice that she manipulates a lot of situations and warps what actually happened in order for her to appear like she has been justified in her actions and her reactions. Which she has every right to react the way she wants, but to bring me down and exaggerate the scenario is not okay with me. Again, she breaks up with me saying that how dare I disrespect her and our relationship. Why would she tell me it's okay to watch, but not say that I shouldn't type? I can't assume what bothers her. (It's also strange that she's okay with strip clubs and porn, but not with me sending a silly text?)

She has accused me of gaslighting. A LOT. She has accused me of being manipulative. Accused me of being impulsive and inconsiderate. Throughout all this, she has played the victim a lot and it seems like I have always been wrong, no matter what I try to do right. I would try to explain myself, but then be accused of ""mansplaining"" and being a misogynistic pig. I am someone that when their partner gets hurt, I try to be there for them and change when I need to. I was made felt like 90% of everything was my fault, that I was the stubborn one, that I was the one that needed to change and not her. It's weird because we also talked about being in a 3-some (no plans on actually doing it, but were interested), and then one day, she randomly came out during a fight and said ""And stop bringing up the 3some, that's NEVER going to happen with us."" Which confused the FUCK out of me because we were actively looking for another at some point, then she turns it around and says that?! She made me a list of things that I needed to work on, but when I told her she needed to work on some things, she got VERY defensive. And yet, it was always ME ME ME. Basically walking on eggshells, recently. No matter how much I changed or tried to do things right, it was not enough. Eventually, she had enough and left me. And it seems like she still isn't finished shooting shots at me. During every argument, she would try to hurt me somehow. More recently, my friend found her on a dating site not too long ago (which I feel like after a serious relationship of a year and talking about marriage/future/engagement, it seems too soon for that.). She had on her profile that she was an ""emotional abuse survivor"" and to message her if ""they are interested and don't have nudes of ex girlfriends/thirst traps/ex hook ups"". She KNEW that my friend was on that site and that I would possibly be dating again, (But I'm not, I'm trying my best to regain my confidence and sense of self.)

I know I'm a very caring person. Not just me as a person, but in my field, too. I take care of others when they need help. I am someone who is trustworthy and fair to many people, also very family oriented, silly, talented, smart. I want there to be equality. Yes, I crack jokes and sometimes my humor can be offensive, but life is a crazy thing, and being serious all the time kills it. That doesn't mean that someone won't be offended by something so I have to take a step back in becoming more cautious around others. But after all this, I felt like I have lost sense of who I was. My confidence was struck and damaged pretty hard towards the end of the relationship. You can't save anyone, you can only support. Unfortunately, she felt like there was nothing wrong with her. But I guess my thing was...was I actually manipulated or is this me just being paranoid? She kept mentioning gaslighting, but was she doing the gaslighting or was I????? This whole situation is VERY confusing and heartbreaking. This was someone I saw a future with, but my sense of reality is a bit staggered....This whole thing is super childish.

TL;DR My girlfriend accuses me of doing many things wrong and overreacts to the smallest of things. Despite me doing things right, I get no credit for it. And when she tries to show me credit, she quickly shuts that down with a LOT more negativity. I'm sure I've done wrong in the past, but I do try to change it and acknowledge that sometimes I can be quite the idiot, too. She has been hurt in the past and I feel like that baggage was brought with her to this current relationship. She is now accusing me of gaslighting and being manipulative/impulsive/inconsiderate and having NO foresight in my decisions. What should I do?  I love this girl to death, she's awesome in multiple ways that the good outweighs the bad, but when things are bad, DAMN....",21Nov2018,1
493,"I'm sorry if this doesn't matter as much as other posts, I don't really know where to post this...
I really like to go to parties oder discos etc. and really, really love to dance. So if I get a little bit tipsy I suddenly fell the urge to dance and get on the dance floor with everyone else. My ""problem"" is that apparently I'm really bad at dancing, everyone (including my friends) always laughs at me. (No worries they are really friends, they don't mean it mean.) So my question is basically, how can I learn to dance better? Because if I just let go and dance how I feel I look jarringly bad...

TL;DR: How can I learn to dance better on the dance floor?",21Nov2018,1
494,"I am in dire need of advice and I am alone. This first part is backstory, in efforts to make my situation understandable. I apologize for length of this entire post. I hope at least one person can take their time to read through it. It's a book: I currently live with my aunt and uncle. Well, quote un-quote aunt and uncle, because we are not blood-related. They were friends with my mother, who passed away when I was 11. After that, I lived with my younger sister and an incredibly abusive father and had stopped speaking to my aunt and uncle for about 8 years, i.e. until now (family is a fuck story of taking sides so my dad wouldnt let us talk to them). So when I was off to college and finished my first semester, I was incredibly depressed, alone, and lost. Long story short, out of pure coincidence they messaged me and  helped me get back on track. I moved in with them 8 months ago as to not have to pay rent or pay for dorms (they are young spirits in their 50's and do not have any children).

Let me begin by saying I am a mature 19 year old. I dont mean it in a conceited way, and of course I still have a lot more maturing to do. But for my age, it's up there- or at least that is what I have been told (my aunt and uncle included). Nevertheless, I do often feel frustrated, stressed and depressed (holy trinity of college, amirite) and take notice of how I behave as a result. I know I often have moments of bad attitude, in the sense that I dont take criticism well. This is a flaw in maturity I am trying to improve. So, as you can imagine, I tend to argue points that I inherently disagree with (does that seem like a normal response? I genuinely dont even know). I dont raise my voice unless they begin raising their voices. I usually try to keep calm but eventually I begin shouting when they shout at me and then I am left to be yelled at for raising my voice at them and causing an argument. I cant express enough how hard I try to have an adult conversation. Keep that last part in mind, here. 

On a side note, I do often have to be *asked* to do the dishes or clean my room. It may not seem like a big deal, but they take it seriously, so thats why I mention it. I do clean out of my own volition once in a while and really do try my best to make random comments of appreciation and gratitude for them helping me out, at the very least. But I do understand how it may not feel like enough. They often have to repeat themselves when they ask me to start doing simple chores without being asked in the first place. I understand my lack of help is frustrating. Still, I can't express in words here how grateful I am. They pay for my phone bill, let me have a roof over my head and food on my plate (though sometimes I buy my own groceries or fast food), I have a shitty car and they have helped with repairs, the list goes on. I am so, so, so, so grateful, and I understand that theyd like my actions to reflect it.


Now, I have to try my best to explain how this situation that is so helpful can cause mental health deterioration and overwhelming stress. i should mention that home life isnt the only problem and other aspects of my life are suffering. For one, my step mom dropped me from my health insurance. I do not make nearly enough money at my job (nor can I pick up more shifts because of school) to afford gas, a new car, health insurance, toiletries, whatever else you can imagine the average adult pays for, with exception of rent and usually food. My friends have all moved away after the first year of college, I need a new car before mine dies or ends up killing me, and keeping up with my medical classes at school has proven very difficult and, of course, stressful. 

So with that in mind, I will provide two examples where a small argument with my aunt and uncle snowballed into extreme consequences, to give an understanding of how I feel and act in arguments, how my aunt and uncle act, and how this could possibly be so severe. 

I have gone through cyclical severe depression since I was 9, and first suicidal at 10 years old. So going through a decade of that stuff with little to no help makes each cycle seem more difficult than the last. Dont know why Im still here, but, I am. So, for those of you with depression, Im sure you understand when I say that as every stressor adds up, no matter the level of importance, it only takes a light, little feather to tumble your entire tower to the ground. And thats what happened in these two situations.

Example one: This event was about a week ago. Very difficult for me to re-live, but it's important. Keep in mind that this topic is incredibly trivial. I had been on a diet for 2 weeks after having gained a lot of weight since college started.  I lost 9 pounds in those 2 weeks, and decided to treat myself to one cheat meal that day (the others were healthy). So, not a big deal, right? Again, I should mention that I have been fat shamed my entire life, even in high school by my father despite being at a healthy weight (once told me I looked like Winnie the Pooh when I went to work in khakis). Anyway, so my aunt asked me if I ate Mcdonalds again, and I said yes, and proceeded to explain to her how it was a cheat meal and how I lost 9 pounds. My uncle joins the conversation and they both begin telling me how eating the meal has set me back a whole week of dieting. I only agree in part, so I just try to explain my perspective, what I believe is correct based on nutritionists' articles. i.e. how gaining fat back would take more work than that, yet how I agree that I would have fluid retention and hence a few extra water-weight-pounds for a few days. Went on to explain how it doesnt mean that I necessarily back-tracked that much, because the biggest point is that i lost 9 pounds and I am happy about it. I really only cared about the weight I had lost. I thought it was great. So I try to agree and disagree in the same discussion, you know? To show I am listening and understanding, but I have my own opinions and disagreements too. Well, to put it straightforward, they would not listen to me. They interrupt me. They talk over me. They can *never* be wrong about anything at all. Long story short (or, short-er), my aunt called me a liar about losing weight. And I mean she straight up called me a ""liar.""  I felt very hurt. Maybe I'm overreacting, but she wasnt kidding. I tried showing her my food diary and weight on the scale that I had tracked and she would just continue to tell me that I probably didnt put enough calories in there, that it wasnt accurate, etc, that I was again, lying. Keep in mind that this got to a shouting point, telling me im lying, because it escalated when they kept telling me that I dont know what Im talking about and that they know more about nutrition, etc etc. I didnt want it to be a battle of ""who knows more"" but it feels like they always turn it into that. I am understanding if how they could maybe think the same thing about me. i. do. understand. Yet, I would like to clarify once again that I try to engage in discussion in a way as aformentioned. anyway, I became very emotional. she called me fat (straight up), and I think that was when my mind felt the weight of  everything I had been struggling with. So it collapsed. To make it clear, I had already been having suicidal thoughts for about a week before this happened. Typing this all out, it seems SO ridiculous. I mean, breakdown over a stupid argument about 9 pounds?! I feel obnoxiously dramatic. 

But it happened. I snapped. I refused to listen any longer, I shouted as loudly as possible that I was leaving, and I went outside and got into my car. Lowest point I have felt so far. Everything collapsed in my mind and there was no way out of anything anymore. No escape...except for suicide.
I wont go into details, but man, the universe has quite a way with coincidences. Looking at my phone to play some music before I acted on my thoughts, as prepared as I was in that moment with my materials, a friend I had not spoken to in a while had messaged me. So, I guess just as it took one small thing for everything to boil over, it took one small thing to make me think twice.

Later, as i was driving around thinking I was going to sleep my car, my aunt asked me if i would come back. So I did. 

Flash forward to last night. Another stupid example. 
This one is probably the most ridiculous. But it goes to show how I feel like no matter what i do, I am going to fall back into extreme frustration and stress. I was helping with Thanksgiving clean-up after work and an exam in class, and had only had three hours of sleep the night before. So I went to sleep around 7pm. I woke up around 11:30pm the same night, went downstairs to watch some tv with my aunt and uncle, and my aunt was eating  ice cream (apparently it's a healthy kind, I dont know). Anyway, I went to the freezer and grabbed an open container that had half a pint left. I asked my aunt if I could eat half a pint of ice cream that was left, to which she replied that there was none. So I thought it would be okay to tell her ""There's half a pint right here though."" Then, at the same time as my uncle responded by saying it's his ice cream, my aunt said I could eat it because she bought two others for thanksgiving. Sooo I was conflicted, and figured Id ask again if I could eat it since my uncle said it was his. In these exact words, ""Oh. Well *uncle's name* said it's his...is it still okay if I eat it?"" PLEASE REASSURE ME THAT ISNT DISRESPECTFUL :( It's killing me even right now to think that after asking again, my uncle retorted with ""You know what Rachel, whatever. Just eat the ice cream. I dont want to get caught up in your drama."" I. am. still. so. confused. That just hit me out of nowhere. In hindsight,  I just should have stayed silent to avoid confrontation. But Im an outspoken person and say what is on my mind. My immediate reaction was just to shake my head in disbelief and say ""What? "" I mean.. what else could I say? So i went with ""You know, I'll just put the ice cream back for you-"" And BOY did they start their angry comments early, before I even finished. There were just repeated comments about me being disrespectful and ungrateful and rude and *acting like I own everything* and man, I PROMISE i was keeping as calm as I could when i kept trying to explain myself. Never got a word in. I tried saying how I was only asking a question out of genuine care of whether or not I should eat it if it isnt mine. So of course this escalated. The attitude hit me. I was clocked out of being respectful after the encounter where I said, ""I am trying to have an adult conversation"" and my aunt replied with ""You're not an adult."" So, I began with the whole ""Wow, all this over some ice cream,"" ""This is so dramatic,"" etc. Comments I wouldn't make if I werent upset. They kept yelling. I was told to leave because my aunt didnt want to see my face anymore. So, I packed up necessities, and left. Slept in my car last night. Was told by police to go back home or find a hotel, the latter which I cannot afford. I really had nowhere to go. I have nowhere to go. I dont know whats worse at this point. 

The issue here is that this tension and stress and hurt is unbearable to me. Is that dramatic? I also dont want this to come off as if my aunt and uncle are demon spawns and Im an innocent angel. I had hoped to clear that up in the beginning of this post. I know I can help out more and I understand that I can be in bad moods. I know when I have attitude. But when it came to the point of being kind and asking genuine questions and being hit with screams, it took a toll on me. I seriously want to know if I am overreacting. I want to know if I shouldnt be expecting adult conversations with people who want to parent me. They remind ne often about how they dont *have* to care for me but they do, then how they dont want to be responsible for me, then give me a curfew of 11 or 10:30pm whenever I go out, then tell me i should be an adult and make my own decisions, then tell me I am not an adult. A small part of me understands that they have never been parents before, they have never lived with a teenager/young adult. But most of me does not understand their responses to me, their attitudes, their controlling. I want to know what I should do. Because at this point I feel so upset and frustrated that I dont want to see them, and so guilty at the same time for being rude and yelling that I dont want to ever go back.

509,"This is mainly a vent post but advice is highly appreciated. This’ll be a long one.

For privacy reasons, I’ll call the teacher Satan.
This year my class got switched to a new math teacher and it hasn’t been going well. She usually tells us to just read what’s in the textbook, after she’ll briefly explain how to solve a problem and then we’ll do some exercises related to the topic and start solving them on the whiteboard. 

After the switch almost everyone’s glades plummeted and people were getting worried about their term grade. My class has never really had huge problems with math, maybe a couple of students but not that many, so this was a shock to all of us.

We were used to a teacher who actually teaches. Who explains how to solve something and why it’s solved that way and how to solve it. We used to have a specific notebook that had a collection of different topic in it and ways to solve different problems. People weren’t afraid to ask questions either because the teacher was nice and kept teaching until every last person understood how to solve a problem.

Well now we have Satan, Satan is not the best teacher, I’d say she’s one of the worst even. As I’ve mentioned before, she doesn’t really explain anything and thinks that we’ll understand all of it by reading the textbook, which usually isn’t the case. Then she gets mad when we don’t know how to solve a problem because “we just read about it”. When a student is at the whiteboard stuck somewhere and just won’t understand how to continue with the problem Satan gets annoyed. 

For example (an actual conversation):
Satan: and what do you do next?
Student: [says incorrect answer]
Satan: no... what do you do? *pointing at different parts of the problem*
Student: I don’t know..
Satan: yes you do
Student: I don’t...
Satan: yes you do! *basically yelling at the student at this point*
The teacher said something afterwards that I can’t recall but the student left the lesson in tears, which shouldn’t happen.

Another thing about Satan that’s really not great is the way she sometimes answers to questions. Us (the students) barely know anything about the topic because Satan doesn’t teach well and her methods are shit. One of my classmates (let’s call her B) Asked a couple of questions related to a problem and Satan replied in a mocking tone, which made B feel really bad because she felt like she asked a dumb question. Satan sometimes answers in a mocking tone and then gets mad when people don’t ask questions. It’s like she isn’t self-aware.

When we had our first tests after transferring to a new math teacher, our scores were terrible to say the least. The grading system here is from 1-5 (1 being the lowest, 5 the highest) and over half of the class got 2s. This shouldn’t be normal. After we got our tests back Satan was solving the problems with us (like she usually should) and talked about HOW EASY THEY WERE and how WE SHOULD’VE KNOWN THIS etc etc. Our moods were already down after seeing our scores, but then Satan had to make us feel like dumbasses on top of it, great.

Satan also offers consultation (which means after-school lessons, if that’s not the correct word for it), a lot of students go to consultation and still don’t understand the topic well, what’s the point of math lessons if you can’t even properly teach math?! Students shouldn’t waste their after school time learning more math because the teacher can’t properly teach in the first place.

Math has always been a really important subject for me and I want to do well in it. I’m planning on talking to Satan and giving some constructive criticism to hopefully make the math lessons somewhat enjoyable. Any advice on how I should approach talking to her?

With the upcoming breaks / holidays I finally have some time to catch up on some TV shows I've been putting off. Lol I need some advice on which ones I should watch first.

Some factors to consider are time, personal taste, chances for spoilers...

**Live Action**

&amp;#x200B;

**Stranger Things S2:** Pro: First season was enjoyable enough, everyone hypes the show, though surprising S2 hasn't been spoiled for me yet. Con: Each episode is a bit longer than I probably have time for.

**Black Mirror:** Pro: Really interesting show, currently finished S2 so far... Con: Again, each episode is pretty long.

**The Good Place:** Pro: Heard it was really funny, I love Kristen Bell, only 1 or 2 seasons so far so should be pretty easy to catch up... Con: Ongoing show means bigger chances for spoilers so much watch ASAP.

**Silicon Valley S3-5:** Pro: Extremely funny, maybe my favorite live action show so far. Con: Started reminding me too much of work , entrepreneurship, etc... It'll take a while to catch up with these 3 seasons...

**Friends:** Classic show, many friends recommended, I first thought this show wouldn't be my cup of humor but when I saw some clips on Youtube I found it hilarious. Also really no chances of being spoiled on anything.. Con: Way too many seasons, it'll take forever to catch up.

**The Office:** Classic show, many friends recommended, basically every millennial that grew up in the US has seen the Office. Also really no chances of being spoiled on anything.. Con: Way too many seasons, it'll take forever to catch up.

(I know many comments are gonna be like how have you never seen Friends or The Office!?!? Idk, busy I guess lol... I've also never seen Breaking Bad which I'm told is the best show ever made. I've also never seen Game of Thrones. The thing is I loved that D &amp; D stuff when I was a kid and was made fun of it, but I guess when you put boobs in something it makes it cool I guess? Idk I knew about it when it was first coming out before it blew up, but just never gave it a chance and missed the opportunity to talk and theorize each season with all my classmates/co-workers so now its like whats the point?...)

&amp;#x200B;

**Animation**

&amp;#x200B;

**Avengers EMH:** Pro: Watched all of it except the last season, good show, well made. Con: If I wanna watch the last season I have to watch from the beginning lol...

**Voltron:** Pro: Heard it was good, I like the animators. Con: Lots of episodes to catch up on.

**Young Justice:** Pro: I wanna re-watch to prepare for the new season. Con: Lots of episodes to catch up on.

**Avatar TLA :** Pro: I'm already on the last season, re-watching to prepare for Netflix series.

512,"They all drink and I dont. I love them, but how can I find more common ground?",21Nov2018,1
513,"I lived with my dad for the past 2 years. He’s an alcoholic and we stopped getting on when his drinking started to take up all our money. He’s unemployed and at points was drinking two bottles of vodka a day so I felt I was being neglected as we were often lacking basic requirements like food, internet, TV, and so on. I stole his painkillers all the time and occasionally some money since I was addicted to MDMA and codeine. Fighting over this grew into fighting over other things and our relationship began to deteriorate. Because of this and his alcoholism he’s developed pretty bad depression and anxiety and attempted suicide three times now. It was clearly for attention as he asked me if he could kill himself before allegedly taking 10 grams of paracetamol with a bottle of vodka which would surely kill him but he came out of the hospital the same night with no liver damage. He tried to cut his wrists about a week ago but he did it on the phone to his crisis worker and told her he did it, so again clearly not a genuine suicide attempt. Last night he was having a go basically blaming everything on me so I just left the house and went to stay at my sister’s. I got a call from the police asking where I was and I told them, then they said my dad was ‘going somewhere’. I asked the student counselor at college to call the mental hospital and they said he was there because he tried to kill himself. He left the door locked with all my stuff in the house and I have no key. Social services are telling me I can’t stay there without an adult. I want my mum to stay with me but she’s schizophrenic and lives with my sister who won’t let her stay with me at my dad’s. My sister won’t let me stay at hers either. I’m currently in a hotel being paid for by social services but I’m only here for two days then I have to find somewhere else to stay. I really don’t know what to do. I need to convince my mum to stay with me at my dad’s and I need to do it quick cos I’ve got 15 grams of ket coming from the dark web. The other option is supported housing but I don’t want to go into that. I really feel like I’m stuck here. ",21Nov2018,1
514,"I'll try my best to keep this as simple as possible. My girlfriend and I met while she was seeing someone else. We were friends for about 6 months and things grew between us on both ends. I walked from the situation because 1) I wanted her to be with him if she was going to choose to do so... without me being a distraction or anything like that and 2) the difficulty of watching a woman I truly felt I love be with someone else. After a few months apart she reached out to me. After a very weird interim... she broke up with him and we ended up together. It's been about a year...and he still texts her every single morning with a ""good morning. I love you so much, have an amazing day"" or some shit like that. We are very happy, we each have a child from a previous relationship, and they get along great. Parts of our families have met. We work incredibly. Everything in our relationship is on point except for this. It fucking bothers the living hell out of me. She didnt answer for 2 weeks and he said he was going to show up at her job/house..she responded which started this all over again. We have talked about it, we have fought about it... he is aware we are together and of our level of happiness and commitment. He still proceeds to do this. It effects me, I dont like it nor am I comfortable with it. She has told him that she is with me and is happy with me.. but it hasnt made it stop. Most days she answers with a ""good morning""... some days they talk throughout the day. Some days she doesnt answer. They never exchanged all their ""stuff"" and still have some ties. She has been trying very hard to not see him or have to do that partly because its emotional burden, partly due to fear. We are very open..honest with eachother. 
My question reddit: do I simply just ignore it and move on in our relationship? Should I let it go/am I making a bigger deal about this than it is? She knows how to end it, but holds back on going the full length to do so..

I've been very torn and frustrated so I guess I am trying to see other individuals view points without being so distracted by my own. Also getting the opinions from people not involved might be helpful
I love her, I dont want to cause her more stress or hurt by being an asshole about this... but I also feel my feelings on the matter should be considered.

Im gonna try to tldr this as much as I can.

I barely sleep. I try but my girlfriend tells me im jist turning twisting all night. I feel exhausted 100% of the time. After im done stacking shelves im broken and crash on the couch with music on with my headphones to hide from the apartment block noises.

Life feels like a dream where i have no impact or control at all.

In my mind everything seems futile because of my physical headache / eye problems. 

I just want to have some calm some quiet and peace and a fucking break for a second.

Ive got friends/family and a gf that are supportive and i love them u conditionally but it doesnt feel as if its really helping anymore. Im grateful for having them dont get me wrong but as i mentioned earlier im jusy very disconnected from reality. 

No I am not suicidal. Im convinced that my life has a meanig and I love life. Maybe not now but i know i have and i know i might be able to again. Just need some advice on where to start untangeling this mess.

I got cancer and finished chemo 2 weeks ago and am getting ready to go back to work next month, but first I want to decide what to do with my life and this involve deciding if I quit or not.

Let's weight the pros and cons:

&amp;#x200B;

Pros:

\+ Chance to work in another country

\+ Salary

\+ Opportunity to finish my masters (3 classes left + dissertation, aprox. 2 years worth of effort that I don't know if I want to go through)

\+ Work is fun

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

\- It's in a small town where I feel I am wasting my life and don't wan't to build a future

\- It's in a very particular business, I feel that what I learn wouldn't make myself useful elsewhere 

\- The work environment is HORRIBLE, filled with pessimistic people and stress and it was really bad for my mental health 

\- I think it will probably be very hard to find a work that pays me well in a big city or that will be without it flaws

I almost quitted before cancer but my father made the worst drama possible, I felt so much pressure from him that I ended up in a depression. Now I think if I choose to quit I will have to end relationships with him if he doesn't respect my decisions.

528,"So,
Some weeks ago, our teacher announced that we will do a field trip in April. Pretty much everyone was hyped for it except for me. He took told us that we can pick the destination but my class couldn't decide where to go. So my french teacher (he really likes France and often talks a lot about it) suggested that we could go to Paris. It isn't so far away and not that expensive. Everyone agreed with that idea, even I did, because I didn't wanted to look like a spoilsport. We are 10th graders, around the age of 15/16, the age at which most people prefer visiting huge cities or capitals. I never liked them. I once got a panic attack when I went to Rome. I also already went to Paris when I was in 5th grade and I absolutely hated it (I'm sorry if i offended you. It wasn't my intention). I don't like traffic. I prefer the less stressful, more chill country life. I have to mention that I probably am a bit homophobic, so I don't like being surrounded by people. The trip is taking place in April but I am really anxious about it. I even become a bit depressed because of it.

I’m really close to my cousin I always go with them to his step dad’s (my uncle) bbq’s and other family gatherings and my uncle always tells us to make ourselves at home and to talk to his family because now “we are all family”. So I took his advice and spoke to a girl who seemed shy and was around my age (I’m 19 she’s 17) and I talked to her about super hero’s and other shows, she genuinely seemed cool and then as I was leaving she gave me her number and I was flattered but I thought she didn’t mean nothing by it. As I started texting her I realized it was a mistake because she would text about 10 times each hour and sometimes even more and once again I thought she it was just a cool friendship even though I hated texting so much. After 4 months I grew tired so if she texted I would text back some bs to keep her busy (keep in mind she wasn’t a interesting person so her texts were bland and she always texted “so how are you?, how’s the weather?” And other stuff).

533,"So I recently moved into a family owned apartment that my parents bought a twenty years ago. We'd previously been renting it privately and part of the conditions of me moving in was that I'd find a flatmate so they'd get at least some of the money they'd previously made from her rent. Yes, I'm aware of how lucky I am, believe me.  It was a good investment on their part that has been widely used by family and non-family alike and has earned its cost back. Anyway, I digress.

I posted on Facebook to say I was looking for someone and got a response from a girl I knew in college a few years ago. We're both 24-25F. We were never friends in college, more acquaintances, but she always seemed nice and given that she was the one person who responded who I felt certain that a) wouldn't kill me or b) I wouldn't kill, I decided to go with her. Time passes, we move in five months ago. 

But unfortunately, unbeknownst to me, this girl comes with a boyfriend. Let's call him X. They've been dating a while now. Seems nice at first. I decided to try get to know him since he's hanging out at ours a fair amount (note: this is not an annoyance, it's part of living together and I get it. If he was a decent person, there would be no issue. I'm always up for making a new friend.) Within the first few minutes, he uses both gay and queer as an insult and deadnames a trans celebrity. Neither of them know I'm not straight but I'm left really bothered by this. We're all adults, why am I being faced with the same insults from when I was a teenager getting bullied in school?

I try to shake it off but the next time he's around, it happens again. So I sit my flatmate down, come out to her and tell her that his ""jokes"" make me really uncomfortable. She apologised, promises to talk to him and explains that his dark humour is a defensive mechanism that comes from some childhood issues with his mother leaving. Hm. I'm not totally convinced by this, but she buys me a nice copy of a book so I'm a little placated and willing to let bygones be bygones if he improves.

Time passes again and I can tell he's a little bit more careful on what he says around me but soon, bit by bit, that filter starts to drop. Instead of just homophobic and transphobic comments, I now hear racist and anti-Semitic remarks passed off as a punchline. Note: she never responds or calls him out on any of this and I've actually heard her laugh and go along with them. Which to me, is just as bad. I now make an excuse and leave the room  as quickly as I can when he comes over. 

I'm really feeling very lost on what to do. It's an informal arrangement, we have no contract so I don't think legal advice will help. I know another talk might be in order but I don't think any amount of talking can change this guy. I don't want to have to kick someone out but I'm really uncomfortable hearing this kind of stuff in my own home. I was raised to be a decent human being who has respect for others, not to put up with this kind of shit. Would forbidding him from coming over be too far? Or should I just avoid contact entirely?

We're also meant to be hosting a Christmas party next month and I'm not sure if I want to force any of my friends to have to meet him since many of them are not straight, white, etc. So yeah. Any advice at all would be great. ",21Nov2018,1
535,My dad has been putting off his taxes for years now and we have no idea why. Most scholarships require proof of income which we do not have so most of the scholarships my brother has tried to recieve have turned him down because of my dad. My brother is very smart and wants to go into engineering. His GPA is very impressive as well. My dad refuses to do them and puts them off no matter what. Is there any way around this and is there any way else we can get money to pay for his college years?,21Nov2018,1
536,I am the only white guy (only white person as well) in my class. I have somewhat played on this to avoid being bullied. The fact that my Dad is a cop has also helped. On a school trip recently we were assigned seats on the bus alphabetically. I was sat next to a black girl (at the back of the bus) and her friends. I fell asleep and while I slept one black girl put her hoodie over me to keep me warm which was quite nice but others (girls I should add) mimed doing sex acts on me and posted pictures of this to social media with hashtags such as #Blacked and #Blackd after the porn site. I am a bit creeped out about this.,21Nov2018,1
537,"This is my first time posting but I need help/outside perspective. Apologize for the format as I'm on mobile. 

I'm in Canada and my current boyfriend and I have a puppy (hes a year old, got him at 4 months) together. Now, my boyfriend has some anger issues and has at times taken it out on the the dog. Using the crate as punishment and keeps him in there for hours at a time when the dog has been bad. Last night I feel as if he took it too far. So I was doing this girls hair and I was trying to get my puppy away due to fumes of the dye and my puppy didnt want to leave me and kept coming back so my boyfriend pulled him by the collar which was fine but as soon as this girl left he dragged him around by the collar and shoved the cone on him (he has stitches so he has to wear it) and started yelling at him and of course my puppy was yelping and as soon as he sat on his bed, my boyfriend started kicking him (not hard but still) all pissed off at him because he kept trying to go around him to get to me  in the other room doing the girls hair. I was trying to get my puppy to lie down on his bed and my boyfriend just pulled his legs down even though his stitches are there. I explained I didnt like how he treated him and his reasoning is, the dog is not the boss and my boyfriend has to come off as the bad guy. I know he loves the dog, and has good moments with him but I dont agree with his tactics on dominance/training.

I want to leave for other reasons, and I want to take the dog with me, but how do I go about it because the dog is registered under his name. In turn, I walk the dog every morning, paid the vet Bill's and have supplied dog beds, treats, etc. 

Has anyone else gone through this? What did you do to go about it?

539,"So, my bf and I moved into an apartment together (2 apartment townhouse) early this year, our first apartment and the owner is a family friend so we were really excited and thought things would go well. 

For the record, the owner (let’s call him John) doesn’t actually run the apartments he has a lady hired (let’s call her Beth) does all the rent collecting, maintenance requests, inspections, etc. 

Anyways, a few months into living here we got neighbors. Young couple, 18 i think. I thought it wouldn’t be too bad and we could possibly make friends (we are early 20s). Boy was i wrong. 

This couple is Stockholm syndrome as hell. The first weekend we called the cops because he locked her up and beat her. Every weekend they get into a huge fight, including beating on the walls, slamming the door at all hours of the day/night, yelling and threatening each other, throwing each other down the steps (the wall by the stairs is the joint wall), hitting each other with vehicles, etc. Now they’ve picked up smoking/selling weed/other drugs which makes our apartment stink. 

Ive texted the female and asked if they could tone it down and be considerate. I’ve contacted Beth several times, she’s come down here once but they had left before she got here. She keeps saying they’re moving out but seems like empty promises. The police never find enough evidence to arrest either one since the female protects the male even after he’s beat her near to death despite myself and other neighbors taking videos of the altercations. 

I work odd shifts, so I sleep at weird times (sometimes at night sometimes during the day) and i can’t get any freakin rest with all this going on plus I can’t afford being around weed and risk it getting into my system (my job obviously doesn’t approve). 

Should i continue to suck it up and hope they actually are moving? Should i be super petty and slam doors/be loud since they’re inconsiderate to us? I’m at a loss and honestly getting more angry as the days go on. :( ",21Nov2018,1
540,"so... long story short. my ex gf cheated on me physically with several guys and then ended the relationship by killing herself. 

There was one guy though that she sort of started dating a bit, she claimed they never had sex but she emotionally cheated with him. this was about 6 months ago.

she blocked him on social media so he wont know of the news. Im conflicted on whether i should tell him what happened. thoughts?",21Nov2018,1
541,"Well guys, it's a problem that I've been dealing with for quite some time, but I still didn't manage to confront my sister about it.

Me [ 21], my younger sister [ 19], my little bro and my mum are living together for about 7 year's now since my parent's got divorced.
We went through a rough time, but thankfully it's getting better day by day since my mum and I both work and actually managed to provide some conditions for our siblings.
When we both are at work my sister is supposed to look after my 9 year old brother, she often invites her best friend with which we are familiar with, so that isn't a problem. The thing with her is that she's quite a troublemaker, she's young and that is okay, but her recent actions just go to far and I don't know how to deal with that.
She's together with her new bf for about 4 months, me and my mother are aware of this, altough my sister doesn't know that.

1,5 weeks ago, I returned home earlier than planned ( usually I arrive 3 hours before my mum comes home, she's pretty late and then immediately goes to sleep) and what I witnessed was shocking.
My sister and her boyfriend where having sex in the room AND in the bed in which I and my little brother sleep in!,
The door was closed and they didn't notice me, I hide myself downstairs, after some time they went out of my room and returned to that of my sister to take a shower. When I looked into my room, and this is no joke, I saw the used condom of that guy lying on top of my bed.
I was shocked and didn't know whether to storm into their room and beat the living shit outta both, at the same time my brother came in and I asked him whether they go in our room often and he nodded, but told me that my sister tells him to keep it a secret which he did.

I went out to take a walk and returned at the time I usually do, they at least took the condom away, but I told my brother to sleep and the couch and cleaned it so that he doesn't have to sleep on that.

One of the main reason why I didn't tell my mother is because we're Muslims and my mum always has been strict when it comes to sex before marriage, I can't possibly tell that to her right?

I just don't know what to do guys, should I confront My sister myself or would that worsen our relationship?

543,"M22 Long story short I've gotten into the habit of peeing in the sink. Looked it up and apparently lots of guys do it. Anyways the sink at my house is broken so my dad put a thing over it so now I gotta pee in the toilet but instead I pee in the bath tub. Not while showering btw but in the bath tub just as. I hate the toilette for two reasons number one water splashes back. Number two parents and sister always complained about pee being on the toilette seat and how I should sit down and pee. So when I started peeing in the sink they stopped getting angry everything was good. 

Any how today my dad caught me peeing in the bath tub. I didn't know he was watching me pee. Apparently he was and told my mom and sister and called me out on it. I also can't pee in public in front of any either I get scared I guess? I try really hard to pee in public but can't...

My parents are really abusive verbally and psychical to me growing up. My dad broke my arm in kindergarten and pretend I fell down the stairs. For years was beaten. They've scared me for life I'm never going to get married or have kids. Personally don't like kids as well as their toxic marriage has ruined me from ever liking females.  

Also to add my dad half assed the plumbing job he made to the toilette so now it barely flushes you gotta flush 3 times to get poop down. My parents aren't going to hire a plumber, my dad always just gets an excuse to take the day off and ""fix it"" notice my sink don't work right now its cause of his plumbing abilities. Same with the toilet. He's an abusive, gambler, who thinks he knows everything and controls my life and that I owe him for him raising me. 

I'm 22M like I said about to finish college though I got 35k in loans owe my sister 25k she helped me pay it and 10k to government. :( ",21Nov2018,1
544,"I am a male, and my male cousin molested me when I was a child. I am deeply, deeply ashamed of myself and I hate almost everything about myself. I have never told anyone because I am afraid of being thought of as a sissy, or as a weak victim. I am grown now, and I overcompensate for the abuse by being ultra masculine. I have created a persona about myself and I am terrified of what people think about me.

I have never told a single living soul about what he did, save for online where everything is anonymous. When it first started he was bigger than me and made it seem like a game. As I got older and I grew bigger than him it stopped but I still never told. So they keep inviting him over for special events. I tell them I dont like him but they just brush it off as a cousin rivalry. It would shatter my family if they knew.

I don't want my mom to know and cry, I don't want my father to be disappointed in me, I don't want to upset my ill grandfather. I just want to pretend it never happened, but as I get older and the holidays keep coming around it gets worse and worse because I have to see my cousin and I am completely aware of what he did. I cant repress it as well as I could.

I worry Im going to have a breakdown tonight or tomorrow when I see him. I am crying like a little baby and I feel very small, despite the fact that now im at least a foot taller than him. Everytime I see him I feel like that same child again.

I feel trapped. What do I do? How do I keep from going insane? I just want it all these thoughts to go away and for him and myself to die. ",21Nov2018,1
545,"Hello everyone, I’m at a point in my life where I’m just completely lost on everything. It’s ironic actually. A few years ago one of my close buddies wanted to commit suicide because his life had hit rock bottom. I was one the giving him advices and support. I was the one who called him everyday to ensure everything would be alright and to remind him to continue keeping his head up. Just the chance of living and breathing is enough to keep us going. Well, here I am now finding myself at rock bottom. Flashback to a few years ago. I had everything. I had enough money to live without stressing daily about needing more. I had a beautiful girlfriend who genuinely cared for me. I had no debt. I had hobbies. I was healthy. The perfect life someone in their twenty’s could’ve asked for. Then shit started happening and it all went downhill. In 2015, I lost my mother to a car accident. She raised me as a single mother, as my father was a deadbeat gambler and alcoholic. The person I loved most in the world was no longer here with me. I was depressed for a little while. The first tip of the iceberg was when I started to gamble. I won big the first few times, then soon it became an addiction that would eventually lead to where I am now. The losses came rolling in. I missed work because I was playing blackjack. I started lying to my girlfriend about where I was. I didn’t go home for several nights because I had lost so much that I would sleep in my car or casino just to wait until the next day to be able to withdraw from my debit/credit cards again after going over the daily limits. You can see where my life is headed now. Most men have at least one (some have all) of the four vices in life: drugs, alcohol, gambling, and women. Mine was gambling. I never really did drugs, except for ecstasy sometimes when I’m at edm shows. I’m just a casual drinker. No issues with being trapped or used by women either. Gambling was my vice. My girlfriend soon left me because of this gambling addiction. Some of it was also due to my anger management. I lost my job, and started doing ridesharing as my source of income. I started isolating myself from everyone. I was embarrassed to show face at events. I made a surprisingly decent amount driving, but whatever I had made I spent at the casino. My life took a huge plunge after I was arrested and then charged with a felony (possession/intent to distribute illegal narcotics). I was driving and delivering drugs to make extra money. Ironic for someone who rarely ever did drugs I’d say. I was granted a $30,000 bond, in which I’d pay 10% to the bondsman, but I had no one to call, and also no money to bond. No family, no friends. I spent seven months in jail until my trial date. I was found guilty with a class 4 felony. I didn’t have to serve any more time after the conviction. However, with a criminal record it’s been difficult to get back on my feet. I got deactivated from the ridesharing apps. I even got rejected from an Amazon warehouse job that pays $12.50/hr. I now work as a Safeway bagger. The best thing going on in my life right now is the freedom to walk around, breathing in fresh air, and not being locked in a jail pod and cell. Is that enough for me to continue living this life? Well, for one thing, I might have finally defeated my gambling addiction. I did a lot of self evaluation while in jail. When I had everything, and everything was going well in life, I still took it for granted. I was greedy and still wanted more. Look where it’s led me now. Broke with nothing and nobody. Yes, I’m thankful to be free and not in jailI, but I really don’t know what else I have left to live for. No parents, no significant other, no children, no career. No purpose. I wish everyone a happy thanksgiving. Spend these precious times with your loved ones and treasure these moments. If you think your life is shit, look for ways to improve it. I wish I could say the same for myself, but I think I might’ve dug a hole too deep to climb out of. Don’t look at what you don’t have, look at what you do have. Live and forgive. Appreciate your parents, appreciate your wife, appreciate your girlfriend, appreciate your children, appreciate your true friends. These are the people that make your world. Learn to be satisfied and appreciate the things you have. Appreciate your old car with 200K miles, appreciate the metro. Appreciate the bus. Appreciate walking. Appreciate your job. Appreciate your iPhone 6. Appreciate life. Don’t keep up with the Joneses. Don’t worry too much about what caption to put for your Instagram posts, don’t stress about how many likes you’ll have. Live for the right reasons, as the wrong ones will slowly kill you.
I felt like writing a long rant...mostly to make my days go by faster, partially because I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up. Thanks for reading, everyone. Stay safe out there.",21Nov2018,1

I want to say yes and get to know her more because she's very pretty and has a really sweet personality it's just that she has a thick accent I don't particularly like it just doesn't allow me to be attracted to her. she's very new to American culture so she doesn't understand a lot of the music, movies, shows, celebs, jokes, foods, places etc that I like talking about. She's also very naive innocent type because of how conservative her environment was back home.

547,"  Ok, so my friend (imma call her K for privacy) was approached by this guy (calling him OD) to go out on a date. He told K he wanted to make her happy and that he'd treat her right, already creepy, and before she answered she texted me. I told K about all of the shady and downright creepy shit OD has done. He has asked girls to shower with him, he is super fucking clingy, he asked for nudes, and has sent unsolicited dick pics to people. But he doesn't appear to be such a bad guy, he plays up the innocent quite new kid, when in reality he is an ass. She told me it was good information to know. Then, a week or so later she told me OD never asked her for nudes. I told her that was good, but what I should have told her was that he never asks on the first date. Today I found out he is K's bf. I want to be honest with her and tell her she is making a mistake, but I don't know how to do it, I really don't want her to get pissed at me. What can I possibly do? I've given her all of these warning but she won't listen, I don't want her getting hurt. ",21Nov2018,1
