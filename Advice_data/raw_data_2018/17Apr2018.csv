0,"I've had a serious back issue for a few months now. The chiropractor my parents have insisted on paying for has been absolutely no help and the whole thing is an obvious scam. Unfortunately, my parents are utterly convinced that chiropractic is some sort of miracle cure and that I need to keep doing it. It's almost like they think they know my body better than I do. Something is very wrong, I can't even walk right without severe pain in my lower back and no home remedies I have tried helped at all, including pain medication. I really don't know where else to turn and I need to fix this soon. Any help would be greatly appreciated. ",17Apr2018,2
1,"I (23f) met her (24f) in high school, we were best friends, had a fall out right after high school, it was her fault.  I’ll call her ABC. ABC was a bully. I was always her “second option” or third. ABC facebooked messaged me last year in August, we started being friends again, she thanked me multiple times for taking her back into my life. 

I informed ABC immediately her friend A had sex with her friend B’s boyfriend/ baby daddy years ago. I know this because he told me, him and i were really close. They are all still close friends. She won’t tell friend b that friend A had sex with her boyfriend. She says it’s not her place. Yet, last week on her birthday she invited all of them out and not me because she said she didn’t know if I would be uncomfortable with them. She invited me to celebrate with her cousin that she always talks bad about and her cousins friend. 

The day (her bday) she was going out with them (friend a and friend b) I asked how they could get along and she said maybe friend B doesn’t know. I asked if she would tell her and how she can just sit back on this. Especially because they are all hanging out and friend b thinks of them as really good friends. I asked her if she would tell me if one of her friends had sex with my ex or talked to him, she responded saying “I’ll respond to your text when I get home... (and proceeded to text me something about her night &amp; guy she liked)” I responded and she responded back still not answering my question. I didn’t respond until late the next morning asking if she could answer my question. She didn’t respond. An hour and half passed. I saw that she was out with her friend (the one she always put me second to, the one who kissed a guy I liked in high school and ABC didn’t tell me about it I had to hear about it from someone else)  
Why would she keep me waiting on a question like that. 
Also friend b wouldnt be ok with her best friend (friend a) having sex with her boyfriend even if they were broken up. I kissed friend a’s boyfriend when it was her ex &amp;  him &amp; i were best friends&amp; she hated me. I was never her friend. Just friends with ABC who is friends with friend b. Friend b found out I kissed him because ABC told her when we weren’t friends. 

I ended up letting ABC know I love and care for her but what’s friendship without trust. Would you have trusted her? ",17Apr2018,1
2,"I’m wondering if I [M/17] should go though with my plan of asking my crush [F/17] out to a Spring formal (Dance) coming up soon. We both have our last two classes together, get along pretty well and are good friends, and I want to take another step before the end of the year. I’m not really scarred of just the rejection itself, I bet I could handle it and walk away alive, but I Am scared of what might come after it. I just don’t want to harm our friendship by asking her out and making thing awkward in the future. 

As Childish a Gambino said: “I like you, and you like me, and I more-than-like you, but I don’t know if you do or don’t more-than-like me. you’ve never said, so I haven’t been saying  anything all summer content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me, And choosing to do so the next day and so on...So, this might be it for us. Unless I say something, And it might especially be it for us if I do say something...” from the song “That Power”",17Apr2018,3

14,"My friend and I never hang out alone, we always hang out with another friend as a group. My friend is very shy, but has had girlfriends in the past before we met. However, he has not had one for over a year (since I have known him). When we hang out at our houses or casually, he is always normal. We have wonderful conversations and enjoy each other's company. Him and our other friend always like to poke fun at me. He never texts me individually, but texts the group chat.

When we go out to bars, this changes. He will sometimes place his hand on the small of my back briefly. He will get closer to me than necessary to talk. He never dances with me, though. But he never ever dances with other girls. He will just dance by himself by me. I always thought it was because he is just not interested in girls right now. But I am realizing, maybe it is because he is interested in me?

We both got hammered recently at a bar, and he went up to the bar for drinks with me. He was being a lot touchier than usual. And then when I complimented him on how hot he was looking that night, he said ""ughhh don't say that"" with a smile, and he came up closer to me. When we walked back, he had his hand on my back. And when we got back to the dance floor, he lightly held the side of my head with his fingers in my hair while he talked to me in my ear. The next day, neither of us acted like anything happened, but I can't stop thinking about it.

Maybe he is just a close talker? Maybe I am weird about personal space and am thinking about this too much? I'm confused..",17Apr2018,2
16,"Hello everyone, I just need some advice on the situation at hand here. I’ll start by giving back story.

I’m in 8th grade in a public middle school. It’s the beginning of fourth marking period and I’m finally consistently turning work in; partly out of desperation, partly because I have adderal now. I messed up 7th grade really bad out of procrastination but was pitied in by my principal. My main problem is homework but I can pass any test without studying. So now it’s 8th grade and I screw up again, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd marking period. So here I am, finally with my adderal and able to focus; however, I think it was too little too late. I’m most likely being held back. And I don’t know
If there is any way to fix this. My principal knows I’m not stupid, I score AP classes on placement tests, and do well on  tests but man I can’t get work in for the life of me. If I get held back it would be horrible. I’m apart of multiple tight knit friend groups and a lot of people rely on me. So the social impact would kill me. I just don’t know what to do. I’ve always been the smart kid until middle school. Advice?

TLDR: Most likely being held back, have a marking period left in the year. Wondering if there is anyway to fix this, or help with the fallout. I’ve always been the smart kid until middle school, and have been stressed out because the educational environment of school, kills me. 

Also feel free to ask for specifications.",17Apr2018,3
18,"I'm a 13 year old male. For the first 13 years and some months of my life, I had no interest whatsoever in any human contact. I kept to myself and that was it. I also had little to no emotion whatsoever as it simply didn't come to me naturally. A few weeks ago though, I met a girl who I was actually interested in. I spoke to her a lot for several days, and I made my feeling clear to her and asked her to the school formal that is coming up in a few weeks. She agreed, and seemingly reciprocated those feelings. Then, not but a few days later, she comes up to me and says that she needs to tell me something. ""My friend asked me to go to the school dance, and I said yes because I didn't want to break his feelings, is that okay with you?"" And I, like a fucking idiot, said, convincingly too, ""Sure, I don't care."" We haven't spoken much since then at all. 

Just a few hours ago, I met a girl in a discord server I'm in. We flirted quite a bit, and I got into her DMs. Turns out, she's fucking 17. What the hell do I do then??????? Needless to say, that ended very awkwardly and I have no idea how my feelings work at all. Why am I so weird, and is there anyone like me? What the hell should I do?

22,"So today I was in the most minor car accident, just tapped the car in front of me in traffic.  No visible damage whatsoever on either car.  Guy takes my insurance info, says he'll let me know if he discovers damage later, then leaves in a hurry.  No police were called.  I have no pics or anything. 

I know, I fucked up.

I'm freaking out over this.  I don't have any of his info at all (this all happened in 2 mins, then the guy just drove off).  He has all of my info.

I'm pretty sure that he will either do nothing, or he will make a claim for replacing the bumper if he wants.

However I'm worried that he can sue later on, or claim that I was a hit and run.  I have absolutely no proof that this accident even happened, as my car looks completely fine.  But he has my info so who is to say that he can't just lie and say that it happened 'yesterday' whenever he wants to file, even years in the future? 

I already told my insurance agent what happened and he says to just wait and see if he files a claim.  However I want to do everything I can to protect myself legally.

Can I file a report with the DMV even though I don't have his info at all?  Should I?  Anything else I can do at this point?

23,"Hello. I work in high finance, where my firm makes large investments on behalf of investors. My role is supporting a small team that finds worthy investments and gets them approved by a senior committee. I apologize for the ambiguity but I am doing it for the sake of anonymity. I love the job, am grateful for the opportunity, and understand how competitive such a role is, which is why this situation is extremely hard for me.

Recently I discovered that one of my superiors on my team has manipulated a financial model (an excel workbook for the investment) to make an investment appear more profitable than our conventional methodology would project. This “manipulation” is actually a common practice in our industry, and we have done it for other investments. The reason I use a word with such a negative connotation is because he did not tell anyone that he was changing our conventional methodology. In a sense, the senior committee was mislead in approving the investment by not being made aware of the change. As someone assigned to this investment, I feel stupid for not discovering this earlier.

Please keep in mind that this person is my superior and has much longer tenure than I do. He has lead the underwriting on this investment with me supporting him. He is also a friend and mentor and has taught me everything I know in the industry. I have him to thank for my success with the  firm. Recently, i witnessed him being reprimanded for a failure to communicate his underwriting approach on a different investment. As such, he is “on thin ice” with the senior committee.

I confronted him about this “mistake” in the model, and was assured that it was “nothing to worry about”. I expressed my concern that this could likely be discovered by others in the future and was told, “that won’t happen, and if it did, it’s *my* fuckup, not yours”. For him, it’s obvious that it is too late to go back and confess this “mistake”, as he would most likely be terminated. Did he keep this quiet on purpose? Or was it a change he made early on in the underwriting of the investment, and genuinely forgot about it? I don’t know, but I will give him the benefit of the doubt. 

This puts me in an extremely awkward situation. I could either (A) be a whistleblower and alert the senior committee of what’s going on, all while risking my relationship with this superior and likely being the cause of his termination. Or (B) I could pretend I never discovered it and move on. (A) feels like the right thing to do in a vacuum, but like any ethical dilemma it is much more complex.

Again, I want to express that the specific change itself in the excel model is by no means illegal, or unethical. As I said, it’s a common industry practice - an alternative way to underwrite. The issue here is not the specific change in the model, but rather using an underwriting approach that was not communicated to the approval committee. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated. ",17Apr2018,2
24,"Hello.

For some time I feel that I may have been avoiding my own emotion. Of course I had my reasons,  I wanted to think clearly and logically, stay away from the distraction of social interaction and the pain they can cause, and I wanted to function as normal despite some trauma I endured. 

I've realized my desire to be social again, but I've forgotten how to endure emotional turbulance.  I think I may have distracted and decieved myself training to become mentally and physically strong/tough in college.  In the end I fear it was a matter of sublimation as I avoided my true weakness of being crippled by social and emotional turbulence. 

If I allow myself to emotionally invest, which hasn't truly happened in 4+ years... I'm overwhelmed by compulsive emotional thoughts that drive me bonkers... and my body physiologically responds in ways that confuse me and ultimately make me feel insecure not only about having emotions but displaying them as well since I've made great effort to rid myself of them. 

I figure that if I accept this as truth, then i may have only been distracting myself in this way as a defense to an ego I'm not even aware of.... My interest in my degree in science may have been a trivial distraction, and fuel to subconsciously defend an ego that I had mistakenly believed I had abandoned. I think it's why I'm currently underperforming in my final year, but I've lost the ability to care at this point. 
I don't know how I can allow myself to stay in an emotional flow anymore.",17Apr2018,1
25,"So, this is a bit of a wacky story. I'll try and keep it brief.

Today, my dad asked if we could get dinner since it was my day off. He came over to my place a little early, and after showing him about some improv comedy thing i was visiting that evening, he dropped a bombshell about taliking to me about something serious.

He then proceeded to casually open his heart about the fact that due to his chronic neck pain (Which he's been struggling with for several years now) and the fact that the narcotics he was prescribed simply weren't enough, he eventually started taking so many narcotics that he was simply in a low-level buzz. He would pass out and wake up doing things he doesn't remember, like waking up next to empty cashew cans or cereal boxes. He woke up to my mom yelling at him for watching porn, which he doesn't remember. He's been taking half days at work so he can come home and get high. I missed some signs, but he'll doze off during dinners or during basketball games, which I simply attributed to his age. He said that he's never been given enough to become physically addicted, since it was all prescription, but he still became psychologically dependant. One time, during a dinner with my sister, he got so buzzed my mom demanded he take a lap and he fell over in some bushes. It's apparently been pretty nasty, which would also explain my mother's behavior towards him. 

Now, my mother has always had a bit of an attitude with him. She would always snap at him for little mistakes or blow things out of proportion. I always hated this and feared a divorce for the longest time. but they never did and they were determined to stay together. Recently, especially the last few years or so, it became a little more vitriolic and one-sided. She's really had to deal with a lot recently and having to crack down on him due to this has made her bitter and irritable. Since I'm a natural smartass, I tended to piss her off a lot even if i didn't mean to. My dad's confession sort of explained this behavior.

Anyways, he also mentioned that he and my mom were no longer living together. He's going to stay at the lake house, she's going to live here in town. They're taking some time off. He asked if I had any questions and I simply asked if there was risk of a potential permanent split. He said ""Anything is possible but I don't think she wants that. While I was taking these narcotics, the thing that made me...me...went away. She still loves me but she's not IN love with me anymore."" He apparently also had the talk with my sister.

Even after hearing this, I didn't feel much. I felt enlightened, having been given an explanation for some weird behavior. Yet, I felt like I was supposed to be upset, but I simply wasn't. A little disappointed, sure, but not what I was apparently supposed to be feeling. I went and had dinner with my dad that night, some good BBQ, then went home and talked to my sister who apparently had been bawling her eyes out the night she was told. She was angry and shocked I wasn't feeling anything. She expected me to kill myself over it due to my issues with depression. My mom thought I would hold her accountable. Yet, I feel next to nothing, except for an obligation to make sure I'm available and know that both my parents can talk to me, I'm here for them, and if either of them need help, I'll be there.

Maybe it's the fact I'm off of one of my meds, but...I guess I'm trying to make myself the steadfast emotional fortress? I don't know what I'm supposed to feel. I don't even know what advice I'm supposed to ask for right now. I feel lost, I guess. I feel like I'm supposed to care, but I just don't know enough about how to fix things TO care.

So, yeah...what should I be doing? I've already vowed to keep my dad in line, have dinner with him more often, make sure he knows I'm there. He muttered all night about how he was worried about my mom, so I know he cares. I know the last thing he needs is the entire family mad at him. I know what he needs right now is support.

I guess...what's the best kind of support I can give him? What should I be doing to make sure he stays straight and narrow? Am I supposed to be feeling more? This is all new ground for me and never in my wildest dreams did I expect my dad (Who is in the medical field and should know these things) to become addicted. I can tell he's trying to get better as he's already talked about Narcotics Anonymous meetings. I've offered to go with him, and aside from that, I don't know what else to do. I don't even know what advice to ask for. So...yeah. That's it, I guess. I'll answer any questions as I can.",17Apr2018,2

27,"Warning, long post. Tl;Dr at the end


Background: I (f23) and my boyfriend (m23) have lived in our apartment for almost 8 months. We have lived together for almost 3 years now, and we had two other apartments for a year each before this one with no issues. I have pretty bad anxiety and insomnia, so I tend to be awake pretty late into the night. My boyfriend is sometimes up late because his job sends him on a combination of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd shifts. We don't play loud music or anything and do our best to be respectful of those around us. 


The very first night we moved in, we were laying on the ground playing battleship since we didn't have our furniture yet. I spent some time walking around the apartment because I was so excited and I also walked around the kitchen making us a couple drinks. Just after 9pm there was a knock at the door and the lady downstairs asked us to keep the ""stomping"" down as they had a child trying to sleep downstairs. I was taken aback because I was the one walking around (I was 140 pounds soaking wet and people frequently comment on how quietly I walk) and I hadn't thought I was making any noise. I quickly apologized and tiptoed around for the rest of the evening. 


Throughout the next couple months they left a few notes on our door asking us to walk lighter and knocked on our door again once or twice, usually around 9 or 10pm. Each time we apologized, but explained that the floors were creaky no matter how lightly we step and we were genuinely doing everything we could to not disturb the kid. We try to walk as little as possible, but I tend to stay up late and I'm within within my rights to lightly walk around the apartment i pay $1100 a month for no matter what time it is. 


They eventually stopped knocking and leaving notes, and my boyfriend and I continued to tread lightly. We had kept the notes, but eventually threw them away because we thought the problem had been resolved. 


Then Saturday night my I worked a long shift and got home pretty late. I hadn't eaten so I walked around some making food, using the bathroom, changing my clothes. I showed my boyfriend something silly our cat was doing in the other room.. basically we were walking around normally between 2 and 3am, but we weren't stomping or dancing or anything. 


Instead of typing the rest out, I'm going to copy and paste the email I wrote my landlord: (Sorry that it's long) (incident is third paragraph in)


""[Landlord],


Hi, my name is [moomoomego] from apartment 2300. I don’t believe we have met but I know you have spoken with [boyfriend] a few times. I’m sorry for bothering you on a weekend, I just wanted to inform you of an event last night to keep you in the loop.


            I believe [boyfriend] has told you before, but in 2017 our downstairs neighbors left a couple notes on our door and knocked on our door to let us know that our footsteps were bothering them and requested that we keep the walking to a minimum.  They explained that their son is a very light sleeper and that it keeps him awake when we are walking, although they acknowledged that the floors are very creaky and there is little we can do to muffle our footsteps. Usually they would come to us with this issue anywhere between 9 and 10pm. [Boyfriend] and I have been literally tiptoeing around the apartment since then. I always wear heavy socks or slippers in the apartment and try and take larger steps to minimize the number of steps I take, but there is no way to get around the floorboards creaking. I have not spoken to them about this issue since late 2017, so I believed that this situation had been resolved as best as it could be.


            Between the two of us, [boyfriend] and I work a combination of first, second, and third shifts to make ends meet. [Boyfriend]’s job will frequently send him on jobs that do not end until 1am or 5am, and my two jobs can sometimes require odd hours. Whenever it is after 10pm we are very aware that quiet hours are in place and that people around us are sleeping, so we make sure that if we watch TV that it is on a minimal volume, keep our voices to a minimum, etc.  However, we usually need to eat when we get home, even if it is at an inconvenient hour. It is a necessary part of our lives to eat, use the bathroom, and do other normal things that require us to walk around the apartment during night hours.  We do everything in our power to keep any noise to a minimum, especially because I sympathize with our neighbors in 2200 - having a child who is a light sleeper in an apartment must be very difficult.  I am frequently woken up at 5am by the children above me screaming, so I understand that noise can be a big disturbance.


            After I worked a long shift on Saturday, [boyfriend] and I made some food around 2:30am.  We were not jumping or stomping, simply walking around the kitchen making food. We make a point not to walk near the bedrooms except to use the restroom so as to keep the footsteps in that area to a minimum while others are resting.  When I was sitting in the living room around 3am, I suddenly heard a long banging and the floor shook. At first I thought maybe someone above me fell out of bed or was stomping, but I couldn’t pinpoint where the noise was coming from.  Then I heard 4 loud “booms” again and the floor shook again. My cat hid and began whimpering, and I was equally freaked out.  About 3 minutes later the man who lives below us pounded on our door. Upon opening the door I saw he was shirtless and clearly agitated as noted through his heavy breathing and the fact that he began yelling at [boyfriend] and me. I asked him if he had heard the pounding because that really freaked me out, and he said that was him pounding because we were making a ton of noise walking around.  I attempted to apologize and explain that I had just been resting but needed to make some food but he interrupted me to continue to yell.  He said that we need to stop walking and that if we do not he will call some of his friends, or he will call the police for a noise disturbance. I was very frightened and taken aback, both because shirtless men yelling at me is very upsetting to me, and because there had been no prior calm request to keep any noise down in months.  [Boyfriend] and I stated that we pay rent here and while we make every attempt to keep our footsteps quiet, we cannot stop walking around all together in our own apartment. The man continued to state he was going to call someone if we continued to walk around and stormed off. 


            I am a 140 pound woman who has been diagnosed and is in treatment for an anxiety disorder.  Sometimes when I am having a panic attack, I will pace around the living room to center myself. I always make sure to do this away from the bedrooms and as lightly as possible, and I have kept this to a minimum since they made a complaint regarding our footsteps at 9pm the very first day we moved in. [Boyfriend] makes every effort to walk lightly, which is difficult for him because he is bigger than me.  The floors creak no matter how lightly we step.


I had a full blown panic attack after this incident last night. I was up until after 5am checking to see if there were cop cars outside, wondering if he was going to call his friends, etc. I have rented multiple apartments prior to this one, and I have not had any neighbors ever complain to [Boyfriend] and I about noise.  I felt, and still feel, unsafe in my apartment right now due to his threats.  I do not know what he meant to imply when he threatened to call his “friends”, but the yelling and pounding made me reach the assumption that this was meant aggressively.  Is the walking around an issue that he would be in the right to call the police and file a noise disturbance about?  I do not have a copy of the condominium rules, but I assume I should be able to walk around in my own apartment, provided I am not stomping, bouncing a ball, etc.  Please let me know if I am not allowed to walk around my apartment during certain hours.


I am not asking you to take any specific action by sending you this email. I simply wanted to keep you in the loop.  If I am yelled at and threatened in this manner by him again I will be calling the police to ensure my safety. I did not take any action last night because I tried to empathize with him and assumed he was just worked up and would calm down. 


Thank you for listening and understanding,

I forgot to include that he also said he was going to call our landlord over and over to ""keep him up as late as we are keeping him up"".

The landlord said he would forward it to the property manager, and I haven't heard anything since. I can hardly stand being in my apartment without having uncontrollable anxiety. Any advice would be appreciated. 


Tl;Dr: Downstairs neighbors think boyfriend and I walk too loud and are keeping their child awake. Due to jobs we keep odd schedules and sometimes get home and eat during the night. We have tiptoed around apartment for months. On Saturday night the (shirtless male) downstairs neighbor pounded on the ceiling and then came up to our apartment, yelled at us, and threatened to call his ""friends"" or call the police for a noise disturbance. Anxious at home now - not sure what to do (if anything)

But with our other roommate (let's call her Sarah), Jane will often just take her food without asking. Does this mean she's more comfortable with Sarah, or does it mean she thinks Sarah is easier to take advantage of? I really hope she's not uncomfortable around me or something. Also, Sarah has told me that she doesn't like it when Jane does that, but she also doesn't want to confront Jane about it, so it's not like they have some mutual agreement about sharing food or something. I don't think I'm intimidating at all, I'm maybe just a little less passive than Sarah? So I don't know why Jane treats us differently. Please let me know what you think.",17Apr2018,2

Ever since I met him I keep getting this image in my head of her with him and it breaks my heart. Every time it pops into my head it upsets me and I feel like throwing up.

The other friend (let’s call him Chester)  had a conversation where he gave Bob some tips to better his videos. Bob took to the criticism well over the phone(Chester originally wanted to meet in person but Bob insisted on FaceTiming) but when the time arose for them to hangout and for Chester to show Bob how to edit and film better, Bob kept canceling and rescheduling. Then finally Bob and Chester got into an argument over text where both of them said some unsavory things.

32,"Contrary to belief, I'm actually pretty hardy when I know I deserve criticism - I actually encourage wholehearted criticism when I am getting feedback on an assignment or piece of work. However, for some reason feedback that invalidates me not understanding the concept of what is being taught keeps nagging me and I can't shake it, if that makes sense.

For two examples: I've been struggling a lot with French. I didn't want to take it (I wanted to take Chinese) but had to fulfill my foreign language requirement. I couldn't understand many things about it, couldn't articulate what my problem was, and kept getting low grades on exams. The other day in class, I had an epiphany while doing passe compose, and realized that there are different instances to do ont and sont. I asked the professor to elaborate. She did, but angrily, and after telling me that if I studied, I would know. I have been studying. I literally didn't know until she clarified the problem that that was why I was losing points (she scribbles an x or a checkmark and doesn't clarify). I feel dumb just writing this out, but I felt like while it was valid advice, it just felt like a jab at me doing worse than the rest of the class?

Second example: I went up to my social science maths professor today because we have an upcoming exam. I wanted some guidance on what I was doing wrong with the sample t-test (I think the difference between independent and repeated). She explained, I didn't understand, and then I finally comprehended it. All well and good. Then I asked her, generally, what she thought I could do to bring my grade up from where it has generally stayed. She told me that I needed to learn conceptually rather than focusing on just solving the problem (fair criticism) but then told me that honestly, I should have known how to do that by now and I need to try harder.

??? I'm literally shaking with anxiety while I'm writing this. I have three exams each day this week, five assignments, overly sensory of my fingers to the point it literally HURTS, very lonely and dealing with commuting to a college that's 98% dormers, and staying up to 3 every night. t has been very hard for me in general this semester, struggling with what I think is an undiagnosed learning disorder; everything is overly sensory, the professors talk too fast, and it takes weeks for me to understand simple topics and apply them. I feel like I'm being overly sensitive because of everything I just listed above. If I am, how can I stop? It's getting in the way of everything I want to do. If I'm not being overly sensitive, what is a way for me to ignore these comments? Should I say to them that I'm working but having problems? I can't say stuff like having anxiety, depression, or anything like that - one of my professors told me every student has it so it's normal.

Also: I am trying to get tutoring and work on studying earlier, but I'm quite frankly overwhelmed with everything and end up just having panic attacks and not completing anything. Does ANYONE know how I can study better with all of these problems? I'm at the end of my rope. I feel so stupid as a 23 year old undergraduate surrounded by super smart 18 year olds.

33,"But not in a self-pitying way. Just in a matter-of-fact way.

I am in my late thirties. I recently completed a 12-month work contract and I am temporarily staying with my family. I am financially solvent. I have a decent work history. I am single and have no children. And aside from some minor trouble with my feet, I am in good health and have no major ongoing health issues.

I have some financial security in the form of retirement accounts. But I'm not independently wealthy and I don't have any capital to speak of... so, you know, risking $100,000+ on opening a small business is not something I would consider.

I am interested in living frugally and saving as much money as I can. I would like to build a large nest egg. And I am willing to go just about anywhere and do just about anything* to achieve that.

I wish to start working and saving money again as soon as possible. And I may be attempting the impossible when I say this, but I wish to avoid anything like taking out tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans to acquire credentials that would, in theory, enable me to make a six figure salary.

Let's assume I have an above average (and below genius) IQ, for whatever that is worth. And I am generally an easy-going, likeable person. I am on the extreme introvert end of the spectrum, but you might not guess that immediately when meeting me.

I have lived in a lot of places within the States and abroad, so I am geoflexible.

He was understandably quite upset with me, and claimed that I intentionally sold him a car with a major problem and he wanted his money back.

44,"Hi Reddit,

20-something female here. I live with two roommates, one my age, one a few years younger (we'll call her X). X's boyfriend lives several states away, but works remotely, so he will often come visit. I don't mind him - he's so kind &amp; polite, and always asks if he can help clean up, do dishes, etc.

The problem is, whenever he comes to visit (typically once a month, but sometimes twice), he stays for at least a week. Since he works remotely (for the most part), his leave date is somewhat arbitrary, and he has stayed a few days longer here and there. I never know when he's going to be staying here until the day he's due to arrive - this obviously is an easy solve, and I can ask my roommate to let me know when he's going to be staying next.

It's so frustrating because we don't have very much communal space, so the space we do have is precious. If they're in our living area, the only other space I can really be away from their couple-ness is my bedroom, where I don't always want to be. Living with two roommates is enough, I didn't want to have a fourth! And since he works remotely, he's often working from home while my roommate is out at work. When he's here for an entire week, I feel like it's no longer my apartment. (I should also note that my roommate who is my age &amp; myself both pay almost $200 more in rent due to having much larger rooms.)

Do I ask her to have him pitch in for some of the rent if he's going to stay? He's sometimes in her room, sometimes in our communal area, always very polite, but obviously contributes to utilities, they take up a little extra space in our already small fridge (cooking for two instead of just herself), and the bathroom obviously gets used more/gets messier quickly/move TP, tissues, water used, etc.

I feel like I'm being a whiny brat about it, especially since they live several states away and don't get to see each other everday. But in a small-ish apartment, having a fourth roommate for a week out of every month (when I did not sign up for this) gets frustrating because I feel like I can't relax in my own home.

Turns out I now have an offer at a small wealth management firm AFTER they initially turned me down. They only offered me the position when they expanded their internship program to two candidates this summer. So like any normal person I continue my search and I go to a school sponsored on site meeting with a partnered insurance company. I literally fell in love with the building. They are medium sized and have about 700 employees.  The wealth management firm has 18 people. I honest to God don't know what line of work I'll prefer. I was excited about wealth management until I was basically their second option which tells me they probably won't hire me after the internship full-time. I have an interview with the insurance company tomorrow and they have been pretty responsive to me. The insurance co. also emphasized how much opportunity there is to move up the ladder. They said they promote on average every year and a half. Whereas, the wealth management firm has promoted two interns from associate to senior associate in their 9 years of being there. The kicker is a senior associate makes about 80k based on my research which isn't too shabby. From my research it looks like it may take a decent time to catch up to that salary if I go the insurance route. Also, the culture seems similar in both where people are mostly business casual however I want a place where I can meet a lot of new people because I want to be more social so only having 18 coworkers doesn't seem appealing to me.

I decided to go to another school next semester instead, because this school wasn’t taking a lot of my transfer credits.

Apparently, there is a rule that if you don’t drop your classes by the FIRST DAY of class on the academic calendar, you’ll be billed a third of the expected tuition. 

I owe $984 dollars. I didn’t attend a single class. They said I could write an appeal letter to a committee to see if they could waive it. I wrote a full page letter, they denied my request. 

Is there anything else I can do to fight this?! Never in my life have I heard of this kind of rule, it seems extremely unfair to do that to a student. At least give them a week of trying their classes before you charge them anything!

69,"Ok so i used to be very close to my cousins back in high school but once we all started college we all went out seperate paths. Id say it generally started back when we all used to do alot of weed together back in the day. I quit about a year ago to focus on school and ive come to apprectiae the sober life more and dont see myself going back. They on the other hand still do, which is cool and i completly respect that. However they gave me a lot of shit when i quit and said i was being a pussy. Were now 2 years into college and i feel like i camt have any personal conversations with them about anything. I dont work either because im so caught up with school. Being jobless is another thing they make fun of me for and say im lazy and ask what i do with my time. Now i know the obvious answer would be to just tell them im busy with school but the thing is i feel a lot of jealosy amd resentment whenever school pops up. I out of all of them am exceling in school and the only reason they know that is because my mom brings up all my achivements with there moms. I dont like telling them anything because its always followed by resentment. They ask questions like there interrogating me for information and i try and keep the info i give them to a minimum. They always say how there moms tell them why they arent on my level and i always just brush it off like nothing. Ive told my mom to stop talking about me but it gets complicated sometimes when my aunts ask a ton of questions (like there kids aka my cousins) or when, for instance, i was out of town for a school related trip last week and she had to say because we had family over late and they asked where i was. The annoying thing about my family is if you tell one person something the whole family already knows beacsue they spread everything. I really really hate my extemded family for this reason. All there about is comparing one another and making each other jealous. Im planning on moving with my mom, dad, and little brother to a whole new city far away from all of them after i graduate. I hear alot that alot of families are like this. If yours is, how do you deal with it? Is it bad that they know about all the things your doing? My mom always tells me ""whoever wants to reach my level, can go ahead and try"" and i feel like its true. It doesnt matter how much of me they know, if there fucking losers theyll never get to my level. I know for a fact they dont want the best for me and all they do when im with them is bring a ton of negative energy and make me feel like shit!

I also want to point out that im conflicted on limiting what my mom can brag about to her sisters (aka my aunts). My mom is extermly proud of me and LOVES to show me off which i find completly normal for a mom wanting. Especially when her sisters are bragging about there kids getting bonuses at the mcdonalds jobs and she slams them with saying her son (me) got to take a paid internship trip to another city. I dont know what to do

71,"Hey guys, so this is my first post. I didn't think this would ever be my first post of choice, but I'm severely freaking out. So, I work for an apartment complex as a leasing agent. One of our buildings has a bed bug infestation. One of our maintanence guys said the issue isn't resolved, but it is getting better through routine heat treatment. Our office is where all residents drop off their rent checks, though. So we are a common area for residents. Here's my problem: For one, I am brand new at this job. I have been there for maybe 3 weeks. It is an amazing opportunity with great pay, and amazing co workers  who I love working with. My second issue is that I have had bed bugs once before thanks to a previous friend, and am TERRIFIED of them. I have been psychologically itchy, and have been checking my bed , walls, and clothes constantly for any signs of them. No matter where I go, I look for them. I dry my clothes on the highest heat setting as soon as I get home from work, and keep a spare set of clothes in the laundry room to change into. My dad has said over and over now that if it takes this much of a toll on me, I should quit. Especially since I live with him and 3 other people who could be at risk for getting them. But I'm not sure what to do, especially considering they said the issue in that one building is getting better, that I haven't seen any signs as of yet in the office, and I love my job...but we also don't have the money for extremination if an infestation were to occur, and I'm not sure if I can continue to deal with this psychological toll.
Am I over reacting? Should I quit my job and find another, or should I stay?

72,"I'm not really sure if this is the right place but there's a lot of variables involved with this that I don't think is applicable on any college related subreddit. I am a freshman engineering major at a very large university down south and am looking to transfer to Oklahoma State. There's a lot of reasons why I want to move, but the biggest is that I've found a passion for Architectural Engineering but unfortunately my school does not have this degree program. Something equally as important to me is that my girlfriend goes to Oklahoma State. I applied to the OKState (which has one of the top rated Architectural Engineering programs in the country) and got in, made it into the honors college, and am getting some aid to go there. Everything is in my favor to go to this school, but my mother is completely against it. She is a very religious person (progressive muslim), and for the majority of her life she has consulted gurus for advice. Before I decided on my current institution, my mother took me to see a guru (a close family friend), and after doing some spiritual work he told me that if I go to Oklahoma, I have a 0% chance of being successful there. He told me that something bad would happen there, but he's not sure what; it could be mental or physical. I believe in God to an extent, but this is a little hard to take in for me. According to my mother, every prediction a guru has ever made to her has been true. I don't want to believe in it, but it's something that's constantly on the back of my mind when considering the transfer. In addition, my mother thinks I'm moving just because my girlfriend is there. I'm not going to deny that she wasn't a factor in my decision making, but I think it's very lucky that the school she goes to happens to have a very good program. I've come to terms with the fact that things may or may not workout with her, although at the moment things are great. It doesn't change the fact that I have a degree that I need to obtain. I've been guilt tripped into feeling that I'm causing a huge burden on my parents by  wanting to go to this school. I do realize that I wouldn't be where I am today without my parents, and that they just want what's best for me, but I don't want to look back four years from now and say, ""Damn I really wish I made that move"". My mother has made it clear that if I make this decision, she'll help me a little financially, but she will cut me off in just about every other way aside from a social standpoint because if ""I can make these kinds of decisions, I can support myself"". I really don't know how to move forward.

73,"Hey guys, so I'm using a throw away and will be posting this to r/personalfinance as well.

So long story short, I found text evidence that my dad was cheating on my mom, confronted him about it,and I told my mom about it after he denied it and lied to my face. She plans on staying with him because she's in her mid 50's and doesn't want a drastic change of life. She also says that she believes there's more good in him than bad. This was about 7 months ago. Since then, I have cut off nearly all communication with him, telling him that I refuse to associate with him until he does the right thing.

Earlier today, my mom called me to talk to me about why I didn't have much money in my bank account and begged me to fix things with my dad. She finally told me that he is considering cutting me off financially and would no longer pay for my education if I don't make things right with him. I told her that that wasn't an option and that I wouldn't be doing anything with him unless he came to me and apologized about lying to my face and being a general douche bag through this entire situation. What should I do with this situation?

Currently I am trying to make contingency plans if I do end up getting cut off. I am a Sophomore baseball player with Junior credit hour standing at prestigious but overly expensive school in state, studying Biology on the premed track. I believe if I were to get disowned that my best option would be to transfer somewhere more affordable. I am sure I can get a decent amount of scholarships with my grades and I have about $2,000 saved up in my bank account with zero debt while I have been building my credit since I was 16. I will also have housing covered until the end of summer.

What should I do if I were cut off immediately? What steps should I take to ""make it""?

75,"I honestly don’t know what to do. I’m reposting this to a bunch of subreddits because I want as much advice as possible. Using a throw away account as well to save my dignity. I’m seriously freaked.

So I’m a 15y old female and in highschool. I’ve never really dated but I’ve always felt that was because I was afraid of commitment. A few guy friends over the years would show interest but I’ve never liked them back. 

Enter Alex. She’s been my friend sense we were maybe 9-10. Even through me moving away and her focusing on her own artistic projects we’ve always remained close friends. 

Side note: I now kinda realize that back when we were 12 or so I used to be a bit touchy. Nothing big, more like play wrestling or putting my arm around her shoulders. Around 13 she came out to me as a lesbian but I didn’t think much of it. I had a few lesbian friends at the time and I’m not homophobic so it didn’t bother me.

So over the last two years were been drifting semi-apart. We still texted each other but never really visited each other as we lived so far away. Recently, out of the blue, she asked if I wanted to hang out at mine over the weekend. I gave her the okay and she came over. We talked for a bit, caught up, did stupid stuff, and by the time we were running out of things to do it was already late. She asked if she could sleep over and of course I said yes. My mom wasn’t home at the time so she didn’t really mind and her mom was cool with it so her mom dropped off our things and she headed off.

So after we watch a dumb movie we’re both tired. We head to bed and I invite her to sleep in mine as it’s pretty big and definitely has room for the both of us. As were messing around on our phones she just kind of turns over and starts admitting that she kind of liked me and she felt bad sleeping in the same bed because of it. I’m obviously super fucking confused because she’s never really showed much interest. She looked really nervous and it felt really bad. 

Now I really, honestly don’t know how to describe why I did this but eventually she kinda looks up and me and it hits me she’s kinda cute. Like suddenly I was introduced this idea and I was leaning into it. She asks if she can kiss me and I just kinda nod my head yes. I don’t want to go into detail about what happened next but it got really heated. Next thing I know it’s the morning after and holy shit. 

So she makes breakfast, we watch tv in silence, she leaves. One day later and this is me. I’m still in fucking horror. I’m so scared because that was my first. I’m kinda shaking writing this. 

My mom doesn’t know because she was out with her boyfriend for the night. I’ve just been laying on the couch mainly with no idea what to do.

When I was younger, it didn't worry me because I thought that's just the way things are and went about life. The doctor was very clear that I needed to be checked on every 6 months or less and I'll admit that I was not always dilligent about this.

Last Thursday, I went for my check-up and the doctor was very quick to tell me that there was a growth that was not there before and showed up quite suddenly. He tried to reassure me but the momentary panic I saw on his normally calm face has me feeling anxious. They immediately performed a biopsy on it after the discovery.  There's so many things going through my head. I'm afraid that means issues with having children or my health.

80,"Hello, 

I need help trying to change my mindset or finding a way to make this work. 

I made an irresponsible decision., here’s the context: 
I am a stay at home mom to a 2 year old. We have a dog who’s 4 years old, I rescued her from the street when she was mangy and malnourished, 3 years ago. 

She’s the best dog but does have her quirks (which I attribute to her living on the streets): for example she’s very nervous around strangers and very territorial (which works great actually because she lives outside my home in a fenced yard so she’s a great guard dog), other than that she’s the sweetest to my family and we love her. 

Everything was fine until I made the (in hindsight) very irresponsible decision to get another dog. A puppy to be specific. I didn’t like my dog being all alone outside and I think she gets lonely sometimes so I thought bringing a puppy home would cheer her up and maybe even help with her nervousness. 

Well, it’s been 2 days and so far she’s hating the new puppy. :’( 

I feel so guilty . and what makes me feel guiltier and is actually the main reason why I’m asking for advice is because my husband wasn’t on board with the decision of getting the puppy. I dismissed his opinion telling him that this was a great idea and that he’d see how happy our older dog was when she had a companion. He simply said “you won’t be able to do it” (meaning take care of 2 dogs and one baby).   Understandably, now he’s acting very grudgingly against  me (like being very cut-off ish, etc) . 

In conclusion, I now recognize that this was an irresponsible decision. I ignored my husband’s wishes and  made a mistake. Now I have to live with it. I’m feeling terrible right now,  I’m looking for advice on how to change my mindset so that I can make the best of it or learn to live with this decision.
Thanks for any and all input.

82,"I'm 20F and he is 20M. 

We became friends when we were 14. He told me he loved me while dating somebody else but I was hooked on him anyways. We had things for eachother back and forth for most of high school. We were best friends. He was lowkey abusive to me during high school and sent mean messages about me to people who used to be mutual friends (I eventually saw these). We had an intense on/off friendship where he kind of used me as the person to go back to. I can see this retroactively. 


When I was 17, we were both single at the same time. We quickly started dating. We began having issues quickly, about 2 months in. He told me I was just like his ""crazy"" (as he called her) ex girlfriend. I had this image in my mind that we were meant to be, so I persevered. He was convinced I had Borderline Personality Disorder and tried to convince me, even when my therapist said I didn't. He would specifically try to ""trigger"" me into an ""episode"". If I told him he was doing this, he would say ""Well you shouldn't get provoked so easily"". My episodes were not by any means normal, but I was diagnosed with aspergers recently (after end of this relationship) and these were stereotypical overwhelmed moments. There was only one physical aggression from him. He was trying to shave my face and I told him that he shouldnt or I would hit his balls (I know this is inappropriate now, but I was 17) and he continued holding me down (hes over a foot taller than me) and trying to shave my face. I faked out hitting his balls and he held me down and punched my boob, leg and arm. I still stayed with him. I will admit that after this, I would hit his leg if he was being really mean to me. I really regret doing that but it developed into a pretty toxic relationship. He moved into my moms empty house that only I lived in with me when I was 18. He would throw things when he got mad, and get in my face. If I told him to leave, he would refuse. The last big fight before I broke up with him, he smeared a sandwich in my face, threw a chair and refused to leave. I told my mom he wouldn't leave and he told my mom he was scared I was going to kill myself. I tried to break up with him for a long time but he kept telling me I was in the middle of an ""episode"" so I wasnt in the ""right state of mind"". I finally just took his stuff back to his moms house and changed locks while he was at work with the help of a friend. I know that the relationship was toxic on both ends. 


Fast forward over two years later and Ive been in a relationship with a guy for close to two years (next month). We started dating quickly as we had had a crush on eachother in middle school and freshman year. We have been living together for a year and I love him very much. I have no feelings for my ex but I still  can't think about him or my past (that I feel disassociated from) without getting so much anxiety that I feel like I'm about to vomit. What should I do, reddit? I am completely lost on how to move on when I am not even romantically stuck. 


TL/DR: Abusive friend turned into abusive relationship. Broken up for 2+ years, in a long term relationship, have no residual romantic feelings yet I have intense anxiety even thinking about my ex. ",17Apr2018,2
83,"There is this guy I like and he likes me. But the problem is he makes me very sad.

A little about me.

I grew up religous , and became irreligious around a year ago. Since then I have this newfound freedom to make friendships and relationships with nothing holding me back. :-). I have a ton of online friends, and he started as one.

I think he is cute and funny. I liked him almost instantly. But I didn't tell. A few weeks later he confessed he likes me.  You'd have though yay! My first boyfriend. But no. I realized there were times he made me sad.

I'll clarify.  He's had a very  sad family life and thats caused him to be pretty depressed and unmotivated.  He's a college drop out. Now I'm not a superficial person, and he has hinted that if given reason (aka me) he will take  up school again and sort out his life. So that's not an issue to me. 


**The problem is,** he's just aloof. He treats me more like a buddy than like a special girl to him. I mean we are both big memers, but there are times when I want to be serious and intimate with him and he never realizes. And that ends up making me very sad. 

If i tell him a story he'll reply with Lol or rip and that's all. If I share some sad feelings he'll just say :(. 

I'm a very upbeat happy go lucky person. And he's just quiet and not talkative. That makes me even sadder.

He's inconsistent. They're some nights we'll talk for hours and he'll be really cute and sweet but those are very infrequent. 

I enjoy talking to other guys more  than I talk to him. Other guys I talk to are so much more friendly, warm, and more fun to talk to them him. Which makes me sad because i realize I'm missing all these sparks that I should be having with him.


I guess I'm just a very emotionally needy person :(.  I always dreamed about the guy I like sending me hearts everyday, those cute wholesome memes. He doesn't do any of that. Or if he does, like extremely extremely rare.

I've tried to lower my standards of emotional fulfillment but even then I still feel sad.  I'm a simple person (well I try to be) and I always tell myself he's not going to be perfect and to compromise. But lowering my emotional fullfillment standards  has made me feel really sad  , especially when online guys I talk to are better at talking at him and i get alot of attention from them. And when I see how other guys act to their girlfriends - as in how loving and affectionate they are - it really makes me crumble inside to realize he won't give me that.


I have told him all this. Many times I told him he's aloof and I feel sad around him. He always says he'll change and he wants me to be happy. But it never shows. It's like his memory resets everyday. 


I dont know what to do. Do i pursue anything with him? I mean we both confessed  we liked each other.

On one hand I want to because it's not like I'm getting married to him. If he is still the same in months/years time I'll tell him he never changed and I can't do it anymore.

I'm scared of doing that though, I don't want to  hurt him. Or end things badly with him. I don't want to get into a relationship with a guy who I openly admit makes me sad.

At the same time I do want to do that because he's all I have right now and maybe if we become official than he will change from being indifferent and aloof. And it would really kill the loneliness. 

Could just use advice:(

*something else I should add, finding guys for me is very difficult because I live with my parents and they are still very religous. Another thing is I constantly fear if so let go of him then I'll never find anyone as good as him again*

**Tl;dr**

- Me and a guy confessed we liked each other, but he is aloof and indifferent compared to my upbeat self. He isn't affectionate and that makes me very sad.

- Said he'll change but rarely shows.

- Dont know whether to stop talking to him, or go into a relationship with him in the hopes he changes and to get out of my current loneliness. Which one?

- I constantly feel that if I choose **stop talking to him** I'm going to regret it badly because I'll never find anyone as good as him.

85,"I haven't talked to a close friend of mine for 7 months due to a misunderstanding. I really miss being friends with her and I don't know what I should do.

5 minutes before we had to hand in this chemistry lab, she wanted to look at my writeup for one question. I thought she wanted to copy it and I didn't let her because I was scared the teacher would give us a zero. He said if he thought we were copying off of one another he would give us a zero. After we handed it in she ignored me for the rest of the class. 

The next day I tried talking to her and she wasn't happy when she responded so I became really annoyed and decided to ignore her as well. This was because whenever she became angry at me she ignored me and wouldn't even acknowledge me when I said sorry. Every time she got mad at me I had no idea what I did wrong, so I was very confused.

I did message her to talk about it, but she said that it wasn't a big deal, but it was clearly a big deal if she ignored me. However, I did insinuate that I thought she was copying off of me, but she was actually mad that I didn't help her. (That was my bad, I should't have said that I thought she was copying off of me) To be honest, I spent like 5 hours on this question and I didn't even know I was right and I didn't want to risk getting a zero so I didn't know how to help her. I was just so nervous about doing well in school because of university and stuff.

I think the final straw was that I switched lab partners because I knew that if we were partners we wouldn't communicate at all. This happened for a group project last time and we got a really bad mark. So after that she didn't sit with me anymore and I just sat alone.

Now we just ignore each other in the hallway and don't look at each other. We have a lot of mutual friends so when they talk to me about her I just nod my head really awkwardly.

I have no classes with her and I feel like if I message her she will not respond or just give me a one word answer. I'm just a really awkward person too so I don't know what to say. And it was her birthday recently so I was debating whether or not I should wish her happy birthday, but in the end I didn't :/

I'm just not really sure what to do. I know I should've handled things better, but I didn't. I know friendships drift apart, but I feel really bad that we don't talk to each other anymore because of this. I don't even know if we can talk to each other again without it being really awkward...

87,"Lots of things on my mind tonight (and this past month) about college, mostly about tuition and housing, and I just wanted to ask people if they had any suggestions maybe that I hadn't thought of yet.

To start off:

I just turned 23, am in good shape, have a full-time job making pretty crappy money ($14/hr in an affluent area). I have 1 year of college credit under my belt and just over a $1000 of savings. I'm living with my parents whose bankruptcy just cleared and now their credit is absolute garbo. So, a bad situation, but not absolutely terrible (could always be worse right?)

I'm in grips with the price of college tuition (per year college tuition in my state is around $11,500), affordability of housing, let alone finding housing (or a cosigner because of my parents' bankruptcy stuff), and a job that pays well enough to pay housing and food.

I'm not sure how I can do it all with only $12,500 per annual limit of federal loans unless I live out of my car or some shit for 2-3 years. I suppose I could take out private loans though.

I've thought about joining the military for GI benefits (place to sleep, paycheck, medical benefits and education benefits sound nice). I've thought about going to community college, but that doesn't solve the loan limit problem. I've thought about just saying screw it and going for a trade job.

I'm not really sure what steps to take. If anyone has any suggestions or experiences they can draw from I'd sincerely appreciate it.

**TLDR**; College is expensive - I can't afford it unless I get an apartment and work through college. I will have an extremely difficult time getting an apartment due to my parents' bankruptcy. I wonder if it would be better to join the military for GI benefits or pursue a career in the trades.",17Apr2018,2

A few months ago on a ski trip with my friends, a girl I was starting to like offered to cuddle since there weren’t enough beds. I turned her down since I was both insecure, and there was a blow up mattress that wasn’t being used so I said it was fine and I could just use that. At the end of the trip my other friend asked to cuddle with her and they ended up hooking up.

I’ve been dwelling on the regret of not sharing that bed with her for the past few months and after talking to her recently I discovered that she had a crush on me back then. It kills me that if I had been more like my friend and been confident in myself, the worst that could’ve happened is I would get to cuddle with a girl I was both friends with and attracted to. She has a boyfriend now that she seems very happy with so I’m glad that she’s happy, but since I rarely have opportunities like that and I’m about to graduate college, the mistake has been haunting me, keeping me up at night, and I don’t know how to stop obsessing over it.

I sometimes stutter through my speech when I talk and sometimes what I say (according to some of the listeners) is not really understandable (I dont have a speech impediment but what I mean is that what I say tends to jump all over the place). I, however have no really close freinds that I could always express myself too without them thinking I sound ridiculous or with apathey(yes there have been exceptions but they are far an imbetween). Also, from my taste in music to my seemingly ""boring"" hobbies seem to keep me distant from most most people. On my spare time, Ive been getting into computer programming, game development, drawing, music, and gaming. Every time i have an error in something, i feel like a failure or inadequate to do that task. I sometimes  feel behind other kids that are doing really well for themselves and are REALLY good at something. Im often mentally exhausted and beginning to feel unmotived to do school work or anything realted to that. I want to be able to enjoy and spend time working on strenthening my more practical hobbies, but i feel exhausted my school by the end of the day. As a result i begin to wonder why im so lazy and feel dissapoinyed in myself. I over think...alot as well. The cycle contniues for 4 days a week. So in short, i feel clumsy, stupid, and lazy despite having many social interactions at school and having hobbies. So my question is how to solve this problem? (Im willing to answer questions if any for further elaboration)",17Apr2018,2
91,I'm 16 years old and as far as I can tell this is not how I should feel I just don't know what to do. I've seen a therapist who didn't really work and I just keep going downhill and I'm afraid of myself sometimes. It's not like I don't have friends and shit either I've got a small but tight group but I just don't feel loved. Like my family loves me but I just don't feel loved ever there's no real connection that makes me feel wanted. I'm always quiet because I'm too anxious to say anything to anyone new really and I can't make new friends easily at all. Relationships are just awful for me they always take a turn straight south at some point or another even though I try my hardest to make everything work out. School is going down for me as well I've never particularly liked school but I was a mostly A's few B's student but last quarter I had two C's mostly B's and one A. Everything just feels like it's falling apart around me sometimes. I get so anxious about stuff sometimes I just stop breathing entirely until I realize and I gasp for air. I just feel so lost like nothing matters and nobody really cares about me and I just fall apart sometimes and other times I just sit and wonder what it'd be like if I just died. I don't think I'd ever do it I just feel so much pain and such an intense numbness I don't know what to do anymore. ,17Apr2018,3
92,"Ok, so this is a bit of a story, but I have no one else to talk about it with. So there's this girl on my bus, keep in mind this is high school, and she's being picked on by these guys. I tell them to stfu and they start saying I like her. I didn't know she existed until then, so I was laughing it off doing the normal ""just been accused of liking someone"" laugh. You know the one, the half chuckle with a bit of blush. So, I get a text from an unknown number a week later (this all happened a month or so ago), and it's her saying thanks and that she's been going through some stuff and I helped her a lot. We texted until midnight, and it ended with her saying she loved me. Another week of talking later, I told her I loved her too. It was genuine. For the next few days, we would talk all day over the phone about things in general. It got to the point where she was telling me when she was horny and stuff like that. She did tell me, however, that she had sent nudes to people before. I told her I didn't want them in a respecting way, but then she told me something that angered me. This guy sent her a snapchat asking for nudes in return for a ""surprise"". This guy was rich, so she was expecting something cool, like a cat. (in her words). The surprise was his dick. 
I went up to this guy the next day, typical class clown fat kid. Told him to stop. His friends come over, stuff gets heated. Their yelling at me, saying I'm lying. I have screenshots of this guys dick, mind you. I tell them. They all stfu instantly. One kid overhears, tells the counsellor. Counsellor calls me in the next day, says she's grateful that I stood up for this girl. I go to talk to the girl, I'll just start calling her Ashley. Ashley doesn't want to talk. Now I'm thinking, ""How the hell did this guy skew the story"". Turns out, according to internet laws, the sending party is more responsible than the receiving. This douchebag got Ashley in trouble, and he got off scot free. This all happened last week, before the break. Ashley isn't allowed on her phone, but the guy is posting his spring break party on Instagram. I'm pissed, she's probably pissed, and this smug asshole is thinking he's a god. What do I do now?

also, some more background, Ashley has been telling me since day one stuff like ""You know I haven't had my first kiss yet?"" and has even tried to send me nudes. I play along for the most part, but I tell her I don't need her to do that stuff, and that she needs to respect herself. She's been getting better, and she's told me I'm the only person she trusts. All this was before the dick-pic thing. We haven't talked since it. ",17Apr2018,2
93,"Instead of just going straight home after class ends I want to spend more time doing something like practicing social skills but I'm unsure where to do it. Today I just went to the library after class and did some work. I just got hired so I'll be able to practice at work, and I have a hobby that I practice at, but other than that I hang out with friends outside of school sometimes but I'd like to know more people. I'm looking to get into more outdoors stuff like rock climbing, hiking, mountain climbing, but I'm also just looking for something simple to practice socializing.

94,"I’m the oldest in my family to a younger brother who just turned 21 (I’m 24). We both grew up without our father around. Our mother is a BA who has gone above and beyond to provide everything we needed/wanted. 

Growing up I took my mother for granted. I was not a well behaved child and was definitely not a positive role model for my younger brother. However, I somehow made it to college and got my shit together. Graduated with a degree and have since landed a a job with a solid company. 

Now that I’ve settled a bit it’s given me a chance to reflect my past... I was and still am a terrible person.

I was never there for my mother. She gave and I only took. 

I  never talked to my brother or gave him a path/code to follow. I honestly didn’t and still don’t know him very well. 

Every girlfriend I’ve ever had I’ve coerced and manipulated. I’m not on good terms with any of them. 

Anyway, the reason this is all coming to light is because today it all feel apart. Everything I’d been running from finally caught up to me. My brother is checking into rehab and my mom is facing back taxes. I can’t help but feel that this is my fault. Being the oldest male I was supposed to step up when my father didn’t/ couldn’t. 

I want to be the man my family needs but I’ve been absent focusing on myself for too long. I have no idea where to start. I feel like such a failure as a man. I’m accomplishing my career goals but they mean nothing to me because my family is struggling to survive.",17Apr2018,2

Currently I am a high school senior with a girlfriend of two years, and plenty of friends. I love all my friends and girlfriend so much, but I'm really unhappy with the person I am. I want a fresh start, which would mean I would talk to my old friends almost never and probably have to break up with my girlfriend who will be going to school 3 states away. I don't know whether to cling to the past and who I am now, or give myself the opportunity to become someone brand new. Thoughts?",17Apr2018,2
96,"I started seeing my new psychiatrist (fictitious name Dr. Johns) about a month and a half ago. When I've to Dr. Johns during my appointments, he's been generally emotionless and seems uninterested in helping me through issues. His voice is blatantly monotonous for the entirety of our sessions, which I thought was a red flag at first.

Then I noticed a strange, abrupt change in his behavior.


Around my third session I noticed a little boy, no older than ten years old, was scheduled one hour before my session every week.
A woman of different race, presumably the boy's babysitter, brought him to Dr. Johns' office every week. That same day I went in right after the little kid's appointment. I sat down on the couch as the kid left. I face towards the doctor as he is sitting directly across from me. I immediately noticed this man's strange energy and happiness flowing through because it contrasted how much of a buzzkill he was before.

It was fucking strange. This man whom I had a dislike for his stale, monotonous, and almost depressing nature suddenly was very happy. His monotone voice was gone, and seemed very happy to see me. Oddly enough, his energy faded away as we started our session and became the usual dickhead he was.

 For the next few sessions, the same abrupt changes in his mood occurred and increased. I've been going to his office 20 minutes earlier than the appointment time, so I see the boy leave as he calls me in. This guy is now breathing HEAVILY, red-faced, and smiling in such a vibrant way that was the direct opposite of his normal, robot-like attitude towards me. I observed no extreme behavior like this from him before, but it was extremely suspicious. However, I thought I was making terrible and unrealistic assumptions about someone and that I was overthinking it. I was thinking of possibilities in an attempt to disprove my suspicions.



But my last session raised my suspicions even more.


Went in 20 minutes early as usual. I'm listening to some music as I sit next to the closed office door in the waiting room. When Dr. John opened his door as his session ended, I looked up. The same boy leaves the office, as I see the psychiatrist behind him, holding a bright green sponge toy baseball bat. I was appalled to see it, and I thought to myself, ""What good does a sponge baseball bat serve for a psychiatrist?"" As I saw him, I made direct eye contact with Dr. Johns. Instead of greeting me in any way (ex. 'Hey, I'll be there in a sec') he suddenly shuts the door as if he didn't expect me to catch him off guard. He opens the door about 30 seconds later, and the bat is away from sight. We both sat down. This man was heavily panting, again with his face bright red. He seemed extremely happy yet again, and was smiling outrageously. However, like I stated before he gradually returns to asshole-mode in &lt;10 minutes.

During the session I looked around the toys in Dr. John's room, and I saw shaped blocks and puzzles, presumably for child IQ tests. The green sponge bat was nowhere to be seen in the room. I couldn't see any toy relating to physical activity, for obviously a psychiatrist wouldn't need one for this line of work. In the back of the room, there is a closet, where I am assuming he left it. But the strange part of this is: why did he close the door so abruptly the ONE time where he was holding a suspicious looking bat? As a psychiatrist, why did he have a bat, and go out of his way to put away said bat? Why is he panting, red-faced, and extremely elated after the sessions with the kid? He's not out of breath or happy to the point where his face is red when he ends my sessions.

It's important to note that for the past two times before, there was a man in his early twenties visiting before me, and when I had a session with him after, he showed no signs of abrupt jolts of stimulation before.

Could you all tell me if I am overthinking it, and if I am not, what do you think I should do? Who should I report it to? Am I being biased? I need other peoples' perspective on this. 

p.s. Dr John called me 'good looking' on our very first session (I am 17 year old male teen). He said it in a rather stoic, non-suspicious manner, but I just wanted to include it for your interpretation. I didn't include this in the main message because it might be too far of a stretch and I don't want it to give any form of confirmation bias. What do you guys think?

98,"Okay so a few months ago (back in October) I was on a dating site and met this guy. We chatted and it was nice, so we decided to meet up a week later. Our first date was on the 20th of October.

He drove an hour to get to another city and I took the train to get there. He is from a small village on the eastern side of the country and I am from the western more urban part. I noticed right away he was really into me, which kind of intimidated me at first but okay. During the date I couldn't help but notice that he was looking at my ass constantly. This made me feel uncomfortable but I didn't say anything about it. The date itself was really bad; he kept on making rude remarks about people on the street, he didn't want to sit and eat anywhere with me and he said he voted for right extremist political parties. It made me feel so awkward that I just couldn't look him in the eye.

When the date ended I told him that I didn't want a second date. We chatted a bit afterwards and he told me he still really liked me. After that he made another rude remark about something that happened in my past which left me crying and I blocked him. Asking him to not ever get in touch with me ever again.

A few months later (back in February) he tried to reach out again. It was obvious to me that he was looking for a valentine or whatever but by that time my anger was cooled down and I realized I might have been irrational. We start talking again. He told me he still really liked me and couldn't stop thinking about me. After doubting for a really long time I agree to a second date. We didn't really set a time since we were both busy though. A few days later after agreeing to meet up he (after lots of asking) admits he has bipolar disorder and anger problems. These are huge red flags for me and I told him that we will definetly not ever meet up and that he should stop trying to get in touch with me. 

Last March (March 27th) he texted me to wish me a happy birthday (my birthday is April 27th) which shocked me. I had an old phone and I wasn't able to block his number. He didn't get in touch with me for some time but after receiving that text I did block him on my new phone. A few days ago he tried adding me on Instagram which resulted in my setting my Instagram on private and removing my profile picture. This guy is not leaving me alone even though I told him repeatedly to leave me alone. I don't think it's worse enough to go to the police for but I feel uncomfortable nonetheless.

How can I get this guy to leave me the hell alone?",17Apr2018,3

102,"So my friend and I decided to plan a trip to see each other but when planning all we would do is fight.

She keeps putting me into no win situations and then giving out to me and keeps telling me I am sabotaging the trip by not doing things that help her out which is not true. I am doing my best to be as accommodating as possible and just dancing around her so I can get this to go off smoothly as possible.

We already changed the initial booking of the holiday to suit her  so she can attend and event but now I am caught having to work on the new dates and need to get out of it but can't since I'm the one who is forced to do all the bookings and haslte and pay cancelation fees because I'm the one causing all the frustration. 

I admit that I have had my anxiety in the beginning and let myself down by showing it to her which has fueled some of this for her thinking I want to sabotage it but I genuinely got excited to go. Now I need to work and attend family matters and obligations that I don't have any control over due to me being the only one in my family whos future rests on my shoulders. She just doesn't get that in the past. 

I need help telling her that I need to cancel and tell her that I can't go without setting her off on a hatred fueled rampage where she rips me apart verbally.

They both drink regularly and I feel like this is one of the main inhibitors of conflict between the two. I know there is a part of him that actually loves her, but she doesn’t want to change.

She is extremely jealous, manipulative, condescending, and insecure.

The latest drama is about me coming on to work for my dad and his company, small construction. He has put me (23M) in charge of finances for the most part and all of the sudden she doesn’t trust me at all. She even thinks that I plan to kill my father because I started urging him to get a life insurance policy and will. My older sister has two kids and it would be nice for them to have an inheritance.

I have suggested that he just leave and take the financial loss of whatever is in the home and on the lease, which is in both of their names, but he thinks it will cost way too much. Also, they have been together for more than ten years and have introduced themselves as husband and wife even though they aren’t married. I don’t know a lot about common law, but I think she might have pretty good ground for going after half of the company’s assets. He late husband, the father of her two children, passed and the first thing she did was send someone to the bank to withdraw his remaining account balance. This shows how ruthless she is when it comes to money. Completely disregards any kind of integrity or respect for people. 

I have suggested that he stop drinking or at least slow down in an effort to encourage her to stop, but he can’t give it up. Plus he has tried that before, and she won’t give it up either.

So my (22f) boyfriend's (22m) best friend (23m) called me one day, asking me if we could hang out. It came out of nowhere but I'm always into meeting New People so thought why not! We had a great time and I immediately felt that 'click' you have with people sometimes. He told me he really liked this girl and asked me for advice on what to do, which I gave him. We stayed very close friends for a few months. We called each other, texted everyday, stayed up late everytime we hung out, Just to give you guys an idea of how close we were. One day he texts me he's finally in a relationship with the girl he liked! I told him how happy I was for him, and asked him for some details on how it happened, etc. We met up to talk about it, all was well. Then a month later, they broke up. I told him how much that sucks and if there's anything I can do, I'm always there willing to help out. He thanked me, and that was it. No contact for 2 weeks, nothing. I talked to my boyfriend about it, but he didn't notice any change in contact with him. I asked around but no one I know who knows him said anything changed. I was confused, but kept trying. I told myself no matter what, I Will text him at least once a week, and start a conversation. But our conversations quickly ran dry, and it felt like I was the only one putting in effort. I started to invite him over to my place again, but at 22:00 he kept saying he was tired and went home everytime (before we used to stay up talking about all kinds of things untill 2 AM). After a while, I stopped trying. For me, friendship should Come from both sides, and I don't want to be the only one putting in effort. But still, it stung and I couldnt get it out of my head. So one day I texted him. My text read 'hey! How are you doing? I noticed we don't talk a lot anymore, and I wanted to ask, did I do something wrong? I'm really sorry if I did. I probably didn't mean it. Do you want to talk about it? I'm not mad at you or trying to start anything, I wanted to ask just in case.' he replied that he also noticed we're not talking often anymore but didn't know why. He said that I didn't do anything wrong and he was sorry if he did anything to upset me. 


And that's the end. No contact after that conversation again. He replies when I message him, but that's it. I Just want to know what happened, what I did wrong.

I was fired from a job in a way that I believe was wrong. I was frustrated so I told a few of my friends who happened to be in my house at the time. I went to sleep, and woke up with all of my ex co-workers texting me to stop making fake accounts and giving them one-star reviews. My story spread to so many of my friends, and so many of them wrote one-star reviews, that the store literally lost a star.

I'm wondering if I could get sued for defamation or some kind of NDA. I'll have to go through the employee agreement to see, but I'm wondering if something here is standard procedure.

I worked at a drink shop, and was basically fired after asking my manager to calm down when he was chewing me out in front of customers. I was fired a week later.

117,"Howdy

TL;DR at the bottom. Most of this post was me giving unnecessarily detailed context.

So I'm going through what basically every 18-year-old goes through: This existential crisis as the world beats down your door demanding that you start giving back to it while you don't know how to answer it. I don't know what labor I'm gonna perform in exchange for money, people. Sorry for the bad metaphor.

I'm just about to close up my first year in university. I go to a school that pretty much any American is familiar with, or at least their football mascot, because it's so damn marketable. And I hate it here. Really, I do. I never liked school that much, and going to college hasn't changed that at all. But it's a pretty dumb move to drop out, so a large part of me wants to stay.

Related: The school I'm at is the only one I applied to. I didn't really think about it past the film program being labeled ""ok"" by my old boss.

I'm going to skim over this part because it's not what I want advice for, but I'm pretty sure that I'm depressed. I haven't been officially diagnosed or anything, but my pediatrician when I was 16 said that she thought I was at risk for it since I described my life as being mostly isolated from others. I've also had suicidal thoughts. I don't think that I would ever act on them, because I'm stupid scared of death, but I've thought them. Please spare me any recommendations for hotlines or for exercising or drinking water- it's not what I'm asking about; I just thought that the context was needed. I do work out at least twice a week (I try for 3-5 but school eats a lot of time) and piss like a racehorse, if you were interested.

Also skimming over this part: My ideal living conditions would be living somewhere in the northwestern US. I like the climate that describes that region, I like mountains, I like trees... seems like a nice place to be.

I went into university because every adult in my entire life told me to. Most of them couldn't have predicted how expensive it would be. My parents (mostly my mom) saved up enough money for me to be able to drop out now and have my college ""experience"" immediately paid off, provided that we pony up a little extra money that we burned through by using those savings to pay for my car insurance. I'll bring this up soon.

I think that I have 2 core problems:

1. I feel trapped within the mind of a child trapped in the body of an adult

2. I have absolutely no ambition for anything

As far as point 1 goes, I think things like ""Pursuing a degree in journalism is foolhardy and will have a horrible return on investment,"" but I had to choose something so that's what I did. I'll lie in bed at 8:05AM and think ""Well my class starts at 9, a shower takes 10-15 minutes, a shave another 10, putting on/taking off clothes and getting my soap and shampoo at least another 6 or so but I'm sleepy so it'll be more like 10, it's a 10 minute walk there, I can stop for 5 minutes to eat a bagel and eggs at the dining hall on the way. That gives me just enough time to do everything."" and then I'll stay in bed until 8:30 and skip breakfast and shaving. What I mean to illustrate here is that I'll consciously think about things that I should do, then I shut down, give into momentary pleasure, boot up again, pick up the pieces, and damn myself for not doing better. I feel like a goddamn child. Sometimes I do make real, dedicated efforts to improve, and I will, but then 2 days in my dormmate will play music really fucking loud at 11 and wake me up, then I won't get enough sleep, then all my progress gets thrown away. I know that treating these events as inevitabilites only reinforce that aspect of them, but I'll be fucked if they aren't perfect descriptors of my life.

On the 2nd one: It's pretty self-evident, isn't it? I just have no ambition to do anything other than be entertained. I did like video editing and I wanted to be a YouTube personality when I was a kid, but that's obviously not a stable career option, and my old boss disillusioned me with working in the film industry as a post-production guy. I would maybe utilize those talents in a hobby, best-case scenario. I have taken computer science classes at university, but I feel that I'm not good at writing software and that the nationwide promotion of STEM is going to result in a surplus of programmers by the time I get out. There's already a surplus of bad ones, but what I'm foreseeing is a surplus of okay to great ones.

I've basically made it impossible for myself to go back to university next semester. I just wouldn't have anywhere to live cheaper than $800 a month in an area where that's really fucking expensive. So I'm at least taking a 6-month break from university on top of summer break, in which I'm taking Calculus I online. 

So with all that context, here's what I actually want to ask:

As I said earlier, I could drop out and have my time mostly paid for. If I did that, I would work for a few months and join the military in 2019. Probably the Air Force. I'm taking German in college right now, so luck be willing I'd like to be stationed somewhere out there in the ol' Deutschland or Austria or something. My grandpa was stationed in Germany back in the 60's and has only good things to say about it, even if he's going senile. I have no misconceptions that doing this would be an easy or fun time. I know that my current lifestyle is incompatible with military life, even in the Chair Force. I know that AFROTC exists- I don't want to go down that road as my tuition is already paid for with a scholarship that I don't have to pay back.

This is something I've been seriously considering. I originally wanted to take the semester off to think about my major, but that's obviously a farce. I've had around 15 years of conscious thought to do that. I'm probably committing some kind of logical fallacy here, but this Air Force thing seems like my best option. I've thought for years that I wanted to get mugged, get stabbed, get robbed, get hurt in a car crash, or something to test my character and pull me out of my sheltered... shell. That's beyond stupid to wish for, but there it is. Military seems like a good place to get brainwashed and and be forced to be an adult. I know that a college education, as it becomes more common to have one, is necessary to get ahead in the world, and the military will pay for it. I'm sure that there's a thousand catches to that, but the principle is there.

Reasons I don't want to do this: It throws away the (admittedly small) savings that my parents have built up for my education, I give away my youth to my country, I'm not particularly patriotic (I think my country is the best country on Earth and I've got a massive hard-on for our Constitutional rights, even if they're infringed on all the time), I'm uncomfortable with the thought that I'm contributing to someone being killed, I don't want to be killed, my mom isn't crazy about it.

Reasons I do want to do this: I can go back to college after, I seriously hate my aimless college life that I have right now, I will hopefully be forced to mature past adolescence, being a veteran may give me good connections, I get to not worry about paying for housing and food without burdening my parents, another 8 (9 really) years to decide what I want to do, I won't have the $40k in student debt that my current path through university is leading me to, my dad would go fucking nuts over it and I really need to fix our relationship.

Also, I kind of want to look into being a plumber. That market is growing pretty fast according to bls.gov, they make good money, there's a shortage, you don't have to go into huge debt... seems like a good option. My parents would absolutely fucking loathe it though (Dad works in HVAC and mom grinded to become a registered nurse. Neither of them think that plumbing is living up to my potential, but tbh my outlook for a while has been that I don't really care about things like human potential) and I would have to live with them while apprenticing or doing technical school, not to mention that the real big bucks are in self-employment and I don't have the drive for that sort of thing.

TL;DR: Don't like school, don't know why I'm in school, feel emotionally immature and sheltered, thinking about using savings to pay off time spent in college and joining the Air Force so that I can grow up and have another 8 years to mull this stuff over. Might be a plumber after, might skip the military and just be a plumber, might just shoot myself lol. JK I wouldn't do that to my mom.

To those of you who were somewhere close to my position, what did you do, and what can you say about it?

Posted this on the mental health Reddit too but thought that I might get some good insight here as well 
The idea of people doing stuff without me makes me feel physically ill. The idea of people having fun without me is literally the biggest cause of anxiety for me right now, like sometimes it even results in pretty bad panic attacks. My mom put it pretty well, that I have a need ""to be the centre of everyone's happiness"". It's exhausting, it's like an obsession or an addiction in a way if I hear there's a party or something I will be a mess till I get there and if I miss it I will feel like the most painful depression. I feel especially bad for my boyfriend though, because I get it really bad when it comes to him. The idea of him having fun without me causes the worst pain, like physical pain. I don't tell him this of course because it's unfair to him and this is something that's on my end. Anyone else get like this? Any advice? I feel like it's actually killing me.

123,"So I work 5pm-2am on Fridays and Saturdays, but we usually get out at around 2:30am. I also work Mondays or Wednesdays when I need the hours (but not closing because I'm still in school). 

I've been here for 2 months and I get paid less than 8$ an hour. 

Due to a lack of people willing to work on Sunday, my new manager literally called me at school and made me work Sundays because no one else would do it, I get 2:00pm to 10:00pm on Sundays now.

I had learned after talking to some of my coworkers who worked in the day that they all got more than 8$ an hour. 
I was here before some of them so I don't think it's based on experience and we work similar hours. 

From what I can tell, the only difference is that they asked for a higher starting wage and got it. This is my first job and I was an idiot so I asked for minimum wage. They gave me a little more than that.

So working on Friday, Saturday and Sunday turned out to be more difficult than I originally thought because I have very little time to complete homework. So I told my manager that if he wanted me to work the entire weekend then I'd have to get a raise. 

He agreed to give me 8.50$ an hour if I kept working Sundays and I agreed because I need the money to save up for college. 

Problem solved right? Well Its been two weeks and I haven't gotten the raise yet so I nagged him a little and it turns out that it takes 3 months to ""process a request for a raise"".

So now I am working closing shift, getting out at 2:30am for less than what my coworkers who work in the day earn, I'm also working Sundays for the same pay and I won't get a raise until late summer. (It's a summer job and I'm planning to leave in August.)

I thought about quitting, however, regretfully due to procrastination I didn't get a job the summer before. 

I'll be 18 in a month and I don't have any other job experience besides these 2 months at this restaurant so I feel like it'll be extremely difficult to get a job, especially since it's almost summer and everyone from school will be getting jobs too. 

Because this is my only job experience, anyone looking at my resume will call the restaurant and if my manager doesn't recommend me then I'll have no other sources of recommendation.

124,"I am guilty myself, I tend to stay up late (around 3-4 ish in the morning) which is messing up my sleep schedule in a way but I start school at 12:00 everyday so bed time at 10 or 11 isn’t a priority. 

On the weekends I have to go and help my grandparents at the swap meet. They have to get up at 4:30 am to get ready and prepare ahead for breakfast and lunch and wake me up at 5:00. Being the person I am it’s really hard for me to get up at that time cause who really likes to anyone ? Anyways, they think because of this I stay up way too long which is true but not entirely. I do sleep on time sometimes but I’m just a night owl that’s just me. 

They do tell me that I can sleep in the van for an hour if I still feel tired. So last Saturday I take a 1 hour power nap and when I wake up and get out of the van my grandfather starts scolding me saying that “he’s gonna put a hidden camera somewhere around my room so he can find out what I do at night and to see if I’m getting the sleep I need”  I tell him that’s an invasion of privacy and he says that it isn’t because it’s his house I understand that it’s his house it’s his rules but do any of you think hats going too far ? I’m a 18 year old mind you (turning 19 next month) and being at this age I still would need privacy. 

Earlier this morning they went to Walmart and I didn’t think much of it but when I left to catch the bus i thought about it and I was like “they never go to Walmart, they’ll only go when they truly need something” so did they go to buy a hidden camera or sound recorder ? When I got home I was looking around my room and forums nothing. My room is I would say close quarters but it isn’t cluttered or anything I can easily jog back and forth in here. They probably set it up in my room when I was gone. 

Im in here right now and I’m super paranoid, I’m scared to even do anything. There could be a camera recording me right now when I’m making this post and due to my hormones blasting through the roof I tend to masturbate numerous times as day and the night is when I’m most active. He doesn’t realize the things he’ll see which he would wish he hadnt seen like me getting dressed or anything. They’re old so being outdated as they are they don’t really think. It sucks because i can’t release the sexual tension I have with knowing there is camera watching me at all times. 

Does he have the right to do this ? Am I in the wrong ? Am I over thinking ? Should I confront them about it or tell my dad ? 

If I tell my dad he’ll get into a huge argument with them because him and my grandparents aren’t in the best shape in their relationship. 

It’s not only this no, no, I have so many problems with them that I can spam this page with so many posts about my grandparents. This post is just the tip of the iceberg. I can’t even sleep right now, might as well stay up all night I guess. ",17Apr2018,4

135,"Hello everyone,

So, this is my current situation. I'm a third year chemistry student at a top public institution, and recently, I think I hit rock bottom. I have not been doing well academically for the past two years, and for some reason I have never seemed to address this despite all the times I told myself that I would do better next time. Because of this, I feel like I haven't done anything with my degree (i.e research, internships), and the realization of this has led me to feel like a total failure and caused to develop suicidal thoughts.

Now, I think this is where my situation gets complex. I graduated high school in the top 5% of my 520 person class, and like everyone in my group, I was looking forward to college. I had the intention of studying engineering but part of me wanted to be a doctor. So, I think the process was OK except for one important aspect: my SAT and ACT scores were rather low. So, a combination on failing to research how engineering is a capped major at most institutions and not being realistic about my school choices led me to being rejected at all but three schools. In the end, I had to choose between two. One (my current school) was more prestigious but I was going to go in undeclared since all the engineering spots were taken. For the other, I was pre-engineering and had a scholarship. Naturally, I picked the more prestigious school.

So, my interest at the time was biological/genetic engineering and I tried to get into the program, but then eventually I decided against it and decided to major in biochemistry since it was similar and formed synergy with dream of being a doctor. Three years later, I'm struggling and my dream of being a doctor is pretty much dead in the water, and I started to realize that maybe I don't like my major. The only problem is that pretty much all the other majors that I was interested in ( Physics, Biology,Mathematics, Economics, and as I mentioned Engineering) are all locked, meaning you need to pass screening courses before you can try to apply to get in, and to be honest, while I appreciate humanities majors, I don't see myself majoring in them. So, right now I feel trapped in a major that I never really developed much interest in.

Right now, I'm just trying to finish out of responsibility and hoping that I finish well enough for me to pursue more advanced studies in another field, But recently, I've been toying with the idea of dropping out. I don't really know. I think having too many conflicting interests and dreams has put me in this situation. I just don't know who I am anymore.

I ended up taking her virginity and thinks moved quick from there. She started telling me she loved me and couldn't wait to spend the rest of her life with me. We talked before about how I wanted to slow down because I am graduating from college soon and unsure where I'm going to end up. I thought about breaking up with her before because of how needy she became which came up in the conversation. She convinced me to stay, but tonight, 2 weeks later, I broke up with her over the phone and tried to let her down as easy as I could. The dates started in December and we made it official 3 months ago, but I still feel horrible for breaking her heart. Did I do the right thing?",17Apr2018,2

153,"I've been struggling with finding a full time job for months, I've applied many places via indeed, and looking up jobs on many places online. I'm 20, I need to pay 2 bills every month. My phone and my internet. Before this I was working at Speedway, it sucked. I was getting paid 7.50/h there. I was in the process of saving for another car (last one transmission blew) so I can stop depending on my mother to drive me around.

I had around $500~ before I got fired for this card thing, it had to do with a rewards card and I wasnt told I couldn't scan it in between customers when they didn't want one, but I learned that the hard way.

Now my $500 has turned into ¢.49.
I've applied to countless places nobody was hiring near me and the people that were just wasn't interested in hiring me.

I have 2 years cashier experience, a couple months stocking experience. But that's it.
Recently I actually found a job. 

It's a step up from my last one at 10/h still a part-time job but it's the best I can do.
The only thing is this job is pretty far from my house (10miles), and it's a late night shift. (12-6)

 I don't mind the shift but my mom does. She hates driving far in the country and doesn't like how it's messing with her sleep schedule. There's no other way I can get to my job without her, I just want to be able to get a car.
But this is killing me. We literally argue about the job every time she brings me to work. I get my first paycheck at the end of this week...

 I can't just get a loan or anything for a used car and then continue to save cause I have no credit, my bank doesn't want to loan anything to me without credit. I feel like shit and idk what to do. I actually enjoy this job but everything is falling apart. I live in housing and we barely get by at it is.

On top of taking me to work she also has to take my brother and sister to work and watch her kids. She has a lot on her plate, I never liked the thought of depending on anyone , especially my mother but I'm at a loss. I feel like ending it now, ive been trying to get my own reliable transportation for months now and ever time I take a step forward I'm pushed two steps back. I just don't know...

Anyways, I’d like to know how to handle a crazy employer.
Long story short, my boss is a psycho. A wannabe megalomaniac who treats his employees like absolute shit. He brings up all our personal issues, insults us, doesn’t let us leave, overworks us to death, pays a shite salary, asks us to do things that aren’t on our contracts etc.
Worst part is he targets me. He takes all his anger out on me, yells, uses profanity, uses extremely abusive and demeaning language all bordering on verbal abuse. I’m familiar with verbal abuse, having lived with it for all of my life and I can see that it’s pretty much what he does to me.

I’m going to quit definitely, but until then, how would you suggest I handle this crazy guy? Note that if I show even a tiny bit of resistance or shrug his bullshit off he gets even angrier and ensures my life is hell.


I can’t complain to anybody because he’s pretty much the one handling HR since this is his company and all that. If I complain to a labour board or whatever nothing will happen because my country doesn’t take this stuff seriously (I don’t live in the USA).

I just want to know if you have any tips on how to get through the day whilst being constantly humiliated and yelled at. Thank you.

156,"4 of my friends (all in theirs early 30's) who are couples decided to get together and party one weekend. For easier references, lets name one couple as M1-F1 and other as M2-F2.
M1 being the male friend whole wife is F1
M2 being the male friend whole wife is F2

All 4 and my husband were friends for the past 20 years since school. I came later around 10 years ago. And we have been friends since then.
Our relationship with M1-F1 had been a bit complicated. 
M1 and his father are involved with local politician leader, ministers and goons who have committed heinous crimes like murder. From cheating orphanned children of government funds to cheating government healthcare subsidies, he and his father have done it all. Knowing all this, I had a frame in mind that they were on darker side of the social strata and a cordial and civil relationship is what I could do best. M1 even after having a committed girlfriend F1 used to be a womaniser, cheat with colleagues etc. All these cheating incident, he used to boast in front of his friends. His motto was ""Cheating is PERMITTED as long as noone finds out."" F1 knew about some of M1's adultery but decided to be with him anyway.
Now coming to the incident....

So M1-F1 went to M2-F2 house which was in another city for a weekend get together. There plan was to chill out, party, bar hop, watch movies etc during the course of 3 days. On the 1st day, they were casually lying around after lunch. It was then that F2 came upto to F1 who was lying down with a blanket over her. She then hugged F1. At that moment M1 who was beside F1 slid his hand under the blanket and started grazing F2 thighs. F2 was shocked and quickly left the area. She couldn't believe what just happened and decided that M1 must have mistaken her leg for his wife's leg. Later that evening, all 4 went out to party and they danced with each other. The next day towards the evening, they decided that they would get drunk and party at home. During this entire evening M1 was getting a bit touchy with F2. She would just walk away from him, but he kept following her. Whenever he found her alone in a corner he would hug her tightly, kiss her on the cheeks.... F2 tried avoiding him thinking maybe he was too drunk but he was persistent. She was worried how to ask F1 or M2 for help. Then at one moment when they were alone M1 being taller slid his hand through the top of F2's t-shirt and squeezed her breasts. Then he pulled F2 and kissed her lips. At that very moment F2 confronted M1. By this time M2 had passed out and F1 was in another room. On F2 questioning M1, he started fumbling and saying stuff like he didnt do anything and the she might be drunk so she's imagining etc. F2 made M1 sit down and explain things. This is when he said that he had a long standing crush on F2 since school days and because M2 was with her, he couldn't say anything. Said M2 was like a brother and blah blahand that he never stopped liking F2 and shit. F2 was shocked at this and she told him to mind his business as he was married to F1 and she didnt deserve to have a cheating husband. And because revealing this incident will hurt her best friend F1 and also her husband F2, she decided to leave him with a warning. After sometime, F1 came into the room and put F2 to bed. The next morning after an awkward breakfast M1-F1 left and M2 went to work while F2 stayed at home. F2 was still traumatised and scared, so that evening, F2 decided to tell everything to M2. M2 then confronted M1 over call and initially M1 was beating around the bush and blaming F2 of being promiscuous and drunk and lying etc. After 15-20 minutes, M1 broke down and started crying and admitted to everything. He said that it happened in the moment and asked him what he should do now. M2 then disconnected the phone. After all this happened, M2-F2 came to me and my husband and narrated the incident. We were shocked at first. F2 couldn't sleep for days because of the nightmares. Then we advised them to report it to the police. But we weren't sure what they wanted. They were angry and violated. But even when we insisted on reporting the incident multiple times, they remained quiet. M2 then said he will be cutting of all ties with M1-F1. Then we said, that's obviously happening, even we are cutting ties, but what about punishment and justice and making sure he doesn't molest anyone else? He then says that the very fact that M1 lost M2's friendship and brotherhood was punishment enough for M1. I was apalled by this statement. He being the husband of the victim and also the closest one to her should encourage her to stand up. Because if a person can dare to molest someone who had been his friend for 20 years, who knows who else he might attack next. We gave up on them regarding reporting the incident and we weren't in a position to file an FIR because the victim wouldn't come out. So we had to move on. It was very difficult. Preaching women safety and empowerment on a daily basis, it was a blow to my self esteem. From that day on, every time I would be in a conversation of rape, violence on women, this incident would play in the back of my mind. And I feel defeated knowing that there's a molester out there who might feel encouraged to molest many more people in future because he got out of this incident scott free. Imagine when he grows older and his viciousness increases. He now knows that a hardcore feminist with serious connections to media couldnt do anything..... Now he is happily roaming around, turned his small shack eatery to a fancy up market restaurant in a posh location by loaning money probably. Seemingly prospering. And when I see this, I have even more difficulty moving on. Because not only could I not do anything, even God couldn't. Anyway he doesn't exist maybe. But all this talks about morality and reward is pure hogwash!
While everyone moved on, i guess am still carrying a baggage and wishing that he gets punished for the crime. However I can only wish. What should I do to get this off my head?

158,"A friend of mine got into a ‘fight’ at school. Using the word fight isn’t very fair, as he never threw a punch, and never hit his opponent, who happened to be a girl. 

Bit of a backstory, my friend is an academic overachiever who hasn’t ever gotten into big trouble (no detentions, suspensions, expulsions) and has over 4 years of martial arts experience.

He caught the girl vandalizing the lockers at my school, and he warned the girl that he wouldn’t lie if he was asked about it. Long story short, eventually someone told the police that he knew something, and he told the truth. 

Roughly a month later, she confronts him in the hall, and she starts throwing punches. My friend dodged or blocked most of her throws, but eventually she figured out that it’s not working and tries to tackle my friend. She ended just kinda jumping onto him, and then she started to claw his face, at which point he pushed her off. She over-exaggerated and acted like he had beat her. All the while the security camera calmly watched from its post in the corner of the hall. 

My friend got suspended for a while, (2-7 days I believe) and she got off with *after school detention.* How is my friend even at fault? Isn’t this the literally definition of sexism??? The entire encounter was caught on camera and the eyewitnesses, myself included, vouched for my friend. Not only has this encounter ruined my friends perfect record, but his overbearing parents banned him from martial arts, took his phone, and grounded him for an unspecified amount of time.

Last little bit, I referred to him as my ‘friend’ but that really isn’t accurate, I don’t really know him outside of school and I consider him a friend because he helped me talk a mutual friend out of suicide.

Edit: I think I should clarify that the vandalism was pretty major, she spray painted in big black letters that “*insert name here* is a nig___” ",17Apr2018,45
159,I don't really know what to do. My former friend went to different school but he still has a few school books of mine. I always kept my distance from him because I could already see he had a few problems like lieing alot and in general bieing a very toxic person. So recently I asked him if I could have these books back. He said he threw them away and then later told me he found one of them and he would bring me it if I bought some food for him wich I did because it isn't that big of a deal. But now hes telling me that he found another book wich I could get if I paid him 20 dollars. I told him I wasn't going to pay him 20 dollars because he should just give the books back. I really need these books back because I obviously need them for school and you get a 30 dollar fine for each book that you miss. What should I do?,17Apr2018,8

This has happened five or six times in the last two years. We live on the first floor of a large apartment complex.

170,"Hi everyone! I wasn't sure where I should post this question so I hope this is the right sub. Sorry for any language mistakes, English isn't my first language.

I'm living and studying in Eastern Europe. My faculty is in the middle of the oldtown. I walk the same path every day on my way to the classes - a very nice street, typical european setting. At a certain point of my walk I usually see an elderly lady (about 70 years old I think?) who is standing next to some steps leading up to a tenement; on the steps she has several items laid out on towels. The items are  pretty random - some bowls, socks, figurines, a hair brush etc. To be honest, these items look like plain clutter. They're obviously used. The lady doesn't look like a typical homeless person at all. She's dressed properly and looks clean. (Sorry if I sound mean, I have nothing against homeless people of course, I just want to give you as much info about her as I can)

Once, shortly before Christmas, as I was coming back from my classes the lady asked me whether I wanted to have a look at her items. I looked at the clutter slightly confused and decided to ask her how she was doing, wasn't she cold, etc (the weather gets freezing here in december though it wasn't snowing yet). At first she told me she was okay but after a second she started telling me that she's upset by how nowadays everone seems to be constantly busy, everything is rushing and nobody has time to talk to each other - you know, the usual talk of older people who feel lost in the modern world. I asked her whether she had anyone to spend Christmas with and she said she has a son with wife and a kid and they work very late hours so she only has a chance to talk to him on the phone from time to time, though he would ""most definitely invite her for Christmas"". 

I chatted with her for a while, wished her a peaceful Christmas and told her not to worry about the youth because it's just how life goes and we all have to deal with it. I bought some ceramic bowls from her because I was just feeling very sorry for her (also I am a struggling student so any cheap household items are welcome lol). I asked her whether she was struggling financially and she said that she was doing ""okay"" but needed some extra coin (and the items were VERY cheap btw). By the time I left the already had tears in her eyes and acted visibly sad/moved. She thanked me many times and said it means a lot to her when a stranger is nice to her.

I didn't see her for some time when it was snowing, but now that the weather is getting nicer I've noticed her back by the steps again. Every time she sees me she asks me if I want to take a look at her items and I don't think she remembers me or our chat. 

My question is - should I try to help her? And if yes, HOW do I do it? I'm not sure it's a good idea to just come up to her, ask for her address and name and try to find her family. Have you ever dealt with a situation like this? Do you think I should leave her alone and let her sell the clutter or try to get her off the street? I have no idea why she's doing it if she has a family. I mean, I have a pretty bad relationship with my family, that's a whole different story, and I certainly can understand someone who hates their parents and cuts contact with them, but from how she was talking about her son I don't think this is that type of situation...",17Apr2018,4
171,"So around this time last year, I made friends with a new student at uni. They were a first year and I thought it'd be nice to help them. We became fast friends and were always close, despite the fact that they were severely depressed (and so was I). But then it turned sour... Around the middle of the year they'd try to touch me when I wasn't in the mood (I never in the mood). It happened on three separate occasions and I told them not do it again. They'd always do it as I was falling asleep. After the third time, I'd had enough and would actively avoid them, which made them mad. It finally got to the point when they asked me if I still wanted to talk to them and I flat out said ""no"". I felt so much better after doing that. 

But yesterday, I saw them on campus for the first time this year and I swear to god I was having a panic attack the moment I saw them. They didn't see me though, which is my only solace. I walked straight to class and tried to pretend I wasn't about to collapse.

174,"Okay, so I live in Japan and have lived here since I was three. I got into a good uni here and want to study Computer Science in Japan. The thing is, my parents want me to go out of the country.

The pro of living in Japan is that I'll be with my family and it'll be soooo much cheaper than going abroad. I'll also be in my comfort zone. The con is that my class would have only about 30 kids. The rest would be studying everything in Japanese and they’ll go to different classes in different buildings, so I wont really be making many friends. My parents are also somewhat strict and I’m worried I’ll get suffocated the next 4 years. I want to socialise and have fun (not partying) and I don’t think being in Japan would give me the opportunity of having a “real” college experience. Studying in Japan would also limit me to work in japan as well. The universities here are very laid back too, and my parents are worried I’ll get lazy and not work hard.

If I go abroad, I’ll gain more practical knowledge in my field and also have more work experience (it’s hard to get a job in japan without completing your degree). I’ll be able to meet lots of people from around the world and broaden my horizons in a way I would not be able to otherwise. I’ll also learn how to actually be independent. But….it’ll be a huge financial burden for my family. I also love my family too much and can’t bear not watching my brother grow up.

My dad told me that if I go abroad and it doesn’t work out, I can always come back to Tokyo and find a job. But if I go to uni here, I’ll never know what it’s like to study outside Japan and I’ll miss out on an amazing opportunity.

My final university choices are : University of massachusetts amherst (14 k scholarship), University of Waterloo (coop program), and Waseda University (in Tokyo).

Last time the wheel hub went out it took about $140 to get it fixed at a shop. Which doesn’t leave me room for a rental car of any sort.

176,"I'm a 21 year old guy who goes to appointments with a lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometime say thanks very much out of habit before she says it so idk. Also when I got a job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ a lot on emails and in person which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done.

178,"Please don’t report I am not seeking legal advice, the first part is explaining the situation. 

As far as I know, no one in my family has been charged with a crime. But i might be charged as part of a shoplifting case. My friend was recently apprehended for it, and they have me on film with him. I had set the box down and we went and paid for other items. This was over three weeks ago (as far as I remember), so it seems odd that this is coming up now. My friend is the dependent of an active duty sailor, but I am not. My mother is a civilian working here on base so either I will deported from Japan or both of us will. I don’t know. This is my first encounter with the law and with the base (plus I am a minor) so I don’t know if they will slap me with the most intense punishment they have. I’ve seen other active duty kids steal from Japanese stores and they are still here but because my mother is not active duty I guess that puts me in a whole different realm of base law. I read online and it seems like the most common punishment for shoplifting is being barred from the next for one year, which is fine by me. 

The item stolen was a low cost item (15.00 I think) so I don’t think i will get deported but I don’t know. 

I’m thinking about telling her this tomorrow and seeking her advice to either turn myself in to base police or not. I am writing this post to help me word my confession and my apology. Here is what I plan to say

“I’m sorry to have disappointed you, but I find myself now in one of the most difficult positions I have never been in. My friend (name) got caught stealing from the NEX and I am on tape with him when it happened. He has been caught by loss prevention already, so it is a matter of time before you are contacted about it. I think it would be better to tell you myself than have you be blindsided by it. It is my first infraction with the base and the NEX, so I do not know what is going to happen to me or you. I am hoping it is a simple ban from the store and a fine but they may deport me if they feel like a more serious punishment is necessary. I am telling you this for two reasons. First, because I am seeking your advice because I have never been in such an intense situation. Secondly, I want to tell you that I am not happy living overseas. It has brought out my “wild side” and I feel like I am slipping into my “rebellious stage” of my teenage years and this situation goes to show that this base is not the right environment from me to be in. Even before this, I felt unhappy with my school and I don’t feel like I should graduate here. I lack friends and my attempts to make them are defeating. I think I would do better living with my grandmother or grandfather, as much as it hurts me to say. I don’t want to leave you here alone, in a foreign county, but having this happen shows that I should not be here. I want to make good memories with you on vacations and trips and such, but Japan is not the place for me. I think living in small towns like where Grandma (name) lives is much better for me to get my mind and life straight, and to get my grades up. I think spending senior year with here will be better for me, personally. I’m sorry to have jeopardized your career with your current duty station,and to have let you down. You raised me better than that and I think it would be beneficial for me to leave and to clear my head in a place that isn’t here. Even if I don’t get deported over this situation, I still think I should spend my senior year with my grandma to clear my head. I’m sorry.”

183,"I moved out of my mom's very unexpectedly about a year and a half ago. I wanted to be on my own and start fresh in a new place 10 hours away. I got a full time job pretty quickly, dropped out of community college, and moved in about a month.

It started out okay, met some cool people, got in my first relationship, and grew up a lot. Then the relationship ended badly and so did a few more after that. I wanted to pursue my passion of writing and filmmaking but I kept feeling so alone and depressed and lost motivation, just like before I moved.

I'm lonely all the time. My coworkers are my only ""friends"" and they barely ever want to do anything outside of work and I feel like they'd rather just be work friends and never really ask what's going on in my personal life. I have no way of making friends outside of work since I live in a small college town where that's the only way to meet people.

I've failed over and over again at relationships and I'm crushing really hard on a co-worker right now and I thought she was into me at one point but I think my horrible ability to have a normal conversation with a cute girl ruined it. It's more than just her looks too, she is one of the coolest people I've met but I'm pretty sure I'll get nowhere with her.

All this stuff has really been getting to me, along with having basically no money, I feel like I'm trapped. No friends, no girlfriend, job I hate, no creative fulfillment, etc. I'm depressed basically all the time but I hide it fairly well with a fake smile and self deprecating humor.

184,"So in April 2017, I relocated to Oakland, California for better opportunities. Since then, my network has expanded and I’ve been able to do cool gigs with prominent tech companies and significant individuals. However, the problem I’m facing is that I’m unable to find a steady-paying job in the Bay Area and it’s EXTREMELY expensive to live here. My personal preference has always been to not attend graduate school if I didn’t have to.

As a backup plan, I’ve applied to two MBA programs back in Tennessee (where I’m from) and got accepted into both. I’m considering moving back for the sake of gaining that additional education credential while learning data analytics.

I have definitely learned way more in 1 year in the Bay Area versus my four years of undergraduate. But also, I have not considered schools out here simply because I would not be able to live comfortably with school and cost of living.

What would you do?

Bay Area pros: Strong network, proximity to tech companies (ideal for me), and plenty gigs
Bay Area cons: unable to find steady job, cost of living, highly competitive

Tennessee pros: family lives there, MBA acceptance, low cost of living
Tennessee cons: totally different atmosphere than ideal industry (tech), feel like I’m moving backwards, rely on internet/phone for maintaining Bay Area relationships ",17Apr2018,3

191,"I've been with this BPD woman for 3 and a half years.

It's been a hell of a ride. She made my life a living hell.

She's possessive, extremely jealous, manipulative, distorts every small situation and gaslight a lot. 

She recently cheated on me as well. 

Tried to breakup 3 times. She swears she'll change, then when she sees im hers again and continues abusing me for her own benefit.

Since I found out about the cheating I started mimicking some of her behaviors (particularly invading her privacy, something she had no problem doing to me and now hates it that I do it to her). I feel like a criminal and conflicted, those are not the values I believe in.

She seeks advices from friends and tells half the story and her distorted version of it. Then grabs whatever thing they said might help victimize herself and throws it at my face like a monkey throws poop. 

The current feeling is the following:

* I don't want to lose her to another man (also conflicted since I remember the things she said or did to another man and it makes me feel like trash)

* It brings me comfort knowing she's with me (and at the same time it doesn't, because I can't forget she betrayed my trust)

* She argues almost daily about the letter I sent to her lover letting him know how batshit crazy she is, along with an audio recording of her stating she wanted me and not him.

* Every time I hang up the phone after a heated argument I get an overwhelming feeling that I don't want to be away from her, end up humiliating myself by calling her and apologizing for losing my temper (while she said every word possible to insult me).

I'm going to therapy and I'm well aware I'm codependent. She never had any empathy whatsoever for me.

192,"This started way back when around first semester, about 6-7 months ago. My friend is taking a few AP classes as well as doing a club and an after school sport. I do not go to the same school as my friend. 

The way she works on homework is it has to perfect. Even if she knows the homework is only being getting graded for completion, she still has to make it perfect. This causes her to finish homework a lot later. She has to stay after school almost everyday because of club and there are days where she has to stay until like 8 or 9. She enjoys the club so she doesn’t want to quit that. She doesn’t want to quit her extra curricular sport either. On top of that, her parents are very strict, but have lightened up a bit. She says she doesn’t eat because she doesn’t have time and also says the same for sleep. Recently I’ve heard that she skipped school because she needs to catch up on work but then the next day she stresses out even more because there is even more work. 

Many people have tried to help her out as well as I have. I have tried giving her advice because she has asked. She is willing to vent out her problems as well. Her best friend has even helped out with her homework and gave her her lunch, but even with all that she’s still having stress problems.

I hold the fart in of course, but then when I hold it in for too long there occurs a loud sound from my stomach. Tommorow I am sitting in a dead silent classroom for 7 hours where everyone can hear even the tiniest sound. So what should I do to prevent this?

I go to the bathroom every brake we have at school which is every 45 minutes and then I fart so I won't deal with it in class for a short period of time. but I am not allowed to take brakes during the mock exam, though if we HAVE to go to the bathroom a teacher will wait outside and hear everything. So this will be a huge problem tommorow. This holding farts thing makes me unconcentrated, uncomfortable and embarrased when my stomach makes the sound.

My food routine:

I wake up 

06:45 Three fucking slices of bread with only banana slices on it. And a glass orange juice.

I come to school at 8:00. Mock exam starts at 8:20.

11:40 (Though I choose when I want to eat since it's a mock exam) Two slices of bread with strawberry jam.

School is over so I go home

16:00 Dinner, it can be basically anything, fish, meat, chicken 

18:00 One youghurt 

21:30 One slice of bread with slices of banana and a glass of orange juice

This is my exact way of eating currently. I hate it so much. But it works better than what I had before.

So I live with two friends, one I have known for maybe 8 years (housemate A) and one about 3 years (housemate B). We live in a medium size, open plan house. We're all pretty quiet people.

Housemate A is pretty into Fortnite. He plays probably 4-5 hours a day (rarely misses a day) and maybe once a week 6-12 hours, usually with game chat. He really gets into it, orders his squad around a bit and usually swears a fair bit. He also taps on the table/controller often and whistles and junk.

He plays on my PlayStation and my TV which is set up on the dining table which is in the kitchen/lounge room and is on the other side of the wall that connects to my room. As you can imagine it's really loud and can be heard throughout the house. Housemate B and I enjoy watching shows together but it's just not possible when housemate A is gaming due to his volume. Im also at uni and study is impossible when he's playing.

It's really wearing me thin. It's been probably a month and a half and I'm just struggling with it. What should I do? I obviously want to talk to him about it but don't know what is reasonable to be suggesting. I'd appreciate an outsiders perspective.

199,"Hey guys! I need your advice. I'm a 5th year dental medicine student and I want to shift to another course. As you can see Dentistry is a 6-year course but in order to graduate you have to finish all your clinical cases. At my pace right now, it will take me an extra year to finish them all.

Dentistry was never my first choice. I belong to a generational type of dental practice meaning I'll be the one to inherit the practice of my parent. I felt really bitter because I didn't get to choose the course and school that I wanted. My older siblings, on the other hand, were able to choose what they wanted. Despite hating my situation, I still excelled in my first four years. The fifth year was different. Clinics was so hard and stressful and I did not enjoy every second of it. From finding your patients, convincing them to return, securing yourself a dental chair, trying to keep your focus on a small chair with metal tools and high-speed drills on another person's mouth, getting scolded by your clinical advisers, and studying last minute for that quiz that you should have studied last night but slept instead because of the fatigue. Everday I felt overstimulated. Then I saw myself growing more anxious and smiling less everyday. I started skipping classes and isolated myself at my condo alone. I seeked for professional help and got diagnosed with clinical depression. Right now I'm under medication and also have the support of my family. 

I have reflected over and over again about what have happened to me for the past months. I am angry because I was forced into this course. I have asked before a few times if I could shift but got denied. I couldn't show my anger to them because I didn't want any conflict. But right now I'm pretty sure myself that I do not want to continue dental medicine because of its high stress and low job satisfaction. Its just not for me and my depression will just get worse. I want to shift to a computer related course (com sci, IT, or MIS). 

I plan on telling it all to my parents tomorrow and see what happens. But what's making me worried is that I'm 21 and I'll probably be 25 or 26 when I finish a computer related course. Will I still be able to get a job with that age? I feel so hopeless right now.

TL;DR I'm a 5th year dentistry student. I hate my course and got clinical depression. Now I want to change to a computer related course. But I'm worried because I'll be 25 or 26 years old when I graduate. Will I still be able to get a job with that age? Am feeling very hopeless.",17Apr2018,8
200,"I'm a stepmom of three. I've been in the picture for six and a half years. My oldest daughter is 14 and has recently been found to be having very sexual conversations on apps like amino and wechat. All of the interactions we're initiated by another party, she appears to have only had one ""partner"" at a time, in that timestamps indicate she was treating each one as you might treat a monogamous relationship. However, based on the language used, based on the manipulation techniques used, these were not peers of hers. These were people who used very classic predatory steps of grooming a submissive virgin.

We've tried to address this issue, but her dad and I haven't had this experience. We almost don't know how to talk to her, how to have a normal conversation, because every small infraction feels gigantic.

She definitely has self esteem issues. She blames a lot of her frustration on me expecting too much of her. I try to have reasonable expectations, but when expectations are not met, there are consequences like lost privileges. There is a history of bipolar disorder that is highly prevalent on the biological mom's side. The biological mom is intermittently in the picture and has encouraged her before to disregard her father and I because we ""don't know her like [she] does"". 

I want to give her positive self esteem, but that's not something you just give. So I want to give her opportunities to improve her self esteem, and hopefully the self-respect necessary to say no to people who are predators. I can tell her standard strategies for saying no, but if she wants to be on social media, I can't really stop her (her friends have phones and have let her use them in the past).

I live in a condo that has a shared wall where my living room basically mirrors this particular neighbors.

My neighbor's live in boyfriend is violent. I have heard him beat his girlfriend \(the owner of the condo\) and young child. Police have been called multiple times, CPS is now involved with the child. For the most part the woman always defends her boyfriend, even when he has beat the child. He has threatened me before when he suspected I called the police when he was beating his child.

A couple months ago the boyfriend got a pit bull, and whenever they leave it alone in the condo \(which they do often\), the thing howls and barks constantly. It's so loud that I might as well have it chained up in my own place.  I suspect they may put it in a cage when they leave, because I usually don't hear it running around, only barking and howling. It makes it so that I can sleep and can't relax. It's causing me major anxiety and affecting other areas of my life. They never take the dog outside for exercise so I can't blame the dog for doing what it does. The only exercise it gets in running around in the condo when they are home, which makes it sound like a fucking stampede inside my place.

This is clearly against my condo noise/privacy rules, but I'm concerned that if I complain, nothing will be done and the neighbors will only get worse and possibly retaliate because they obviously don't like me already and will probably enjoy the fact that their dog is annoying this shit out of me.

TBH, our friendship is the type of friendship that lasts a lifetime and the only reason she can't make me a priority to solve the problem, is bc she's so obsessed with her boyfriend and since he's her first boyfriend and first crush, it's been really easy for her to replace me with him.
We're graduating in 1 month, how do I accept that this friendship is just over although all of my best memories are with that person?
Also, my parents don't know abt our fallout and since she basically turned all my friends against me, I have no one to take pictures with at graduation. How do I tell my parents this w/out them blaming me and judging me? And yes, my parents are forcing me to walk. ",17Apr2018,1

214,"Spent my senior year applying to a fancy (read: insanely expensive but extremely prestigious esp. for the field) grad school and got in. An application fell into my lap for a job back home (I've spent my college years far from home) in a well-respected position with a top company. Applied thinking I might as well and made it through each interview round. Along the way, I started thinking about how nice it would be to move home, save my money, pay my already large student loan debt, and be around my friends/family/currently long-distance SO. Got the rejection for the job this morning. I'm devastated and I realize now how much I wanted to return home to work and figure out my life from there. I've always been pushed to achieve, working multiple jobs in school or out of it, and have gone well beyond my comfort zone, resulting in some intense anxiety at times, and it would be nice to go home and figure that out. But, now that the job is not an option, I'm left with the graduate school that I'm no longer sure is the right option for me, and would add six figures onto my already heavy loan debt, but is a truly incredible program that would give me great experience and connections. I need a break and just want to take some time to make a little money and reset myself, but I'm worried I'll feel like I failed the overachiever in me by abandoning this grad school opportunity. What do I do?",17Apr2018,1
215,"The player has anxiety and sometimes gets paranoid about his friendships. He does become irrational in his decisions so I want to help him out by getting an opinion from the outside. So here is the story.

Player creates a skype group and decide to add all his close friends. The group grew bigger so player decides to create various events involving a popular game at the time. The friends have tons of fun. This went on for 3+ years. The player created a discord since skype sucks and everyone joins, they eventually get power to control the group. 1 and a half years go by. Player managed the group and made sure no conflict occured by removing some abused permissions.

Group seemed divided by cliques. Popular ones go behind player's back to discuss removing members they find problematic. One member remind them that player is relevant to decision. The player is then added to discussion.

Player was confused but since most members agreed with decision he decided to go with it.

Months later player is invited to event and was celebrating a holiday. He was drinking and decided to voice an opinion that one of the popular members didn't agree with. They bash the player in a DM after player decided to ask another popular member for info after venting.

Group seems to message player for tech help most of the time and seems less likely to join him in a call unless one of the popular people were there with him.

Player felt the group turned into a weird clique base and he wasn't relevant to any of his 'friends' there so he leaves the discord for a bit to do his own stuff. A month later popclique decides to make own discord because they felt it was dead and without much freedom/power was given to everyone. Player was obviously upset but w/e. During his time off he chatted with people he thought were friends on the side for a couple of weeks but stopped for a while. No one messages the player for a month after he stopped initiating conversation.

What should the player do? Ask the 'friends' why they had been so distant. Or give up and find new friends?

The positive view I have about the situation is that people were just busy so they couldn't message the player. They may have wanted a new group because they were afraid the player might have gotten upset.

The negative is that they could be avoiding him because he left the group and prob felt abandoned. But didn't try talking to him about it.",17Apr2018,1

Also the fact that roll call has percentage and him only doing roll call when he feels like it isn’t a problem either.

232,"Firstly I want to acknowledge that it is completely my fault that, I first even sent an email out instead of a text to the coworker, and second how stupid it was that i didn't check to whom i was sending it to. I'm a person who understands consequences and I fully accept any punishment, but I would still like some advice on how to handle this situation.

Sometime last week, I sent a email out to a coworker who informed me that she was leaving. I am very close to this coworker and was sadden yet very excited for her future opportunities and seeking to better her life in any way she sees fit. After she informed me I went back to my office and wrote up a nice poem up until the last line where I said screw you for ruining my Friday. This email was accidentally sent to my boss. I quickly told her the context and she understood, and informed me to be careful with sending emails like that as I never know how the other person may take it. I did inform her about the kind of friendship I had with the individual. About an hour later, she spoke to the person I sent the email out to, asking about it. She informed that person that she is a new manager and wants to make sure she wasn't offended etc. She told her that is how our relationship is and that she wasn't offended at all. 

After their conversation, I thought that this situation is over. But fast forward to today, where the manager to whom I sent the email to came over to my bosses desk (I sit next to my boss). They were speaking very quietly, I thought nothing of first, until that manager went and stood back up and discreetly came by my desk and peeked at Me, and went back to my managers desk. Still thought nothing, until I got up a minute later to talk to my coworker, to find them talking at a corner, outside of where my boss sits, to which I'm thinking they completely did not want me to hear what they were discussing. Yes it's a possibility, that they could of not been talking about the email I sent last week, but my gut is telling me otherwise.

I quickly checked the HR code of conduct, and it states that a inappropriate email is grounds for corrective action, which by all means the email I sent was inappropriate.

I was wondering what should I do in my situation. Should I get in front of the issue and talk to hr myself with the person I sent the email to? Am I overreacting? Any advice would be helpful.

-can sleep in my own bed after parties
-no kids in apartment complex (BIG plus for me)
-lots of closet space
-all residents are my age
-guaranteed balcony

-at least 30 minutes from all friends
-will have to crash on friends’ couches if we go out to a party, or Uber back
-kids in apartment, various ages
-underground garage so I wouldn’t have to clean snow off my car

I’ll be a operational rep going over ventilator equipment and how it works with hospital department staff on the west coast. 

They will be providing a company car and credit card for food, hotel, and airplane tickets etc. at full coverage.

I feel that it is a great step upwards in my career as it boosts my resume and gives opportunities beyond this position. 

My question is for those who travel a lot for work. This position requires 80% travel, anything west of Texas from boarder to boarder (US [Canada to Mexico]). 

What are the challenges of traveling for work, best parts, worst parts (besides the obvious), and life hacks. 

I currently work at a Hospital in ICU, ER, and General Floor with 8 Years experience in the field. I am definitely wanting to step away from the bedside (working directly with patients) , but I have never traveled for work so I am seeking advice, tips, and suggestions.

I recently got engaged to my fiancé 4/7/18 in Venice, Italy. She’s definitely on board with the career change, as she too loves to travel. We both hope that she may be able to come on trips with me and/or stay at hotels with me (not on company money of course). Obviously, there can be challenges in a relationship when it comes to time away, but we have a strong loving relationship so I’m not too concerned. (No kids, both agree for 5-7 years on that). I’m 27 and she’s 25. 

The recruiter mentioned it would not be unusual to be gone 4-5 days a week. I love hotels and traveling, but not having experience in this area I am definitely looking for advice from individuals.

244,"Backstory: I met a girl in our last years of college. We dated for a little over a year and a half, and because she got into law school in another city, and I wanted to go to flight school, we both moved to South Florida. 7 months later, after constantly fighting, we established that we weren't working out. At least not while she was in law school. After spending another 9 months in an apartment with her (she was never really there, so it wasn't awkward, just extremely depressing, and led me to drinking very heavily and at one point, almost taking my life). About a week after I found a place to move into, I met someone at my job, and we started conversing. That eventually led to us dating. She was the nicest, most supportive person I'd ever met. She even stuck with me when I was in the middle of moving out, and even after I told her that I was still technically living with my ex. 

About 2 months in, I started to lose the enthusiasm that I had in the beginning. I found myself getting very easily irritated, and annoyed. I didn't know what to do about it, so I just kept it to myself and kept going. 4 months in, it had gotten to the point where not only would I get annoyed easily, but I was so used to being spoken to in a certain tone by me ex, that I frequently misinterpreted things that the new gf would say, and it led to a lot of clashes. I eventually realized that I didn't need to be in a relationship at that time, and I needed to call this off. She was too nice, and didn't deserve me being an asshole because of past relationships. The whole week leading up to me talking to her about it, I felt HORRIBLE. I couldn't handle knowing that I was about to crush her feelings. The Thursday of that week, we went shopping together, had a good time, and things were fine. But I knew that it was more than likely going to be temporary, and we would be right back to the same routine. The next day, she could tell something was wrong, and I finally told her I needed a break because I knew I wasn't treating her fairly. My friends told me that was the right thing to do, that it was mature of me, etc., but I still feel like absolute trash for it. In a recent conversation regarding a parking permit, she asked me not to contact her again, because I've caused her enough pain already. I didn't plan on cutting ties with her, because she didn't give me any reason to, but now I see that she wants that.

246,"Hi everyone! I'm new to this thread and thankful to have it, looking for some advice on what to do about my mom as we are nearing my wedding. 

A little background: my mom is young, a potential narcissist, and my father was an abuser who is no longer in our lives. We're really close, like mother/daughter boundary-crossing close into friendship. I'm her support, but she seems to really resent me for having me so young and taking away her youth. I am also decently successful - I have a graduate degree, living in a big city, getting married, and she always says that she wish she had the opportunities that I had. Anyway, I'm getting married in a couple of weeks and my mother is supposed to walk me down the aisle, give the welcome toast, and have a mother/daughter dance with me. 

Throughout the last year or so of wedding planning, she has been pretty distant and unsupportive. Complains about wedding-related things, and has made financial commitments that she hasn't kept (and I didn't expect her to keep, but she insisted..). She also bought my dress, which I am extremely thankful for and have deeply expressed to her. She is known for being selfish and attention-grabbing, so I've just tried to leave her be and plan the wedding on my own without much help, which is fine with me. But, her constant saying of ""well I don't have to go to that wedding event if I don't want to"", etc. and it's really gotten to me because she isn't willing to go to my wedding events (bachelorette, brunch, etc.) even though she's my only family member (no siblings, father, etc.) and supposedly best friend. It's really bummed me out, but I haven't said anything because I expected this. As a daughter, you really have big dreams of your mom being excited and happy, and she just has been grumpy (not because she doesn't love my fiance, they have an amazing relationship). 

Last week I reached out about her making the final payment that she committed to. She backed out, and I admittedly made a big deal out of it by saying ""Just f***ing forget it"". She blew up, and then I ended up expressing my feelings of loneliness since she hasn't been very supportive or excited. That transpired into her saying that I've become a monster, and I'm fussy and attention-grabby. This isn't me at all, I've been trying to be very humble and casual throughout all of the wedding planning, and our wedding is hopefully going to reflect that.

It's been 6 days since I expressed how I felt, she called me names, told me to leave her ""the f out of everything"". I haven't reached out to her, and she hasn't reached out to me. I don't want to end up being the codependent person that I am and reach out and apologize when all I did was express my feelings, and she came back with hurtful comments. I feel like she should apologize to me, but I know that's not going to happen. 

Should I call her and talk about this? Should I give her another week to cool off? I'm nervous that she won't reach out first, or what if too much time passes and she says f it completely and just doesn't even come to the wedding to prove a point to me?

I'm lost, I don't know what to do. Any guidance or advice on dialogue is very much appreciated. ",17Apr2018,5

Over time I started to notice it thinning when we were in the sun or a well lit room. His hair was so light in color you could just barely see his scalp which was never the case before. I assured him it was a normal part of agining and that his dad is thin in the front but not bald so SURELY it was done thinning at this point. 

Nope\- I couldnt have been more wrong. In the last 6 months his hair has SUBSTAINTIALLY thinned. To the point his own mother gasped at the sight of him. Its progressed beyond his fathers minor thin patch and im beginning to think hes destined to be bald on top. Which has no effect on my attraction to him cause I love him and think he would look good bald too but, this is KILLING HIM INSIDE. 

My fiance is the type of guy who goes to the gym every day, gets a haircut every 3 weeks, trims his armpit hair, you get it. Hes more high maintnance than me and grooming is something he does in front of the mirror every night. He has a very fragile ego and this has taken a serious toll. He spends a ton of time with hair product in front of the mirror trying to ""hide"" it. Hes started wearing hats and brings it up at least once a day. Today he even sent me pictures of it and old pictures of his thick hair lamenting on what once was his hairline. 

Now aside from him mourning and learning to accept this\- is there any REAL treatments out there for him? When I google it all that comes up are magic elixers and shampoos that make empty promises. I would offer him hair plugs but that seems extreme for a 26 yr old. I suggested a trip to the Dr. to see if its nutritional or perhaps hormonal but he does not have insurance and declined anyway. I reassure him everyday that he looks good and that I love him just as much but its his own personal confidence I cannot fix. And I worry its having a negative mental effect on him. I want to help him but my words mean nothing. The min he sees a mirror hes frantically fixing his hair. The other night at dinner with my family i had to BEG him to take his hat off. I hated making him uncomfortable but my 80 yr old sicilian grandma does not allow hats at the table. 

PLEASE ANY ADVICE IS HELPFUL!! I just want him to feel confident and happy again. ",17Apr2018,0

249,"I'm working part-time as a waitress (night shift). Since I don't own a car and bus already stops running when I finish work, I usually need a lift home from my co-worker. Let's call him John.

John keeps flirting with me since we met, he even asked me out a few times. I didn't think too much of it because he seems like a type that would playfully flirt around without any serious intention. I still try to be polite but distant though and I turned him down every time he asked me out. I'm sure I didn't give him any false hope.

Today I found out John already had wife and daughter. (his daughter is hella cute too) In fact, his wife actually texted me (I don't know how she gets my number) and tells me about how he used to cheat on her several times. She said she doesn't blame me on this because she knows I'm innocent and that her husband is an a-hole. I assured her that there is nothing going on between me and John and that if it bothers her, I will stop asking him to drive me home. She thanked me for that then went on and vented all her frustration (almost the entirety of her failed marriage) on me. 

So now I need to know how I'm going to face John when I go to work this Saturday. I know I'm not asking him to drive me home anymore but if I do that he might get suspicious. He works in the kitchen too so everyone in there will hear what we talk about. I couldn't talk to him privately because the restaurant is always packed and I FEAR this type of confrontation. I don't want to embarrass him in front of his colleagues (they are close but I'm not sure how much they know about his family issue). I don't even know if I should tell him that his wife texted me or pretend like nothing happens. I could ask someone else to give me a lift but they would ask me why I stop going with John. What should I do guys???",17Apr2018,1
250,"Yesterday was the deadline to put down money at veterinary schools and I put down a deposit at my in state vet school. For 3 months I have been so torn between my local one and an extremely well-ranked and respected one out of state. My in state school is private, so it is very expensive. It is also brand new, so it is not even ranked or accredited yet (it will be though this year). But I definitely did click with it. The facilities were incredible and I love my home state and would really value being close to my family/friends. 

The out of state school I also clicked with. Of the 9 schools I was accepted to, those students were absolutely the ones I connected to and related to the most. I loved the sense of community in the undergrad and vet school. The two negatives were the very cold weather and distance from home. I didn't know if I was ready to make such a big transition and move across the country for four years. I'm definitely more of a home body. 

I'm not unhappy with my decision. But I thought I would be happier. At the moment I put down my deposit I was most happy that I would be a vet, not about the particular school. I keep thinking about the out of state school and wondering if I should reach out and change my mind even though the deadline was yesterday. I've visited both schools twice, made spreadsheets, pros cons lists, and they are honestly exactly even. Is this just buyer's remorse or should I actually be reaching out to the out of state school?

251,"So I'm a queer gay trans guy in college. It's my second year and I've got new friends and I'm so fucking happy for the first time, but something is bothering me that I can't really ignore. During the beginning of the semester I didn't have a lot of friends, and hung out in the designated queer social space, this shady 9th circle sort of self made hell where a lot of other LGBTQ ppl hang out, but a lot more don't bc it's petty as fuck. (like I've said, I've moved past that circle thankfully) But it's still the best place to work and socialize etc. on campus. In this space I was fairly decent friends with J, who also had newly become president of the space, and on good terms if not better friends with everyone else in there. But the new semester kids just arrived and we were all welcoming them - I decided to expand my social sphere and invite them on an urban exploration trip that night, bc that's my expertise and it's so amazing. To make a long story short, J jumped into the exploration group, and when I left an hour before we were to go out, he texted saying he took them all to get high and we'd go another night. 
Fair enough. Drugs are a rite of passage to some. So I stayed in and worked instead. 
The next morning one of the sweeter new gays came up to me and confided that J had actually gotten them high, cancelled w me, and did the trip anyway, bc one of the ppl they met getting high wasn't a fan of me and wanted to come with. This was a trip I organized, taught them how to get around security, and rallied everyone together. Still, not a big deal. I told J I was pissed he took advantage and that it wasn't cool. He shrugged bc, tbh he's used to being in control and blew it off. So I continued my life and he did his, separately, though in the same space. 
a couple months ago though, another new queer with a conscious I'd made friends with texted me saying J was telling everyone I was an attention whore, and problematic (to make this in context, I go to a very progressive school, and to be questionable in abuse etc. is the lowest of the low, as it should be) as soon as I leave the space. So I head back over and tell him if he's got a problem bring it to me, not talk behind my back, and he's just like, I'm just warning people but I sorta put the fear of god in him bc tbh while I didn't threaten him, I'm really intimidating for a twink. And I thought that was the end of it. Now though, my friends are getting threats that if they don't stop being friends with me, they'll be iced, J is spreading rumors first that I'm sexually aggressive (whatever that means) and next that I'm an abuser, when I don't smile at him in the QSL people say I'm harassing him. His key card went missing bc his frontal lobe is full of dick pics and diet plans, and his boyfriend accused me of stealing it. And like I said, the space is filled with rather socially awkward creatures who just follow the leader. 

The point is this. I don't mind lies being told. I don't mind ppl not liking me. It's nothing new. But I've been abused. Twice. I've been sexually assaulted and I have panic attacks half the time when I fuck my boyfriend bc I'm terrified of being hurt - anyone I've been with will tell you I'm the most careful person asking consent before every fucking act to the point of irritation. And the best part is J and I share a rapist. If anything we should be allies but I'm being painted to so many people like I'm as much of a monster as he was. And honestly my life is so much better now that my social sphere is outside that space but fuck... I don't want to lose my community. I can't walk this campus with people thinking I would EVER do something without consent, that I would ever abuse someone. I can't let it go. And I don't know what to do except walking up to the space and saying Hi I'm _____ if you think I'm a monster raise your hand and I'll answer your questions (i'd even do it so they could be anonymous via sahara app) But any advice would be brilliant. Thanks. ",17Apr2018,1
252,"My younger sister is getting married in a couple of weeks. We come from a relatively dysfunctional family. My mother, an abusive alcoholic, raised my sister after my parents got divorced. I stayed with my dad. My mom passed a few years ago, but my dad is still alive.

He remarried when my sister was in high school. Our stepmother is a pathological liar and manipulator that has essentially made it impossible for us to have a normal relationship with our father. My sister blames my dad for all the trouble he's caused, not defending her against our stepmother's crazy accusations, and being generally a non-factor in her adult life.

As her older brother, I've kind of stepped in to be that reliable family member. Helping her with advice and occasionally money as she's gotten her life together. Now, she's a thriving adult and I couldn't be more proud of what she's accomplished, despite the difficulties caused by our parents.

I was able to convince her to invite my dad to the wedding. He's going to come. But my sister has made it clear that she wants me to walk her down the aisle, give her away at the altar and have the first dance at the wedding.

I'm honored, obviously. But since my dad will be in attendance, I'm also in an uncomfortable position. I made it my mission to help my sister make sure that her day was as perfect as it could be. And if this is what she wants, so be it. But what should I do about my dad?",17Apr2018,1

257,"Okay kinda complicated so hear me out.

I (M-now 19), was in Senior year of high school. I had gotten out of a relationship, so I was...”going around”, to say the least. Always was safe, and everything looked fine afterwards.

I was 17 at the time. Around December, I started messaging a friend who left after Freshman year. We started talking. Eventually met up. We had sex. I wore protection, and everything seemed fine afterwords. (This was how I lost my virginity)

She stopped communication with me afterwords, and I wasn’t sure what happened. Turned out she had a boyfriend (who she’s engaged to right now). Literally, she denies anything and everything that happened. She claims that we never have spoken recently, let alone had sex. Her BF later actually threatened me if I ever talked to her again. So idk if I should bring this whole thing up or not.

All my friends spent following weeks joking about it, but turns out she was pregnant. No one thinks it’s mine cuz We’d think other guy wouldn’t wear one, plus I did, and like I said it all looked okay.

Now I recently saw her profile, and her kid has been born, sometime is August/September. We had sex in December. I’m currently in a serious relationship right now, as well as college.

It has been about 7 months after child’s apparent birth. Also I’d think the BF would be hunting me down at this point, if it was mine. So here are my questions now:

1. Is it possible that it is my child?
2. My father wasn’t a good one, and I want to be one. If it is mine, should I step up and claim it? I don’t want a child now but shit happens I guess.
3. She has denied any physical interaction, and it’s been apparently 7 months with no notification. Whether it’s mine or not, what will happen if she claims it’s mine later?
4. Not sure how hospitals do things, but with both her and the guy present, would they have been able to tell that it was theirs or not?
5. Like I said, I’m not ready, nor want a child, but I don’t wanna be a dick. Should I question her, or should I just forget about it, and leave it be. (And if so will I get fucked later?)",17Apr2018,1

259,"So this isn't my proudest post, but I'm going to be as honest as I can be. This is my fifth year of studying at university (in Australia), and currently, I have nothing to show for it. I've jumped degree to degree. Currently doing an IT one, and I still have zero passion. I'm obviously not proud of this at all, but I think maybe I have a bit of sunk cost fallacy about the whole thing. I'm still in first year for the IT course. 

I'm wanting to drop, for the following reasons:

 - I'm not passionate enough

 - I feel unmotivated, but I feel like I HAVE to do it, so it's really wearing me down, and I'm finding myself slipping in terms of diet and general wellbeing.

 - I currently am a bartender, and I enjoy it, and I don't see myself enjoying being an IT professional any more, even if it pays better. I'm not really super interested in earning a tonne of money. 

 - IT jobs aren't really that easy to come by. Even though the field is growing yearly, the amount of IT graduates is growing even more in Australia, so there'll be LESS jobs when I graduate, per capita. 

 - I am currently trying my hand at being a novelist. It's an absolute pipe dream, but I've been working at it with surprising dedication. It's been my dream since I was a tiny kid, and I've read 3 books on the subject since I really buried myself in it a few months ago (comparing that to the number of books I've read on uni subjects: 0). Bartending suits more for this kind of work, since (and this is probably not always the case) IT jobs seem very demanding, and eat up a lot of your time. This one possibly isn't true. 

So I'm pretty set on dropping. My main issue is that I'm currently mid-semester, so I can't drop the course fees, and I'm in the thick of the assessment. As I am set on quitting the degree, essentially forfeiting the 4k or whatever it was that the degree will cost me down the line (I'm fucking retarded), do you think I should bother trying to pass? On the one hand, it feels futile, and is a spectacular way to kill my spirits, happiness, and potentially wellbeing. On the other, 4k is a lot of money, and even though I don't want to pursue this, and I know I don't, I feel like maybe I'm losing something by not giving it a shot. 

I'll take any thoughts on any of this. On my decision to drop out, on my thoughts about the current semester. Any of it. ",17Apr2018,1

Also, I browsed this subreddit a little bit before making this post and while I think my problem might pale in comparison to some of the shit people are going through, I just need some outside thoughts on my currently messed up brain.

So, Im 32, she's 27. I live in the States and she lives in Ireland. We met each other playing an online game 3 years ago, and decided to give a relationship a shot. We are certainly perfect for each other, that's not really the issue. After dating for several months we planned on meeting. She came over here for a week. It was great. We started planning another trip, we aimed for this one to be longer so we could see what it was like living together, so she came over here for a month. Again, it was great. We compliment each other very well and we are certain we want to make this a permanent move. Amidst all the plannings of passports, and marriage licenses, and multiple plane trips and lawyers, Im stumbling upon my problem.

I've spent a large majority of my life alone, I didnt have my first real relationship until I was 27 and it didn't go well, so I've mostly been a lone wolf. I've always been jealous of people who knew what they wanted, and I've always posed this question to myself and others. ""If you could be doing anything, anything at all, right now, what would it be?"" Answers have varied from sex, to games, to travel, etc. But my answer has always been ""I dont know."" So here's where my new problem comes in. I have an answer now. I want to be with her. Sex, games, just sitting on the couch doing nothing, I just want to be with her. But I find myself in a position where I finally have an answer, but I can't do that thing, so everything else just seems like a huge bore. I have no issues at work because Im thinking about work and nothing else. But as soon as I get home, even though I have a multitude of things do, I just decide to go to bed and lie there until sleep comes and I get to go back to work. While it wouldnt be an issue of my feeling bored all the time, it's starting to feel like a drain on her too, as I often just don't spend my free time with her because I feel so shitty about everything.

So, that's my little ""sob"" story. I was wondering if anyone in long distance relationships had any advice for me. I had no issues feeling bored without her until she was here for a month and I foolishly started letting myself get used to it. Thanks.",17Apr2018,1

271,"I've brought it up with them before. My parents have said they don't want me to do cyber school this upcoming school year (my Junior year), but would consider talking about it again for my Senior year. They know I am unhappy at my school. 

At the end of my 8th grade year, I moved from the town I lived my entire life in to a state across the country. After my Freshman year I moved again, and this time I moved only a few hours away from where I originally lived. I have been unhappy and somewhat struggling in my new school, and I believe I need a change. My parents know I dislike where I am, but they have their own concerns about cyber school. Their main worries are: my chances of getting in a good college; and my social life/me becoming socially awkward. Personally, I'm not worried about either. I'm not the type of person that needs to go out every night, see people every day, etc. I'm a more secluded person and my parents know this. Besides, It's only 2 more years until I graduate. I have no social ""problems,"" I'm just a private person and doing cyber school won't affect my ""social skills."" I know graduating from a cyber school nowadays won't really affect my chances of getting into a good college (as long as my grades are good and I score well on the college admission tests), but my parents are still worried. It's obvious to me that I'm no Harvard or Yale student anyways lol.

I should also note that my sister is graduating from college this year. She is currently looking for a job, and 2 notable places that she could move to are Nebraska and California. I asked my parents if I could move with her and my dad said possibly Nebraska (California would be too far away). I just think it's kind of interesting that they wouldn't let me do cyber school but would consider letting me move *again* to a state *hours* away.

*edit* Something I forgot to mention: I pretty much have no other choice of schools where I live. My county doesn't allow students to go out-of-boundary (whatever you want to call it). The schooling in my city is *very bad*, so as I said, I am pretty much stuck at my current school.

I understand no one but my parents could choose what school I will end up in.

272,"My best friend and I have a rule that she implemented when we were dating (she’s my ex. Yes, I know) where we aren’t allowed to not reply to eachother unless we say bye because we’re busy. And I can’t lie and say i’m busy because her and I know what the other is doing and where hey are 24/7

Because of this rule, we sometimes have lots of generic and small talky conversations that are just a waste of time. I’m a really quiet guy overall also so once i’ve said everything on my mind and so has she, there isn’t really much to talk about. Just constant “wyd” and shit like that. ESPECIALLY when we’re facetiming. When we facetime she gets mad if I go on pause or am not holding the phone up to my face, so when her and I facetime and are just making small talk since there’s nothing else to say since we talk every second, i’m just sitting there bored not being able to play video games or go on my phone. I just have to quietly wait for her phone to get low battery or for her to have to go somewhere so I can finally stop wasting time

I love talking to her, but when we’re talking I can’t really do other things and sometimes i’m just not in the mood to be texing or facetiming anyone. If I tell her this though, she’ll get offended and constantly bring it up everytime we facetime. She’ll probably jokingly say shit like “oh you’re facetiming me?

A couple of months ago, he messaged a girl I know saying he wishes she could do all these dirty things to him.

She finished cleaning awfully quickly and left. She returned about ten minutes later with two drinks that had been in the bag with the other groceries. She said I left them in the bag and she almost threw them out. From the moment I let her into my apartment she acted annoyed that I was there while she was cleaning and kept banging things around in the kitchen and slamming cabinet doors and the over door. She barely cleaned anything before she left. Normally I am not here when she comes to clean, but some of my normal activities got cancelled so I came home. I texted her after she left to ask if she’d seen the groceries that are missing and she said she didn’t remember seeing them. There’s no way she could have missed them if she found the drinks in the bag. I don’t have proof that she stole them, but it’s the only plausible explanation. I thought at first that maybe she’d taken them thinking that I meant to throw them away, but since she returned the drinks, that hypothesis goes out the window.

286,"I apologize in advance for the melancholy of this post.

Trying to keep it as short as possible (edit: I failed to keep it short sorry), I just am not happy. I have no friends and no motivation to do anything. I go to college because I'm forced to. Most of the time when I'm out of college I just stay in bed and literally do nothing. I'm *always* at home. Maybe I'd read or watch an endless stream of meaningless videos on youtube but more or less, substantially, I do nothing at all. I even lost my interest in learning. I used to be a straight A student in high school and now I just couldn't care less about anything. 

And the biggest one (I think) is the friends part. I mean... it seems like no one wants to be friends with me? I'd like to say that I'm not _hopelessly_ boring. I like math... I know 3 languages apart excluding English. I have pretty interesting tastes in video games/music. I don't know. I was always that kid you just said ""hi"" to but didn't actually hang out with or anything. Well I want go hang out with people I want to be funny and laugh because other people are being funny. Despite my being an introvert I think I really crave social interaction. I just feel so.. empty? I don't think there's anything wrong with me either.. random people have told me I'm attractive actually. and I'm still young (only 18) which.. isn't to say that age is a problem but it should he easier to make friends at this age. I sometimes watch those videos of old high school depictions of life (""blank high school 1998"" or something like that) on youtube and just envy the vivid felicity of these people. I just wish I could talk about something with someone and smile just like they do.

295,"Hi there,

First things first- thanks for any insight or advice you may have.

I've been working at my company for almost 8 months now. I run our social media. When I first started, I was keeping up with three accounts daily (our company's Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn) and was helping my immediate boss with some of his projects. This was all that others had to do in my position before me-- and they only stayed at my company in this position for about a year or a little over a year on average. I plan to stay longer.

About three months into my job, my company created a new project that has its own Facebook, Twitter, and website, and made it my responsibility. I now have DOUBLE the amount of work I did on a daily basis to keep all 6 web/social media outlets up and running. While it isn't undo-able, it has unequivocally upped the amount of work I do on a day-to-day basis. (With the creation of the new website alone, I've had to devote a full day of my week to maintaining it).

I didn't want to ask for a raise when they first implemented this program because I had only been at my company for three months. I wanted to at least make it until six to possibly pursue the idea of a raise. It is now almost eight months. My question is: do I even have the leverage to ask for a raise at this point? I mean, I know I've been at the company for less than a year but my workload has doubled since I first started. No other person in my position has had this workload/ this amount of responsibility, and I'm being paid the same amount as they were. When and how would it be appropriate and respectful to ask for a raise?",17Apr2018,1

For one activity we went into a forest and long story short we all ended up completely covered in mud. When we got back we needed washed and changed, the boys and the girls each had rooms with shower stalls and connecting these rooms was a very warm room with pipes dividing it in half (this is where we where supposed to leave our muddy clothes) I got washed and grabbed my towel and put it on, for some reason I decided to go hang my clothes out before getting changed.

When I walked into the drying room strangely both female teachers were standing on the boys side and there were some girls on the other side changed and hanging their old stuff.

I hung my stuff and remember Mrs A saying something like “there’s anon he’s always the most organised” to Mrs B.

Right at that moment I dropped my towel.

When I asked if he wanted to break up, he made it very clear he didn't want to as he still loves me so much and finds me very attractive and now I'm paranoid.

Contact makes me very happy and connected to who I am dating and without it I feel unwanted and distant to whoever I'm with at that time. We also sent nudes very often over text and he was super forward with what he wanted to do to me, sexual wise... For example whenever I sent him a picture when I was in the bath he would say: 'Oh yeah baby, I want to fuck you hard when you're all wet'.

300,"This is the type of stuff one talks to a psychologist to, but there's no reason to make it exclusive to them. 

I am a 23 year old male with a shot at doing great things moving forward. There are two current situations which I need advice with along with anxiety associated with both of them. The first is that I have a shot at doing a PhD in something I love and the second is that I am falling for someone. There is anxiety in both due to previous experience. 

I have had a rough childhood in that I was socially awkward and had trouble finding motivation to learn new things. Had a rough father that was ballistic at times that meant that I tiptoed around people to gain their approval. I was a nerd and excelled at school (with great anxiety) but had trouble doing things I love for me rather than someone else. Too afraid to try something for the risk of failure. 

I am too afraid about messing up the PhD or the MSc that comes before it. This fear is currently holding me back. I've done amazing work at the beginning of the MSc, but I'm very afraid of nose diving which is leading me to burn out. I can do this. I just need to stop stressing.

The second problem is that I still have trouble loving myself or taking care of myself in a friendship. This sounds narcissistic, but what I mean by this is that I love giving to others. I enjoy being friends with people. Never had a girlfriend (lived somewhere where I didn't interact with girls when I grew up) so I don't have any data there to use. However, my urge to gain people's approval pushes me to do more and risk hurting myself in the process, all to make sure that the people still like me. Don't get me wrong I am much better than what I used to be in highschool, but I'm noticing that it's happening in small ways that can lead to a bad relationship. I don't mind it per se, I'm just worried I'd find out I'm bothered too late in the game, that's if the game happens to begin with. I have not had any luck in college with girls for obvious reasons.  

I have conquered many problems and fought many battles, overcoming a lot of anxiety in the process, to be where I am now. I have forgiven people and done the dirty work of fixing the biggest outlying problems. The current problem is that bad memories frequently taint my current view of reality when stress is present and make me believe I will mess things up going forward. 

TL;DR:

1) I have a shot at PhD doing something I love, but the stress and anxiety fueled by poor-self-motivation-associated memories mean that I might bomb it. 

2) I am falling for someone. I have worked on improving myself and eliminating poor personal traits that can bother others, but I am still worried about how a relationship would go given bad personal childhood experience and giving too much to someone without getting something in return. That's if i get lucky to begin with.

308,"I'm 22F. I met a guy on a dating app last summer and started seeing him. He initially told me he was 28M, turns out he was actually 32M. I dated him for about 10 months before I found out he had a GF, at which point I sent her screenshots of our conversations and blocked him on everything.

I performed oral on him a few times before I realized he had a GF, because I was under the impression he was single. One night when I was drunk, we ended up having sex even though I had explicitly told him I wouldn't have sex with someone unless I was in a relationship with them. I freaked out after and messaged a friend about the fact that we had sex and I was upset. When I brought it up to him that I wasn't okay with it, he guilted me and went on a tirade about women and how they make false rape accusations. He claimed he broke up with his GF for me, and went to some ridiculous lengths to keep up that image until I found out the truth, including showing me a random apartment he supposedly was moving into after he supposedly moved out of his GF's place (he's a realtor, had access to lots of apartments and would oftentimes take me to those to try to hook up with me). 

He insisted most of our communications were on Snapchat, so most of our messages are gone.

I'm furious and still struggling with the emotional fallout of what happened to me, especially since I had been in an abusive/cheating relationship in the past and made it clear multiple times that I didn't want to see anybody who was already in a relationship.

She had no other friends, she’s just kind of a socially awkward person, so over time my wife and I adopted her as a kind of extension into our family. She watches our kids, we have her over for dinner and invite her to hang out frequently. She even gets in on family game nights. Nothing strange or remotely sexual has ever happened.

I deployed with him, and he was a pathological liar with a victim complex so I always kept my distance. I hadn’t seen him in a year or more so I figured, hell, maybe he turned his life around. She seemed really happy with the guy and we didn’t want to meddle, so we were chill about it. Signs started showing up. He was in town and we all grabbed lunch. He wanted to catch up with me at the beginning of the meal, and when she tried to chime in he told her “Men were talking”. I recoiled, and corrected it on the spot. Lunch ended abruptly and I haven’t spoken to him since. He and I aren’t on outright bad terms, just very cold toward each other. She’s been a very bubbly, warm hearted person as long as we’ve known her and the more time she spends with this guy the more reserved she has become. We addressed it in a minimally invasive way, she assured us everything was kosher and she was just tired from work. They were engaged shortly afterward, and she asked my wife to be a maid of honor. My wife told her yes, but made it clear that we don’t care for the guy. We see her less and less since then.

I run, and this last winter I invited her to run a half marathon with me. My family goes to support me every year, and it’s close to home for her. It was also kind of a last big get together for all of us because she’s moving way north to be with him after they get married. She ran, and did well but ended up getting in a minor car accident afterward. She was driving his car, which she payed off with her own money. He absolutely lost his shit via phone. It was so loud that she had to excuse herself and as far as we know he never asked if she was okay. We talked with her about it, just shy of pleading. She listened but didn’t really respond to any of our concerns. She kind of faded out after that, but assured us that she was just busy with the wedding. She’s had a lot of bridesmaids withdraw due to pregnancy, military moves, etc...

The wedding is in 13 days. It’s probably the last time we’ll see her, and we’re kind of mourning the whole situation. We don’t want to waste the opportunity to let her know we are still here if she needs anything, but really unsure about how appropriate offering that kind of support is during a wedding. 

What would you say to her if it you were in our shoes?",17Apr2018,1
319,"I have very few friends, and they very rarely ask me out to do anything. They are very often hanging out with each other, and it's making me very insecure. Am i too boring to hang out with them? Is that why they don't want anything to do with me? Its gotten to the point where i without noticing start acting up to please them and to hang out with me. I could go from normal to super joking and talkative, and i think they are noticing it. In fact, i do this so often i've kinda forgotten who i actually even am. I do this about 5 times a day where i start acting up very differently. For example normal to very joking and chill but not myself and i fucking hate it, or from normal to sad because i feel left out. I have tried getting more friends to improve and not feel so left out, and they just always drop the conversation, and i don't know why. I tried befriending a few girls (really nice and friendly ones) and they just ignored me. I tried to cheer myself up and find something to occupy myself with and i've been going to the gym for a good year now. I have gotten some really good gains and i actually look pretty nice now in my own eyes. I also started over on r/NoFap and am on a good streak. But it doesn't fucking help.

321,"TLDR; My nan is holding back my grandad from living his life as much as he can with the time he has left due to her forcing upon herself to need 24/7 care, what do we do?

So my grandad is 81 years old, my nan 75
My nan is a sour woman, who has a good heart sometimes, but is very bitter about my grandad being a cargo pilot and travelling the world and leaving her behind to work over the years.

About 10 years ago my nan had a small fall and has used it as an excuse to make herself bedridden, its out of choice, because if you make her angry she's as active as an athlete.
Because of this she requires 24/7 care which has written my grandad's freedom off completely, so instead of enjoying their retirement travelling and what not, they're stuck in a dark and dingy room.

My grandad is too scared to do anything about it so us as a family got a social worker to come and talk to my nan to see if she would accept a bit of help a couple times a week so my grandad doesnt need to do too much and can still leaves the house as he's still able bodied to out, my nan however has not left the bedroom in 10 years.

The social worker went upstairs, when she came back down she said she has never been so verbally abused in her life and even advised my grandad, ""Why are you still here, if i were you, i would arrange help, leave and enjoy life""! We were shocked and wondered what my nan had said to her to make someone of her job role come to that conclusion.

We can't arrange any help as anything we've tried requires ""her consent"".

The only thing left we can think of is involuntary sectioning, but i dont know if its a bit too extreme, given the state of his health, i would say my grandad has about 5 years left to live, it should not be spent lookong after a woman who doesnt appreciate what he does...

What do we do?",17Apr2018,2
322,"I have been an LNA for several years yet it has always been a dream of mine to become a RN. Long story short, I am now attending an Ivy League nursing program and working my A** off for that title! Mind you, I am 30 years old so being a non-traditional student has its own challenges. 

Several months ago I was having a conversation with a woman who is a retired nurse practitioner. We were discussing how I felt going into my semester. I responded with ""Yeah, I feel great. Ive been an LNA for a long time, so, ya know, I've already got that nursing experience."" She responded sharply with ""Well, an LNA is NOT a nurse."" and I have to tell you, that statement really hurt my feelings. 

Now, several months later and I am finishing up my sophmore year in just one week. It is incredible the amount of knowledge I have gained this year. However, I have a highschool friend from my tiny midwestern home town who has never left city limits. She is a mother of three, in an awful relationship, and works as a CNA in a pretty low-class nursing home. Every day on FB I see her posts about how her ""NURSING"" job is sooo hard, and how its ""Soo hard"" to love a ""NURSE because we work all the time, and how NURSING is soooo rewarding. I find this to be incredibly infuriating! How dare she get to call herself a nurse, when she is not?! I am working my tail off for this degree and my LNA training was a mere drop in the bucket from what im learning in school now. I feel that calling yourself a nurse shoud be an earned title. Am I wrong? 

Anyways, I wont go on. But I just find it interesting that my perspective has changed so drastically. Other RN's ,what do you  think about this? How does it make you feel? I would love both CNA and RN opinions!

323,"hey all

this is kinda urgent so I'll try to be as brief as I possibly can:

my gf and me (m) are in a long distance relationship, have been dating for over half a year. We both haven't felt very good with eachother over the past few months. she has been telling me what ""kind of"" partner she wants and needs, how she wants me to become that person (be more active, assertive, etc etc). eventhough that feels like a slap in the face every time she does that, we are still together. however, everything is getting to a point now, where I just want to escape from it.

there is going to be a big family gathering in a few weeks and she wants me to come. I on the other hand do not feel like going because I honestly think that we are not going to make it as a couple until then - it simply does not feel like I belong there, eventhough her family is very warm towards me.

what you need to know: my gf works in a field where she needs to be very empathetic as she communicates a lot with other people. we just got in a huge fight over this because I expressed that I am unsure about this entire thing, after her asking me if I am coming right before she was supposed to leave for work. it's like she is setting up traps for me, where I have to say ""yes"" in order not to upset her. and if I want to go back on my lie she says that I am not allowed to since I promised it, eventhough I only did it to give her peace of mind. she has told me before also that she's suicidal so I am very concerned about her and what she is going to do if I say that I want to break up. she says that I am going to embarass her if I don't come since she's already told ""everybody"" how I am coming. but honestly.. I don't wanna go if I feel like we are going to break up a few weeks after.

she has now basically given me a deadline until like 30 minutes from now. if I cannot commit to going, she will block me off everything and hate me for the rest of her life. she said that I need to grow up and become a man. and I honestly want to get out and heal from this entire thing.. but at the same time I am just afraid to upset her now in between work, I don't know what she's going to do.

I don't know what to do. I honestly don't know what to do, please can someone give me a good advice how to handle this situation?",17Apr2018,1
324,"Or at least, on the same level as I do to her.

I have a friend who has told me that she is very awkward person and that she think people notices it. She is very polite and when we hang out in person with mutual friends (though rarely -- probably once a year), she tends to talk primarily with me or with my other guy friend. In the past, we used to walk home together with her sister from high school and she talked to me a lot when we were in assemblies. 

However, since high school, a year passed and I reconnected with her in May of 2017 via text. Her textng style makes it seem like she's always serious and uninterested. I got the vibe that she didn't like talking with me until I talked with her sister, and she said that she likes the conversations I had with her because she tells to me all the time. For closure, I asked if I was botehring her and she said no, so I continued.

Then I got severly depressed and told her too much information about myself. I told her I liked her, that I was depressed, asked the about why she rejected me, and told her about my suicide attempt, all in the span of two months. I put all of the blame of myself and apologized and stopped talking to her about my depression after the end of two months. However, I continued to her because I consider her an actual friend, considering that she was there when I was in distress and she gave me advice and comforted me when I had no one to talk to.

As time went on, we began to talk more, mainly about our mutual interests and life. She began to tell me about her personal life -- her troubled childhood, her current family situation/issues, and the drama at her old high school. She told me about her own interests separated from our mutual interests and her life in college. She began to become very nice to me: wished me good luck in school or to have a good night, or day in class. She doesn't ghost me anymore like how she was in the beginning after I finished talking to her about my depression, and usually comes back to me when she's busy with something and sometimes even apologizes. She also likes the idea of hanging out with me in the summer and binging a series together.

However, she has problems too. Despite being socially awkward, she never initiates text conversations with me. And I realize that if I start talking about my own interests, she doesn't seem to even talk to me or show interest in it. When she's talking about herself, it's in paragraphs and when I talk about myself, it may be one word or phrase. She rarely asks how I'm doing and sometimes continues talking about herself even if I say something. I honestly feel like she won't initiate for anything, even if it was my birthday, I feel like she wouldn't text me just a simple ""Happy birthday"". There are times where when my tone is thoughtful and sincere, she's dry and when my tone is dry, she sounds sincere and thoughtful. She tells me all about how her roommate and floor advisor are some of the best individuals she's ever met in her life yet I feel like she'll never say that about me. I don't know if she has an indifference towards me but it's starting to make me mad.

I see glimpses though. Like she found my comic interest interesting, and she said that she was glad she went to that crazy high school with me.

I've known her for four years, three years as a mutual friend and a year as an interpersonal friend.

Is my friend my friend? I'm confused and frustrated right now.

325,"For a first date, do something interactive like rock-climbing or bowling, where you can show her how to do it, with some physical touch
 Re: tackling resistance or rejection...playful teasing, like ""ooh, sassy!' or 'feisty! I like it, goes a long way, and can prolong an interaction.
 If a chick says she has a bf or husband, ask her playfully ""why don't you upgrade to a real man?"" or say ""what he doesn't know won't hurt him"".
 (Many taken chicks are happy to get some on-the-side)
 Start 'kino-escalation' early in the first date, so touch doesn't feel awkward or forced later on. Always try to get her back your place or her's ASAP.
 Be dominant. Make simple commands like ""come, let's sit over here"" and move her around the venue. Make small compliance requests throughout the date.
 Use 'false time constraints' like ""I'm only in town for the weekend"" or ""my schedule is booked up for the next month"" to compel her to put out quicker.
 If you're having a conversational coffee date, don't let it end; take her for a walk on the beach or another 'adventure' afterwards.
 Keep the conversation about her, and let her do most of the sharing. 
 Have activities on-hand at your pad to keep her entertained and provide an excuse to go back there. Have some booze and weed to loosen you both up.
 Speak in a deep, sexy voice. Mind your body language (i.e. take up a lot of space, move slowly and confidently, etc.)
 Be impeccibly-groomed and dressed. 
 It helps to be seen with other men and women as 'social proof' (i.e. preselection and popularity)
 Make your move early on. Kiss her and escalate to sex within 30 min. of reaching your pad.
 There's much more to it, but these pointers should help.

 IMO some of the best places to pick up are karaoke bars (ask a chick to sing a duet with you to establish a connection), AA meetings (they're emotionally-vulnerable and people exchange #'s freely here), and raves/festivals (exchange candy bracelets, socialize in the smoke pit, many are high on Molly and dtf)

 -Play hard-to-get. Do not try to impress; otherwise you will look try-hard and convey lower value than her. 
 -Make transitions smoothly 
 -create an 'emotional bubble' for the two of you (establish some common ground, and make it feel like it's you guys against the world')
 -Chicks often say they're looking for a partner-in-crime; tell her ""let's go shoplifting at WalMart! It'll be fun ;) If I like you, we can graduate to robbing liquor stores!""
 -Give her a massage as soon as she sits down on your couch

 -'Peacocking' works to an extent; have items like a pendant that have a story behind them; visible tattoos can also be used
 -Get her invested in you by asking HER to buy YOU a drink
 -Bring out her sexual side by 'chase-framing' (eg. ""hands off the merchandise; excuse me, my eyes are up here, Miss!; Sorry, I don't put out that easy!""
 -Get her to qualify herself to you (eg. You seem pretty rad, but I normally go for X type of girls)

 -playing the guitar, or effortlessly showcasing talent gets them wet
 -When you reach coitus, take her from behind and be rough (i.e. lightly pull hair, scratch her back, spank her ass, and put your hands around her neck, lightly squeezing)
 -After sex, lie together intimately for 20 min or so, so she doesn't start asking ""so is that all you wanted from me; make her something to eat, then politely excuse yourself so things don't start to go downhill or get awkward

 That's all I have for now. Experienced players feel free to challenge or contribute.",17Apr2018,0
326,"So my fiancé and I (we've been together for a little over two years now) are closing on a house in a few days, and we couldn't be more excited. We live in Alabama, where the homophobes opted for eliminating marriage licenses altogether to avoid having to marry gays. Pretty embarrassing for our state. Annnnyways, we decided that since we are both financially stable and will already own a home together, that we could go ahead and file the affidavit that says we are married. We had been planning a November wedding, and I already bought my NON-refundable dream dress. Naturally, we decided we could ""get married"" in a few weeks and still have the wedding in November so that we can celebrate with friends and family (and so everyone can see me in my gorgeous dress, selfish I know). Now I'm getting worried, though. I'm afraid already being married will cheapen the festivities, like the bachelorette party or the first kiss as husband and wife after we read our vows, and make it feel less special since we will have already been married for about 6 months. Has anyone been in this situation before? Should we wait until November or just go ahead and take the plunge? I'm stuck and don't know what to do, and my fiancé says he doesn't care either way.

He feeds this dog about 16oz of food a day. You can tell the poor thing is malnourished, his paws are disproportionate to his body size and you can literally feel every bone in his body. He has no fat on him, anywhere.


On top of this, he has literally NEVER BATHED his dog, ever. He only uses dry shampoo/conditioner and light brushing monthly. You can smell the dog from 5 feet away, he is grimy as fuck, and keeps getting ear and skin infections, about biweekly. 


Myself and My other 2 roommates gave the dog a bath 2 months ago, because he smelled like someone took a shit on him after VI took him for a hike. VI left the day after the hike for home, which is out of state, for a week and left his stinky animal for us to deal with. Naturally when he found out that we bathed him, he got all butthurt and defensive. Despite that it needed to be done ASAP.


We've tried having normal, logical, civilized conversations about this to no avail. VI is moving out in a few months, I'm kinda concerned about this doggo's well-being in the long term.

338,"The long and short of it is this:

I've been with my fiance for 7 years \(since high school\), and we've been engaged since Christmas 2016. We were going to get married in 2020, but I kept having doubts about if we were working, over and over again, and two weeks ago I realized that I just don't love him anymore and haven't for a while, but was subconsciously forcing it for his sake. Old me sacrificed her happiness for others around her, but now thanks to therapy I'm working on making myself happy too.

And that means leaving him. My therapist and my friends all agree that this sounds like the right option right now based on the limited information I've given them.

BUT of course I had this revelation literally a month after we signed our new, expensive lease for our nice apartment. Neither of us can afford it on our own, nor could we individually afford two rents if we broke it and had to rent separately. At least I don't think we could. We'd probably have to ask our respective parents for help and that would be both awkward and uncomfortable.

As an added bonus we are still in the process of moving our stuff into the new apartment \(our old lease is up in 2 weeks\). I've known for 2 weeks now that I want to leave him after this new lease is up...but I'm getting impatient.

It would be more fair to him emotionally to leave now, but it would be more fair to both of us financially for me to leave next year. The most sensible thing would be to take the second bedroom/office and use that as a real bedroom for one of us, and let the other take the existing bedroom, but I don't think fiance would be able to handle living with me in this kind of situation. He still loves me very much. Also if I leave him now I'm worried he'll beg me to give him more time to fix things, because he's promised to be better at the new house without the human garbage disposal roommate we had before. But I still just...don't love him anymore and don't feel anything for him anymore. 

What should I do? Should I leave well enough alone until it's logical to leave? Should I tell him now? Wat do?

I still love him loads but feel we don't really click sometimes.It's a very head vs heart matter.

One minute I'll be planning to break up with him, the next I'll be crying at the thought of leaving him. Just after I started to have these thoughts a new guy at work joined. We get on super well. We are always laughing and trying to spend more time together (going on tills that are near etc.). I gave him a lift home and he added me on snap chat. He asked to call me, saying that he's had a really bad day and needs to vent. So we talk for a while having a good laugh and then he casually mentions that he really likes this girl at his school. I was pretty devastated but played it off as if nothing happened. We continued talking and then he says ""oh shit sorry (the girl he likes) is calling I better answer this!"" so we say goodbye and now I'm here.

I don't know why it has affected me so much. I feel sad and also so so guilty about it because I'm still with my boyfriend. I know I'm a terrible person. 


I still love my boyfriend so much and can't believe I've done this to him. For the record, he doesn't know about my crush.

We ""broke up"" for a day a couple weeks ago and I was so unbelievable upset I rang him and we got back together. I know I'm being so harsh on him but I can't seem to regulate my true feelings of our relationship. It's unfair for him to have to keep going through my hot and cold phases but honestly, I don't think I can cope if we break up. I truly love him with all my heart. 



My head is a constant mess and he is such good guy I have no clue why I'm doing this. My mum suggested it could be because I'm going off to uni soon and I am a very pessimistic person. She says she thinks I'm trying to break it off before I get hurt. I am very emotionally guarded and that's why I'm so shocked at how strong my feelings are for my boyfriend. I dated someone else for 8 months and barely cried once when we broke up. Please, someone, help as I have no clue what to do.

If I notice someone isn’t getting it I try to explain again (usually pisses SO off, friends are more receptive but I can tell I’ve lost them after a while) in a different way, or in a way that might make more sense to them as an individual, etc. but it usually doesn’t work especially with complicated/emotionally involved stuff. I can explain more or give more examples if you ask.

What am I doing wrong or what can I do to improve? Or how can I tell what I'm doing wrong? It’s really wearing on me because I feel so misunderstood (I realize everyone feels this way, but I feel like I never ever have people interpret right, even people closest to me). Potentially related if it helps-people think I’m aggressive a lot when I feel very calm, I’m just expressing my opinion. Please help :(",17Apr2018,1
345,"I slipped on ice and fell onto my lower back/ right hip/ pelvic bone. I was immediately in excruciating pain and called for an ambulance. X-rays were done, and thankfully nothing is broken. I do not have any neurological symptoms of a spinal injury, such as incontinence. 

Over all this seems like it is a minor injury, but it is very painful and I've been laying on my couch for about 5 days. I can move around a bit more now, and am finally able to use the bathroom without help. I can't help but be fearful of the idea that this will lead to some kind of chronic pain. 

I've just been taking an over the counter muscle relaxant, and Advil. The majority of the pain seems to be muscle, which I'm fairly confident will heal, but I have a deep sharp pain in my lower back/ almost butt cheek area. It's triggered by certain movements and sometimes from walking. I'm moving very slowly and basically just walking from my couch to my toilet at this point. I'm worried this is my hip joint, and scared that I will be in this pain for longer than I can handle. I know it's only been 5 days, but I am feeling very anxious and scared.

346,"I will start of by saying that by attack I don't mean that he hit me, but it was verbal and his whole behavior. Also, I don't live in the US or Western Europe, so some legal advice might not apply.

Anyway, I went to a used cars dealer to buy a car in a town roughly 1 hour away from where I live. It was my first time checking out a car, I had a mechanic\-friend with me. We were talking about the car for an hour, there were some issues we weren't made aware of initially, but he lowered the price and so I and the dealer went to the local bank, so that I can withdraw money and pay for the car \(he drove me \- he insisted that he'd take me there\). Unfortunately, my bank in this specific town closes 1 hour sooner than in most others \(small town\), which I wasn't aware of, so it was already closed and I told him I'd come tomorrow. At that point, he started super heavily pushing me to give him some money upfront, or he's not gonna sell the car to me tomorrow. No reason, he just said he doesn't like that and started getting verbally insulting towards me. I was kinda shocked at this and grew suspicious, so I refused and said that if he doesn't want to sell it to me anymore the next day, then I'm not taking it. At this point \(we were at the way back from the bank\) he threw me out of the car, called me names and drove off with my hoodie still inside his car. I called him immediately that I want my hoodie back, but he refused and hang up on me. I was super shocked and called my friend to pick me up.

My friend convinced me to go take my hoodie back, but the sales guy \(he owns the cars dealership\) was nowhere to be found. I asked his employees when he's coming, but they kept telling me different times. In the meantime, the guy didn't pick up my calls or respond to my messages. So I called the cops.

You see, where I live, cops are somewhat corrupt. You can pay off a cop to look the other way if you're trying to register a car you shouldn't be able to, or if you were driving over the speed limit and such. And it's quite common that these shady car dealers know the cops and they're ""friends"".

Anyway, the cops arrived and 30 seconds after them, the guy arrived. He brought 2 goons with him. The guy mocked me in front of the cops, called me names, claimed that he had agreed that he'd bring my hoodie and started mocking me. He told me to take the hoodie out of his car, but as I was coming near to it, he started shouting not to touch his property. After that, one of the goons came up to me, in front of the cops and stared at me and started asking what I want and such. Meanwhile, the cars dealer was laughing and talking to some friends. The cop said that he isn't allowed to express his opinions on car dealers, but that he'd look somewhere else... implying that there's something wrong with this person. They stayed until we left to make sure a fight won't break out.

On the way back, me and my friend started realizing that some info he gave us about the car didn't add up at all and that it might have been stolen, or that he was just a huge liar.

I'm pretty happy to have my hoodie back \(was my favorite and they don't make them anymore afaik\) and that I was assertive, but damn, what a psycho. I struggled a lot with general anxiety, depression and such and I'm quite emotionally sensitive to these things. I don't think the police is something to put trust into here. I'm scared of some kind of revenge or aggression from the guy. He has my phone number and knows the town I live in. And he apparently lied, called goons to his aid when he knew I came for my hoodie, threw me out of his car if he can't get his way RIGHT NOW, called me names \(i never said anything insulting back\) \- just a psycho.

What do I do? How do I feel safe again and calm down? I'm just really shocked at how some people act and how they treat other people. My friend has been buying and selling used cars for a solid 15 years and he told me he never saw anything like this before.",17Apr2018,1
347,"So, a little bit of backstory; when I was 18 I had a really bad car accident coming back at from my first date. I sustained a C4 spinal cord injury and peripheral nerve damage preventing me from using my left arm. I was still in high school, but I had all my required credits so I was still able to graduate. Balancing rehab and school proved to be too difficult for me, so I lost what academic scholarships I had. My parents aren't an option, they've told me they ""didn't care if I got an education"" verbatim. I wasn't surprised though, they had kicked me out only 10 days before my car accident happened. We've never had a good relationship. I've tried getting a job but the wheelchair makes it so I never get past the interview. I even got trained as a PC repair technician (just a CompTIA A+ cert. nothing fancy) with the promise of a job at a company that is known for hiring the disabled, but they retracted their offer when I told them I might not be able to reach their required typing speed. Now at 24, I'm finally eligible for federal aid, but because I'm half a mile out out-of-district the community college charges an extra $100 per credit hour. So the federal aid is not enough to cover expenses given that I only have social security income. At this point I don't consider student loans an option though, at least not for undergrad schooling. From what I've read and heard from other people, I decided that student loans are an absolutely Last Resort. I live in Michigan so I get a LOT of help from my auto insurance but this is something they have said they would not cover. The amount of time I've spent devoted to scholarships cumulatively allows me to say I've spent over a week looking and applying for scholarships with no positive replies (I have no idea why people say it's so easy). It would be super easy for me to just become a drunk and still live comfortably. I want to make a contribution to society though. The world is full of awful people, so I don't want to give up and become one of them. There's got to be some way I haven't looked at this from. Any ideas?",17Apr2018,1
348,"Warning, my grammar is poor. Read with extreme caution. 

This all has to do with jobs. Some back story. I live about 30 minutes away from a town of 20,000 people. It’s the closest store, movie theatre and jobs. Etc.etc. Moving cannot be an answer for a couple more years 

My family and I have been here around 12 years.  I had my first job here and promoted pretty quick. I was a manager of a call center. After around 5 years the call center closed. Took about 2 months but I walked into an amazing job in retail sales. Small town, selling sell phones making amazing money. I worked there for about 5 years. That retail giant closed my local store. Once again without work. It took another couple months but I found a job working with a local retail place. Locally owned and operated. I was sought out by the Manager and they liked my experience in the industry. He quickly left the company after hiring me. I went 6 months without a boss. Finally out of the blue the new manager let me go after I had been there year. Losing my two other jobs of 5 plus years I had 90 days warning. This last one was entirely I expected. 

Now I don’t have a job and almost two months go by. I’ve filled out about 40 applications and had a few interviews. I finally get a second interview for “job x” I’ll call it. I interview with the main office instead of local place cause main office owns all smaller places now. They tell me Salary, position, commission and such and such. I have a last interview to meet local manager and we hit it off. She asked me if I understood Salary expectations. I told her corporate went over these. She immediately let me know that locally the salary is 10,000 less. I internally gasped and went on. She later emailed and made the office. With new lower salary and had added 5,000 to base. With the commissions I felt I had no choice to accept since I’ve not had money for two months now and was eaten through our small savings. 

I know this is a lot, sorry. Stay with me. 


I start the job and we do all the paperwork and it was around my third day. I get sent s commission report. The commission for my position has been 7,000 less per year than I was told. Of course I can grow this but it will take time. Once again I was told that the commission that was told to me was for a bigger office in a larger city. Not here. Then comes day 5. Insurance day. I look at the policy and almost gasp. It would be almost $900 for insurance for my family a month. Which with lower salary and lower commission I simply cannot afford. So I’m stuck. No health care. My kid is covered through local program but others are not. Now I’m still applying for a few jobs here and there but my resume is a mess. Being at one job only a year. Telling people I wasn’t fired for misconduct I was just let go cause I wasn’t a good fit. The few people who’ve reached out ask me since I was let go in January if I have any other work to report. So, I tell them I have a job but just can’t stay where I’m at. I feel that’s the reason I’m not getting any other interviews. I know it looks bad to be in a small town and be looking for something different after just starting somewhere. Just looking for advice or if someone could spruce up my resume. Someone to help me with guidance during this struggling time. Savings is gone. Just need a helpful hint or someone to send a smile my way.

356,"Hi, so I usually don’t come here for advice, but I need to get things off my head.  My issue here is that I have strong ambitions, but I don’t act on them.  You know the saying actions speak louder than words? I know that’s completely true but I still don’t apply it to my life.  I feel as if I’m all talk.  I’m in high school and I’ve been putting off getting my license for nearly 2 years, I’ve only practiced driving 3 times total in those two years.  I love cars, I want to drive, go places on my own time, get a job that I can drive to etc. People would say well, you haven’t been practicing because you simply don’t care about achieving your goal.  This isn’t the case, it’s all I think about. Another example is learning a language, I have been really wanting to learn a specific language for the past few years and I’m not even able to create sentences/ be conversational.  There’s many things I want to achieve and learn yet I don’t get anywhere. Every day I think about these things and I make myself feel more guilty each day that goes by.   I’m not a lazy person, I get other things done but for some reason the most important ones I want to and should complete aren’t prioritized.  Maybe since it’s been so long since I created these goals, they’ve become less important subconsciously?

360,"I've been best friends with this guy since college, he was like a brother to me. We were joined at the hip and even worked together at the same place over summer breaks. He was even my best man at my wedding. About 5 years ago I moved away for a job and in that time he's never once come to visit, or even asked me about my family. I have 2 kids now. It's like I don't exist except if he needs something, I'll get a random text if he's drunk or having a hard time dealing with something.

Recently he started planning a trip with some of our friends, he's very into the bro culture and having ""epic"" adventures. He's single and has never settled down even though he's in his mid 30's. Anyways, the way he went about planning this trip finally made me realize we're not really friends anymore. Like I mentioned, I moved away 5 years ago and I live about 700 miles from him now. He decides to plan a trip to a city that's only an hour away from me, I got an invite and I was excited to see all my friends and they were even flying into my city and renting cars. I sent my best friend a message telling him they were welcome to stay at my place for a night since their flights got in late.  I wasn't going to be able to meet up with them for a few days because I have to work so I thought it would be cool if they stayed at my house one night and then I'd drive up to meet them when I was off work. My house is right on the way but he declined.

He moved to the West coast for a short period of time and I made it a point to go out and visit him. I go back home to visit family twice a year and I always try to make time to catch up with him while I'm there his parents are basically my parents too. Maybe I took it way to personal but I thought it was really insulting that this was the first time in 5 years that he would be close to where I live and he wouldn't take the time to come visit. He wanted to get to their hotel as soon as possible so they could start partying. It just made me realize where I was on his priority list and I was starting to feel like he only wanted me to go to help pay for the hotel. When I found out he only wanted to party the whole time I backed out of going on the trip. I gave up drinking and I don't like to be around it.

363,"i'm a young woman who acquired two facial (burn) scars, right next to each other, about 1.5 years ago. they're right above my top lip, and are pretty noticeable imo. they have a different texture and color from the rest of my face. i don't have a lot of hope that they will improve, and actually think that they've gotten worse over the past year.

i feel really self-conscious and struggle with having them. i used to be quite social and had a lot of self-confidence, but now i struggle to even look people in the face. it's affected both my existing relationships and my ability to meet new people. It's also affected my willingness to go out; all i want to do is stay in my room.

looking at my reflection in mirrors is painful, but i constantly check my reflection anyway, trying to figure out if my scars have improved. i also constantly check my appearance in my phone camera as well. all this has done is send me into a spiral of obsession and misery. i often slip into periods of suicidal ideation because of my scars and other things going on in my life. i feel absolutely hideous and repulsive.

i'm wondering how other people, especially women, deal with having facial scars. did you know a clear difference in your life after getting one? did you become depressed? how do you cope? how do you maintain self-confidence and feel attractive, if you do? i know having a facial scar is not even close to the worst problems one can possibly have, but it makes me feel miserable. i do acknowledge that i'm lucky my scars aren't worse.

364,"I have a friend who I care a lot about, she was for a long time very understanding and very close to me, she trusted me [M] and I trusted her. We would go to each other with our problems via online messaging and talk a lot, for at least 5 hours a day. However even since originally she never seemed to be okay with talking to me in public. My friends including her would spend a lot of time together but despite my various attempts she always seemed to blockade herself away from me. This made it hurt, a lot, to see her in public ignoring me while acting like nothing was wrong online. As though she was embarrassed.

But then, she ended up in a relationship with one of my friends. By friend, they never were the type to help me or my other friends out, just come to us when he felt like it for some joking and wouldn't talk to us about anything personally. When this happened, I felt pretty bummed to say the least because in the 8 month prior I'd developed quite the feelings for her, and she knew about it and said she reciprocated these feelings. But suddenly this friend had come out of nowhere and within 2 weeks of knowing them started a relationship (this has progressed to being a serious relationship in the last month or so) but after spending the first few days of them being together feeling sorry for myself that ""life is unfair"" and so on. but when I eventually got over it and was asked what was wrong by my close [f]riend I told her why and she shouted at me. This really really hurt because it felt like I was being punished for having feelings. A few days later she returned and tried to act like nothing had happened, except now she just wanted me to help her with her problems.

Our friendship is no longer close. she speaks to me maybe twice every week when she feels slightly upset by something and never asks me how I am. Both her and her now partner seem to enjoy causing me to feel this.

I am a people pleaser, I find it very hard to deal with upsetting people especially when there's a choice of one or the other. And I can't stop myself but try again and again with her. I don't know why but I cannot keep my hands off trying to talk to her. And she just seems to be rude to me

My nicer friends have advised me to not try with her because she does nothing but hurt me anymore. I wish I could but I feel upset at the prospect of losing the one person in my life who trusted me and I could trust them with anything.

365,"Me and this guy are coworkers and we have a history together. Last year, he asked me out and we went on a date. He was a really nice guy and we had a lot in common and I was very much into the idea of dating him, but I eventually decided to call things off before things go too serious. The main reason I called things off was because of my mom. She wouldn't approve of him and if we were to date, she would simply treat him like shit. I couldn't stand to see such a nice guy treated so poorly. Simply put, I called things off with him because I didn't want to see him hurt by my mother.

It's been well over a year since I called things off with him. We still work together and for the most part, things are friendly between us, but still a little awkward. I would've thought that by now I would've moved on and simply see him as a friend, but I can't do it. I still really like him a lot and it hurts knowing that I can't date him.

I told my mom about this guy and she shot him down. She reminded me that I'm only to date within our race, (Chinese) but my dad on the other hand thinks that I should be allowed to date whoever I want, so long as I'm happy. It's just very hard for me because I love my mom and I care about my relationship with her, but I don't know how much longer I can take of her controlling me and not letting me pursue what makes me happy.

Secretly dating this guy wouldn't work out. My mom rarely lets me leave the house for anything outside of work and we as a family are constantly doing things together. I spend a lot of time with them and pulling a potential boyfriend into the mix would complicate things with him and my mom.

I'm 25 and I obviously believe that I should be able to date whoever I want, but I also care about my relationship with my mom. I've thought about moving out, but my mom has threatened to disown me if I move out before marriage. I don't want to tear apart the family and ruin things with my mom. Do I just try to move on from this guy and accept my life as is, or is there a better option for me?

I assumed it was just cause they got together, but upon walking into school one day, a friend yelled a hello to me and i said hello back, then he turned his head to the girl, he asked her ""are you still mad at him?"" This bothered me, so i texted her later in the day asking her if could talk to her saying it was important, which she ignored. After this, I texted her asking if i did anything to make her mad, in which she replied ""Im not mad"". After this, i referenced what I had overheard my friend say earlier in the day, and she just said ""Im not mad"" again. After this, she continued to ignore me and avoid me both online and in real life, while still talking to everyone else she used to before the relationship. Whenever other friends I have would ask her why she is ignoring me, she would not respond to them, so I decided to ask her in real life myself. Upon asking her, she just said ""I dont know"" in a cutesy smiley sort of way, and i replied by just saying ""Im done"" and walked away. A couple weeks later, a friend asked her privately why she is ignoring me, in which she replied that I did something. For some reason, she wont tell anyone what I did to make her ignore me like this.

374,"Sorry, this is a long one, but here we go:


Just an FYI: I’m confused/probably gay myself, so I probably won’t understand a lot about what’s gone on here and this is in no way biased by jealousy.


For ease, let’s call my friend Tom and the other boy Mark.

I’m not quite sure how to explain our relationship, but it’s basically an exclusive club where three people are chosen by the previous members every two years to ‘keep the line going’: we don’t really have a club leader except for Mark. Mark and another boy we’ll call Alex are two school years/grades above Tom, another (irrelevant) boy, and me.

In the beginning, I’d heard of Mark through a rumour my (already then-friend) Alex had spread about receiving oral sex from him. I now believe this to be true, although Mark denies it.

We were introduced to the club last year (Tom and I were recommended into the club by our other friend). All of us are reasonably good friends, but Mark seems to have a fractured relationship with Alex, likely because of the previous incident. As I was already friends with Alex, I didn’t take much notice of what Mark said about him to us (mostly that he was lazy and never did any work).

Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago. Mark jokingly flirted with everyone, but had seemed to take a particular interest in Tom; everyone noticed, and a lot of jokes were made. I had some suspicion about Mark, but these were confirmed when one day Tom showed me private messages that went somewhat like this:


&gt;Mark: Hey Tom, are you gay/bi?

&gt;Tom: Nope, don’t think so.     

&gt;Mark: Okay, well I’m bi.


I thought this was really odd, and sharing the story with Alex seemed to confirm my suspicion that Mark was interested in Tom. For a couple of weeks after that, I noticed that Mark had been frequently messaging Tom.


Here’s the weird bit.


We had a two-week spring break as usual, and yesterday we returned to school. The day seemed pretty normal, until I went to get morning break with Tom (alone). Suddenly, we had a conversation like this:


&gt;Tom: I was going to tell you something, but I’m not sure.

&gt;Me: You’ve told me you were going to say something now.

&gt;Tom: But... you won’t look at me the same way.

&gt;Me: I don’t care, just tell me.


Finally, he comes out with this:


&gt;Tom: Yesterday after school I blew Mark.


I was pretty shocked; he’s always been the innocent, naïve one, so I wasn’t quite sure how to answer. We continued our break normally.

The rest of the day, I had this weird feeling in my stomach. Something didn’t sit right. To be perfectly honest, I never really thought about any of us potentially having sexual encounters, so this really unnerved me. I’d considered the possibility of them doing that sort of thing before, but I never really thought it  would happen.

I suddenly started thinking of all the odd things Mark had been saying to Tom:

* He’d been advocating keeping secrets from parents (Tom is certainly attached to his parents)

* He’d told him that his first sexual encounter was at our age

* He regularly privately sent him selfies, often at the gym

* He’d told Tom about a ‘nudes circle’ that he had participated in

* He had completely turned Tom against Alex


I honestly don’t know what to do from here, or whether it’s really a problem at all. It’d honestly be so helpful to hear anything, I really don’t want my friend to get involved in anything he’s not ready for.

375,"Me and my fiancé have been together for awhile now and it’s great except when he drinks. When he drinks too much, he blacks out and messages dirty things to random girls. Last year, when I was pregnant, he went to his ex’s house one night after drinking and messaged her confessing his love to her. She messaged me and told me, and told me that he’s cheated me on a year prior to that. He finally recently admitted that he cheated on me with her twice. A couple of months ago, he messaged a girl I know saying he wishes she could do all these dirty things to him. And then the other night, he messaged one of his coworkers saying that he’s gonna get a hotel room with her so they can get drunk and have sex. What should I do? It’s a crappy situation since we have a kid together, and I don’t want him to have parents that are not together, but I don’t want him to have parents that aren’t faithful to each other(I’ve never cheated on him).

378,"Hello, I currently work at a job that I really like, but have recently encountered a problem. I work as a Pharmacy tech and as a Cashier. My store is currently going under new management because it's doing very bad sales wise.

On Friday (4/13) someone ""stole"" $100 from a drawer. The drawer was under a Coworkers name. Yet, I was using it mostly since it a very fast paced work environment and we don't have time to sign out and sign in. So we just trust that someone won't misuse our registers. 

I was aware about the situation on Friday because I stayed past closing to finish up work that I had, but when they counted the drawers it came up $100 short, so there he (my boss) was looking all around. I left shortly since I had to work the next morning. I'm not sure what happened after. 

Fast forward to Tuesday (4/17), I and the coworker are confronted by the higher ups individually.
During the ""meeting"" I realized I was prime suspect because I attended both the biggest transactions ($100 and $242) that day and the camera saw me there, but they are aimed at our backs not in front of is or even sideways. So, they can't see if we put money in the drawer of slip it in our pockets. Plus, I've only been there 9 months (the least amount of time than anyone else) 
So, who better would it have been ?

But I didn't take it. I have absolutely not reason to take it. I don't have a motive to... I get paid to go to school (I have a full ride to my university as well as a scholarship that ends up giving me close to $5,000 a semester). My dad gives me a 100$ a week. I get paid 600-800$ biweekly. That's more than enough money for a college student who isn't paying for school nor bills, etc. (I live with my parents) 
I'm honestly very afraid of losing my job. As well as the fact this will probably go on my record and I probably will have a hard time working for the government at all. (I want to become a detective. This is only a job to help save money since it pays really good.) 

How do I clear my name or how would you go about it? I also believe that no one stole the money. It might just fallen etc. Or so I believe. My co-workers are cool and seem very trustworthy. 

I need advice please. Thank you I'm advance!

383,"Context

I was raised to be nonconfrontational. Since as far as I could remember my parents would always tell me not to get into fights, arguments etc. Usually if something goes wrong my mom would want to handle it for me. When I was younger I thought ""Okay whatever"" but as I got older (16 now) I want to do more things for myself. This is highschool and your parents can't be doing everything for you. I've learned that you need to handle your own self in highschool and that no one will do it for you PRETTY quickly in my freshmen year.

So here's what happened today: I was writing notes on the board, and someone stood in front of the board blocking me. I called his name about 4 times and before he turned around and said what. I told him ""Can you scoot over please?"" I did this to be nice. I didn't want to say ""move"" or ""get out the way"" or something, so that was as polite as I could make it sound in my mind. He said ""When I'm done"" and this got me mad. I tried calling the teacher but the teacher kind of ignored me. He most likely didn't hear me because I have a very deep voice.

Someone called my name and said ""If you want him to move over, you gotta say ""yo move over [N-word]"" but I didn't want to do that so I just waited until he was done.

I felt like such a coward and I wanted to do something about it. I felt so bad and angry at myself for not doing something.

Also I should probably mention that he might be stronger than me. Son brings literally a gallon of water to school everyday to drink, he takes a weights class, and consumes a lot of protein powder. He's very skinny but somewhat muscular. I too am pretty strong but I'm still a coward.

So now that you know the context of the situation and where I stand, how do you become more assertive and not be a pushover, despite the fact that you don't want to start a fight?

384,"Short description. I went into a big company (Ernst &amp; Young - for those curious) pretty much straight out of university. Into a job role I wasn't too sure about from the beginning working in a job which I've never been 100% commited to.

Problem is the job is client faced and here in Germany the client comes first. Then the internal company managers and then if your lucky you get a chance to enjoy evenings / weekend.

Being 24 I know it's a little bit silly to ask this. But with the economy and people always mentioning how hard it is to get a job. I'm just not sure quitting and just doing self discovery would be worth it. And I know my parents aren't ever going to be ones to approve (they did sort of push this job onto me).

387,"When I asked this question, it's mainly because it's happening to my friends. The story goes like this : it's my friend's birthday on the last day of April, and she invited us to go to a water park. She helped get us tickets but only had 10 including for herself. It just so happens that we have a seemingly large group of friends (maybe around 15 or more), and she obviously can't invite everyone, and not all of them always sit with us at the table. So this group she invites is what I call the 'regulars', which means the people that always sit most often at the lunch table together. There's only one guy (lets call him C)who isn't a regular, but he still got invited because we're kinda close with him (also cause he would throw a big fit if he wasn't invited). 

As it turns out, one of the girls at our table wasn't invited a) because there was a limited amount of tickets and b) she recently went to the same water park not long ago. Maybe my friend forgot to invite her and by that time it was too late, but that girl (lets call her L) wasn't invited. So C is quite a big mouthed person, and doesn't exactly know when to shut up, so he tells L at break that this group of us is going to the water park for our friend's birthday. L shows a slightly slumped face after he said that. To add insult to the injury, another guy tried stopping C but he may have ended up hurting L's feelings even more. 

So some back story on L. She's kinda emotional in some ways, and always gets emotionally affected whenever something happens. But she also has another group of friends that she's apparently closer to than us, so she hangs out with them more. After she heard she started being sulky with us and was even ignoring the birthday friend. So right now my friend feels extremely guilty about the situation even though we helped cleared it with both of them a little, but my friend still feel extremely guilty. My friend and I also feel guilty for bringing it up by telling them to stop spreading around that we're going out( as it might make others feel even more left out). The thing is, L constantly does the same thing to us, but we don't have that kind of reaction, like begin sulky or some what petty. I understand that she feels hurt but she does the same thing to her own friends?
 Right now we feel extremely guilty that our friend's birthday is somehow ruined because of this one single thing.  

Is there any advice on how to handle this? I don't want my friend to remain guilty and hurt.",17Apr2018,2

392,"Okay so me and FF are still in Arizona and are still in Flagstaff. We have done some amazing things (honestly my favorite was promposing to her because I'm going to take the girl I love to prom). We went to this amazing obstacle course and we have seen so many movies. All of which is to try and take her mind away from her current events.

So last night I fell asleep and FF was watching Tv on the pullout bed.

( She insisted that I get the bed since I am her guest an has chosen to use the pullout bed. I tried to get her to take the bed even at one point moving her to the bed when she fell asleep. She woke up instantly and just called me stubborn. 

Now it's just like a game to see who will sleep on the pullout bed. I respect her space but we are staying in the same hotel room together so I can protect her. For instance I'll leave and good down to the lobby for a while so she can shower. And she will do the same. We are never unclothed at any point (although I do walk around shirtless but I did ask her permission as I don't usually sleep with a shirt on). She said that was fine since she knew I would never do any thing to her and she would like me to be comfortable. 

So I will always ask before I do anything if it is okay to do soemthing. Like if she is on the couch I'll ask if I can sit next to her. She says I'm being to polite when really I want to make sure I'm not making her uncomfortable. I know what she is going through and I can't stand the idea of me scaring or hurting her. So yeah I may come off as too polite but I can never see her cry, not like I had seen her the past 2 days.)

So anyways last night when I fell asleep a few hours later I heard her scream. I immediately jumped up to see if at was okay. She was having a night-terror different then a nightmare. I remember one of the reasons she sleeps very little is because she suffers from them. I'll sum up what a night terror is. A night terror is when an individual is suddenly awaken form sleep and are filled with a constant state of terror. Sometimes they remeber what happens other times they dont. 

I know your not suppose to wake a person when they are having a night terror so I just held her. She ended up calming down and wss mumbling under her breath. (I dont desrve you...thsnk you...I love you...Im so sorry) she wss also crying. I ended up sitting on the pullout bed with her (asleep) in my arms. I ended up telling her I loved her and I'll never let anything happen to her. I turned on the tv hoping it would keep me up because I didn't want to fall asleep with her.

But I ended up falling asleep. So when I woke up this morning I felt so guilty. I felt like I took advantage of her state of exhaustion. Nothing sexual happened but I feel like I should have done more to stay awake. I don't want her to not trust me anymore.

I kinda told her that she had a night terror last night and she apologised for waking me up and asked if she was any trouble. I said I comforted her and she ran up and hugged me. She said thank you in so sorry for evrything I'm putting you through. I really don't deserve your friendship. I let her know everything that happened and she said it was okay she didn't feel hurt or taken advantage of and kept apologising for her actions.

I just feel so bad because I feel like I did take advantage of her weak state. I didn't tell her about the I love you part because I don't want to freak her out. But I feel like that is keeping something from her. I don't want her to think I'm keeping secrets.

I just don't have the motivation to work hard in any of my subjects anymore. Last year, which was 9th, I ended up with a good GPA &gt;3.6 (Definitely had no C's or low B's in my classes), and I had the intent of getting 4.0's for the rest of the 3 years; however, my procrastination started to grow immensely without me realizing it. 1st semester of 10th grade rolled by, and I was doing far better than last year since I had A's in all my non-AP courses &amp; B+s in my AP's (took 3 AP's, 3 PreAP, and an On-Level). However, I never studied for the final exams and ended up failing one AP test, getting a 70 on the other; got A's on all my Pre-Ap tests though, and a B in Biology (I was busy playing Roblox, so I never studied). Basically, I could've done better if I actually worked hard; but I didn't. Then, after Winter Break ended, I stopped doing homework, stopped studying for unit tests, stopped caring about school, and also stopped caring about others. This didn't magically happen, it was building up gradually to the point where it became apparent. Started failing my quizzes and tests in PreAP and AP courses, and now I'm a low-B student; I don't even want to know what my GPA is anymore (C's in my APs and low B's in my PreAP courses).
 
Every morning, I always tell myself that I'll try my best at school, but I end up just not listening to the lectures, or even doing the assignments for homework. It's weird because a part of me makes me feel guilty and miserable, while the other side soothes me for the actions I've made thus far. To top off my shitty school grades, I have to study for the ACT/SAT next year for college admission; and oh boy, you guessed it, haven't even read a single page of any of my review books or taken any serious practice tests. Again, all this because I'm too depressed to even care about school and my future. 

Anyways, it's not like I never put in effort from the beginning, since I did excellent throughout middle school, but instead, it's like quitting a commitment you've made, halfway through, due to external/internal pressures.

396,"Me and this guy are coworkers and we have a history together. Last year, he asked me out and we went on a date. He was a really nice guy and we had a lot in common and I was very much into the idea of dating him, but I eventually decided to call things off before things go too serious. The main reason I called things off was because of my mom. She wouldn't approve of him and if we were to date, she would simply treat him like shit. I couldn't stand to see such a nice guy treated so poorly. Simply put, I called things off with him because I didn't want to see him hurt by my mother.

It's been well over a year since I called things off with him. We still work together and for the most part, things are friendly between us, but still a little awkward. I would've thought that by now I would've moved on and simply see him as a friend, but I can't do it. I still really like him a lot and it hurts knowing that I can't date him.

I told my mom about this guy and she shot him down. She reminded me that I'm only to date within our race, (Chinese) but my dad on the other hand thinks that I should be allowed to date whoever I want, so long as I'm happy. It's just very hard for me because I love my mom and I care about my relationship with her, but I don't know how much longer I can take of her controlling me and not letting me pursue what makes me happy.

Secretly dating this guy wouldn't work out. My mom rarely lets me leave the house for anything outside of work and we as a family are constantly doing things together. I spend a lot of time with them and pulling a potential boyfriend into the mix would complicate things with him and my mom.

I'm 25 and I obviously believe that I should be able to date whoever I want, but I also care about my relationship with my mom. I've thought about moving out, but my mom has threatened to disown me if I move out before marriage. I don't want to tear apart the family and ruin things with my mom. Do I just try to move on from this guy and accept my life as is, or is there a better option for me?

398,"**TL;DR at the bottom. Excuse the wall of text. Wherever you see '&amp;', it's a person**

The old saying goes *""Friends make good friends, but not roommates""*. Some shit like that, but I'm at my wits' end with a roommate of mine and what he's subjected me and my 3rd roommate to as a result of getting a puppy.

I live with two people my age; I'm 23, and they're about the same. I've been friends with one of them for the better part of 6-7 years; the other was a friend of a friend kind of deal.

The one I'm friends with - we'll call him &amp; - asked me and my roommate before moving in if it was okay if we got a puppy at some point. We agreed and said sure, no big deal. We moved into a 3/2 townhouse in September of last year on a Friday; 1st of the month. While visiting my girlfriend at work the very next day, I got a call saying ""We have a dog"" followed by him explaining he found a puppy and bought him. Keep in mind this is less than 24 hours after we had walked into the house for the first time. In short, we had a puppy pooping and peeing on our carpet before we even had furniture to call our own.

Since then, it has been a Homeric drama regarding the state of our home and his ""raising"" this animal:

- A hurricane hit our state last year shortly after we got the dog and it affected our house for all of 16 hours but he took him out on our back porch and let him go #1 and #2 out there ""you know dude, because of the storm"". That has turned into &amp; letting out his dog onto the patio **every single time it needs to poop**. The animal will not poop anywhere else, aside from on our carpet.

- &amp;'s work hours are slightly different than your typical 9-5; sometimes he works mornings, sometimes he works afternoons/evenings. So you can imagine how confused the dog became regarding a traditional schedule with respect to regular long walks, being taken to socialize with other animals, etc. Up until about a month ago, he would simply leave him in his room, unattended for hours each day, including days where he worked doubles. Given that he wasn't kenneled until recently, he would poop and pee in his room on his carpet and tear apart anything he could; and you can't really blame him. His room has been trashed for months including the carpet, crown-molding on the floor boards, and just the general atmosphere in the room, but he tells people who get a whiff or hear of the damage ""Oh yeah, the dog tore up my room the other day."" As of late, he leaves him in a kennel all day and I've come home numerous times to our upstairs hallway smelling like a rotting corpse due to his accidents - #1 and #2 - in his cage just festering in there. I have pictures with timestamps proving the conditions and dates despite his persistence that it's all recent.

- He started ""feeding him in his room"" around three months after we got him. I didn't care until I started to notice that the animal was simply not growing. His fur is getting plenty long and he sheds a healthy bit, but he's currently going on 10 or 11 months and he's a mixed breed of two breeds that get enormously large very quickly, yet he is still about a foot off the ground and maybe three feet in length and is skinny to the point where you can feel his spine, ribs, etc. Now he's not bone-thin or emaciated, but he just isn't growing. People on the outside have started to notice this, too. Aside from the fact that he never posts full pictures of the dog on social media, friends of mine have told me ""we've started to notice for his breed, he isn't getting very big."" &amp; simply attributes this to ""he's probably got another small breed in him"" but he just looks stumped. Which brings me to my next point...

- He doesn't socialize with other animals or go to dog parks. I've seen pictures of him at the beach once and with another dog once. My guess is that it's due to him not being updated on shots/veterinarian visits. Why else would &amp; hesitate to take him around other animals? He claims he would take him to doggy day care throughout the week a few months ago, but it didn't add up, as the dog was in his room all day whenever me and my other roommate would check/work from home. Along with shots, I've brought up a couple times getting him fixed, as &amp; mentioned it early on. He told me ""You do realize they have to be AT LEAST a year old before being fixed, right?!"" and I'm not sure if he takes me for an idiot, someone who never raised animals, or both but that just simply isn't true (if it is, someone please let me know with some literature/sourcing!) What I learned is that they can be fixed as soon as 8 weeks after birth and with the most conservative estimates saying you should wait until around 5-6 months, both of which have passed.

- Lastly is our living situation in general. Our townhouse is managed by a landlord, owned by an owner; the former of which lives in our city, the latter up North. At any rate, they are both *very* hands off: if they get the rent every month, they pretty much trust us to behave. They also know we got a dog. But what I think they **aren't** aware of is what that dog has subjected our house to given &amp;'s room, the back porch, etc. and at this point, I'm almost afraid of having him come out to assess the damages now so it doesn't worsen/exponentiate, but I feel like it's a must at this point as the situation has gone downhill very fast. There are a couple general wear-and-tear stains in the living room, but you can tell night and day which ones are puppy pee/poop and which are not and I made it violently evident in the beginning that it can be a house dog, but &amp; and &amp; alone is responsible for the animal at the end of the day. Hell, he even started telling us recently ""Don't go in my room, don't let him out or walk him; he needs to learn to be alone.""

&amp; is a very good friend of mine, but he's a very bad roommate. Aside from the dog, I've started fact-checking things he tells me about others; text messages, stories, etc. that 90% of the time just are downright lies. At this point, I'm more sad for the dog because his life has been ruined physically and mentally speaking for years to come, maybe forever. I'm simply at my wits' end and have no idea how to explosively or passively approach this situation. Do I anonymously tell the landlord and have him come out? What if that incriminates me as well? Do I approach &amp; directly and sternly? He's very manipulative and will just make himself out to be the victim. I just want to live in a house I can appreciate and for my roommate to stop pretending this behavior is normal.

**TL;DR - My roommate rushed into getting a puppy that has caused all kinds of problems to our house and my roommate is subjecting him to borderline animal cruelty at this point. What can I do and should I do it anonymously?**",17Apr2018,1
399,"Hello, Reddit 

   I have gotten really close to a coworker over the past couple of weeks. The first time we hung out was after I had just broken up with my boyfriend. He was there to give me advice and was really supportive of me. He also described his current situation with his own girlfriend. He caught his girlfriend cheating on him with one of his close friends through text message. She cheated on him on multiple occasions and she ended up passing on the Chlamydia she got from his friend onto him. They broke up a few weeks ago but stayed friends. However, today, several weeks after that happened to him, he tells me that he’s decided to give it another try with her. Morally, since I am a girl, I want to back off to avoid conflict ( I work two jobs, one with him and the other job with his ex). But, I also want to be there for him like how he was for me. Hes a sweet guy and I know when it all comes crashing down again, it’s gonna crush him...",17Apr2018,3

404,"I'm 26, female, have been diagnosed with Schizophrenia since 2013. Runs in the family. 

It's taken me an embarrassingly long time to get through community college, I've had to take multiple semesters off for hospitalizations and such due to suicide attempts and Schizophrenic episodes. 

Now I'm at the point where my Associate's degree is ONE class away. Math. And I'm struggling with it SO BAD. I can't focus, can't pass tests. Can't make sense of any of it, even with tutoring, not that I go to tutoring much because I'm so sedated and exhausted from class and medication I can't make myself go to tutoring after the class.

Should I just give up and try and find work? My degree is in Graphic &amp; Web design, don't need a degree for that anyway, it's more portfolio-based... 

I get SSI/Disability and live in a low-income apartment. I hate this. I don't know what kind of future I see for myself. Am I just going to live off of disability money for the rest of my life? I can't really work, any bit of stress gets me symptomatic and I get delusions and hallucinatoins that encourage delusions. I get very bad.

407,"Hey

So Im a college student and Im taking some classes that doesn't really have to do with my course, and the way the teacher decided to rate us is by making a project that consists of me and 3 more people doing, in every monday, a presentation of it, showing how we developed it week by week..

So this last week, me and my group weren't really into doing the weekly update, so we ended up pushing it to do it on a sunday night, literaly less than a day to the presentation, but in the end I had to do basicaly everything by myself, with only one other guy helping me out a little bit. I ended up finishing it by 2am, but I was more mad at them for not helping me than actualy tired..

Long story short, I decided to do a douchbag move and not go to the presentation the other day (I know it was wrong..), leaving them by thenselves to explain what they didnt even know about, cus they probably didnt read the update on the project that I made for that week.

Well, after the occurrence, they dont even look at my face.. and Im honestly feeling bad for what I did, realising that I took the wrong way to tell them how they were not helping at all on the project..

But I wanna make it up to them and show that Im actually sorry for what happened, but I dont know how to do it..

Soo any advice?",17Apr2018,1

I had my pro debut and I was doing absolutely great then I lost due to a mistake. Ever since then its been hard to get back fully like I used too, I went a year half no fight because I neglected it. had a fight in april 2017 then I drop out because I wasn't mentally ready ( was getting destroyed in training). I started working full time after my last loss as well so I just assumed its hard because of that ( was working part time as a bartender prior).  then few months later I injure myself at training and it took me out for 3-4 months and I am still dealing with it while trying to get back in it.  Part of me wants to quit but part of me wants to stay because I put so much into it.

411,"I honestly don't know how to handle it anymore.

For starters they refuse to take the blame for anything. If they break something, it's somehow your fault, if they are unhappy, it's your fault, etc.

They threaten to hurt me, tell me that I'm worthless, one time shoved me into something which bruised my leg, tell me that I wreck everything, that I'm useless, I must have an IQ of 2, have lied to me before, called me a bitch, retarded, an ass etc.

My mom made up this huge bs story about having high blood pressure yesterday. She said that she was at the pharmacy and decided to take her blood pressure, apparently it was so high she was recommended to go to the ER. I simply asked her why she didn't go and recommended she make a doctor's appointment to get it checked out. She responded by telling me that I give her high blood pressure and that I'm so insensitive and mean.

I called CPS but they really just messed things up worse and I emailed the police reporting the threats but they didn't respond.

I also have some health issues that are apparently my fault too. I'm starting to feel really suicidal. I don't know where to get support from. I just don't want to go through this anymore. I'll be 16 in 4 months so legally I can move out but I have no idea where to go.",17Apr2018,3
412,"I currently work for a hotel in the area as a front desk agent. I make decent money for my age (20/m, $13/hr) and the benefits in terms of travel are INSANE. I've just applied within the last 2 weeks for a supervisor position. They still have not interviewed me. I had it scheduled for Saturday but they got too busy and pushed it with no definitive time frame. Management says they're ""not in a rush"" to find a supervisor. 

Right after I applied I got a message from a competing hotel on LinkedIn. I doubt they have the same benefits, but they're offering a dollar an hour more, plus a chance at supervisor within 6 months (more pay again). 

Now, I LOVE my job. I would love to move into management and make a career out of this. I'm still in school and they're usually pretty good with my schedule, and they give me almost any time off I ask for. There's no guarantee the new company will accommodate me the way my current employer does. 

My plan was to just talk to management and say ""hey, I love my job and have no desire to leave. I've been made an offer and I just need to know whether or not it's realistic for me to stick around for a supervisor position"".

I'm 25F. I have a physical disability but havent been able to get on disability yet, but am waiting for my 6th application to (hopefully) be approved.

I graduated high school, but did not finish my college esthetics course as they kicked me out due to my health issues, so I cant practice esthetics and am in debt for a degree I never got, despite being at the top of my class.

I am currently making 0$. My SO is working retail, but that doesn't bring in enough money for us to even afford food most of the time. We essentially live on pasta, with an occasional ""splurge"" meal once per paycheck. (By splurge meal, I mean we bought fresh veggies for once and are making a homemade soup)

If/when I get disability I would like to go back to school but have no idea what to take. I'm generally a fast learner and can pick-up almost anything fairly quickly, but don't have anything specific in mind.

I dont speak to my family, so can't expect any help from them. We are living in my SO's parents basement, but they are getting tired of us not being able to pay our minimal rent. (And honestly Im tired of us not having our own space)

I'd saved up a decent chunk of money before coming down here and currently live off my savings, but as time rolls by I'm starting to feel like I'm wasting my life and realizing that I have no idea what I want to do.

I have a general idea of what needs to get done (I think?) but starting is just overwhelming me. Any advice on how/where to start to get this done? I have 6 weeks on my grandmothers condo.  I am currently uncertain about my parents closing date (likely not too far off that too?)",17Apr2018,1
427,"Just to preface, I've had depression and anxiety for over 10 years and everyone that knows me knows that I'm very reserved and don't talk much. The reason I am reserved and don't talk much is because of my anxiety and it is not just mentally difficult, but also physically difficult to speak. It is very difficult to think of things to say, and when I do try to say anything the words come out weak, so I've defaulted to barely talking. 

I haven't gotten treatment for any of my issues, but for the past month I've felt ""better"" and have actually been able to hold conversations relatively well with strangers. I don't really know what advice I'm asking for, but the problem is with family and acquaintances that I'm around often. I try to do the same thing with my family and friends, but it is just extremely uncomfortable. I find it uncomfortable because they've known me this way for years. They don't know that I have depression and anxiety issues, they just think that I only talk unless I absolutely have to (actual quote from a very close cousin as he introduced me to one of his friends). However, in truth, that is not who I am. I like to talk and have fun with people. There have only been 5 people that I've felt comfortable with no issues talking to, but I still don't divulge deep info about myself to them and they've all been online. The problem I have is that they've known me this way for so long that it would seem very strange and they would treat me differently or react weird to me actually being me (not that they would have a negative reaction, but just the initial shock).

I've rambled and I know that the obvious solution is therapy, but I'm just looking for advice to overcome that uncomfortable feeling. One thing I'm not going to do though is tell them about my depression and anxiety because that would solve nothing, and create even more uncomfortable tension and unwanted pity.
