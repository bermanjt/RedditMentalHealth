0,"So a very close friend of mine died suddenly about 9 months ago from a heart attack.  He and his wife had only been married for about 6 months at the time, but she was obviously completely devastated, as were the rest of our friends.  Since his passing, we have been staying in very close touch with her, even though we really didn't know her extremely well at the time of his passing; they had been together for roughly 2 years, but he had met her on a dating site, so none of our group of friends knew her prior to that.  In the first few months after his passing, she was a grieving mess as you can imagine, crying at the drop of a hat, and really letting it all out after she had a couple of drinks.  In the past couple of months, she seems to be doing better, at least from an outside appearance.  She has started a new job, enrolled in school to get her Master's, and appears ready to start a new chapter in her life.  Here's where it gets VERY complicated: I believe she has formed an attraction to me, even though she hasn't made any overt moves as of yet.  She frequently texts me to hang out, which she didn't do in the early days after his passing, and we were at a bar a week or so ago where I heard her tell another friend of hers ""I need to get laid.  Sorry, but it's been almost a year.  I just need to"".  I believe she said this purposely in my earshot.  This is problematic for me, if it's the case, for multiple reasons: 1) The guilt I would feel if I were to engage would be overwhelming, 2) Being with her would be a 24/7 reminder of my dead friend, 3) I believe that my other friends, even if they said they were ok with it, would think it's an extremely strange setup at best, and would think we're both engaging in a disgusting betrayal at worst.  The other possibility that I've been mulling over is that she isn't REALLY interested in me; she's interested in being with one of his best friends (I was the only one of his real close inner circle that wasn't married or in a relationship with someone else when he died, and that's still the case) because it would feel like she's always close to him in a way.  And if the day does come that she initiates something, I don't know what I can say or do to let her down without upsetting her; she's made a lot of progress since his death, but obviously she's still very fragile.  I don't want to contribute to any kind of negative spiral that could result.  ",18Jun2018,1
1,"I want to elaborate, as I know the title may sound a bit unsettling. It's not that I have sexual desires towards every girl I meet, but rather my brain finds itself asking ""is this who I'm actually meant to be with?""

A little background may also help. I grew up with what I found to be strange parents in a countryside far from cities. I was homeschooled there, and I didn't meet another person my age until I was 17 and took the ACT exam for college placement. Anyone that came to our house was about my parents' age.

Now that I've been in college for two and a half years, I'm finding all sorts of neat things (like Reddit which I've been loving! A site where I can learn anything about anything? It's brilliant!) that other people have told me about from their childhood, and tons of new music like Beyonce and Maroon 5 to add to my mental library of my parents' music like Van Halen and Styx. I've also been seeing a girl for about a year and a half now, because when we first met, I was struck by her elegance and intelligence.

However, now, as we realize we have increasingly little in common, I'm also finding myself talking to other girls, and afterwards wondering if she is the person I'm actually supposed to be with. This has always been a bit of a problem with me. At some point, unless I can fix this part of myself soon, I know I need to communicate this to my girlfriend, but I was wondering if this is normal for anybody else? I never really had friends as a part of my life growing up, and it's super exciting to meet people now. I'm wondering if it's my lack of friends growing up that makes me want to ""hold on and never let go"" to each person that walks into my life. Is it possible to just be friends with girls? If there is anything I need to rephrase or clarify on, please let me know and I will do my best to communicate what you need.",18Jun2018,1
2,"So I'm bipolar. I'm fed up of the health system where I am still thinking guys can't have mental health issues. They won't let me do CBT or try any meds where as my friend who's female has bipolar has a session every week and is on some kind of anti depressants and she's fine now. I'm getting worse to the point where I can go a whole week and not remember what I've done, my partner has started recording what I've done to tell me and I'm not okay.

4,"How do I fill that empty feeling that I feel after getting over someone? I’m happy I’m done with him, but now all my feelings, good and bad, have disappeared and left a gap that I have a need to fill. I’m worried that if I don’t figure it out, I’ll go back to liking him or like someone else when I’m not really ready for it. Summer is also starting so I don’t even have school to keep me busy.

I already told her that before but I guess she forgot.  Then she made stuff up, saying I quit the last two psychologists because they wanted me to start working too.  That's literally not even true and she made it up on the spot.  My pscyhologist cuts me off and doesn't focus on the issues I want help with.

I am a male and about two years ago i was in a long term relationship with a girl and long story short one night she held me down and forced me to have sex with her. Its been crossing my mind alot lately and it makes me feel super uncomfortable and somewhat gross to think about but i don't feel like everything in media shows i should, is there something wrong with me?  

Ive tried talking to friends about it but i just get told I'm bigger and stronger than her and i could have stopped it had i wanted to. I feel very confused about the whole situation and i don't know what to do.",18Jun2018,3
7,My boyfriend and I are recent college grads and we are trying to move to Colorado. Possibly boulder or Colorado Springs. We have both moved back home to save money for the next couple of months. We both currently live in Texas but we both want to move to Colorado for awhile. We are hoping to sublease and find jobs out there and I don’t think we will have a hard time finding jobs because we are both medical scribes. I’m wondering if anyone has any advice about moving ?

8,"I hate to write this because it makes it feel more real, but the truth is that my friendship with my friend of many many years feels lesser somehow. We're both in really different environments and we're changing into different people I think. He lives on the other side of the US, so I never see him, and whenever we do talk on the phone or just text, our conversations feel repeated. We glaze over the same things, and I know that doesn't officially mean it's the end, but having nothing to talk about or just speaking to one another when something is wrong, and not just for the hell of it, makes our interactions feel impersonal. For example they come to me with familial issues a lot, and I give the best advice I can give, so when they come back with the same thing I, one: feel like a rag doll that's only used for venting, and two: bored. Plus, sometimes they don't just vent, there are days we talk about other stuff but the interest of conversation is losing its spark. Maybe this is a character flaw on my part? Do I suck at being a friend? I'm not the most empathetic person, meanwhile they're very sentimental, so sometimes it's hard to care, I feel like I have to at times exaggerate myself or act which feels AWFUL because it's disingenuous. 

Is there any way I can revamp the friendship? Long distance might be the issue here but honestly I don't know. I was never conscious of these things before, probably because they didn't exist yet, but now I can't help it. Being isolated also doesn't help, part of me feels like I'm being dramatic but to me we're drifting and I genuinely don't know what to do. 

Am I reading this situation totally wrong? Maybe we're just going through our own rough times and that naturally creates (more) distance between us? I would do anything for this person, they mean a lot to me and they're all I have. Any advice or thoughts are appreciated.",18Jun2018,1

13,"So today me and my family went to the mall and I decided to go play Pokémon go in the library and all around but mostly stayed in the library. After a while I rejoined my parents where then my mom told me that she saw my gf with another guy into the theater. I didn’t want to jump to conclusions so I didn’t think much of it later on once we were going to leave my parents told me to go get the car and so a couple of loops around the parking lot led to me finding her Kia Forte I know that obviously someone else could have the same car but definitely not the same scratches and dents, and that’s when. I saw it the same scratch and two holes in her front bumper. A little backstory to this is that we took a one or two week break from each other and now we’re back together and although we don’t talk as much we still have gone on walks more than when we were dating before the break which I see as a good thing because it lets us learn more about each other and during last weekend I visited her house and got to meet more of her family and I asked if she had the time to go out this weekend. She said no because she was gonna be busy with family that was going to be in town and she was going to hangout with a friend this week she hadn’t seen in a while. Also I’ll add she’s said before sometimes she doesn’t want to go to places because she has no money.",18Jun2018,2

15,"let me prefix this by saying we work at a bar that is a cesspool for incestuous relationships so I'm not looking for any 'don't shit where you eat' advice!

So a few days ago we had a staff do where everyone got really drunk and celebrated the beginning of summer. I got *very* drunk and so my memories of it are all quite blurry, but I *do* remember a guy I've had quite minimal contact with at work coming up to me at least twice throughout the night and him saying some stuff I'm not quite sure what to make of. 

By minimal contact I mean we never have extended conversations (apart from at the last staff do where we had one drunken conversation about god-knows-what), but whenever we're on the same shift he never fails to say 'hi undenominational roe, how are you', and we might have a quick chat. 

Anyway, at this party he came up to me at various times (this is where my memory fails me and everything gets a bit blurry) and would sort of look down at his feet and say 'you're just so....'; struggle to find the word he was looking for; and then substitute in stuff like 'intriguing' and 'unlike anyone I've ever met'. I asked him at the time if those were compliments and he said they were.

We spent quite a lot of the rest of the night together, dancing and chatting, and i know we kissed a few times but both of us were absolutely off our tits. He complimented what i was wearing and my hair and we talked about a lot of stuff we had in common. Add to this the sort of confession-style approaches of earlier in the night and i think the only reason i could account for his behaviour in all this was that he wanted to kiss me. I like kissing and I'll kiss anyone who asks for it when I'm drunk, no big deal. 

In hindsight though, I'm paranoid that I misread what i thought of as signs he wanted something from me, and that actually he was just being nice. If someone said stuff like that to you would you assume they were trying for something? And should I send him a brief apology to smooth things over? Maybe just saying that I hope i didn't act too inappropriately and I'm sorry if anything we did made him uncomfortable? I don't have any social media and not lots of people have my number so I would have to do a little rummaging for his contact info. ",18Jun2018,2
16,"So I find myself in a bit of a strange situation. I have been in a long distance relationship with a girl for about 5 years now. We met when I studied abroad to her country 4 years ago. Since then, I have graduated and even moved to her country, although I could not be in the same area as her, so the LDR continues. The distance has been hard on us, so we opened the relationship about 2.5 years ago to seeing other people. Also I should note that we have travelled to see eachother about 2-3 times a year, so it's not like I never see this person. 

This girl is lovely. She never gets mad at me for anything, she always tries to be supportive, and she always tries out my hobbies like gaming or other things that she isn't really interested in that much.

Well, about 4 months ago, I met a girl who I started seeing kind of casually. I had been with about 12-15 people since we opened our relationship. This girl was quite different though, and I caught feelings hard and so has she. My girlfriend knows about her and that I have caught feelings, so I am not hiding anything from her. 

I am feeling lost now. I always thought that I would spend my life with LDR girl. We planned on having kids and getting married. If I asked her right now, I have no doubts that she would get married. The other girl is also really into me. She tells me that she hopes what we have never ends and she would like to make it long term. This girl that I met is really similar to me. She understands me more than anyone ever has before. LDR would often not understand me, but accept even if she didn't quite get why I would feel a certain way. The girl I have been seeing now just clicks with me. I feel like I should have always been with her. It also helps that we have the same hobbies and tastes to a T. We enjoy doing the same things together. With LDR girl, she would do her best to try out my hobbies, but it is obvious that she enjoyed herself, but doesn't really get it or would never do it without me including her. 

The biggest block for me however, the girl I am seeing has two young kids. It has always been my dream to have kids, and it's something I think about very often. The girl I have been with for 5 years would gladly have kids with me. The girl who I have been seeing already has two kids, but said she would consider having another child if the situation was right. I have met her kids before and they like me a lot, but even though I care for them, I will never be their dad. And if I did have a child with this girl, I would be afraid that her two kids would feel like we favored the kid we had together, which we would never do. 

One way or another, I need to make a decision because I hate the idea of leading anyone on. Summed up, There is the girl I am with who would do anything with me, and we would experience everything together for the first time. She would do absolutely anything for me and I could be happy with her I know. On the other hand, there is this girl I have been seeing for a few months who really understands me. We have the same interests and tendencies. Like we are both kind of messy and have the same humour. Something clicks with this girl that I have never experienced before. I am not sure what I should do.",18Jun2018,1

19,"i live across campus in an apartment. i never had a roommate before and when i go back to my college town in August it will be my first time having some roommates. i could have 1-4 roommates. it’s a random selection so it varies on my apartment complex’s decision. i have questions it may be stupid questions but i never had a roommate before so i’m clueless. 

1. my friends that have roommates complain about them always using their things. like food that they buy and their roommates always eat their food without asking. i’m paying for one person, myself. if i buy something like food and water bottles, it’s mine. but i’m afraid of putting my stuff in the fridge because they will eat my food. will roommates eat my food because it’s in the fridge or do they have common sense and not to touch someone’s food? 

2. payment. the utilities are split except in your individual bedrooms. i paid for everything at my single apartment of the things i used like electricity and water etc. i hardly use that much electricity and water in the main room (living room) where the utilities are split. i feel it’s unfair for me to pay for my roommates utilities in the main room because i hardly use it, my part of the utilities would probably be $5 and i’m barely at home and when i am i’m in my room. 

3. random roommate selection. i’m not a smoker and i’m not a dog person. (usually they have a roommate form you sign if you are ok with smoking and having a pet because these are big things if you are gonna live with someone) i’m afraid i get stuck with someone like this. because my friend has a roommate that smokes and she said in her form no smokers. can i file a complaint and get a new roommate, how does that work?

20,"To start off, I'm still in high school. My strongest skill right now is math, so a problem will usually take me 3-4 minutes and then I'm on to something new.

The problem arises in other subjects, namely English, where I'm working on one thing for a long period of time. I can get some decent ideas down in the first ten or so minutes, but after that I just get stuck. It feels like I have a limit of how much I can think before I just drift off and lose focus completely. 

It took me 4 tries just to write this post because I couldn't figure out how to say what I'm feeling, and even now it isn't perfect but it's the closest I can get.

It feels like I go into some kind of ""drifted off"" state, and whenever I realize this I can't get myself back on track. It isn't even fun, I just get pissed off at myself because I can't think straight and It feels like there's a wall between me and anything I want to do.

It even happens with things I enjoy like video games - I've been playing some very easy games like Super Mario Odyssey lately to see if I could get myself to focus on something, but whenever I have to do something that takes any more than 5 minutes I just stop.

It isn't me wanting to do something else or take a break, I just zone out and lose focus on everything except my thoughts. Usually I think about a song or some hypothetical conversation, but when I try and do whatever it is I'm thinking about, I come around in a full circle and get zoned out again.",18Jun2018,1

And it was the same bottle my dad has his “medical marijuana” in. I know have so many thoughts going through my mind, is my mom smoking now too? Does my dad actually have issues?

25,"I'm a 21 year old female &amp; I've been working my part-time job as a retail sales associate for just over 2 years. I absolutely love my job, coworkers and 4 of my 5 managers. All coworkers &amp; those managers are friendly, warm and nice to me and vice versa. 

One of those managers for some reason, likes to passive-aggressively make comments about me, and to me, and I seriously don't know how to respond or handle the comments. I like to think I'm a friendly person (everyone gets along with me and I'm told fairly frequently that I'm sweet), so i don't know what I've done to cause my manager to be like this towards me.

Here's a few examples of the things she's said to me (mind you, one of these was yesterday, and the other two were just today):

\*\*For context\*\* I missed a shift yesterday (first time EVER in the 2 years I've worked), and it was because of a miscommunication between me and a fellow coworker who I thought would be able to cover that shift for me, as I was not in town yesterday morning (when my shift was). When I didn't come in, my work called me and I apologized profusely for the mishap and told them I'll happily come in to make up for my mistake and help close the store.

1. I walked into my shift this morning following yesterday's mishap and I run into the rude manager and the first thing she says to me (in response to my friendly ""hey!"") was: ""Oh thanks for actually showing up today"". And honestly I was taken aback, i wasn't sure if she was just joking so I laughed in response and said ""haha no problem!""
2. Yesterday I had to also help my rude manager fill some boxers &amp; socks at the front of the store. So we brought the boxes over and I started putting the boxers on the racks. (\*90&amp;#37; of the time, from what I've seen, the boxers are NEVER hung and organized by colour/pattern, and are often assorted randomly). So i started randomly hanging them and my manager stops and says: ""WAIT what are you doing? Am i ACTUALLY seeing this right now? You just hung that boxer on the wrong rack, go back to Kindergarten. That's basic colour matching!"" I was again shocked and said ""haha oh my gosh, where's my brain today?"" She replies: ""I don't know, do you even have one?"". She said all of this while smiling so I didn't know if she was being serious or just joking. Either way I found it rude.
3. Today, I was up at cash for a moment where she was. She was talking to herself and saying ""where's the calculator?"". The calculator was actually just on the desk infront of her all along and when she finally saw it she said ""Oh wow, there it is haha. Look, I just pulled a You!"" (referring to me....does she mean to imply that I'm dumb/unaware?) I just again laughed at that b/c I wasn't sure what else to say.

This manager, according to my other coworkers, also has a passive aggressive vibe towards them too. I really don't know if I should say anything, or just keep letting it slide? I want to be able to say ""hey that was a bit rude"" very calmly/not in a rude way, but I hate confrontation. Especially with a manager.

26,"So about 5 days ago I was driving delivering pizzas. Out of nowhere I got extremely lightheaded, had to breathe heavily, my arms felt numb, and my heart started beating like crazy. It happened 2 days after, and then about 30 minutes ago.

I've never had an anxiety attack in my life. I had my oil pan gasket replaced recently, and the exhaust manifold had to be taken off in order to get the oil pan off. I'm taking my car in tomorrow to see if maybe it's loose, or if there's a leak. 

The thing is, this was done well over a month ago, and it's been happening whether the AC is on or off, and with all the windows down. I can't imagine even if I did have a leak that much carbon monoxide could make it into my cabin with plenty of air circulation as the windows are all down. There's no strange noise either.

After a lot of reading, and explaining to my girlfriend who has anxiety, it seems like out of nowhere, driving is triggering intense anxiety attacks, but a lot of the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning seem to be the same. 

Any advice would be very appreciated.",18Jun2018,2

29,"Hi, I'm Joe. I'm a 21 year old student studying IT in my first year. But I keep stumbling on a problem. I can barely get myself to study and when I do I just feel really shitty. I get tired, so I nap. I get sad, so I blame myself for not doing more work. I know it's a big word but it just seems like I get sort of depressed every time I do work for uni.

I do tasks like projects and presentations just fine but I can't get myself to study for my most important subjects. And it piles up and by the end of the semester I've got half of JavaScript or C# to learn left and it gets daunting. I already have lots of second attempts set for later in the summer from earlier in the year and at this point I'm just feeling like giving up for the next exam.

I don't know why this keeps happening, the it happened in highschool where I just lost all interest in the hard science I got and now again with the IT. I love creating stuff and would love to work in the field later. But I keep feeling like it's not my actual calling. But I don't know what is then. I don't feel passionate about anything that I can make a career out of as far as I know.

I have been told that I am a very intelligent guy and I do think I am. And since I am that way I had no trouble not doing anything up until my last year of high school. I don't know how to study and how to enjoy it and how to feel like I'm achieving anything, I just feel depressed because I'll fail because I can't get myself to study and learn. I don't know what to do at this point anymore. I need help with this because I want my future to be good. I want to finish this education and use the money I'd make from IT to maybe pay for another degree that I wanted first but turned out to be too expensive for my parents.

I like computers, I like programming, I like the people I get to work with. But I seem to hate studying and practicing and I just don't know how to fix this. Should I get a therapist to just talk to me and stuff? How do I get myself to stick to a study schedule I make for myself? How do I get myself to sit down and focus on studying without feeling like shit? How do I do this? I failed before and I don't want to do that again but I have no idea how I get there. Please help.

I might be rambling a bit at this point, I'm just tired and feeling a bit shitty in general and at this point I'm just desperate. Thank you for reading this though and thank you even more if you have any suggestions or ideas or even just some comforting or a sign that I'm really not the only one that struggles like this. I hope I hear something soon.",18Jun2018,1

31,"I've dated this girl 4 times in the past few weeks.

She is a very nice girl and she is also very attractive. Her personality is very down to earth.

She was upfront about what she wanted before we dated, which was a relationship.

I've never really had a relationship, so I was all down for it and thought it was time for me to settle.

Our dates have revolved around food/watching netflix at my place, but it got to a point where I realized that our interests were completely different. Different taste in music, different careers, etc. We enjoyed a few shows together.

We just did foreplay (kissing, HJs/BJs, eating her out etc) after the 2nd and 3rd date when she came back to my place, but she was never actually able to make me cum.

She even asked me after the 3rd date if I was still actually interested in her and I said yes because I thought time would give us that ""spark"" and make us fall in love (she is into me more so I am into her it seems like).

On the 4th date, we tried to have sex. The reason she didn't want to have sex before was because she is a virgin and she said it would be very painful (even putting a finger in hurt her).

We decided to attempt it with a condom, but she didn't even feel it go in because I went limp and it wasn't wet enough after foreplay.

We then tried lube, but this time I didn't use a condom (poor decision, I know) and put on a lot of lube on my penis and a bunch of lube on her vagina.

I could barely get it in within the first 10-15 seconds of trying until she said it hurt too much, at which point I stopped. My penis was also not fully hard and only the tip was able to penetrate.

She then proceeded to give me a handjob since there was so much lube on my penis already, but this time I closed my eyes and just thought of my favorite porn, which is what made me actually ejaculate for the first time from this girl (very sad, I know).

I don't get the butterflies when she leaves and I don't feel very much towards her. I've realized that I don't care for a relationship, the thought of having one seemed better than actually having one. I'd rather not have a relationship right now in my life with everything else that is going on.

I don't know what to do right now, she is a very nice girl and I know I will have to tell her asap to avoid wasting time and hurting her feelings even more.

I'm also worried about this potential pregnancy scare, even though I keep telling myself the chances are unlikely since I didn't even fully penetrate her and she has never made me come until after the last attempt to have PIV sex. Also, only the tip went in for a few seconds and I wasn't rock hard.

I'm also worried about the after effects of letting her go and then feeling crummy inside and missing her even though we never really clicked. Apart of me is thinking to give the relationship time, but if I don't really care for her that much right now, what makes me think I will over time?

I feel like a scumbag, she's a very nice girl who is just trying to find the right person to date and here I am, about to break her innocent heart.

It's literally tearing me apart and I'm not sure what to do. What shocks me is that I'm still not attracted to her and can't click with her even though she has a great personality and is attractive.

Any advice is much appreciated. Thank you.

**TLDR: I have been dating this girl for 4 dates, she wants a relationship, it's not clicking and I want to let her go in the least heartbreaking way possible. I also am scared I might have got her pregnant with unprotected sex with lots of lube that lasted less than 15 seconds with only the tip and some of my penis penetrated before she said it hurt (4th date). My penis was also not fully erect. Not sure how to handle this situation**",18Jun2018,1
32,"I went through a traumatic health experience and have suppressed so much emotion in order to survive that now I can’t bear to let any kind of true feelings in myself happen. I’m too scared to cry in case it utterly overwhelms me and I become dangerously depressed. I live in a kind of fake positive bubble. 

It’s affecting my relationships, it’s affecting my health - which is ironic because I am trying to get well! I already see several mental health professionals of the best quality and have been treating my conditions. 

I’m looking for similar stories to mine, and ways to gently delve into what has been suppressed in a careful way.

33,"Before I go into (excruciating) detail I would very much appreciate it if you shared your own story of you'd already gone through the process of leaving home. 

Now, a little bit of basic information. I'm a 21 year old female, originally from New York and livinf in Mexico and studying psychology. My father is what would be considered a toxic person. He has been an alcoholic long before I was born and since I can remember he has been emotionally and psychologically abusive. He has only got me a couple of times and not too harsh. With my mother however he has a tendency to be violent. He hardly hits her hard enough to leave bruises but he manhandles her. Because of his job we lived apart for 9 years. A visited and such but for the most part we only videocalled and talked on the phone. About a year ago he moved in with us, leaving his old job and starting his own business. In that year my mother, younger sister and I have left the house twice now because of his violent attitude. Violence is unacceptable but if I'm honest it was for the most part manageable but I never feel calm, I'm always incredibly nervous because I have no idea what can make him angry. He has also always been extremely controlling and overbearing, watching my every move.

Anyway, it's been about a week and a half that we left the house. My mom seemed to be convinced of finally leaving him but a few day ago he promised to change. Now, if I'm honest this time it really seems like the real deal. He's looking for help (religious). I'm not convinced of his change and I really don't plan on going back. Today we came over and had lunch with him and my mother and him basically told me to come back. My sister and I are still staying elsewhere. My mother spent the weekend with him because they went to some form of coaching together. Anyway, my mother is ready to move back in and my sister is going to be forced because she is still underage. My problem is that I don't want to move back in.

My alternative is moving in with my long term boyfriend and I know without a doubt that things with him will be fine. I know what it implies and the fact that we have to adjust to a completely different life but I feel ready. I'm sure of what I want. I want to move out but my parents have really made me feel guilty about it. I have no real guarantee of change and I can't see myself living here any longer. My heart is torn between my sister and mother (and her desire to be a whole family) and my own desire to be free and live a healthier, stress-free (at least less stressful) life. 

I would greatly appreciate any opinions or advice to help me know what is the better move from your own neutral point of view.",18Jun2018,2

I’m in school to eventually become a cardiothoracic surgeon, so you can imagine how stressful my life is right now. Working in a hospital, studying, and having a relationship is really hard and I couldn’t do all 3. 

Idk if it makes me a bad person for choosing my career and school over a person but I had to choose. I’m pretty sad, and we agreed to be friends because he’s one of my best friends so I know we are still going to see each other. We didn’t date that long so I’m capable of having him as a friend and not being upset about it, but right now I’m pretty sad that good people can come in your life but you can’t have them, life isn’t fair and it sucks and how do I get over this?

37,"I’m a 31(f) and he’s 31(m)... we have a beautiful son together and a little princess on the way! 

I’m sitting here contemplating our relationship! I know what I feel, and I also know what is right to do by our kids.

He’s not 100% invested in us. Never has been. With me or our son this far. He’s always been one foot in and one foot out. When he’s out, he “thrives” gets a job, works, gyms, eats, socialises and all of the above. 
When he’s in, he’s doesn’t work for months and can say years at a time, he’s lazy &amp; unmotivated, doesn’t help with bills and just stays indoors all day. 

I honestly don’t pick fights with him, I keep my mouth shut about him sleeping around when he’s single and not let it affect us in the now. His family hates me (bunch of enablers, and coz of it we clash) they believe that it’s my job to take care of him, cook, clean and raise our kids. I do it anyways, but if I ask him to do simple things, take the bins out or wash the dishes. He’s on his fb messaging his sisters calling me toxic and poison. Coz I’m having a go at him. Their response, leave her, you deserve better, she’s too hectic etc. it’s all hurtful. I’ve dealt with this for 10 years and honestly I know times up! I can’t take that shit anymore.

I have the normal fears of not doing it alone with my kids, but never finding someone who will be the healthy kind of love for me. I provide and take care of my household as it is. The house is under my name, the bills are all under my name and I pay for them all. So it’s not the financial side. 

My confidence is at 0. And my self esteem is low. The same month I fell pregnant, he was sleeping with a 19 year old girl. And was all over TRP &amp; MGTOW boasting about disrespecting me. 

I’m a good mum, I’m stable, financially stable and take good care of my kid and soon to be kids. It hasn’t been easy but I try to always make sure their needs are met. When we are seperated, he’s hardly ever around and gives next to nothing. He has bought our son clothes maybe 6 times in the last 8 years, and this is when we are together and not together.

What’s his is his, he will only pay half (when he works) and I pay everything in full and can never catch a break when he’s not working...

Am I being selfish for wanting to end things? I will always share care and always let him in the life of our kids, but he needs to meet me halfway. He lived with his Mum for the last 2 years and 4 months out of those 24 he worked and paid half rent to cover, food, cooking, cleaning etc. and he thinks it’s he same when we are together. This is how we are as a family unit... and I hate it! 

Advice? ",18Jun2018,2
38,"Hello guys. I will do my best to try and run you through the situation because I really need some advice for this one. 

So as you may know, it is Father’s Day. The problem is my dad and I don’t really have a relationship. We don’t really communicate much and he hasn’t quite been there for me growing up (I am 16 years old now).

He doesn’t actually know how to be a ‘dad’ and sometimes I question the choice he made when he decided to have me and my brother all these years ago. In my immediate family, it’s just me, my brother and my dad living together but we do not function like a family at all. We don’t talk, we don’t sit down at the table for dinner, and my dad is not home 85% of the time. He is either working or at his girlfriend’s house (Also note: me and my brother don’t have the greatest relationship with our dad’s girlfriend, this comes up very soon.) 

My dad has made 0 effort to have a relationship with me or my brother. On the other hand, neither have I or my brother made effort to have a relationship with our dad. However, if our dad did make efforts and wanted to spend time with both of us, sort of like a normal family, we would be open. 

Anyways, I bought him a gift for Father’s Day and gave it to him in the morning. Later in the day he says that the 3 of us (my brother, him, and me) could go out for lunch and with this information, I was happy to go and agreed to lunch, of course I would. Later in the day he texts me and says that his girlfriend is now coming. With me not having the best relationship with her, it kind of hurt me that my dad didn’t want to have lunch with just his kids. He always wants his girlfriend to come everywhere and I don’t know if I am in the wrong for being upset with this. 

With this sudden news and with me not being in the best mental state lately, I tell my dad that I am very sorry but I cannot come. He said that he is very disappointed in me and called me selfish. He said it is his day and that his girlfriend is apart of his life and that I always wreck things. With this said, I send him this text:

~We were supposed to celebrate, the 3 of us, because it is Father's Day. Me and *Brother’s name* are your kids and you are our Father. You told me that we are going out. With only this information, I said I am coming. I am happy to come. But you just sent me this text now. You didn't say anything about this before. Why not? I do feel selfish and I am sorry that with my state I cannot come now with this changed plan.~

Am I being immature? I come seeking advice because I want to know how to handle a situation like this properly. I feel awful that I cannot go to dinner with my dad as it is Father’s Day after all. How could I have handled this situation differently? Like I said, I am younger and I would really like to develop the tools to deal with things like this in a mature way in the future. If you could leave your thoughts, it would be greatly appreciated.

44,"Little background; I'm turning 18 in October and most likely have ADHD/ some anxiety from dealing with ADHD issues and being a perfectionist (I believe said anxiety will go away once the ADHD is under control). 
I am concerned about getting through the year without having mental breakdowns and also going to college without failing miserably. My school has fantastic teachers and one of the only reasons I have succeeded is because of the amazing support system my school provides. Even if the school I go to has same support system, it is going to take me a while to build those connections. 
 Because of this, I decided I should probably find a way to manage this. I can't tell anyone; my dad once said evolution isn't real. There is no way I am going to be able to explain that my brain has a lack of dopamine which makes executive functions difficult without the entire family thinking I am making excuses for myself. Even if I was able to get a diagnosis, I would never hear the end of it for even suggesting that I want medication, just to see what I'm missing out on. It's out of the question. 
 My plan is, a couple weeks into the school year, I go to my guidance counselor (Who is already concerned about this when I told her it was so bad that I couldn't drive) and be like ""Hey, by the way, can I see a psychologist through the school without anyone knowing?"" We'd talk over this, perhaps she'd give me some advice on managing it until I see a doctor, which I will probably wait until I'm eighteen to do. 
I figure this next step could go three ways: 
1) I go through the school or a person comes to me (Because I can't drive because of ADHD). I think I would prefer this the most because then I have the support of my school. This is, assuming, they keep the information from my family. 
2) I somehow work it out with my insurance company about my EOBs and go to a psychologist.
3) I pay out of pocket with some money I have saved up. Obviously, this is my last resort, but I figure I can earn  back the three thousandish (Out of five thousand) dollars if I am able to actually focus. No use having extra money if you flunk out of college. 
Part of me isn't even concerned about meds; I just want to know that I am the way I am because of a lack of dopamine in my brain (to put it simply) and not because I'm lazy or stupid or something. I want evidence that the fault is not in my character or who I am as a person. 
That said, I would like to try it. Just to see what actually focusing is like, you know? I really do think I am smart and capable because when I can actually focus on something I do great things. Can you imagine the things I could do if I could focus the way others do? Just the concept of that excites me beyond words can tell. Even if the only thing that changed was that I could drive (which I doubt would only be the only thing). That would open so many doors for me that are currently locked. (disclaimer: I know meds aren't the only piece of the puzzle of treatment, but according to people I have spoken to with ADHD on meds, it's like someone gave them the edges of the puzzle, and I can definitely see why.)
So here are some things I am concerned with: 
How much should I bring to my guidance counselor? I'm thinking a few tests from online, as I feel those would speak better than I could with my scores reaching 89-90%s . I also want to include things showing how undiagnosed ADHDers tend to self medicate with caffeine and food (bc dopamine.) But would this be too much? I mean if I tell my guidance counselor I often eat to feel focused (it doesn't work well but still) am I going to be labelled with a binge eating disorder? Am I going to be labelled as a drug seeker for actively having caffeinated things to concentrate on something? Because neither of them are true. I don't think the caffeine thing will be an issue, especially since with this claim I literally can't get high off caffeine in the first place (Yes, it does suck. 2/10 don't recommend.) How much information is too much information? What will qualify her for finding outside help? I'm getting a new guidance counselor this year due to my school having some issues, so this is not going to be the same lady who saw me come in crying because the teacher sent me to  detention for reading (He wasn't even doing anything, I was done with my worksheet!) and talk a mile a minute about how much I wanted to get into my school of choice. 
Can I even see a psychologist through my school? Is that a legitimate thing that I have available to me? How can I find out?
How can I make sure my family won't see my medical history if I am on insurance? I know EOBs are a thing, but I don't even know what our insurance is? 
If I go through my school, will they be able to see any sort of history through my school? 
That's all I have, but I may come in and comment more as they come to my brain because I had more questions, I just can't remember them all because I spent a while doing this instead of my ACT test prep. If you read this big wall of text, you're absolutely lovely. 
Thank you!

45,"Backstory: my 91yo grandma moved in with my parents about a year ago due to memory &amp; health issues. Her mood has continued to get worse while her health is improving. She treats my parents like crap: calls my mom names, complains about EVERYTHING, claims my mom doesn’t love her, threatens to take all her pills at once, yells if they’re gone more than an hour, etc. I understand that she is feeling terrible since she can’t remember how to do much or take care of herself, which I can’t imagine how frustrating that would be.

I am a single mom of my 7year old &amp; a teacher. My parents help me out by taking my son to school M, Th, F and picking him up W, Th, F because I just can’t do it with my own school hours (his dad has him Mon night-Wed morn).

My grandma hates my son. He doesn’t fawn over her, he doesn’t want to sit &amp; talk to her all the time. He wants to go do normal 7 year old things. He’s this way with everyone. Total normal 7 year old kid behavior. He does NOTHING wrong. Whenever my son is at my parents house, she refuses to eat or talk to anyone, claiming my parents love my son more than they love her and she won’t come around when he’s here. She threatens to run away, she threatens to take all her pills.

I'm saying this knowing what anorexia is, as I study psychology. I'm on the earlier years of the career, so I know about the topic on an intermediate level and I do not really possess any tools to properly help her recover. 

She consumes 200-300 calories a day. She also seems to suffer from numbness on her fingers which disappears if she eats her vitamins. 

There's a lot more she has told me, but it would be a major breach in privacy to disclose it openly. That said, I'm hard pressed. She really pushed hard against me telling her mum about this, but I feel like it is the best course of action to take.

What can I do to help her feel safer when it comes to eating food? I already told her to give me an honest daily report on what she ate, and to stop weighing herself so often, as it puts extra pressure on her. We also made a deal. She has to reach 500 calories a day by the end of the week, and to stop counting calories. 

She feels like she must slim down, which I don't believe to be necessary, as she is utterly staggering. She is beautiful, but fails to see herself that way.

49,"Personal life:

I live with both of my parents and my autistic younger brother. I've grown to greatly despise them over the years for different reasons. My only solution to deal with them is move out, but I lack the income from a job I can actually handle to do so. Even if I could move out, my massive debt is going to ruin my credit. I just sit at home and play video games like plenty of other losers on the planet since that's the only thing that catches my interest. My only friends are online, some i've known for about 10 years. They're not really able to help me and I don't blame them.

Education:

All I have is a high school degree and 44k+ in student loans since I wasn't qualified for any scholarship when going to school 6 years ago. I was stupid for going to college when not knowing what to do with myself. If it matters, I went for game de
sign, but I only selected that because it involved video games.

Work experience:

Worked at retail for a year, but I was terrible at it and left before they had the chance to fire me(they were trying to get rid of me since day 1 but couldn't find anyone to replace me apparently). Two years after unemployment, I managed to get a job at UPS, but I left after two days because it was too much for me to handle. Right now, i'm just delivering food with doordash. The pay is terrible, but it gets me away from the house and pays for lunch. The flexibility really helps.


So now, i'm still lost.

Me and my father never lived together growing up so I always felt detached from him. I’d visit on the weekends and because of his up bringing he was extremely strict. He was very old fashioned and so it felt hard to voice my opinions because of his temper. He always gave me and my sisters a “Death Stare” that meant you we in trouble. 

About 10 years ago, he moved to Florida with my sisters and I stayed in New York. So of course our relationship felt even more distant. We still talked on the phone like we always did but I never cared for them. I felt like I HAD to and honestly I barely remember them. Me being his only male child, he never wanted me to do feminine things. And then when I was sure I was gay that made things worse. I could never tell him I was gay because of how he viewed gays at the time. He would always tell me how wrong it was, and one day he found out that my older sister was lesbian and all hell broke loose. 

He completely interrogated her and to this day, she feels like that interaction was what ruined their relationship. 

My father doesn’t know I’m gay, in fact he doesn’t know me at all. I never let him. Because it wasn’t safe to. So I hide, even though we talk on the phone today. We spoke today and he completely went off about the how bad the relationship between him and my sisters are. He even brought up my sister being a lesbian and said “that was a phase I was in, I have gay coworkers and she’s my daughter so I love her” 

He says he loves me, but our relationship can’t be a REAL one until we get REAL with each other. But I feel stuck and don’t know how to tell him. In fact, I can barely get a word in when he’s talking. I told myself I don’t care for him, and a big part of me doesn’t, but there’s part of me that feels like there’s something worth salvaging. 

Sorry this was so long, I know what I should do... I just don’t know how to do it.

I have a group of friends which is very close and we do almost everything together,we are all have the same mind kinda and like the same things (kinda). Except one friend, who's entirely different but we still love him and have fun with him. This friend has one of the guys in our group as him ""main friend"" and has the strongest connection to him. 

Now to the point.
Three of us, me included, are planning on a long trip out of the country (a few months), and that ""main friend"" is one of us. But the different friend isn't.
That different friend is very emotional and I would really like some help on how not to include him in our trip (we just don't want his ummm... Vibes... With us) without getting his feelings hurt. ",18Jun2018,1

I'm 22 and tbh my life is pretty boring, I don't drink and sex isn't really a priority to me but my friends are different, they like getting drunk and getting laid. And thats ok to me.

I really don't have a problem with their lifestyle. They can do whatever they want and I won't judge them, but even though I don't care about what they do in their spare time, they see me as a freak.

Like, every time they would ask me out for drinks and I turn them down they'd start saying things like  ""what's wrong with you?"", ""we're just having fun"", ""I guess we can't go anywhere then"", ""you should be doing the same, you have no exuse"" . Every time I tell someone I dont drink or that I don't really care about dating they look me like I'm doing something wrong. 

Well... am I? Why do they judge me so much? May be I come off as too **preachy** for them but that's not my intention... What can I do?",18Jun2018,2

62,"Hey guys, so I feel like I'm in a tough spot.

I'm currently a college student who's working during the summer to make some cash to help with college expenses. The problem is, is that I don't have a car because I was never able to afford one, so I have to rely on my mom to take me to work. She's getting really upset for having to take me, and it's less of the gas money (as I've offered to help pay for it), it's her work schedule (third shift), and just having to drive me in general. It isn't any longer than a ten minute drive, but still, she has to take me there. I'm kinda nervous to tell her my new schedule because she always ends up getting really mad. To be fair, she does have a lot on her plate, as she's working a job that is in general, very underpaying. And she's been someone who has always had to deal with a lot of stress, and she's never been someone who's been good at managing it. 

If I could get a car, I would, but I just don't have enough money. Right now, I'm going to have some extra cash after paying for what I need, and I'll be working at school as an RA, but I can't see myself being able to buy a car for quite some time",18Jun2018,2

65,"Not sure if the flair is what I should’ve put but this is kinda relationship stuff. 

Anyway, I matched with this girl on Tinder and messaged her on there as I would. She didn’t unmatch me which was unusual. I looked at her profile again and found her Snapchat which I added, of course. She never replied on Tinder and I chatted her a few times to a few responses.

Cut to last night, I was hanging out with friends and had one Woodchuck Cider and was feeling it. Normally, I wouldn’t have felt that but I drank it really fast and hadn’t eaten much that day. I had seen earlier in the day that this girl was drinking a Citizen Cider so I sent her a picture of the empty Woodchuck bottle and she replied with another picture. We sent pictures back and forth for a while and then just went to chatting. She invited me to a place downtown (easy walk for me). I told her something along the lines of, “I’d go if I could afford it.” So I didn’t go. 

Now, a day later, I send her a few chats and a picture of a song I was listening to. I got very few responses. The upsetting part is that, as of now, I go back home to a different state at the beginning of July and she goes to college in Arizona (in Vermont now).

67,"I am a male &amp; expecting my first child to be born in around 4 weeks. (Yay!)

I work for a huge corporate company &amp; started last June. When we first got pregnant, I checked out all the policy on leave, and found out that maternity leave was 16 weeks &amp; paternity leave (mine) was 4 weeks.

Sweet! I get a whole month off with pay to spend time with my wife &amp; son. 

In January, the policy was changed (supposedly to be more inclusive of same sex couples). There is no longer maternity leave &amp; paternity leave. Only PARENTAL leave. 

The new policy states that a primary caregiver of the child is allowed 16 weeks, while the secondary caregiver is allowed 4 weeks. The policy states that the primary caregiver designation is at the parents’ discretion. 

I have recently been planning to take the 16 weeks by designating as primary caregiver. However, this policy change is not widely known in my local office, as I am the only father to be and no one has a reason to be aware of it. 

If I take the 16 weeks as policy allows, I know I am going to receive backlash from my coworkers &amp; manager because I am a male. However, it is not up to them nor can they do anything about it. I have already spoken with HR. 

A few family members of mine have also implied that I will be taking a wrongful advantage of this policy, mainly because I work full time while my wife works part time &amp; will be staying home the majority of the time throughout our baby’s life. 

Am I doing something “wrong”? 

I will genuinely be spending the majority of my time off with my child. My wife will have just delivered &amp; be exhausted &amp; recovering. This would allow me to take on the brunt of the work while she tests &amp; prepares to return to her PT job in two weeks. 

I feel like if the company now allows people to choose who will be primary caregiver for the “length of the leave”, then I should take advantage of this potentially once in a lifetime opportunity. 

Advice please. Thank you.

            Ok so a little backstory, My friend and I are both in high school. I moved to a new town and didn’t know anyone, I met Zoe (Name changed for obvious reasons.) and we hit it off. We both find out we have depression and counsel each other, helping each other climb out of a pit. She’s literally saved my life and I’m so grateful I met her.

           Zoe during all of this has been dating a guy named Tom (Named also changed.) He well liked, funny, and chill guy. They break up, nasty rumors start spreading around. Again, we’re in high school. Her depression gets worse, I try to talk to her and ask if I could help etc, she kind of brushes me off. She appeared to get a lot better, so I thought she got through it. I forget and school ends for the summer. She makes on her Instagram talking about how she’s been down. A cry for help if you will. I text her and ask if she’s doing alright. She just responds ‘No.’ to any of my texts asking if she could tell me what’s wrong, if I could help and so on. At this point it was 11:00 at night, so I figure I’ll go to bed and ask her tomorrow. Around 11:30 I get this feeling in my gut to ask her if she cuts herself. She responds with ‘maybe’. So, I push further, until she tells me yes she does cut herself. That last time she harmed herself was on the 14th. I asked her if I could tell her parents. She says definitely not, that they are part of the reason she cuts herself. I don’t really know her parents much, but Zoe’s dad is a heavy drinker. I then ask her if she could tell her sister about this. She again, says no, and tells me that her sister is a total jerk to her. I ask her how she is a jerk. But she just says she doesn’t want to talk about it. She hasn’t said anything since then. 

Thanks so much for your help. And I’m sorry this is such a long read.

He was divorced and had kids from that marriage when he met my mom, and I guess they took priority over me. Before he left he was close friends with a lot of my uncles but they’ve cut ties with him since. I found his phone number and address on yellow pages and confirmed it with them, so far my mom doesn’t know that I’ve even looked for him.

I’m not really looking for a heartwarming reunion and lifelong relationship (I think that ships sailed) but would just like to sit down with him and talk for once, and just get an idea of who he is, and ask why he did what he did, if he regrets it, etc.

Why really freaks me out is just knowing that I have a whole other family out there who don’t even know about me. If I reach out to them, it can go one of two ways: I would love to meet them; my mothers family is pretty spread out and for the most part it’s just been her and me. To have other relatives, grandparents, aunts and uncles who could be part of my life would be a whole other world to me. But what hits me the most is the thought of meeting my brother and sister. This is what scares me. As opposed to my father, who made the decision to leave, they don’t even know about me. If they’d welcome me and I could have a relationship with them, it would be a dream come true; I’m an only child with no cousins, so growing up was pretty isolating. This is the best scenario. The other scenario would be that I show up out of nowhere and basically just act as a home wrecker, showing the bad side of my dads actions that would probably ruin the relationship between him and my siblings and the rest of his family. As well, they’d probably want nothing to do with me as they’d just see me as an inconvenient, meaningless reminder that their families not perfect.

My whole life, I’ve felt that this is a whole other side of my life that was taken from me. That scenes in fresh prince where will says “how come he doesn’t want me”? Or when Jeff in community confronts his dad have always held special meaning to me. Being it Father’s Day, this has been on my mind and I’d like some takes on where to go from here.

93,"So let's rewind a bit. I'm in grade 12. I'm close minded. Everyone around me and their mother is going to University right after graduating high school, so I automatically veer towards the same. 

I have no clue what I want to study, so my mentality goes straight to ""what the hell do I pick, oh I'll pick the closest thing that sounds interesting, okay I'll choose business"", even through I have barely any knowledge or experience in it. Nothing really stands out to me as great to study, nor is there a specific school I find really awesome. I just pick whatever and go right in. Now I'm done 1st year.

I didn't fail or anything bad like that. Nothing terrible happened. I just feel like this path in school is so aimless and I'm primarily doing it just because its the ""default"" path. These days I'm thinking a lot more open-minded than I did back in high school, and I've realized how dumb I feel. 

I just feel like if I'm going to a big institution to receive a focused and formal education, I have to really want to go on that path, and right now I don't. So I'm thinking dropping out, finding myself and my true path might be something to seriously consider. I've felt lost in life for a long time, and that needs to change.

Plus making my parents worry about thousands of dollars in tuition for something I'm very unsure about makes me feel guilty. And the community honestly disgusts me a little so I won't miss anyone too much.

Also this is not some ivy league super business school. So I'm not giving up anything ridiculously amazing, just to clarify that.

Things that make me afraid of doing this are the whole sunk cost thing, fear of lack of opportunities available to me if I do this (though I have read of stories of 30 year olds starting bachelors degrees.. I don't know how hard that is though), the possibility that maybe I'm being too hasty with this decision, and shit, just the idea of DROPPING OUT is intimidating enough.

TLDR: Just feel lost, feel like I went to school in a close-minded and hasty manner, maybe I just need to find myself, but it's pretty damn intimidating to make a decision like this.",18Jun2018,2

97,"So I have seen one or two red flags with this guy already. 

He has a tendency to be a little selfish. But isn’t a narcissist or anything overly extreme. 

We’ve openly talked about porn and I think I may have given him the impression that I am very sexually progressive. 

However, we never talked about watching porn together or anything like that. It’s too soon and we are still getting to know each other.

On our third date, we went out with friends, had a great time, and were drunk when we got back to his apartment.

We got home around 4 AM. We had sex and then I fell asleep... until I woke up to him watching porn around 5AM.
 
I kinda made a remark (while I was half asleep and still drunk)  that I was a little jealous that he was watching porn but I was too tired to say anything else.

I brought this up to him today and asked if I give off the vibe that I’m okay with this kinda stuff and he said no and apologized for being selfish. 

It was our third date and I guess I’m kind of confused about whether or not I should keep seeing him.

I kind of mentioned my hesitation to continue seeing him and so he asked if he could make it up to me and he has arranged plans to do so. 

I kind of feel like it’s too soon to just cut someone off and say “hey you fucked up, bye!”.

98,"Last year when I had just turned 18, my boyfriend broke up with me. We had sex in the morning then I went home super sick &amp; he texted me he wanted to break up. It was soul crushing specifically because in the past 8 months I had had 4 different bf's. I didn't want to jump from one to the other, I would meet someone &amp; then after a few weeks they would break up with me in the most horrible ways. This last break up was probably the least horrible, some of the others did some fucked up shit to me. Anyway, I ended up faking a pregnancy. I took it way too far &amp; when I think about how I was back then I can't believe how fucked up my mind was, I was drinking so much, not living a life in any way &amp; half the time I actually believed the things I was lying about actually were happening. My mum &amp; sister even read my msgs about it &amp; I continued to lie. I never confessed to anyone but I messaged the boy saying I was sorry for everything I did &amp; for torturing him. My lies were so elaborate I guessed he probably knew and just wanted me to go away.
A year &amp; a half on, I've half got myself back on track. I studied, stopped binge drinking and started going to therapy again. I say half back on track because I still haven't told the truth about what I did. Recently I went out for the first time in months with my friends &amp; obviously wasn't a good idea. I remember few things but went home with a friend, two weeks later found out I was pregnant, for real. I don't know what to do, I know what I did was bad and so I feel like this is punishment for what I did. My friend has been horribly abusive &amp; is not in the picture anymore. I would never get an abortion &amp; it's difficult because my mum thinks I got one before. I don't know whether I am supposed to keep this baby &amp; take care of her or give her up for adoption because I'm obviously not a good, mature person yet. I just want to do what's best for her but I don't know if what I did is so fucked up that I am not best for her. I know I have done something so fucked up but I really care about this baby and I guess I'm asking if my past is so vile that I should take it into consideration for this baby's future.",18Jun2018,2
99,"Hey guys, so just got back from a trip yesterday and noticed a baby bird on the ground under a tree in the backyard. so i see the nest and grab a ladder and gloves and put him back in there as there are about 2 others in there also. i go out later and now there’s like 2 on the ground and keep in mind they have their eyes closed the majority of the time and they had like the tube like wings and fuzz on their heads and weren’t able to walk or hop around so they weren’t fledglings. so i look at the nest again and i see a pretty big hole in part of the nest and i’m like this isn’t gonna work lmao. i did some research and read that you can put the babies in the same tree and like find a small basket and put the original nest in it and moved the three chicks in there (with gloves). the parents are flying around the entire time so i move quickly and secure that the nest won’t fly off the tree with the wind and i made sure to put the new nest fairly near the original spot, as i later observed her look for them, find them, and feed them all day from the new nest. now that it is nighttime i’m concerned because during the day every time i would go out there the parents would freak out and fly all around me but not now because i went out there with a flashlight and they were nowhere to be found and the babies are all snuggled together. So, can anyone tell me if the mother is supposed to be sleeping over them to keep them warm bc i wanna give them the best chance they can have and i don’t have the proper resources to bring them inside and care for them, risking for sure abandonment by the parents.

100,"I have a friend group that has been together since middle school. We’re now all 19-21 years old and I’ve really started feeling bitter towards a few of them. I love them to death but the way a few of them have been acting over the past year is completely irrational, in my opinion. 

I really want the best for these people, deep down I want them to succeed and be happy. But it’s hard when they’re acting this way- for example:

One friend has been extremely humble and one of my closest friends since pre-school. Last year, he decided to drop out of college and take a job making around $40,000. I supported him and told him that it isn’t personally something I would do, but go for it. College isn’t for everyone! I understand that.
Although, over the past 6 months he’s been flaunting his “success” and has lied about a ton of shit that he’s doing. He randomly said he was back in school taking online courses but I later found out that was false. I know for a FACT that he’s blowing all of his money on dumb shit and paying to fly girls to stay with him and go on vacation. Last week he said he was getting a $20,000 raise, which I found out isn’t true. It’s a bunch of little shit, texts, tweets, dumb shit that I feel like won’t last. Can I help him without stepping on his toes or just let him figure it out?

There are similar stories with a couple friends that have changed a lot. Is it time to just let them go and let them become acquaintances or should I try to help them? I don’t want to be that guy that thinks he’s helping but is actually making things worse, but I don’t want to watch them go down these paths. Advice?",18Jun2018,2
101,"We’ve been dating for quite some time now. And yes, something happened between us. 

The good news is she said that she is an inactive carrier of Hepatitis B due to her contracting it from birth, maybe from her mother, I don’t know. Her doctor says that she is non-infectious. Also, I already received 2 out of 3 vaccine shots for Hepatitis B, upon testing, the vaccine already reached the minimum titer for it to become effective. I will be receiving my last dose of the vaccine later this July. I have yet to take another blood test to confirm that I have not contracted the disease.

She does not leave any clean litter for the people she asks to take care of them for her. I went there late on Saturday night to feed them.

105,"Unbeknownst to my family, I have been starting to talk to a couple of the therapists at my college campus because I've felt as if I've been placing emotional barriers to distance myself from them. As much as I love my family, the crucial reason they don't know about my therapy sessions is because they don't take Mental Health Issues seriously. Attending more therapy sessions has helped me face the fact that I've had an anxiety disorder and depression due to past unfortunate events that I'd prefer not to go into detail about. I don't know how to address this topic to my family, because I never told them about these past unfortunate events when they happened (there was a lot of shame and fear at this time). I don't even know how I'll even address the depression or anxiety disorder. 

I've tried to connect with my teenage sibling about this subject, but to put it bluntly, she can't empathize and it's frustrating. It doesn't help that I'm a college graduate and she's just starting her first years of high school. We are completely different people who are experiencing drastically different things. So, it's hard enough that I'm just not close to her, but, it's harder when she doesn't understand my feelings. And to be honest, I'm just not patient with her. For example, she believes that my depression is just me being extra dramatic over little problems that don't actually matter and that if anyone has anything to complain about, it's her (because she has ""real"" academic expectations and social obligations). And although I've expressed to her that these little problems just add up, she dismisses them and sums it up to ""life is unfair, deal with it"". However, whenever I carry the same attitude toward her problems, she accuses me of being an unsupportive sibling... I feel really lost on where to go with her.

It's harder with my parents because I'm not this person they imagine me to be. It's the worst when I get compared to other cousins or peers of my age range in all sorts of aspects (academic status, career status, appearance, etc.). My parents will initially insult my academic status, career status, appearance, etc. and then coincidentally have an attitude change whenever another family member, friend, or peer ask about me. They'll go as far as to lie about certain aspects of my life to make it look as if I've achieved something they want. My therapists have all agreed that's probably where I've developed my negative attitude toward them. I've asked questions regarding their feelings on the subjects of mental health, but all of their responses terrify me. They really believe that people with depression, anxiety, and suicidal tendencies are only doing it for attention and that by attempting to ""heal"" them, we are only giving into their selfish and entitled behavior. I feel lost on them too...I know they've noticed my behavior has probably been different. But, they'll say things like ""you're not sad, you're just acting crazy."" or ""why are you being crazy?""

I'm afraid that by officially acknowledging that I have problems, they will all just dismiss me as crazy.

I love my family, but I don't know if it would be worth risking being rejected due to issues I really want to try to resolve.

I'm really scared.",18Jun2018,4
106,"The cat is basically mine, because she was a birthday gift given to me by my parents when I turned 12. I’m 27 now, and feeling like I need my furry companion with me. She is extremely bonded to me, and is not nearly as close to anyone else... both of us spent our childhoods (me after 12, her from a few months onward) growing up together. She will let my mom pet her, however it’s not nearly the same as it is with me. She used to sleep with me every night and follow me around the house constantly. Now, everytime I go over, she’s happy to see me and it makes me wonder if maybe it wouldn’t be so bad moving her in with me (since everything will smell like me and I’ll be around a lot). I see her once a week now, but I can’t help but wish I saw her much more. She’s basically my best friend. Plus, my brother and sister in law recently adopted a cat, which inspired me to get one of my own.. and I’m thinking I either want to adopt a new kitten or move my childhood friend in with me.. And adopting feels like a betrayal to me, since the cat in question loves me so very much and would likely be jealous if she knew. It just feels wrong...

There are several problems that concern me about moving her in, though. 
1. She’s an older cat. She’s healthy now, but I’m not sure what impact this could have on her. 
2. She is able to go outside at my parent’s house, and has for her entire life. In my apartment, she would never be able to go outside again. 
3. Everything will be completely new. After 16 years in the same place, what would that be like? 

Anyways, does anyone have any insight or advice as to what I could do? 

 I appreciate it. Thank you!!

111,"Asking for a friend:

My friend is a young adult female and is wondering how to overcome inappropriate thoughts about her father. She grew up with him in the house but now is only home maybe twice a week. She still lives at home with her mother and younger siblings. As a baby she was very close with her mother, then switched to a daddy's girl at 4/5. They have a very close relationship, but nothing inappropriate ever transpired. If anything they have a very close bond and often talk about his issues with her mom (her mom puts her in the middle of their arguments so she has to play mediator), her depression, work, dreams, etc. She would describe him as her best friendShe was also never abused physically/sexually/etc. He's a pretty awesome dad and would do anything for his family.

She has basically no friends besides me, but is close to her family. She's always been an introvert, shy, and anxious but she doesn't actually want more friends and requires very little social interaction. Most of her social interactions come from one sibling, her mother, me, and her father (when he's home). She usually has a job but doesn't have one currently, and when she did the added social interactions seemed not to impact these thoughts she has.

She started feeling this way at about 12/13 years old, but grew out of it. She wasn't really disturbed by them back then, and just assumed it was due to entering puberty and let it pass on its own. However, after taking SSRI's for two years, and coming off, she has the inappropriate feelings again. She also feels like her thoughts and brain regressed for a small time- right when she came off the meds she felt mentally 12 (is in her early 20s)  and did act immature, but slowly over a year she began to ""grow up"" all over again and has mentally caught up to about her actual age. IDK how these meds affected her but during and after she was on them her personality completely changed, like she was actually a completely different person and made crazy choices.

Now it's been a year since she was off them, but ever since she first came off them these thoughts have reappeared. They seem to be growing more persistent too. She doesn't have feelings towards other men really, and actually seems disinterested in dating as a whole. She also feels emotionally tied to him because of how she listens to his emotions/feelings and tries to repair his relationship with his wife. He is also her emotional support and is the epitome of ""My Daughter is a Princess"" type of dad. This is how it's always been with them though. Her mom is incredibly emotionally immature so often times it's her and her dad discussing how to help/handle her mom or wondering what to do to get through her mom's outbursts. 

She is very disturbed by her feelings/urges and would like some non-judgmental advice on how to deal with this because it's getting worse. Or if it's normal? I headed this with electra complex because she feels like she is somehow stunted and stuck in the complex. She has hostile feelings towards her mom and wants her dad to (for) herself. She is also embarrassed to discuss this with a counselor because she feels like such a freak.

112,"The title says it all but I'll elaborate.

I'm an instructor at a college and a very good friend of mine is enrolled in a highly technical program I'm teaching. It's quite difficult and less than half the students typically graduate from it. I think he's seeing this as a shot to get into a new profession and turn his life as he's bounced around odd-jobs the last few years. Unfortunately I don't think he has the mindset to really succeed here. He's very smart, but not terribly technically minded.

I've offered to tutor him over the summer (free if course) on some of the content I think he'll struggle with and at least get a headstart on things before the fall. I put forward the offer months ago and he's only taken me up on it once, despite sounding keen on the idea of it. I keep reminding him and letting him know I'm available whenever, but haven't heard back on it, just indefinite ""yeah that sounds like a good idea"".

I'm reluctant to tell him to look to something else though. I just don't think it's right to tell him he's incapable, because I might be wrong on this (and would love to be, but I've seen enough students to get a good feel for this stuff). I don't want to do nothing and see him gain even more debt from going back to school only to fail. The only middle ground I can think of is to tutor his ass off but he's not able to commit to that for whatever reason.

I like to help students however I can and don't ever get this personally invested, but I've known this person for like 75% of my life and he was at my wedding. I can't help but get a bit more invested.

I'm planning to keep pushing the tutoring a bit but would be curious on other takes on this I just can't see. Maybe he has to figure this out for himself? Maybe it's okay to push him a bit more to make sure he succeeds? I have no idea what's best here.",18Jun2018,2

So I live in a suburban area of PA, and I met him when he moved here from San Francisco, CA. Hes going back to SF in a few weeks. He's also going to Hawaii and Ohio, so I won't see him for the next month. In SF, he has these friends and he calls them ""his boys"" who apparently smoke week all day and they do stupid shit. My bf won't tell me what they've done or do or will do; all he tells me is that they ""aren't good people"". 

This isn't the first sketchy thing I've seen my bf do either. He seems to have a sort of business going on. He does this thing where people send him money to shop for extremely expensive clothing or accessories for them. Then, he ships it to the client and is allowed to keep a certain percentage of the money. He can also send people to buy him things. He's made quite a lot of money this way, but won't tell me how much (not that I care, ive never really asked but I know he wouldnt tell me). I do know that he goes to New York City once in a while and works at Round Two. I'm not really sure what that is except that its a store that sells supreme and all that jawn.

Another kinda weird thing is that he knows A LOT about guns. I don't know whether to be impressed or afraid. He told me once about how he knows how to load and shoot a gun. He knows exact types of guns. He knows everything about guns. He's told me about how he knows its kinda weird. He's interested in guns, and I don't know if that's a good or bad thing..

He's also come back from SF once and told me how someone pulled a knife on him and jumped him. He's fine, wasn't stabbed or anything, but I'm concerned. I told him I want him to be careful when he goes. 

Idk. Maybe I'm overreacting. Im very conflicted. I need to state my age at the end or you wouldn't have taken me seriously, but were both 16. Only 16, and he's making thousands of dollars, while traveling the world, and hanging with sketchy af people. Also, I know he's not selling drugs.

I don’t linger on it much, it barely comes up simply due to it being something I’ve accepted that’s part of me, but it just becomes irritating when trying to progress in life.

Things aren’t bad, I’ve got a full time job (crappy pay and crappier job but still), I’m engaged, own house (not bought, rented) and a fantastic family (on my side), but man, it would be great to not be here, like the thought of it is real comforting.

After a few years my fiancé convinced me to go to a therapist, she knows very little because I don’t open up about it but I went anyway, and that was beyond counter productive. It was impersonal, focused on weird things and was a disappointing experience however that’s all I’ve got access too, I stopped going.

There’s a lot of things that go on my mind, some that get to me, I don’t think I’m even able to say some of them as it could cause trouble, things I’d never act upon just a crappy mind I’ve been given.

I’m very unattached to everything, I recently got told a close family member has cancer, and I, I didn’t really react, it’s bad but like, I don’t know. Hearing about death or anything damaging in no way discomforts me, I’m just stale and empty and don’t know what it’ll take for me to actually feel compassionate.

It doesn’t seem that there’s many people wanting to help, just willing to judge.

I think I’m asking for advice? I want to study, I want to progress but I just can’t (if you hate the word can’t, sorry, but it’s what I use, a grammatical correction can’t fix 10  years of mental self destruction).

But yeah, sorry, and thanks.",18Jun2018,1
118,"Hey reddit. Just need somewhere to talk. 

I am going into my senior year of high school (17M) and will soon be applying for colleges and such. 

A little background: my parents are divorced. Father never remarried and I live with him primarily. Mother remarried to a great man (marine, iron worker... his life is crazy and awesome). 

So my mom and step-dad really want me to join the Air Force. I understand that it has the opportunity to teach you some extremely valuable life skills and make you a better person, along with the benefits of education and such. However, I really don’t think it’s right for me. I don’t think I would fit in or be good or comfortable there. I am kind of sensitive in the sense where when someone seems extremely angry at me I will sometimes silently cry a little bit but not too much. Also, I’m gay, and they think I act “too flamboyant” so I do believe that they think this would help make me “act better.”

Here’s the kicker. They are trying to subtly pressure me into doing it for another motive. My mom currently has to pay child support to my dad, and that will continue for a few years after I graduate high school (something to do with the law), and joining the military will stop it. I’m sure you can see where this is going. They brought it up one time and said “we don’t want this to be a major factor in your decision, but...” and it just really saddens me and pisses me off. 

I have a 35 on my ACT and College credits already, hoping to major in CS somewhere... maybe even at a university abroad. The world is huge and I haven’t seen any of it. I just feel like I will be wasting four+ prime years of my life if I do this. I don’t even know if that score will fucking matter if I enlist. I just really don’t want to but I don’t know what to do. I guess I don’t want to “disappoint” them either. 

Thanks for reading y’all. Happy Monday~~",18Jun2018,2
119,"My online friends. Well actually just one online BFF and this one guy I have streaks with who I occasionally have a convo with (however he considers me his friend and does seem concerned about me at times). 

Backstory on my BFF: We met on an online site and added each other on Snapchat, exchanges phone numbers, Facebook, ig everythang. Ever since probably July or August of 2017 to up until 2 weeks ago, we have been snapchatting each other every single day except for when I have had my phone taken away. Context, she has several mental issues, anxiety, insecurity, sensitive but she is a very good person in general. This will give you insight on how fcked up I am for doing this

Context of me ghosting: so two weeks ago I decided to just abandon my phone and Snapchat and immerse myself in my real life and nature in order to fix my mental issues. However I did this without telling my BFF or my other friend. A week into this attempt to diy fix my life, I caved in and started using my phone again, but I didn’t contact my friends again. 

Now it’s been two weeks and I feel like a piece of shiiit. But at the same time I’m good on my own but I don’t want to hurt her feelings. This has been the 3rd time I’ve ghosted on an online friend before (all other times were because of mental issues as well and feeling like I was becoming a person that they would not appreciate ). My question though is how would I go about contacting her ? I don’t want to lie and say that I just didn’t want to talk to her and I’ve reused the lie that my parents took my phone away too many times and it was so long this time. Also I feel like im still not the person I want to be that she will like, I want to be happy and I’m not atm. And I want to continue to go without internet because that’s how my mental health has improved in the past.

I just need help in what to say to her when I do contact her / my other friend. I’m such a mess

120,"I was a socially awkward loner all throughout my school years and then in my 20s struggled with depression and self-esteem problems. Because of that I never really got into the dating scene. Over the past few years I have been trying to finally just develop the confidence and go for it, but I am struggling because it seems almost everyone in my age group is done playing the field and only wants to date for the sake of finding a long term partner. I am simply not at that point in my life yet. I want to date around so I know what I want out of a partner and also just so I can get it out of my system.

I'm angry that this bullshit happens in the first place. It went for an hour and I have no idea what the point of it all was if they're sleeping in the same place. We live in the same house but they rent a separate studio apt and I don't want to intrude in ""married"" ""couple"" arguments so I said nothing. My sister thinks he's cheating and she's probably right. But who gives a fuck anyway as the marriage is probably a sham and they're only together because they had the 2 year old. Suck it up and play along for the next 16 years. I'd like to defend my sister unconditionally but she has her own faults, they both do. They both blow up in anger, 0 to 100 in seconds. I already told her months ago to do family counseling after a similar incident. I told her they have to control their anger. They did nothing. As a result, these arguments (although not too common) get out of control. I just it all tolerate it for my own reasons.

They don't give a shit about the implications. They'll probably just look at me like I'm the asshole. If I call them out they'll get angry and it's pointless to argue with anger.

Both my parents are first gen immigrants from Korea and are frequently arguing and controlling and dominate our family functions and our daily lives. They're frequently irrational and take things way out of context over small disputes and I thought it was initially because of a language barrier. However, even if I try to explain issues or slow things down they refuse to listen and turn each issue into a ultimatum, either I obey or I don't and get punished regardless of each one I choose. Every argument becomes more and more irrational and has become even worse with each argument being more and more inflammatory.

Not too hard, I could definitely say that and I already know her response (positive). 

But a friend told me I should say how I'm attracted to her and see where that gets me. Now that, that's a bit harder.

- The opportunity to say it

- The strength to say it

- Confidence everything will be okay in the end

I just know I have to say something, but I'm nervous, and I don't even know that it'll feel like the right time. As the chance for her and I to be separated from everyone else face to face is a lucky situation.

131,"I am 30F and in the process of saving about $1500-$2000 for a new bedroom furniture set.
While I save my money, I am exploring my options, but I am very picky and tend to be cheap.

I purchase most of my furniture through Walmart for under $50 an item, but over the past 10 years, I’ve noticed that what I buy tends to be pressed sawdust, chips and becomes wobbly and produces water marks from cups extremely fast. I end up replacing the items after a year or so. 

I want something that will last me maybe 3-5 years if I take care of it.

Where do I buy better quality furniture from? What is better quality furniture?

The only places I know to look are Walmart and similar competitors, IKEA and Rooms To Go. I only have experience with Walmart, I like the return policy. I also have picked out a king size mattress and protector for $500 from Walmart, so the rest of my budget is for furniture.

When I browse the inventory on IKEA of RTG, I feel a lack of options with my pickiness...

What I’m looking for:

-Furniture must be all solid black, no grain or textures. (This really limits selections.)

-Furniture must not have any gaps between floor and edges. (I have sugar gliders and do not want them to get under anything I cannot reach.)

-Furniture preferably would not be too hard to disassemble as I usually move every 2 years. I’d also not like solid wood as it becomes heavy for me to move being my small self, and I tend to shift things around often.

-I do not have much space, the smaller the item, but the more tall the item would be preferred. Instead of a long 6 drawer dresser, I’m looking for taller 5 drawer dressers.

-I’m looking for a king platform bed, preferably with storage drawers. I have my eye on a headboard with cubby holes and a shelf. I cannot use nightstands if I have these drawers. So one or the other.

-I need about 12 regular size drawers for all of my extra clothes. The taller the better so I can fit 2 or 3 in my room and use one as a tv stand.

Any help on teaching me about the value of better quality furniture is and what that means is appreciated. If you have suggestions on where to look, that’s even better!

OR, should I just stick with my cheap Walmart stuff bc it’s the only option that fits my criteria?",18Jun2018,1
132,"So I find myself in a bit of a strange situation. I have been in a long distance relationship with a girl for about 5 years now. We met when I studied abroad to her country 4 years ago. Since then, I have graduated and even moved to her country, although I could not be in the same area as her, so the LDR continues. The distance has been hard on us, so we opened the relationship about 2.5 years ago to seeing other people. Also I should note that we have travelled to see eachother about 2-3 times a year, so it's not like I never see this person.

This girl is lovely. She never gets mad at me for anything, she always tries to be supportive, and she always tries out my hobbies like gaming or other things that she isn't really interested in that much.

Well, about 4 months ago, I met a girl who I started seeing kind of casually. I had been with about 12-15 people since we opened our relationship. This girl was quite different though, and I caught feelings hard and so has she. My girlfriend knows about her and that I have caught feelings, so I am not hiding anything from her.

I am feeling lost now. I always thought that I would spend my life with LDR girl. We planned on having kids and getting married. If I asked her right now, I have no doubts that she would marry me. The other girl is also really into me. She tells me that she hopes what we have never ends and she would like to make it long term. This girl that I met is really similar to me. She understands me more than anyone ever has before. LDR would often not understand me, but accept even if she didn't quite get why I would feel a certain way. The girl I have been seeing now just clicks with me. I feel like I should have always been with her. It also helps that we have the same hobbies and tastes to a T. We enjoy doing the same things together. With LDR girl, she would do her best to try out my hobbies, but it is obvious that she enjoyed herself, but doesn't really get it or would never do it without me including her.

The biggest block for me however, the girl I am seeing has two young kids. It has always been my dream to have kids, and it's something I think about very often. The girl I have been with for 5 years would gladly have kids with me. The girl who I have been seeing already has two kids, but said she would consider having another child if the situation was right. I have met her kids before and they like me a lot, but even though I care for them, I will never be their dad. And if I did have a child with this girl, I would be afraid that her two kids would feel like we favored the kid we had together, which we would never do.

One way or another, I need to make a decision because I hate the idea of leading anyone on. Summed up, There is the girl I am with who would do anything with me, and we would experience everything together for the first time. She would do absolutely anything for me and I could be happy with her I know. On the other hand, there is this girl I have been seeing for a few months who really understands me. We have the same interests and tendencies. Like we are both kind of messy and have the same humour. Something clicks with this girl that I have never experienced before. I am not sure what I should do.

I like her so much and I know she knows it. I asked her 2 months ago and she said maybe one day.
 
Idk what to do.. I snap her daily and now I work mornings since it’s summer and I know I’m the only guy she flirts with at work and calls me her Best Friend over everyone at work. What do I do to try to get out of this shell??

Everyone thinks we are dating, we have pictures together that look and when she parties (rarely) they say she always ask for me..

134,"I made a post a while back when I had an overwhelming first day at my first job, Wendy’s. I messed up a lot but looking back it was a pretty typical first day for much people. The next few days I got *slightly* better and I still had the excuse of being new when I messed up.

But now its been a month working there and I honestly believe that most of my coworkers think that I’m a fucking moron. I do great in school, and I consider myself a pretty smart person, but for some reason I struggle *so much* when it comes to focusing and listening to people. 

This fucks me over when it comes to this job because of how I’m always being asked to do things, and if I’m not certain I know what I’m doing I’ll ask a ton of questions. It takes me a lot longer to learn how things work compared to others.

On top of that I make absolutely boneheaded mistakes that make people think there’s something wrong with me. Like when a coworker went on break for 20 minutes and he ordered something and I literally asked him if he was “staying or going”, which lead to my manager burst out laughing. It wasn’t that bad but in total it was the one of the many times I’ve come across as a retard to her. He then asked for a small cup and I gave him a fucking senior sized one and he just awkwardly looked at me until I realized what I did. 

Of course what amplifies this problem is my anxiety and awkwardness around people. I was hoping that this job would help my social anxiety like I’ve heard it does for people but I feel no different. I’m still my same awkward self who is always crushed when I have pressure on me. It’s like my mind turns off and I’ll make the worst mistake socially or while working.

I know what all these people think about me doesn’t matter in the slightest but it just *kills* me to see how hard it is to feel normal. Working there depresses me but I need this money badly.

Around this time, I've been planning on moving to Los Angeles to pursue television writing.

149,"     It's a long story but I have a couple of days to make a decision that will drastically change my life. Either decision i make will have a drastic impact in my life.

 Here's the story; My girl friend that's 17 and I (19) have been going out and having a serious relationship for the past 3 years. We have talked about moving together and having a family together. I honestly do have plans to get together with her. But since we started going out she always would tell me to not get too attached to her because her family will be moving out of state. They're moving from California to arizon. They've been wanting to move for almost 4 years now but their plans kept getting delayed. 

I have always told her that I will move with her when the time comes. We always agreed that first we would move in with her family, then we will move out eventually and we'll start our lives together and start our own family.

     But now the time has come, she's moving in less than one month and here's what's difficult. I only have one of 2 choices.

1. I move out with her just like we have always planned and we actually marry each other and do all the things we've planned
Or
2. I back out of all our plans and loose her forever. I know it would leave her devastated and heart broken 

I honestly don't want to move it gives me anxiety to think about it. Imagine leaving my own family to go move in with her family. Leaving everything and everyone I know behind. My whole life would change and I'm not sure how to deal with it

But then again I really do want to move and start my own family with her and marry her like we planned but I'm just scared what if I move and it turns out she's not the one.
Please help me

152,"Okay, so I've always had a minor fear of cockroaches, I think a lot of little kids do. But im older now and have had a few expirences with them recently. About 6months ago I accidentally killed one with my hand in the dark, which is what reinstated the fear in me. I've seen a few more in my house sparatically and can't spray because of my bird. The fear somtimes keeps me up at night (anytime I hear a thud or feel somthing brush my leg i assume it's one and have to turn my lights on and check) and i also have, a few times a day, graphic images of them crawling out of my mouth/ear. It's hard for me to sit down for long periods of time and I don't feel I can relax at all. I know they aren't a real threat to me but that doesn't stop me from carrying around a bottle of bleach in case I see one. I don't know how I can stop being so paranoid about them.

156,"As the title states, people all my life have told me I'm way too nice. I've never really looked to Change it. Quite honestly, Its extremely hard to get me mad, and situations that would have normal people throwing fits, I continue to stay way too polite through.

So I don't understand how recently, situations that I would have normally been polite and not affirmative on I've suddenly become an asshole to. It's not at all like my personality, and the past few days it's happened I don't even feel like its me. It feels more like an out of body experience and like I'm just watching myself from within myself.

For example, I had a guy stop me and my dad in the mall to try to sell us something. Normally no big deal, tell the guy no and be on your way.

But this time, the guy doesn't take our no, comes around behind me, pulls the back of my shirt Dowm to stick these pads from his product on my back. When he turns it on (without my permission) it caused all the muscles in my back to tense up, and my shoulders to jerk up. Why anyone would want that is beyond me. Anyway, he takes it off of me, and goes over to my dad. Now my dad just had surgery on his back two days prior, and whatever that device did, could be detrimental to his recovery.

My dad told the guy ""No, don't put that on me"". The guy ignores him and pulls the back of his shirt down and attaches the pads. My dads never been someone to stand up for himself, and quite frankly I'm not someone to stand up for myself either. This is what surprised me.... Ive never done this before in my life, but I started yelling at the guy. I said, ""ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?"" they guy turns around dumbfounded and says, ""What?"". I said, ""HE JUST SAID DONT PUT THAT ON HIM"". he says, ""How about he try it?"" I said, ""HOW ABOUT YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP AND TAKE THAT SHIT OFF OF HIM?"" this guy turns around to me and says, ""Why are you so heated?"" I said, ""WEVE GOT SHIT TO DO. SHUT THE FUCK UP AND TAKE IT OFF OF HIM"".

Now just tonight, I was at the movies with my mom (drive in movie theatre) and we had to rent chairs to sit outside of the car. When we went to return the chairs afterwards, one of the employees rudely told her she put them in the wrong place, and pretty much acted like my mom was an idiot. The theatre requires they hold your licence when you rent chairs, so she asked where did she have to go to get her licence back. The employee then points over to the concession stand. As we started walking over, I heard someone else ask them sane question, and the same employee says, ""Oh I have the licences right here"".

So I took my mom back over to her, and shes looking for my mom's licence, and says she cant find it. I'm starting to get angry, and I said, ""GREAT, YOU LOST HER LICENCE???"" The employee turns to me, rolls her eyes and says, ""Calm down"". Now that really pissed me off. I started yelling, ""ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME??? FIRST YOU TALKED TO HER (my mom) LIKE SHE WAS A FUCKING IDIOT, THEN YOU TOLD HER TO GO TO THE CONCESSION STAND TO GET HER LICENCE BACK?"" the employee says, ""Oh I didn't know what you were doing"". I said, ""WE CAME BACK HERE WITH CHAIRS IN OUR HANDS AND ASKED WHERE TO GET HER LICENCE BACK, HOW THE HELL DONT YOU KNOW WHAT WERE DOING?"" she ignores me and says, ""Oh, here's the licence"". Then turns to another employee and says, ""Make sure they leave"" I turned around (since I was already walking out of the building) and said, ""FUCK YOU"".

I know I sound like I'm insane for getting as angry and worked up over these things as I am. I've NEVER acted like this before, and I don't know why I suddenly am. It sounds completely insane and irrational to me. I've been I situations like this before and have just been completely timid and submissive. What the hell changed????",18Jun2018,2
157,"Around five years ago I use to have a crush on this girl that went to my church. We weren't particularly friends and at the awkward age of 12-13 ish, I did my best to include her in activities or make small talk with her. She appeared to be a quiet person around me which only deflated my efforts to talk to her. In that same year my family stopped going to that church and I lost all contact with her only to forget about my feelings for her. Fast forward to about a week ago, I decided to get back into the church and went on a weekend retreat with them. Unsurprisingly, she was there and just the same as I remembered her. She was a little more talkative with the people around her but was still pretty quiet when I talked to her or when I was around. That being said I feel like I'm more confident in myself to be able to talk to her and get her to open up a little more but that's where I'm conflicted. As of right now I feel as if I'm borderline obsessed with her and I hate it. During the retreat I couldn't help but keep a lookout for where she was or who she was talking to. I would love to start talking to her but at the same time I feel as though my borderline obsession with her may cause a relationship with her to be harmful to either her or me.

158,"So when i was 13, i met this guy and we started hanging out a lot. He was 16, almost 17. I trusted him. He was my first kiss. I knew him for 2 years before we made anything ""official"". I know- gross. I was only 13. We were together all the time, face timing and swimming in my pool. He was my neighbor so things always worked out. We were together for over 8 months before I cut things off.

Eventually, i noticed he started to get a lot more touchy. He was on the bus with me one day, and asked me ""what would you do if i did this?"" And i asked ""did what?"". He then proceded to stick his hand between my legs, but above my thin dress. He did this precicely at the time a few minutes before he got off the bus at his stop. I felt so angry. I was only 13, so I didn't know what to think. 'Maybe this is what boyfriends do. He's a silly boy, why should I be mad.'

One day he was over and my mom wasn't home. We went up to my room and fooled around, but I only wanted to kiss, although I didn't make it clear that I only wanted to kiss. He pushed me onto the bed, but in good fun. We made out, but then- he stuck his hand down the back of my pants and touched me. I firmly said his name once or twice and said stop. It took a few times before he stopped and we left the room.

This next time is the one that trips me up. He was at a point where he didn't care about me as a person at all. He pretended to care so that I could give him what he wanted. He wanted me to give him a bj and a hj. I said no and he guilt tripped me into saying ok. He told me that I never do anything for him and that he never gets any pleasure in return for the KISSES he gave me. He told me to take my bra off for him and let him suck or touch my nipples. He said this is what gf and bf do and that i dont love him if i didnt. Mind you- I WAS FUCKING THIRTEEN. So we did all that, none of which I wanted to do. I did NOT give him a hand job or a blow job. I never touched his dick. I never wanted to even kiss him. He's not attractive whatsoever. I never wanted to do anything with him, but he told me if I didn't do these things, he wouldn't think I loved him.. After he touched me, he told me its what I wanted. He told me that I wanted it all.

Its been on my mind on and off for maybe a year or two now. Fighting with myself- I am not a victim. I gave consent. And then, no he took advantage of my age and my body. But then i think- i should have said no. But i didnt say no sometimes so i had it coming. He straight up told me at one point if I gained or lost weight he wouldn't love me anymore. I ended that relationship, but now he guilt trips me TO THIS DAY by pestering me with texts like wyd or how are you? Probably because I ended it with saying we should just be friends because I was afraid to hurt him.",18Jun2018,1

162,"This situations a bit complicated.

In kindergarten up until 9th grade, I was friends with this girl who we’ll call G. During 8th grade she started being a horrible friend and our friendship disintegrated in 9th grade. Here are basically the things that she would do:

- G would willfully misinterpret the things I said in order to make me seem/feel like a bad person. 
- G would constantly act passive aggressive towards me and treat me worse than her other friends. 
- She has told me to kill myself and refused to admit it. 
- She has told the school telling them that I was the one that was bullying her, getting me sent to the office multiple times for me to be told to stop bullying her. 
- She would get her friends to tell me to stop bullying her even though I have not communicated with her for months

So for my upcoming junior year of high school, I decided to take the school’s drawing class. It’s a small class and to my knowledge, there’s only one period so everyone who takes drawing will all be in the same class. However, i believe that there is a solid chance that G will want to take the same drawing class as I am. 

During 9th grade, my mother was called by the school that they think that I was bullying G and she had told the school to never put us in the same class. My mother also told me that if I was ever put in the same class as G, she will let me stay home until things get sorted out. 

I’ve told my mother about this possibility, so she suggested that I take a different class and she strongly believes that G is bad news and that I should never be around her. 

However, since I’m as stubborn as a mule, I really want to stay in this drawing class even though there’s the possibility that G will be in the same class. 

So if the situation comes up where G does take drawing, should I just change classes and take drawing in my senior year or should I stick to my decision and explain to my mother that I would rather stay in drawing even if I will have to deal with the presence of G?",18Jun2018,2

She is the most arrogant, miserable, grating person I’ve ever met. Lacks all self awareness. She flys off the handle on him at least 6 times a day. She picks apart everything he says, takes issue with everything he does, seemingly makes up things to be offended by. She screams profanities at my dad while my 5 year old brother is right there, causes a scene in public virtually every where we go. Hated by whole family, she gossips about family members with other family members and has destroyed many of our family members relationships. She is UNBEARABLE to be around

168,"I don't even know where to start, so...hi. This will be long as shit. 

My best friend...""Jake"" and I go way back. We've also both struggled with mental illness. I got into treatment, he did not. He refuses to. When I beg him, or nag him, or get frustrated with his stubbornness I hear myself and I sound like every other person who interacted with me before I got help so I try very hard to detach from him with love and offer support without expectations. Lead a horse to water, not make him drink and all. 

Except...Jake can be volatile. He gets angry and forgets himself. He's threatened to strangle me. He's destroyed his sister's things over petty nonsense (like...""Why are you using the washing machine, \*I told you\* I needed it?"" or something like that. Punches holes through walls.) 

He's also demonstrated this sort of...I don't know whether to call it selfishness or disregard for our friendship or what. I know he \*likes\* me, I just feel like he likes everyone else more than me. Like...I asked him if he could go to my Grandma's funeral, or just stop by the visitation. It was a hard time, family drama, he said he would but blew me off to drive his SO to work, no warning or cancellation text...just didn't show. Which...fine. He does that fairly often. He'll ditch me or cancel last minute or, in several cases be hours late to hang out. He was the first person to know I'm gay (or bisexual or...not straight, whatever). It was a big deal for me to tell him and he just...told people. Told his SO to avoid having the ""Why is your best friend a woman are you gonna cheat on me?!"" conversation with her. I let that go to, even when she started to talk to me about it in front of our entire circle of friends. ""Bluecharade is a lesbian????!!"" ""Heh, \*no\*, heheh. I am not a lesbian."" \*Sweats nervously\*. 

It feels like...I like black tea, okay? It's a nice tea. But if you said I could have any tea I wanted I sure as hell wouldn't pick black tea. Black tea's right at the Walgreens down the road, it'll be there when I want it. These other fancy-ass teas are way cooler than black tea. He just likes all the other teas more. But he's my best friend so I put up with so much. I know his family, and I get what it's like to be struggling. I do, which is why I feel so bad disliking his behavior this much. He'll go no contact with me until I physically show up at his house to check on him and he'll say, ""Sorry, I've been to depressed to talk to anyone other than \[SO\]."" 

I don't want to dislike him for his actions. I know they are symptoms of his illness but they...they just really suck. It's shitty to feel like he's avoiding me, it's shitty to get blown off or ignored. It's shitty when he flies off the handle at the slightest provocation, I hate being screamed at over nothing. I don't want to hate him for his illness, that makes me feel guilty because it's like... hate the sin not the sinner and I'm starting to not be able to distinguish the two.

**Update 1:**

Ok good news is that I managed to make her realize that it was an imposter. Now I am helping her wipe her hard drives just to be safe.

But something is still really off. She’s telling me her ‘ex-bf’ who stood her up 20 times always posts vague, ‘indirect’ stuff on his twitter/IG that is about her. I’ve asked for a screenshot of any conversation between them but she said she didn’t have one. She claims he hacks her Instagram and Spotify and removes her ability to play BTS tracks. She also sends me these super random text messages from unknown numbers, one was just a picture of a fence, and she says they’re from him.

I don’t know his cousin very well, we really only met at some thanksgivings/family events etc. so i don’t know what her normal personality is like. But when you guys say it’s schizophrenia, It kind of makes sense... should I call the parents? Honestly her parents are off a bit too

**Update 2:**

Today she told me she will plans to meet her kpop husband despite what I said. However at this point I'm pretty certain she is not actually communicating with anyone, I think she is having delusions like some of you guys said. Though I told her to bring a friend just in case. She could't produce a single screenshot of a message he had sent. I'm pretty sure her ""ex-bf"" who stood her up 20 times was also a delusion. 

 I called her for a short conversation so I could gauge her mental status. She seemed fairly normal until I questioned her about her kpop husband. She said that she's already featured in korean magazines and that people in public are trying to sneak views at her phone because they are jealous. She also said she would be on the Late Late show with James Corden this week. She would repeat stuff like ""I'm not even lying"", ""It's real"" ""It's the truth"" ,""I'm not making this up"" quite often. It was creepy and pretty sad, I remember her being kind and innocent. 

By luck, I got in contact with another cousin I barely know. I asked if he had heard anything about our cousin and he said that she is known to be a bit of a psycho. Apparently her grandparents (my aunt/uncle) know that she has mental issues, and told her parents to take her to a doctor, but they didn't listen. Her father is kind of an off guy so I could see him stubbornly refusing to listen or believe it. 

I'm going to call her grandparents tomorrow and see what they say.

I've been looking at schizophrenia symptoms and they fit pretty damn well.. she is also at the age when it typically manifests. What do you guys think.. What if her parents refuse to listen? Do I just have to watch my cousin's brain rot until she goes insane or kills herself. I want to yell at her parents..",18Jun2018,8

179,"Bit of background. I've been trying to get my bachelor's degree in an engineering discipline for a while now. It has taken me a long time to get where I am, but I'm still a decent amount away from graduating - it was only until recently that I was officially considered a Junior. I've made it past the required math and science courses which has basically opened the gates for me to begin my engineering specific courses. The coursework was very difficult for me but I persevered. 

I didn't enjoy what I was doing but I didn't exactly hate it either, that was up until now. I just finished taking my first semester of engineering-specific classes and it was borderline soul shattering. After about a month in, I dreaded studying for any of my classes. None of the material was interesting, exams gave me anxiety because I tried to avoid studying until the last possible minute and it was overall a bad time. I started to drink in excess. Hard liquor maybe 3 times a week for 2-3 months. I needed something to take my mind off of school even if just for a couple of hours.

Fast forward to end of the semester, I passed all of my courses but any spark of motivation I had to continue has been put out. I feel like I'm starting to hit a wall, as if this is the furthest I can go unless something changes. I'm taking summer courses and actually have a test in a couple hours from now which I haven't bothered to study for.

I don't know what to do. I've been working part-time since I started college but the pay is shit so essentially I'm broke all the time. Every week I make enough to pay for gas, some food, and whatever scraps I have left I'm tempted to buy alcohol with. Every night is becoming insufferable. I feel like there's no way out.

Her other siblings have ADHD, slight autism and social anxiety. 
Over the last few months I have been observing my girlfriends behaviour (she is 17 nearly 18 and I’m 21 - yes it’s legal in Australia) and she shows mild signs of her 8 year old sisters condition. She goes from being really good to really bad really quickly, she will hit me till she’s too tired to hit me anymore. Lucky she’s only 5’1 and tiny while I’m 6ft and go to the gym everyday so I  have atleast 30kgs on her but it’s getting hard because it’s taking a toll on my health. I am drained, quiet down a lot and just sometimes fed up with her just always wanting to do stuff that she wants to do and never what I want to do. 
Now I know I’m not perfect and I think I have a form of ADHD because I’m hyper active and just abit highly strung but I’ve gained a lot of patience and moving out of home for a few years helped me mature and try to control myself. 
I just need advice because I love her so much and I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how much I can take. Like I said I love her so much. She’s my first girlfriend and I am hopeful it will get better but I just need some support as what to do. 
Sorry if this is all over the place. She’s lying down on my lap after one of her outburst watching a video that’s seeming have calmed her down. 
Thankyou in advance.",18Jun2018,2
182,"I'm a 17 year old girl, a high school sophomore and I've been familiar with therapy since I was 16. I've been to 3 different shrinks before my current one, which I have visited the most.

At first, i was kind of forced to go to therapy after I ran away from home. No, I wasn't proclaimed missing because my mother never alerted the police, she knew where I was temporarily living. In the end, social services found out and that's when the police had to take me to a station to write an explanation and take me back home afterwards.

My first therapist was the least effective of them all and I stopped seeing her after my first session. The second one was more or less acting as a pair of bellows for my ego. The third one focused more on my family issues when I didn't want to deal with that.

I started seeing my current therapist a few months ago after my ex- best friend recommended her to me. That was when I exhibited suicidal tendencies (no attempts at taking my life just obsessively thinking about the idea) and I talked to her about how I might have depression. She found out that I don't.

I've discussed a lot of things with her- how I feel empty most of the time, how nobody cares about me, nobody likes me, love life is at an all- time low etc. She pins the source of these problems on my pessimistic point of view and lack of self- confidence and charisma. Then we start arguing because I keep telling her that I can't change, I can't feel content and have an optimistic, happy- go- lucky demeanour when i'm living in an unfair society where it's easier to give up rather than waste one's time trying to change something.

I haven't gone to a session since last week. I'm deliberating about going once again but I feel that nothing will change. I want to give up and lose all hope of it getting better but that part of me is in conflict with my stubbornness. 

tl;dr: Constantly arguing with my shrink, feel like there's no point in continuing. Should i cease or continue?",18Jun2018,1

185,"
I’ve graduated high school a year ago but I never had a girlfriend. I used to be bullied a lot for being overweight. The physical bullying never bothered me because I would fight them off pretty brutally. What really hurt for me was the emotional and verbal stuff which I had no idea how to defend myself against. It didn’t help either that I was Indian too. So since I’ve graduated, I’ve made an active effort to be the opposite of who I used to be. I work out regularly (built kinda like an MMA featherweight now), I make sure I get proper haircuts and decent clothes and I even act more attractive now. I’m now one of the more popular kids in my cohort and have great relationships with my peers in my class and beyond. I really want a relationship but I can’t because of how vain I’ve become. I would constantly pester my dad about his opinions on my appearance and I’ve become extremely insecure about the size of my penis (4.8 inches erect). I’ve started learning techniques in oral sex and practising them on toys to compensate for this but I’m still terribly insecure. Furthermore, I’ve been traumatised for taking it upon myself to get evidence of my mom cheating on my dad. This involved taking screenshots of chat logs with her complimenting her boyfriend’s “European genitals” as well as taking pictures of her getting physical with him in bed. I’ve also been abused by both parents as well. I really want to be in a relationship but I think I’m too small (penis-wise and self-esteem-wise) for anyone and I’m too paranoid. It’s really been a downer on my mood. I don’t know what to do. I would love a relationship but I’m scared that no matter how good of a partner I’ll be she’ll ditch me solely because of my size and sleep with a larger guy. ",18Jun2018,2

We dated for a long time and everything seemed perfect on my end but she never spoke up about issues she had with me so they festered inside of her.

I was furious but I know she felt guilty and things because she couldn’t even look me in the eyes or talk to me during this time.  When we spoke last she held me and our conversation revealed the chemistry that still lies between us. I know she feels something for me still and I’m willing to wait while she works out things.

196,"So my Roommate got a puppy. It is 100% my their dog and, personally, I have absolutely no interest in dogs, having a dog, or playing with a dog. But. 

My Roommate often works late, so when I get home the dog is in the house alone. Even though It's not my dog, I understand it's a social creature and, because we live in the same house, it regards me as a pack-mate. So it often follows me around when I'm home and my roommate isn't. It is very excitable and jumps up and play bites (it's obviously not trying to hurt me, but it will bite at my face, hands, and feet when I come home.) On a Nice day I usually let it outside and forget about it (Or it's already outside when I gt home), but on a Rainy, Cold or Windy day I think that's a bit cruel, so I keep it inside. the problem is, if I'm the only one in the house, it wants to follow me around. If I close my door, it will sit at my door and bark or whine until either a) my roommate gets home, or b) I let it in. When I let it in *sometimes* it just jumps on my bed and goes to sleep. I don't have any problem with this, but usually it wants to play and jumps up at me or snaps at me. I understand it's an energy-filled puppy it wants to play. I understand that it's been home along for 6+ hours and is excited to see a friend. I don't really blame it or anything - i'd be excited for company if I was stuck in a room for 6 hours - but at the end of the day It's not my dog and I have no interest in having a dog. I don't really want to spend my time taking it for works or playing fetch with it in the yard. 

But I feel like I'm stuck with it, because for whatever reason, it likes me. And my roommate isn't home yet. 

So how can I make sure I'm doing right by the dog without giving up all my free time? I always check it's food and water when I get home, but should I also commit to spending 15 minutes with it? If so, what would I do for that time? a quick walk? I've never lived in the same house as a dog before, so this is new ground for me. ",18Jun2018,1
197,"T:L:D:R at bottom.

I’m 15 and live in Tasmania, Australia. No one in my family (that I know of) has ever had a job, including my parents. We have gotten all our money from a government run place called Centrelink (I’m pretty sure it’s a welfare system, but I don’t really know, I know that it gives us money every week/month though).

Last night I was talking to a friend of mine that lives in NSW, Australia (I used to live in NSW) saying that he managed to get a job at the local McDonalds, suddenly it occurred to me that I should probably work on getting one as although it may sound mean, especially since it’s right after Father’s Day, but I do not want to turn out like my parents.

There’s several problems I fear may prevent me from getting a job

1) The area in which I live is roughly a 50 minute drive from the city, something my mum would not be willing to do every day or every 2/3 Days.

2) I am unaware of any jobs in my local community, although I assume that they’d all be jobs like moving stuff around or yard work or fixing little things - Something I’d be open to but it wouldn’t really be a first choice of mine.

3) I have no clue how a resume works. I googled one but the ones I came across just didn’t really help. I just simply don’t know what to put inside a resume.

There’s other small issues which I doubt would get in the way, so I’ve kept them out of this post for the sake of making it shorter for you guys.

T:L:D:R: I have no experience or knowledge about getting a job, I don’t have anyone that could help other than a friend that is often very busy, there’s also three main issues that I fear could get in the way 1) Transportation would not be ideal as it’d be likely that I’d have no way of getting to and from a job, 2) I’m unaware of any jobs in my local community that would employ people under 18 years old, and 3) Resumes are difficult.",18Jun2018,1

The other week my sister saw a picture of my girlfriend as it was the background of my phone and she asked who it was. So i decided to tell her that it was my girlfriend. Despite my protests she began bombarding me with questions, whats her name, how long have you been together etc. We didnt get very far into the conversation when she asked if I met her at university. Hesitantly, i told her that i met her online. My sister burst out laughing, i just stood their awkwardly whilst she laughed at me, and then proceeded to call my girlfriend a catfish. I was so embarassed and angry, and she made me feel like absolute shit. So i just walked off without saying anything.

203,"We spend 8 hours a day together 4 days a week, just us two (don't want to share job for privacy reasons, but it's something like housekeeping/ cleaning at a medical facility). She's been very passive aggressive, very angry in her physical actions, very frustrated and very very sad (I've caught her crying but pretended I didn't see, see her hide behind her glasses/ hair, but her face is all red and stuff) . I've only asked her about it once; ""Are you ok/ is there anything I can do"" (this was on a day where it was the worst) but she said no, she wasn't ok, and that there was nothing I could do. I left it alone after that and give her as much space as I can (as much as possible in the room we work in). She's been very easy to annoy so I've mostly had my head down and minded my own business (apart from bringing her cakes and chocolates sometimes).

204,"As a preface, let me say that I love my future spouse no matter what. She and I have had a loving six years together (I’m 28, she’s 31). There’s been issues admittedly, but our resolve has been amazing. We do well moving past problems because we have a deep understand of each other. I don’t want a different partner in life.

Also, let me state that I do not view anybody as inferior if they are obese or out of shape. It’s your body and your choice. It is not in my capacity to judge you or anyone else. Love yourself for who you are.

There was a time that we both practiced bad eating habits and didn’t exercise. I suppose it isn’t uncommon, being comfortable in a relationship and letting go a bit. We would binge episodes of Always Sunny (when it was on Netflix) and eat McDonalds late night or order greasy food with soda regularly. We both smoked and went to bars, drinking overpriced, sugary mixed drinks. In retrospect, it was a little gross.

Maybe about two years ago, I made the decision to cut out fast food and soda from my diet and begin exercising. I started running and scaled back my intake and changed what I ate. I bought healthy food and produce instead of ordering us pizza. My fiancé thought I was going overboard with my routine and being too “intense” but I was just honestly trying to incorporate good change into my life.

Fast forward to present and I’m in the best shape I’ve ever been in and I’m pretty decent at cooking too. My fiancé is still overweight and eats terribly. She’s talked about getting into shape because I believe she truly wants to and has a gym membership, but hasn’t committed to the journey of fitness. She works two jobs 5-6 days a week and seems pretty exhausted from work as she just wants to relax and sit on the couch with her phone. On her day(s) off she wants to lounge at our pool and drink because it’s the only time she has to do it. Most of the people she surrounds herself with are also overweight and don’t eat well.

I don’t want to feel superficial or like an asshole, but I do feel like our intimacy is lacking because sexually she isn’t as appealing as when we met because she has let herself go physically. I know she would be just as attractive as she was six years ago if she took care of herself. 
I’ve tried to suggest her committing to exercise, but it just stresses her out and creates an argumentative atmosphere. Admittedly, there have been two occasions where I’ve been blunt about it, but otherwise I’ve tried hard to be as compassionate as possible while communicating that I still love her. 

What the hell do I do? Am I being a pig and should I just let it be (happy wife, happy life mentality)? I don’t think offering an ultimatum is correct, but could it be a move to make? Do I need to directly communicate my thoughts on the sexually attractiveness? I know her default answer will be that she always works and doesn’t have time/gets too stressed out dealing with it; how do I drill past that and help her? It’s not like she doesn’t want to become fit, but it is almost as if she’s afraid of it. Help, please!",18Jun2018,9

209,"So a quick backstory, for you guys to know what is going on. I'm currently going into my second year of high school in America, but I was born in Japan, me being 1/4 Japanese. I've been in America pretty much my whole life, but I go back to Japan every other summer break, which is right now. 

Anyways, whenever I come to Japan, I enroll as an exchange student for a month or two of my summer break, and go to a Japanese school for that period of time. I have done this 3 or 4 times, and every time I've done this, its fun and everything goes smoothly. But this time, its a little different. While I might be a sophomore in high school, I'm still a 3rd year JH in Japan (junior high) because of the different school schedules in Japan. But that means next year, Ill be entering high school in Japan if I was to stay here. 

Now, here's where I'm having a little trouble. I was planning to go to school here in Japan for a total of 1 month, so around a week and a half more. But my parents and grandparents brought up the idea of me staying here for good, finishing up middle school and going to high school here in Japan, without going back to America. Or, I could do as I originally planned and just enjoy my summer break and go back to America. 

If I was to stay here and start a new school life, I wouldn't be able to go back to say my farewells to my friend, family and currently my girlfriend back in America. I would also leave behind my newly adopted cat (like c'mon I don't wanna leave my cat). 

On the other side, school in Japan is a lot more friendly, welcoming, and safer compared to anything in America. Everyone's polite and nice, and nobody had a problem with me asking a bunch of questions in class since I don't know Japanese as well as my English. And if I stay here, I will be able to live in a city than in a town, which is nice for a change. Ill be able to pursue my dream of being a musician here since there are many teachers and amazing bands that I could join, and most of all, Ill be able to spend time with my grandparents on both my dad and mothers side, since I don't know how much time they have left on earth. 

I am not sure what to do. If I do plan to stay here in Japan, I will miss my family, friends and girlfriend very much, on top of the fact that I will most likely never see them again. I will miss my kitty cat, as well as my decently big house since ill be living in an apartment here. My girlfriend has been going through some rough times, and she was really excited to go to homecoming with me the following year. She is the sweetest, most caring person I know. All of this, on top of the fact that I will not see my parents for a very long time, the people that I personally trust the most. 

But there will be a lot of opportunities here, better education, a safer learning space, music, and opportunities to make new friends. 

I am very much divided inside, I'm not sure what to do. I have to make my decision very soon, and I don't have anyone I can talk to that's not biased. Please, take this seriously and if anyone can give me any advice, I will be thankful.",18Jun2018,3

I have friends, but my closest friends are the most toxic. They treat me bad all the time, and I fucking hate them. I only stick around because one has a broken family, and one has suicidal tendencies. Is it worth it to stick around and take the abuse? Or can I leave? 

One time she made a group and called a position before the group was even made, without a fair trial. Then she proceeds to say that she’ll make the audio (it was a audio thing for school). Then she says that she gets to control what’s in t even though it’s a group effort, and then she never actually did it.
Also, I can never argue with them because one person always has their back even when they’re completely wrong.

For a period of time they ACTUALLY believed cats were a liquid. Like actual dumbasses. So I explained it to them MULTIPLE times. Then after I explain it in so much detail they’re stunned, they say “it was just a joke” even when they clarified that it wasn’t.

One time one of them has said shit like “Fatass” and “Fucking worthless piece of garbage”. 

Another time they have done things like hit me over the head with a book, continuously touch me when I ask them not to, ignore me when I’m talking to them, or halfway through talking they’ll just cut me off without saying anything to me.

I can keep going, but this would be the size of a bible. Would it be okay to ditch them?",18Jun2018,1
213,"I recently got married to the love of my life, but I’ve recently started to feel anxious about some things I felt at the beginning of our relationship. During the first few months we dated my now husband informed me that he had cheated on his last neglectful, long distance girlfriend; They broke up shortly after. While he never cheated on me, that made me feel worried that would happen again sometime in our relationship. He’s given me no reason to believe he’d cheat on me; he’s taken care of me since we first started dating, tells me everyday how much he loves me and loves being married to me, and has given up his bad habits like smoking for me as well. Despite telling myself this, I still can’t shake the feeling I’ll be cheated on and have had numerous nightmares about it. I grew up in an environment where most of the men cheated on their s/o and learning that he’s previously cheated as well has not helped my anxiety. I know I should trust him however, so how do learn to trust him more?

TL;DR: my husband cheated in his previous relationship and it’s making me paranoid. How do I trust him more?",18Jun2018,1

She seemed a bit angry so I walked in wanting to help her as I play a bit myself.

215,"Hey guys, the title pretty much says what’s going on. 

About 3 weeks ago, I got a new temporary housemate (for a total of 4 of us) for the summer while one of our permanent housemates is away. The guy is pretty cool: nice enough, clean, and pays rent on time. 

He told us that he was gay the second night while we were talking. I forget the conversation but someone asked him, “come on [new roommate], you’d fuck her, wouldn’t you?” He just replied, “yeah, if you got rid of the boobs, vagina, hair, and gave her a penis, yeah I’d fuck her.” We all had a laugh and moved on. 

A couple weeks go by, and I notice he’s starting to get more friendly with me. Sitting pretty close to me on the couch, touching my shoulder/back as he walks by. At first I just chalked it up to him being a touchy-feely and friendly kind of guy. Then it started to get a bit more overt. It’s difficult to explain, but you could almost just tel. 

I brought it up to him, said if I did anything to miscommunicate my sexuality, that it was unintentional, but I’m not interested. He brushed it off like it was nothing. Neither confirmed nor denied his actions. 

As the days go by, it’s more of the same, and I just figured my second guess that he was a touchy person was right. Then he actively cock-blocked me on two separate occasions. I didn’t say anything after the first time, but confronted him that that’s not cool the second time. Same reaction as before, equivocally brushed it off. The next day, he puts his hand on my thigh as we’re sitting down. Still pissed off, I just looked at him and said “move that.” He smirks and moves his hand. Nothing more came of it. 

Any advice on what to do in this situation? I don’t want to bring it up to the landlord because even if he does move out, we’d have to cover his rent (and they’d most likely ask me to cover it since no one else is having a problem with this dude), and it’s surprisingly difficult to find clean roommates who pay rent on time ",18Jun2018,3

218,"My boss(60sF) recently sent a screenshot of a really bad review that claims a bunch of bad things happened when she went shopping in our store, like that no one helped her out of our 2 sales girls. Now our shop is a one-man shop so thats a little weird.


Anyway, she sent the review in a text to me and my only other coworker in a group chat along with, ""I just would like to understand."" which I found pretty unprofessional but whatever. THEN, she texted my mom!!


 To explain a little, my mom was the one who referenced me for this job as I have a lot of experience and they needed a salesperson. So they do know each other but shes not at all involved. She texted her something pretty annoying saying, ""Im on vacation, etc. I thought your daughter was perfect. So sad.""  Again, I find that pretty immature. It angered my mom.


She never called me individually and I never responded. It was sent 2 days ago (Saturday) and I found out she texted my mom Sunday. Is it okay to text her back now? I've been advised I should text her back firmly because she did accuse me without even knowing it was me or knowing what truly happened. She even got her daughter (a manager at the store) to call casually and she inquired about me bringing a friend into the store. Obviously, I denied it and she placated and said of course she didnt believe it.


Is it too late? Can I still answer saying check the cameras and I always do my job etc? I'm going to give my 2 weeks as soon as I find another job anyway.

226,"I live in Detroit. This past Friday, I was out running in my neighborhood, and came across what looked to be a stray cat. I have come across other cats outside when running before, but they've looked healthy, and had a collar on. This particular cat looked anemic - skin and bones, and clearly had some sort of issue with its tongue getting stuck on the sides of its mouth.

Being the owner of 2 previously stray cats (check for microchips), I felt I needed to do something. I took it back home (only a couple blocks away) and fed it some food and water. This was past 6, when everything was closed. Vet offices, animal shelters, humane society, even animal control.

I didnt want to risk bringing it inside with the other 2 cats that are mine, so I tried my best to keep it in my backyard, which is fenced in. I saw that the humane society was open the next morning on Saturday - but by the time that came, the cat was gone.

When it showed up again, it was again past the time everything was closed. During that same day, we had some friends over, and a inflatable pool that we were hanging out in. Cat had stuck around most of the evening and all was well.

The next morning.. we found the cat dead... in our pool. The thing looked so feeble and weak, we're not sure how it even got in there. We placed it in a box, and were contacting the correct department that safely disposes of dead strays - closed until Monday morning.

So, now, here we are, Monday morning, and I contact them, and they are on their way. My partner put the box out by the side of the road. On their way to work, they saw a lost cat poster - same cat. My partner called them and had to leave a message.

What do we do? Hold on to the body? What are the possible repercussions? I  just wanted to give this poor kitty food, and get it to a humane society or SOMETHING, to give it a better chance at life, than what I  believed out on the streets. This cat had no collar, and we never had the opportunity to check for microchips.

This cat was 18 years old, according to the poster - why would anyone let a feeble, old cat like that be an outside cat?

230,"TL;DR Trying to figure out if I should go for the state department, peace corps, or go for something else entirely.

Hello All,

I graduated with a bachelors from University about a year ago, my entire time there I was very open with everyone that I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. Everyone kept saying don't worry you'll figure it out, just keep doing your thing.

While there I served in Student Government, eventually to an executive cabinet position. Since then, I've been a manager at a concert hall, went back to the restaurant industry for awhile. Currently I've joined a temp agency to try a bunch of different jobs out to see if any of them feel right. My current assignment is at a non-profit, and I enjoy it there and they enjoy having me there, I don't see myself continuing and staying in the position.

I really like service and non-profit work, in the future I think it would be amazing to be a city-councilor or a public servant in some form, but I think about doing that when I'm established and have a family.

As for now I really don't know where to go, I've had a few people approached me to tell me I should join the State Department or Peace Corps. In fact, my current boss, who did two years in Kenya with the Peace Corps, told me I should really consider it, that I seem the type that would do really well with them. As for the State Department, given that they just went through a hiring freeze, the unstable leadership, and the sheer amount of dedication in exams and evaluations, also that I don't know any current foreign officers I have no idea if I'm the right type to join the State Department or if it's necessarily the right time. 

The thought of going abroad makes me feel eager for the future, especially for work for an extended period of time. I really think it's important to experience the world as a whole the best one can given that globalization is such a driving force in this day and age. I've never been abroad, due to financial or responsibility restraints, my parents are also huge influences in my life, and both of them really don't want to encourage me going abroad, but understand that it something that I want. Weirdly, or maybe not weirdly, they are more fine with me joining the military because since I have a degree I would be going in as an officer. I've weighed the idea but I don't feel as passionately about it. 

My other hold back from doing abroad work is that as excited it makes me feel, it also makes me really nervous. Since I feel nervous I feel I'm not as ready or as good of a fit as I want to be to do work abroad.

Basically anybody who has any advice or perspective would be wonderful, I don't want to get stagnated in doing temp work for the rest of my life, and I feel like the decision should be made sooner rather than later.

Thank you.",18Jun2018,1
231,"I have been going out with this guy for the past year and I honestly don't know what to do anymore. 

We are from different nationalities and I moved to his country to live closer to him and keep the relationship going, since we met during summer vacation last year. It began as a back and forth relationship but with very strong feelings, which is why I decided to move here. In the other country things were not going well and I didn't have more study reasons to keep me there. And I love this new city I'm living in. 

About my boyfriend, he's not the most boyfriend material kinda guy. He's 28 and apparently I'm the first person he's actually dated longer than a couple of months. The problem is he's really immature and selfish sometimes. I'm starting to realize he's not as into me as I am into him and he's not ready to make efforts to show love.   
We've had a lot of fights, our whole relationship is based on fights since I've tried very hard to explain to him certain relationship aspects (that you would expect from someone who's 28) but he's absolutely clueless about. He's left me down so many times and whenever I tried to explain it to him, or how I felt, or how I think we could work better, he turns defensive, childish, generalizes behaviours and yells. 

Thurday we had an argument, he was talking about doing stuff for my birthday and travelling to a place he's already gone with a friend in the past. He has a past with this friend and we've done some trips that he said the same thing, how he's done that with her before. I didn't mind it before because she's actually our friend who introduced us, I'm not going to be jealous of their past, but for my birthday I wanted to do something new with him, not something that he has already done. He got mad at me, we fought and that was it. I tried to come and see him saturday to lighten things up and hang out, he was moody and nothing I did made anything better. Sunday I was feeling bad, because I'm currently doing treatment for an infection and I have some liver pain and was feeling down a bit. I asked if we could meet up and hang out, he had a lot of excuses and we didn't see each other. This morning I asked if he was ok, and wished him to have a nice week. He said that he feels better but he was still mad at me for the fight. I just can't do it anymore.

243,"Im 26, My Dad is 84.

A while back, he brought home a bench from the graveyard to restore as it was broken. He fixed it up and took it back there. - Now the other week he went there and it was missing, then he found it in a nearby woods. 

Now just now he asked if I would go with him to move it. 

Then on the way down he starts talking about how we need to be careful if there is any lads on it or something. We get down there and this fucked up shitty bench is in the middle of fucking no where woods next to this grave yard.  Next to an old bombfire and some other shit - So we carry it about 100 metres back to where he wanted it to be - saying its for the people who are visiting the graves of their loved ones. No one has the right to take it where they want it etc etc. 

So we move it there and start comming out, and there is an absolute pikey fucking looking guy staring at me. For about 30 metres  as we walked back towards the car. He is clearly taking a photo of me, or me and my Dad on his phone. 

He said something to me but I couldn't hear him. But he either was probably the guy that moved it or hangs out with the people that probably did. He looked like an absolute wretch of a man. 

So we leave and go home. 

But what worries me is my Dad is fearless and thinks he is still bad. He used to be tough but he is a frail 84 year old man. He wanted to speak to this guy to let him know its for people to view the graves - he says - 'I wasn't the manager of the social services in charge of 50 people for nothing'. 

But he doesn't seem to understand there are people out there who will mug him, or attack him just because they can. 

I have been sucker punched twice in this town by people who I have never met. Yet my Dad seems to thing nothing will ever happen to him. 

I feel like I have to constantly look out for him because he sticks his neck out all the fucking time. 

The bench doesn't belong to us anyway! He says he is doing it out the kindness of his heart, and to put things right. 

But I prefer to remain inconspicuous. I don't want everyone knowing me because of him, and I don't want to be associated with a lot of people.

i don't know if I should admire his courage or if he is being a fucking idiot. 

But its not the kind of thing I would fuck with, it doesn't feel like my place to. 

I hate this it feels like since I have been 17/18 there has been a complete role reversal. And I don't want him doing shit like this on his own incase he gets himself killed or in trouble. 

The thing is a lot of these thugs will only see him as an old man - they dont know or care who he used to be, he is basically unrecognizable from the days he was in the RAF and running marathons etc. So I feel like its my place to watch out for him like a child.

I tried reaching out to her in the beginning of his and I’s relationship and nothing really happened. He and I have been together almost a year and a half.

249,"i’ve been dating this girl for 6 months, i am madly in love and she is too. a friday night ago she and her friends went out and got drunk. the next night, a saturday, her and her friends tripped acid at their house. the next morning, sunday, she asked for me to go see her. i pulled up to her house and she asked if we can sit in my car and talk. i didn’t say anything. she started with, “remember friday night when i went out?.. i did something.. with somebody.. i had sex with someone..” i was angry. i’ve never been more angry in my life. i just felt this urge to punch her in the face, i said “yeah i think we should break up.” she started crying, saying shes so sorry, that she blacked out that night and doesn’t even remember. but she wasn’t raped, she knew what she was doing. words were exchanged between us and i said “get the fuck out of my car.” i drove off, she kept texting me and calling me, saying “please no come back” i said “ok” and i went back to her house. she kept asking if there’s anything she could do because she truly loves me and can live without me. she’s just.. idk.. she’s turning into a different person. the people she’s living with aren’t good for her. all they do is get drunk together. i haven’t been able to trust her in a while now. it just seems like she was always hiding something from me. she kept crying saying this was the only bad thing she’s ever done and she hopes i can forgive her and maybe try again with our relationship one day. she called my best friend who lives across the world and asked him stuff like “is it really over between me and OP? i can’t live without him im supposed to marry him i fucked up so bad i can’t do this without him” and she regrets it more than anything. this shit hurts, i’ve been cheated on twice before. but this girl is supposed to be the love of my life, the connection i have with her is unlike anything i’ve ever had with anyone. and she feels the same with me. im afraid ill never find someone like her again. she was truly the best thing to ever happen to me, but, i can’t stop thinking about her being with someone else sexually, it hurts. i wish this all never happened. i know none of this is my fault, i don’t hate myself, i hate her actions. she texted me a long paragraph with the main point being “i know i fucked up really bad, and i know you are done with me but i’m not done with you, i hate who i am becoming, this isn’t me, i hope you can forgive me, im going to become a better person for you, and for me, i hope we can try this again in the future because i love you and i can’t live without you. ill stop drinking and going out i promise ill do anything i just can’t lose you” and i believe her, i know she truly loves and cares for me like no one ever has. but.. she had sex with someone else. i guess i need advice for, should i ever get back with her? i loved her more than anything.. and she’s the most prettiest person ive met, i will truly never find someone as beautiful as her. i don’t think things will be the same if we ever do get back together. this is a lot to handle but i’m handling it well, keep a clear mind you know. i feel like i’ll look stupid if i do get back with her. im nervous about what do to.

250,"**Tl:dr** - young kids openly destroying property need a way to keep them away. Can't build fence. At witts end with these little bastards.

I live in a group of townhouses where all the lawn is 'common grounds'. No unit has, or is permitted a fence or fenced in area. Five meters behind each unit is considered part of the unit and small decks and gardens are permitted, but again no fence. There are several families with kids but two units in partucular are the issue. 

The kids of 2 units are the real problem. 6 kids aged 5-10yrs rove the property freely, unsupervised, and cause a lot of damage. They openly destroy anything with the larges sticks, rocks, or pipes they can find. Nothing is safe and they even destroy their own toys. From 7am-10pm they are running around and causing such a ruckus it is impossable to have a window open without being disturbed by screaching or smashing.

Going to the parents has yeilded no results. Trying to talk to the kids makes one's garden or  'back yard' a further target, including yourself via spitting or water pistols filled with various liquids. The condo board has some bylaws that would assist (noise limitations/destruction of property) but they do nothing to enforce them.

As the kids seem to be well fed and clothed child services does nothing, other than tell the parents to supervise the kids, which they still do not, and the parents only put on a show of caring if CS or other officials are around.

The other kids that live here do their best to avoid the 'screaming 6' due to bullying, toy theft and toy destruction, and are actually nice, well behaved kids (3-15yro).

I need constructive suggestions that can get these little buggers to back off and leave my uinit, and others, alone. ",18Jun2018,2
251,"So my partner and I have come to have/foster two dogs. 

One is a 6 month old toy poodle and the other is a large 3 year old mutt (looks like a Shepard/Husky) 

Tonight is the first night we have had them both. 

The bigger dog has had a long day; train ride, vets, a new environment, missing their owner. 

While the poodle has had a regular day in paradise. 

We have brought them in the same room together (after allowing the bigger dog to smell around the apartment and get a bit comfortable) and as soon as the poodle ran about the floor the bigger dog growled/snarled. 

Right now clearly they are separated again. 

We hope that is just the case of being tired, uncomfortable etc that led to the aggressive reaction.

255,"The other night my husband and I were talking about something sexual he recently said and when I asked where he heard that from he said from his co-worker. I was weirded out that he could have such an intimate conversation with a co-worker and he ended up presenting me with all of their texts. They used to work together four years ago then he went to a new company and now she just came to his current company less than two months ago. She even once told him that she was attracted to him when she was married to her ex. Now she's divorced.

In the past two months they have exchanged hundreds of texts. Some are work related but many of them about just random things and often very flirtatious. He has asked her about her dating/sex life but I noticed that most of the flirty texts are usually from her end - lots of smiley and winking emojis, inside jokes, asking him to go places with her, and even offering to massage him (which he declined). Some of it was just inappropriate for a work friendship and he even said he was uncomfortable with some of the messages. But still he never told her to stop and never brought this up to me despite telling me about less interesting interactions with his other employees. He was very apologetic for letting it get to that point and promised that he would talk to her and basically tell her that she's being inappropriate and to back off. 

The thing is, I had met her a few times years ago and have her on Facebook myself. I'm wondering if I should also msg her to make sure the message gets heard. I'm not gonna be like GET AWAY FROM MY MAN or anything like that. Just to say ""hey can you please keep me in mind when you interact with him and remember that he is your coworker"". I know that she and her ex divorced when she discovered flirty texts between him and his colleague so now she's doing the same thing with me and my husband now as the ""other woman"". Maybe my msg will force her to recall what she went through when she was in my shoes. Or maybe it won't idk. Is this a terrible idea? I have bad anxiety and I keep thinking how far it may have gone if I didn't stumble on this. Or how they interact in person...

We gave each other our gmails (Yes some people use it) and we go to know each other a little bit. Im a guy she was a girl (We were just friends nothing more) and I’m 1 month and 1 day older than her (Im 15). We live in the same timezone in the U.S. but far away from each other. We regularly talked and played video games together almost every day. We were friends for about 7-9 months or so in total before the occurrence. She was the best friend I had online. I always remind myself that nothing good lasts forever. In January of this year I thought to myself: “How could our friendship end?” We didn’t know what the other liked like, or voices, so all we did was talk to each other through gmail. Through our friendship we learned that we had an extraordinary amount of similarities. I guess thats why we were friends. A few months ago she said she talked to her parents and said she was gonna stop talking to me because they didn’t believe who I said I was so yea. Poof. Like that. Gone. I never thought that would happen so suddenly but I guess I can’t be wrong when I said nothing good lasts forever. I can still contact her but I don’t want to push her away even more.

257,"Hi all, throwaway because both people involved frequent reddit. 

So long story short, 5 years ago, my fiancé (then 15 yo) was at a party with my best friend (then 16 yo). There was lots of drinking, to the point that my best friend doesn’t remember the night. Fast forward to 2 months ago; My fiancé sends her an apology letter saying that he’s sorry that he put his hand down her pants that night, and that after she said “stop” he felt so ashamed that he left the party and has been feeling so much guilt ever since. My best friend was so shocked to read this apology letter because she didn’t remember a thing. At first, she laughed it off and said she didn’t remember anyway so it’s fine. 

So now, 2 months later, my best friend is not speaking to me and is seeking counseling (which is great, but cutting me out caught me off guard). She hates my fiancé and can’t seem to process the information. 
My fiancé has apologized profusely for doing it and for not telling me for so long, to the point of breaking down several times. He has been nothing but amazing in our relationship for the past 5 years, which is why this was such a hard pill to swallow for me. We called off our wedding to work through this. 

My question for you guys is, what should I be doing? My best friend doesn’t want anything to do with me - is she being dramatic or am I being too insensitive about the situation? My fiancé is seeking a therapist, since this has been a root for his depression the past few years (he told me this after the apology letter was sent).

The pressure I felt to not be poor led me to major in biology, a subject i had no interest in, do poorly, and then take four years of random admin/receptionist type jobs which made me even more depressed (I hated them). During that time, I also took some design/art classes because I was always good at them as a kid. Tried to be a designer, and a lawyer, but failed at both school admissions exams. I also love business/money/numbers but can't get into a top MBA. 

After some serious self-reflection, I realize I inadvertently have become the person I dreaded becoming. My background makes me seem indecisive and all over the place. While I would work constantly, more than anyone else, I still failed at everything I did. I realized it was for two reasons:
1. I truly believed I wasn't enough as I was, so I was trying to compensate via career, but because I secretly didn't like myself, I was sabotaging.
2. There was also some comfort/survival mechanism at play about failing constantly, and I think feeling successful made me feel undeserved and brought back memories from past successful people who were ""bad"" to me, whereas I equivocated the two.

Anyway, here I am, back at square one. I have no job (quit my last job) and can't get into school. I've been crying everyday because this was my worst fear and it came true.

The employees are:
3 assistants - A, B &amp; me 
3 attorneys - owner, managing attorney &amp; previous managing attorney 
1 receptionist

Managing attorney openly dislikes assistant B. She previously texted assistant b telling her she won’t accept her requests for time off or to leave early because assistant B asked a different attorney to leave early while managing attorney was out. 

Managing attorney has been talked to about her attitude and rudeness. 

Assistant B left for 2 months to study for bar exam. I took all her cases. 

On June 15,2018
Managing attorney instructed me to ask opposing counsel (attorney for the other person) a date our client (assistant B’s case) provided opposing counsel their documents. I call, no answer. I email opposing counsel asking for the date. She emails back stating our client did not properly serve the documents. I forward the email to managing attorney to get her in the loop. 

This same client calls me for an update because we are unprofessional and aren’t being responsive or settling his case. I inform managing attorney because it’s her case and ask her for an update to provide to the client. She ignores what I should respond to the client and says opposing counsel isn’t responding to our settlement offer and asks me what we should do. She then proceeds to say I do not cc her in any emails and I cannot be trusted with anything. (She is upset it is in writing that the client didnt properly serve opposing counsel, she later told me this in person). 

(Rewind to June 12,2018)
Managing attorney assigned me to do a response to a request on the day it was due 6/12/18. I’ve only ever done one response to a request (formal request in court). I completed it and provided it to her 6/15/18. I’ve been told by assistant A that deadlines aren’t super strict unless opposing counsel is.  I didn’t know we needed to respond to all requests in writing because they can be debated in court. I’ve only ever done one response! And it was recent. Managing attorney asks me (through our messenger app) if I know the deadline. I respond stating it was due 6/12. She says she cannot be telling me every little deadline. Assistant A says we do respond to all requests but managing attorney should have told me the deadline was coming up if I hadn’t done anything about it. I tell managing attorney I didn’t know we responded to all requests. She told me that was a red flag and we needed to discuss if I can or cannot meet what is needed to be done at work. 
I say ok. 

She calls me into her office. Tells me she’s putting me on probation for 90 days and says she has written a up list of requirements I am required to do as a case manager. I tell her I have only responded to one request and she doesn’t believe it, she is in shock that I’ve only done one and says “we must not give you enough work” and “that’s still no excuse we’ve gone over these deadlines”. I say ok. She goes over her requirements and schedules to meet with me again 8/15/18. 60 days out not 90. I sign her list of expectations. 


Everyone I’ve told say she is upset I told her she wasn’t doing her job right (client was upset we don’t follow up) and that made her upset. I don’t know what it is but I have always been respectful to her and she has been respectful to me with minor attitude problems from her. Her and assistant B though, they yell at each other or give major attitude but it has calmed down.

In early May there was a personal emergency that involved her so we were forced to resolve that, which I am glad to say has been resolved. Since then, however, I have been getting harassing messages from someone that I believe to be an ex of my ex. Some anonymous and one through facebook. I have no proof that they are all from the same person but I have my suspicions. I have a feeling that us briefly talking in May set him off as if they were talking or something, I really dont know and I really dont care. The one facebook message was from his personal account and the rest were anonymous. 



Anyway, my question is: should I get a restraining order against one/both of them if shes possibly encouraging this? I cant imagine him doing it while she was unaware. My other option is to let it die down (which it has been, thankfully) and just forget it? I don't believe I am in any danger, but I would like to just move on in peace.


I would prefer not to talk to either of them, even if its to tell them to stop. My current girlfriend thinks I should get the police involved but I recently had to get the police involved with the situation in May and I don't want to go through that all again.

Some background: He owns a small business that is mainly online. Before we were together, he leased a location for his business and moved 6 months before the lease was finished. So, he still owes what’s left. He doesn’t make enough to cover it. I understand that he works just to pay the bills, but the money he owes me just keeps growing. 

Over the weekend, he was thinking of making an offer to buy a duplex to rent out. He owns the office space that his business is currently at so he hopes the collateral is enough to purchase the duplex and to bring in more money. 

When we have small arguments, I can’t help to bring up the money he owes me. It is now 5,400. 

We live frugally because of his bills. When I moved in, he said we will get cable and internet but now he says it’s a waste of money. We never have money, we are always just on our phones, and I’m starting to feel unhappy. But I know he is trying his best. 

Also, after his interesting in buying and renting out duplexes, he says he wants to buy enough to retire and then we purchase our first home. He says it could be 8-10 years. What I wanted was to be in our own home within 5 years.

280,"For context, this isn't specifically about people I know (who almost never do it), or shops/other businesses (though they do it quite often). It extends, literally, to random strangers on the street. People I've never seen before have, on multiple occasions in just the past few months, accosted me and accused me of stealing something from them.

Details:

* It happens both inside and outside businesses.

* In businesses, I am often within five minutes of entering (sometimes *immediately*) confronted by security and/or the manager, who imply I'm stealing and ask me to empty my pockets, etc. Generally, if it's security, I ask to speak to their employer/manager; if it's the manager, I inform them they've overstepped their legal bounds (this sort of behaviour is illegal where I live).

* Outside businesses, the people are invariably someone I've never seen before, usually accusing me of stealing something specific and expensive (laptop, phone, etc.). On a couple of occasions, they *physically assaulted me* when I told them, basically, ""fuck off.""

* Both inside *and outside* businesses, it is common for them to claim something along the lines of ""we caught you doing it on video""--when it's outside a business, I'm not even sure what that's supposed to mean, and if I ask where this happened, they invariably dodge the question or outright refuse to say.

* Twice, the police were supposedly called: once, by one of the strangers on the street, after he physically forced me onto the ground; the other, by the manager of a drug store. However, on neither of these occasions did the police ever show up, even though in the first case I was there for nearly an hour before I decided to just twist the guy's arm and run.

* Though it should be needless to say, I have, in fact, not stolen anything from any of these people or businesses.

* I really doubt this is all some bizarre extended hallucination, though the thought has occurred to me.

* I am white.",18Jun2018,1
281,"I'm not well at all. It's probably obvious on this account and it isn't even my main account. I have more online friends than irl and, now that I might withdraw after a year of college, it might stay that way. 

I want to talk to people about what I'm feeling, just a little, but I only do so with a few. I feel confused because I don't know what I want. I don't feel like talking to two of them and I attempted to say goodbye to one but we ended up talking again and I thought I enjoyed it for a bit. I always feel like any amount of complaining just annoys most of them. I feel obligated to just listen and give advice but I also just want someone to talk to me.

283,"Hello, okay so I’ll try to make this as short as possible but I also want to try to explain everything in detail. 

I very recently came to the realization that I do not have a personality whatsoever. Like my whole life I’ve just copied other people’s opinions but pretended that it was my own. For example, my whole family loves sushi and so therefore I love sushi. And my friends smoked weed so therefore I started smoking weed. In addition, I can never focus on anything, like I’m always in my own thoughts... even when people are talking to me and so I zone out. I’m also a chronic procrastinator, and can’t get anything I want done. And I also don’t really care about anything, like I have no true interests. 

Yet when I mention “friends” I mean more people that pretend to be my friends (which I’m realizing now).

I also don’t have a special “clothing style” and I’m not funny and I don’t really have any social skills. Anyways, right now I’m in the psych ward bc I almost tried to kill myself and I told the doctor everything and he diagnosed me severely depressed. But I’m not. And this I know myself. So can someone please give me some advice or something, because as of right now I don’t feel like a person. 

Any advice is appreciated but please don’t try to argue me because I’m certain that I’m not depressed &amp; would like to know if there’s any way I can come out of this.",18Jun2018,1
284,"As the title notes, I am seeking a new career path. I feel like I'm a ""jack of all trades, master of none"". I am a high school graduate, and have an associate's degree from a culinary school. My husband is an Executive Chef, so I stepped away from the kitchen - with two kids, I needed a M-F day job. I have since worked in a variety of administrative assistant positions in several national parks (concessions, not NPS). Positions include F&amp;B, guest recreation, lodging, human resources, and environmental management. As an admin for a hotel or lodge in a national park, I have great qualifications. However, these positions are being slashed across the industry as managers are expected to take on the duties instead. I currently work 20 hours a week, and cannot gain more hours save for special/one-off projects. I did work as an assistant manager for F&amp;B, but the schedule just won't work for our family until my kids are grown and gone. 

My husband will be taking positions in other places as time goes on - we don't plan on being in our current area more than 2-3 more years. I thought that some kind of clerical position in a hospital/medical environment might work well. Since I did work in human resources for a year and a half, I thought that getting more education could lead to some opportunity there. I did enjoy that work, and I could theoretically be employed in a wide variety of work environments. I also have a lot of experience with payroll and time-keeping, but even with continued education, I'm not sure how many of these jobs are out there. I *really* enjoy my current environmental management job, but I know that these jobs are few and far between.

At the end of the day, I am very open to more education. I do have access to a small community college, but online courses are always an option. I am still paying off student loans, so I do need to keep costs in mind. Outside of needing a ""regular"" M-F job that can work with school/daycare hours, I am pretty open to ideas.

So help me, Reddit! I would love any career advice you could give me!",18Jun2018,1
285,"My mom has a form of FAS and is mildly intellectually delayed. She has a history of extreme abuse from both her alcoholic mother and her boyfriend for most of her life. She started having kids in her teens and dropped out in grade 10. 

So fast forward to this present day, she got away from everyone who has abused her and all her kids are grown up. She is completely isolated,  has no friends or family who cares about her and my siblings all abandoned her. But for good reason, since she keeps burning all her bridges by constantly borrowing money and she’s a compulsive liar who can’t hold onto a job and she has a shit ton of debt and bad credit. Every time something goes good in her life she fucks it up by making stupid decisions like, leaving everything behind to travel to another country and then running back when she runs out of money and then she guilt trips her kids into letting her borrow money and letting her stay with her, etc. I can go on and on about some of the stupid shit she does but i’ll try to keep things on topic. 

When I was a kid, she was an alright mother she didn’t abuse me physically and I wasn’t abused sexually and she did her best to encourage me, which is a positive so she wasn’t a complete monster. But at the same time we were extremely poor and we were constantly moving from place to place which made it hard for me to make friends which caused me to become pretty isolated, basically the internet raised me. She was rarely home and constantly had new boyfriends who she would make a priority. She stopped celebrating my birthday when I was 10 years old and she left me alone during Christmas numerous times and ontop of that I was suffering from extreme depression/isolation which I still struggle with today. So basically my family is fucked and my mom has no one and my father along with his side of the family live in another country and don’t want anything to do with me. 

Once I became an adult I moved in with my high school sweetheart, we helped each other finish college and we lived with a few horrible roommates to save money. Now that we have successful careers we can finally afford to live alone, which we both want to do so badly. But then there comes my mother crawling back into life, begging me into letting her stay with me since her ex left her for another man (which I warned her about him being gay multiple times, since he was cheating on her with men and she refused to listen obviously.) she said she had to sleep at a homeless shelter a few nights before hand and she was scared. So now she is living with me and she’s getting extremely comfortable here. She is not making an effort at all to improve her situation, she takes off first thing in the morning and doesn’t come back until evening everyday, but refuses to tell me where she goes. She eats our food, doesn’t help with chores and when we complain she pulls the mom card and say’s “I gave birth to you, you owe me!!.” and “I thought if i had kids they would take care of me, i was wrong!! Don’t have kids, they’re selfish.” she’s extremely religious and says stupid things like “I can’t wait to die and go to heaven!!”, she also has a bad leg and breathing problems but refuses to see a doctor. 

Ever since my toxic mother started living with me it has caused problems with me and my boyfriend and she is making me extremely unhappy that she doesn’t want to improve herself at all. I tried to take her to see a therapist, family doctor for testing &amp; I even applied to multiple jobs online for her. I’m even trying to teach her how to drive, but she makes it extremely hard to help her, it just kills me inside. I’m the only person left in her life and If i give up on her she will most likely end up in the streets. Idk what to do but I’m only 24 and since she fucked up my childhood, I’d at least like to enjoy my early adulthood and get the opportunity to finally become happy with my fiancé away from my fucked up and toxic family. Stay in mind me and my fiancé aren’t rich we’re still paying off our student loans and we’re on a tight budget. 

What should I do? 

Tldr;  Mom had an extremely hard life, along with FAS (which is a hidden disability and there aren’t any support programs for this condition in my country) I am the last person in the world she has left since she burnt all her bridges and I want to help her get on her feet. Her mooching is causing problems in my relationship with my fiancé and triggering my depression from my childhood when I felt so hopeless. ",18Jun2018,2

287,"F/29 - South Asian background

About 3.5 years ago I moved out of my parents place. I was helping my parents with their mortgage and helping out at home. But it started to take its toll on me when they started to really live beyond their means which started to eat away at almost all my income. They were quite overly involved in my life as well... needing to know who I was out with and telling me not to go out at certain times.... my parents were a little more traditional and thus would enforce cultural rules on me as well.

So 3 years ago when I was in a relationship I moved out and into my own place. For the first couple of years it was an odd experience as my boyfriend at the time and I use to hang out between his place and my place but eventually we broke up and i was on my own. 

I changed jobs recently and my pay here had taken a significant hit... which I was prepared for... however there are more deductions now (after my probation period) that I’m now taking a hit of over $ 900 less a month... this is making it impossible to get by.... I’m using 50% of my income on rent because it’s so expensive to live in my city. 

I recently also got very sick and ended up getting a really bad allergic reaction (still not sure what I reacted to) but i just remember waking up at midnight and freaking out when looking in the mirror... my whole face was swollen and my eyes almost swollen shut... I knew I needed to either get to emergency or get to some antihistamines ASAP... so at midnight I called a cab and payed $40 to get to the nearest drug store. 

I remember being so scared, panicked and anxious... and helpless with no one around to ask for help. 

Around this time my mom got really sick too... she ended up with a very bad ear infection and went to the ER and got placed on morphine and antibiotics. 

I spent the weekend at my parents place to help take care of my mom ( my dad and brother are around too but kinda useless at taking care of her)

I went back to my parents place this weekend to celebrate a cultural festival and stupidly broke down to my mother about the stresses I’ve been facing with for finances and the fear from the allergic reaction and she basically was begging, pleading,and guilting me into moving back home. Promising that she will give me my own space and saying that I could move back home and save all my rent money. 

I do enjoy spending time with them... and money is so tight.... should I just move back home?

289,"I work or worked at a pretty rough place. I've only been there a couple months.

The job was tough but it was good and I liked it until the boss rehired a guy who left long before I was ever hired.

Fyi: this isn't a normal type of job. It's pretty much under the table, show up when you want type of thing. Nothing normal about it.

This guy is just... Flat out nuts. He's a heavy drug user (meth, heroin, LSD, cocaine, MDMA, alcoholism, marijuana) and he's got a criminal history that includes armed robbery, breaking and entering, assault, sexual assault, stealing cars and he's served prison time for some of it too. That's all been corroborated by multiple sources. He looks like you'd expect too. Skinny yet strong, face tattoos, neck tattoos sleeve tattoos, scars all around his eyes and mouth, broken nose, missing teeth...

Anyways, he took a bunch of drugs and got drunk at work and he told me something I wish I never heard. He told me that he killed a drug dealer to score when he didn't have any money... And that's not what he went to prison for. He was never caught.

So I decided I'm outta there. I don't want to work with a murderer -especially one that hasn't been prosecuted and served time for it.

I asked around for advice on what to do about him. I have a conscience and can't ignore it. I asked a lawyer and a police officer, both close to me and they both said the same thing. Basically, without evidence this goes nowhere. If he doesn't spill the beans himself, there's going to be nothing that happens except police interview him and that he tries to find out where I live and cause hell for me. And I was informed in under no legal obligation to do anything.

But anyways... I quit.

You think I did the right thing, at least for me?

There's not much I can do about the psychotic, drug addled murderer... But hey, this job was new and I don't actually need to be working right now.

291,"So I have a severe head injury as the result of falling off a rooftop. I was life flighted to one of the best hospitals in the nation, where I spent five days there. Everything the doctors wanted to evaluate checked out. Little to my knowledge my parents have been consenting to relinquishing my authority to make medical decisions. 

I was then sent to speech therapy, where again, I was deemed incompetent, and so I can’t discharge myself AMA. I got so fed up with the “speech therapy” that I said I want to leave. The speech therapist assisting me was rather astonished about how I wanted to leave all of a sudden, however, me wanting to go home has been a pent up thing of mine. I had it at that point of being around the hospital environment. 

The speech therapist said I’m not allowed to go, which pissed me off even more. I told her that I’m leaving, and she brought in the actual doctor where he reiterated why I can’t leave like a “normal patient”, which was infuriating. When the therapy session was over, and when I was being escorted to the room, I noticed two things 1) not a lot of nurses around, and 2) I was down the hall from a fire escape. 

The doctor watching over me said he’d only be gone a second, so grabbed my phone and wallet, and I attempted my escape. I got to the fire escape, and bolted. I was able to make it to the lobby, where nobody was at, and I was about to walk out the front door, the only problem was two armed security guards had already gotten word that I was escaping (I’m surprised they knew so quick), and they tried apprehending me. 

One of the security guards was a female, at least in her 30’s, she tried to be the “good cop”. She was trying to reason with me, but in my mental state, there was no reasoning. I’m built like a linebacker, so I knew I was able to push through the security guards. I implied a forewarning to the female security guard that they’re in my way. Before she could say anything I bolted again, she tried to restrain me, but I was able to put hands around where her breasts were (wasn’t intentional, this is just how you “run people over” in football), and just absolutely trucked her. I bet she’s still sore on that, literally. Although props to her, she got back up quicker than I thought. 

Anyways, I made the escape, and was able to make it to the nearby park. I hid in a restroom, and I called the police. I propped the story up to give them a sense of urgency. The police arrive to my location, and an officer comes to talk with me, I tried to tell him that I’m just a regular citizen, and there’s no reason to be concerned. He says to me “that’s kind of hard to do, because you’re in a hospital gown!” 

I felt like the jig was up, so I told him I wasn’t supposed to leave AMA, because I was “incompetent”, so he asks me to get in the police car. I did, and we went back to the hospital. Back at the hospital, I had an awkward stare down with the security guard I ran over. Where as my “fuck you” to her. I asked if she’s feeling a “a little sore”. She just turned away from me (sore loser). 

The officer was briefed on the situation, as I was taken back to my room. The officer comes into my room, and he lectures me on why what I did wasn’t cool. Then he told me that she’s also an officer, so I assaulted an officer. He did point out that they’re going to let it slide. 

Later that day, I wake up from a nap, and I was retrained. The parents were also there just absolutely pissed at what all I have done. I was a bit remorseful, so I mellowed down, and I was told that I had to apologize to the security guard. 

After about five or so hours, the doctor took off my restraints, and they offered me a bowl of ice cream. The doctor said that I’m going to be out soon, but he wouldn’t say how long, when the last restraint was off, I told him that I want to know. The doctor was kind of being smug, and said “he doesn’t have to give an estimate”, which flipped that switch. 

I got up, grabbed the ice cream, and threw it right at his face. It was kind of funny that he called the nurses to help restrain me again, and I was too busy laughing at him because the styrofoam bowl was stuck to his head, with the soft serve strawberry ice cream running down his head and clothing. 

I ended up spending the night in restraints... 

The next day, the doctors took my restraints off, and they asked “if you comply, you’ll be out sooner, because you’re delaying your speech therapy”. I went along with the flow as best I could for the next two days. 

The speech therapist was just treating me like a child, and at this point I had my phone back. I called the police and told them I was being held prisoner. A different cop arrived, and he explained to me that if I call again there would be serious repercussions. He then proceeded to ask what was wrong. 

Out of nowhere I said if I stayed any longer that I would “kill myself”. Wrong answer, the officer, and hospital decided I’m going to the psych clinic across town. This was pretty much my lowest low, because I was under 24 hour evaluation, and realized I could been living a bit in luxury at the hospital (the food was great at the old place). The food at the psych clinic really sucked. 

I went along with everything, as hard as it was. I eventually got done with my speech therapy sessions, and I was able to finally go home. 

My temper is still there, and I feel like the person I am is unrecognizable, because of the outbursts I’ve had at the hospital. I’m finally home, where I can finally have alone time for the remainder of my recovery process. I have some medical person (idk the term, sorry) who stops by to check in on me, but that’s it. 

I think the key I needed, was that I just wanted to be alone. ",18Jun2018,1

293,"So my dad's friend and employee who is also our neighbor has put me in a very difficult position. Let's call my dad's friend Bob.

Bob has been using drugs (meth if I'm not mistaken) and has been going through some personal family issues. My dad has spoken to Bob a few times about him using drugs and was not happy with Bob as Bob has a 4 year old child and a wife who rely on him. Bob has been making debt for himself and began to borrow and owe people money. After an intervention with Bobs wife and my dad ,Bob promised he would stop buying drugs.

A few weeks go by and Bob gives me a lift to the store. When I get in the car (just two of us) Bob asks if I have $50 for him. I say no because i am using the money to buy stuff from the store. It seemed like he was desperate for the money. 

So he says okay and says he needs to make a stop before he takes me to the store. So he takes me to a house in the bad side of our neighborhood and says if my dad phones I must not answer it. He also said that I must not tell my dad where he went if he asks. So I said won't say anything because I didn't want to cause a  problem. 

I'm almost certain Bob took me to a drug dealers house because he owed the guy money. 

So after Bob spent about 10 minute's in the house he then took me to the store. On the way he got a call and was discussing life insurance with an insurance company over the phone. 

Bob has been suicidal in the past because of the issues he had with his family. He then goes on to say how hard it is getting life insurance.

The problem is that I don't know whether to mention this to my dad or just keep or keep it to  myself. I feel that if I don't tell my dad I would be lying to him in a way and it just doesn't sit well with me not telling him. Also I feel like I should tell my dad because Bobs life might be in danger. But I don't want to mention it because Bob might loose his job which his family relies on. Also I don't want to cause a problem between Bob and myself because he is my neighbor and sort of a friend.

Bob is a good guy, he does have flaws to character but so does everyone. 

I would appreciate anyadvice on how to handle the situation, I don't know what to do or what not to do.Any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks 

P.S. 
Sorry for the bad formatting I'm new to Reddit and am on mobile, please forgive 

TL:DR- My dads friend, employee and also our neighbor is using drugs again (without dad knowing) and might plan on taking his own life. He asked to borrow money from me ( I said no), went to his dealers house and later discussed life insurance over the phone.

I live in a Chicago suburb. Most of the studios are in LA, which makes it difficult to even start as a staff writer. I would consider moving to LA; I have some savings, but I know fuck-all about moving out and living alone, especially in a city. Besides, my parents wouldn't have it. I'm supposed to be transferring to a 4-year institution to get a bachelor's degree (currently working on an Associate's), and they are going to help pay for it.

My other option is to get the bachelor's, my original plan in high school. I wanted to get a bachelor's in English and become an editor for books, then maybe a publisher, or something similar. Even then, I get a lot of flak, since apparently English and those skills are still useless. It seems the salary is usually steady, if meager, and I like that security.

TLDR:  Hospital visit in Cancun ends with hospital extorting my mom for $7K+ after threats of jail.  I'd like to find way to prevent this from happening to others and make Amerimed hospital in Cancun be punished for their crimes.

Recently my mom was on vacation in Cancun Mexico and ended up in the hospital, where she was essentially robbed by the Doctors and administrative staff.

A little background; a few weeks prior to the trip my mom was in the hospital for a breathing issue and was later released.  The root cause was never fully understood, so she was keeping an eye on things.  You should also know that my mom sometimes has seizures.  Not the convulsive type but more absent.  The root of this is still not understood, but she has not had one in a couple of years.

While in Cancun, mom was having a little trouble breathing the first couple of days, but it was manageable.  Then she had one of her 'spells', as she calls it.  Her travel buddy had never seen mom have a spell, so called an ambulance.  This is a reasonable response when you are frightened for someone’s life.  However, in Mexico you may want to consider rolling the dice because this is where a relaxing vacation turns into imprisonment.

Upon getting to the hospital, the immediately ask for a credit card so they can put a 4K hold.  This seems reasonable since there is a possibility of skipping out on the bill when leaving the country.  All the while they are doing this, they tell my mom that the accept her insurance provider from the United States.  I'm still not sure if that is true...but time will tell.  The credit card was supposed to only be a hold for what the insurance did not cover.  Still no red flags, but my mom is being a little cautious.  She tries to ask what things are going to cost and is denied any details as they go about performing tests and giving medications.

At this time, I'm informed of the situation from my sister, so I can help get her airfare to go help out.  I help her and start to look up information, so they know what to expect.  I talk to my mom and sister and warn them about multiple reports of hospitals in Mexico extorting Americans and holding the hostage until they pay some ridiculous sums of money to settle the bill.  I pass on what information I have about the scam; threats of jail and keeping your passport until you pay up.  This is paired with information about how they cannot arrest your for not paying and have not right to keep your passport.  I assume I'm being paranoid, but next day my fears were realized.

During the time the Dr tells her that she has pneumonia and will need to be in the hospital for at least 3 days.  Pneumonia seems possible with the breathing problems, but my mom is worried about what this is going to cost.  She does not have much money, so was very concerned about how she was going to pay.  The doctors and nurses refuse to talk about how much anything is going cost but continue to put drugs in her IV day and night.

My sister and aunt arrived as planned to help my mom the next morning.  At this time the hospital administration presents them with a 5K bill for services and explains that this does not yet include the doctor fees and some other stuff.  They also tell them that it will be ~4K every day she is in there.  At this point, my mom wants to leave because she knows she cannot afford this service.  She had accepted losing the 4K deposit depending on what the insurance covered but did not have sufficient balance remaining on her credit card to pay the additional 3K they were now demanding.  She asked to be discharged immediately and explained that she did not have the money to pay the 7K that they were demanding of her.  At this point the following happened:
	* The doctor told her she would die if she left and told my sister that it would be on her hands when my mother died.
	* The doctor told her that he would put her on the no-fly list, so she could not go home.
	* The nurse refused to remove the IV.
	* The administration stated that she could just stay until she could pay.
	* Doctor and Administration threatened to call the police and have the all arrested for not paying the bills (yes, all 4 people in the room).
	* My sister says there was a large man posted in the doorway to intimidate them.
	* They threatened to keep their passports and not allow them to leave the country.

At this point, I tried to explain to my sister that she needed to have mom remove the IV and walk out of the hospital.  She was a nursing assistant for a number of years, so I knew she could put in a IV which is harder than removing it.  They were frightened due to the threats of jail.  I gave my sister the number for the American Consulate, so she could get information from them about their rights in Mexico and confirm that they could not be arrested or held hostage.  Sadly, my sister did not follow through with my suggestions.  In the end they transferred money to my mom’s checking account and used a debit card to pay the additional $3K so they could gain their freedom.  The next day the hospital attempted to 2 more charges of $2K apiece from my mom’s checking account.  It was at this point she finally called to block the charges and attempt a charge-back on the previous charges.  Since everything they did was shady she even filed for a charge-back on the initial $4K to her credit card.  I think she has a chance of getting the Credit Card charge reversed, but my understanding is that debit card charges are much more difficult.  Even after she placed the hold on her debit card they attempted at least 2 more charges of 2K each. 

My mom is finally home safe and had a chance to visit her doctor.  He informed her that the 'antibiotics' she was sent home with were nothing more than antacids.  He also fears that she was drugged by the hospital to make her more pliable.  She did hallucinate the night after she left the hospital.  Further, he said while the x-ray shows something that could be pneumonia it was nothing that would warrant hospitalization.  He feared that they would have killed my mom in the process of robbing her.

After all of this, I'd like to make them pay in any small way I can.  I suppose blasting them on the internet is a good start, but does anyone know more official channels I can take to punish the hospital, so this is less likely to happen to others?

298,"I am M, my friend is F.

While we were hanging out my friend started mocking me saying I am probably small down there, then kept trying to pressure me into exposing myself to ""prove"" her wrong. She was being really aggressive and I was really uncomfortable, but she didn't care and kept at it.

I feel like I can't tell anybody about this because nobody would believe me. Everyone is always like, ""dicks are ugly and nobody wants to see them"", so I'm worried if I try to talk to anyone they'll think I'm making it up.

Should I keep this to myself and just stop hanging out with her? Or how could I talk to someone about it? I had CSA when I was younger so it is bothering me a lot... like bringing up memories of it.",18Jun2018,2
299,"**TL;DR: Thought retaking a course would replace a lower grade. Turns out I am only limited to two applications for grade forgiveness (the process of replacing the grade), but since I am no longer enrolled in that college, it says I can't replace them. I don't know what to do. I retook about 3 courses and got an A, B, and a C+ in them, but I don't know how to get rid of the F's I had previously and it is killing my GPA.**

Long story short, I was a good/advanced student in middle school and a decent student in high school. 3.25+GPA always. I took DE classes and did well in them, except one which was Biology I earned a D because I was a stupid stoner bitch.

Fast forward to freshman year, I didn't care my first semester at a state college because I was applying to a university for Spring and had to drop courses to apply as a first time in college student. I got a D in a class because I never showed up and I never withdrew.

Now I'm at my university, first semester of real college (spring). Did decently well, got an A, B, and failed a class because of me being a dumbass and getting used to living on my own. **Now this whole time I thought I'd heard that a repeated course would replace the grade (so I retook the F and got a B+ the next semester).**

Sophomore year, I'm doing about the same. Maybe one A, a B, a C, and another fail. **""So what, I'll just retake it for a higher grade""** is what I told myself. Same for the spring of that year. I started trying to withdraw instead of failing.

Junior year my parents went through a really nasty divorce, where I found myself to be in the absolute middle of it because of my dad (who I don't talk to any more). I dropped all but one course. I still failed it because I was using opiates, drinking, and smoking (this had been going on since April of 2017 when he first drug me into the mess).

I was pretty clean off drugs and alcohol by Spring of junior year, I took three courses. Got an A, a B (repeated grade), and another F because I was too god damn stupid to withdraw and **ASSUMED** I could retake it for a better grade when the time came.


*Alright, now I finally decided I wanted to be a nurse*. I have put forth tons of effort into my summer classes, receiving an A in Anatomy and Physiology, a pass in the lab, and doing well in my other courses that span throughout the summer (12wk). Nothing will be below a B, and I plan to keep it that way. My mother has said she's never seen someone so motivated before, and I have never seen this side of me before either. Turning 21 I finally decided that I needed to get my school shit together. Time to check my course history and start seeing what my GPA from my previous university was.


**Here's where everything fucked up:**

I saw that my old F's that I thought I replaced were still showing (it was only 3 or so courses that had failing grades, some I failed twice, but I ended up passing them). Turns out it doesn't work like that. I need to apply for grade forgiveness and I am limited to only do two courses... 

So I figure I'll do the courses I need for my nursing school application. I think if I replaced my two courses, I'd have somewhere just below a 3.0, and the summer classes might be enough to bring my up to the mandatory 3.0gpa for nursing school. So hope was somewhat brought back.

I went on and tried to apply for the grade forgiveness (to replace a F with the new grade). Since I no longer want to go to school here (I just need a fresh start in a new place), it says I can not apply since I am not in an active program.

I seriously have no idea what to do. If anyone has advice, I'll take it. So far, all my classes on my nursing applications are A's and B's (with a C in stats because I am terrible with math). It's just those stupid courses I took for no reason and failed. I'm really not THAT bad of a student, but I really don't want my stupidity from my late teens to hold me back from what I really want to do.

300," I honestly don't know if this is the right place to ask this question. If not could someone point me in the right direction? Anyhow. I'm currently writing my thesis on de-noising images for CAPTCHA purposes. I got told to add a section about the threat model of CAPTCHAs. As far as I understand it a threat model purpose is to: ""to provide defenders with a systematic analysis of the probable attacker’s profile, the most likely attack vectors, and the assets most desired by an attacker.""(Wikipedia says it better than I can). But what would the threat model for CAPTCHAs be? I don't really get it. What I would say is that CAPTCHAs are put in place when there is a need to differentiate between bots an ""real users"" and that the way they get attacked depends from the CAPTACHA itself (imageCAPTCHA -&gt; de-noising techniques; reCAPTCHA (I am not a robot) -&gt; by simulating a ""real user"" access to the internet.

309,"Greetings fellow redditors. 

Let me set the stage real quick. 
* I'm 20 years old.
* I'm a part-time manager at a great fast food restaurant. I love my job and I love everyone I work with. I also make a good wage and will make a lot more here in a month or so. Most of my friends are the people I work with.
* I attend a university that is an hour away. I've attended the university for 2 years going on my third next semester. I drive between 8-10 hours a week. Also, I have full paid tuition which is why I commute. It allows me to work at a job I enjoy, live with my parents and near my girlfriend and attend classes at a good university with the only negative of commuting. 
* I have a loving girlfriend of nearly 3 and a half years. She just graduated high school and is about to attend a university that is an hour from mine and 2 1/2 hours from where we live now. 
* I've lived with my parents for the 2 years I've attended university.
* Around a year ago, I got a 2015 car with a monthly payment of $300. 

The crossroads: About a week ago, my dad got a job opportunity of a life-time. He'll be making twice as much as he does now. Of course he accepted it. However, this involves them moving 3 hours away from where I live now. This means that unless I quit college and go move with them, I'll be living on my own. That isn't even an option considering my full paid tuition completely disappears if I miss a semester. 

My plan, starting after Christmas, is to attend the university my girlfriend does and stay at the university for graduate school. The big issue is this next semester. With the money my dad will be making now, they agreed to give me $400 a month to help pay rent for an apartment.

The only options I can see are:

* A) I stay in the city I'm in now with the job I enjoy. Continue to commute 8-10 hours a week. My girlfriend would be 2 1/2 hours a way and I'd plan most every weekend to spend with her. 
* B) I move to the city where my University is so I won't have to commute. I'll be an hour closer to my girlfriend but I'll have to quit my current job and find a new one in the new city. 

There are other options like moving to the city where my girlfriend is and working for a semester and then attending that university the following semester with full support from my parents. I could also move with my parents, but lose my job, friends and be a much longer drive from my girlfriend. 

I'm asking for advice. I don't know what to do. I'll be living on my own for the first time. I'm very happy for my dad but his job changes everything for me. My parents have already moved and they kept our old house until I start classes back. I have little over a month before I need to move but I know I definitely need to figure out my plan. My boss knows about the offer but he assumes I'll be staying here. He makes a lot of money and offered help in any way in case I needed it as long as I stayed working for him.  I'll probably post this on r/personalfinance too.

313,"this happened last month but im at a point where if i don’t address it now i probably never will. 

i like this guy.. we had a few classes together last semester but never really talked. he is very quiet, never spoke in class, keeps to himself. he always looks really sad and is almost always alone so i made an effort. anyway, i sat by him so i would say hi once in a while, etc. nothing crazy or too forward. i am shy too and ive never been in a relationship, let alone even really talk to a guy. so fast forward to last month. i decide to cut my losses and have more than a 5 minute conversation with him. i see him outside [ alone], and go to sit by him. keep in mind this is a person who is antisocial. he doesn’t tell me to leave and he doesn’t leave himself so we start to talk, just small talk. this is where it gets strange. he starts to talk about how his ex, out of the blue, and how he knows a lot of girls are “attracted” to him. he ends up telling me so much, about how he’s depressed, and he wishes he never met anyone, just all this personal shit, all on his own, while meanwhile im just sitting there, like consoling him, but kind of in shock at his openness. he ends his tragic story asking me a question: what do i want from him. because he doesn’t want friends or a girlfriend. i just played it off, said something like who said anything about that? so after that he just continued small talk. and then we just went to class. i haven’t talked to him since. 

so my question is what does this mean? why would he tell me, a person he barely knows a lot of personal information? am i overthinking it? is he just cocky and insecure? there must be a reason why he would choose to say all his problems.. if he really wanted me to go he would have just left. should i talk to him before school ends? if you read this far thanks, i know this is a stupid post, i just have no one to talk to.

Tl;dr - Curious as to if anybody has a bit of advice as to what to do when trying to receive a credit due to an overpayment to a company.

My mom is on disability and certain payments are taken out of her check automatically every month,

We received a reduction to our hydro payments sometime within the last year I believe.  She was paying around $300 towards hydro monthly but when these changes came about she found out she had an overpayment credit with them of around  $1500.  

When she got notice that hydro rates would go down she contacted her disability worker to let them know that they've not only been overpaying but that she'd also like the payments reduced.  She had no expectations that she would get any of the overpayment back but if they decreased the hydro payment, the extra $180 some odd dollars would be fairly useful to her regardless.

Anyways, disability decided yes it would be a good idea to reduce payments to hydro and said they lowered it as much as was possible and she's still overpaying.

She was initially told by disability that the amount it was reduced to would cause some of her credit to get used up each month and therefore eventually work itself out.

Since they reduced her payment, she's accumulated another 5-600 dollars in credit with the hydro company.

So after numerous attempts to get it sorted out, nothing seems to be happening.

I guess I was just wondering if anybody had any suggestions on what she could do or is this just something she'll have to continue to deal with? People around here hardly get anything for disability as it is.

I’m in my mid 40’s and for the past 2-3 years I’ve lost all ambition or passion. I use to have things I loved to do but I can no longer do many of them.  I got married over a decade ago and shortly before that I became disabled. My disability leaves me unable to do many of my previous hobbies as it has weakened my body considerably. My legs were  especially weakened more than the rest of my body I’m just fortunate I wasn’t completely paralyzed. I was an avid outdoorsman who enjoyed hiking, biking, kayaking, and boarding (surf,skate,etc). After my disability those were all taken from me as they had become too painful to be enjoyable.   While I am more able now to do some of these things I’m still greatly limited.  I use to be active and creative.  I make music but I can’t write anything I draw but I can’t think of anything I want to draw. I feel so frustrated with my life right now.

Social Advice:

I had a very unstable upbringing.  Ever since I was born, my parents were fighting one another and moving house to house.  I probably moved more than 7 times before I was 10 y.o.  This may not be a lot to some, but for me this made it very difficult to understand how to develop and keep friendships.  My parents finally split apart and I moved up north to live with an aunt who turned out to be a very neurotic individual with a boat load of psychological problems.  From this I was severely mentally and emotionally abused until I was able to get free from this and go to college.  I have dealt with severe episodes of depression and lack of social connections due to my unstable life.  Now I am close to graduating college and I don't have any good friends who I could call on and help me out if I were in a bad situation (like if my car broke down 20 miles away from where they live, they would come and help).  I am just now over my depression and starting to be a more stable and happy individual.  But now I am realizing how ill prepared I am for real life and what is going to be asked of me to make a difference.  I don't believe I need special treatment because of my experiences, but I am yearning deeply to feel like I am apart of society and I am able to make an impactful difference in the lives of the people around me.  I want to have friends and social ties to the community, but I just have no clue how to do this.  Advice on how to do this will be appreciated.

328,"So at the end of the school year I applied to many places for work for the summer. For the longest time I only heard back from two, so I joined the first of the two to join. These two were fast food joints that paid minimum wage and weren't so different from each other.
Today I got a call from another job willing to pay 9 dollars at the lowest and maybe even 11 dollars an hour. This job is definitely better then the one I hold now, but I hate to quit so soon after just getting this job. The temp job is only a month or two tops which is percisely what I need, as my current job knows that I'm leave no come August. So my question for this would be, what will be the best way of going about quitting my current job assuming I get the new job, or should I even quit? .",18Jun2018,1
329,"We were at work talking about our offices, computers, etc. I said that I was fine with my computer despite it not being the fastest of the bunch. They said jokingly that I don't complain about anything; that I wouldn't complain about having dial-up internet. They then said, ""Not saying that's a bad thing.""

I consider myself a 'pick your battles' kind of person for sure, but I'm wondering if that comment could indicate that there is a perception that I am a doormat. ",18Jun2018,0
330,"I've been told before that I'm fairly good at giving advice and comforting people for a seventeen year old, but I have no idea what to say in this situation. I'm completely lost. I don't have the paperwork right now but one of the nodes on her thyroid is over two inches long. It's grown a lot in the past year and she's breaking down- she's fought through cancer in the past,  twice, and beaten it, but she's obviously scared to do it all over again, and I don't blame her. What do I say to make her feel even a little bet better? I'm at a complete loss and I feel so helpless, I can't even imagine how she's feeling right now. I'm so scared for her, but I don't know how to vocalize that I'm scared because I care about her without freaking her out more. ",18Jun2018,1
331,"So about 9 months ago my mother cheated on my father. He eventually found out when he followed her car when she said she was going to a job party. 

At first they told me they were getting divorced but it seems to have calmed down. I was told that they were going to try to make it work together again. After this event I noticed my father becoming really paranoid over where my mother went, I don't really blame him just think it isn't okay.

About 2 months ago I spot a glimpse of a program on his laptop with a map on it, it also mentioned the exact model cellphone my mother uses. (He usually has it open around the house so it's easy to spot what's on it). I thought about it for some time but eventually let it go thinking my eyes were playing tricks on me. 

Today I confirmed that what I saw was the truth. I sat down on our couch to watch TV. His laptop was on the table, I wasn't looking at it but when my dad approached it I glanced at it right before he closed it. He told me that the screen was probably blocking my vision but I'm pretty sure he didn't want me to see what programs he had open.

Now my mother isn't the most tech savvy person in the family so I doubt she would have noticed the program even when it was sending notifications to her phone. 

I'm just wondering if I should ask my mother or father about this first. I'm thinking that if my mother knew about this then my father wouldn't try to keep it secret from me but maybe he is just trying to keep it between themselves. I wouldn't really want to see them get separated but I don't think it's okay to spy on someone like this without them knowing.

Got fucked again, dropped one course and brought my GPA up to a 1.99, woo! I study hard, I concentrate in class, and I do well on quizzes/assignments/tests but for some reason writing exams I get fucking railed, both mentally and physically.

But I don't want to be hating my career choice, if I bomb this cisy final exam and ace the business I may drop below academic threshold and I'm fucked.

340,"Fairly new to Reddit so I apologize ahead of time for any mistakes. Background and story - My son is what some would consider gifted, due to that he doesn't really have friends his own age. He is extremely ambitious. already graduated HS, spends his time working with varies startups, networking, co-founded a STEM center in our city. His 1st love is flying has been since he was 3. At 16 when most of us get our DL he got his student pilot license. He tries to fly as much as he can. 
I'm a single Mom, my husband, his Dad was murdered in 2012. He has a few amazing male role models. Another man, in particular, started to invite my son to fly (this man owns a 172 Cessna plane) and go with him on numerous outings that all had to do with helping the community. I thought, how great! Then I was invited also, no problem I actually enjoyed the new adventure. I was asked if my son could go on a Rotary trip which would involve going out of the country basically a 2-week vaca. He approached me about dating which I very politely declined. He kept pursuing and I kept my distance. During these months my elderly Father who had been battling cancer for years took a turn for the worst. Stage 4 bladder cancer. I took a leave from work (still working just not in the office daily) I rented out my house and moved in with my parents to help fulltime. My parents are 87 and 83 children of the depression. I know some people will feel that's crazy, but I'm an only child, adopted and I feel that it's the right thing to do. To make a long story short, this man told my son that I would be going on this trip also. When I heard that I immediately set out to stop whatever thoughts he had. Explaining my family came first, I wasn't interested in dating like I had stated previously. That my family, all members were staying close to my Father making memories. After that conversation, we didn't talk for 8 or 9 weeks. Then I got a strange VM stating he tried to call but could get through. The message made no sense. I told my son and he called him. 
This man screamed at my son calling him (my son) a liar, he said he had bought a $1,300.00 ticket for him. For what I honestly don't even know. This man owns his own plane and as with other pilots that have invited my son to fly I always pay for or offer to buy the fuel, but we never even had or got near that conversation since he wasn't going. He also said to my son ""I know your Mom doesn't have money"" and started to belittle my son and myself. My son was mortified. Not understanding why this behavior was happening. 
I asked a couple of people who know this man, ""what the hell!?"" and they said he is very self-absorbed. Btw- he's in his 70's divorced his world revolves around him what he likes, wants, etc.. He is overly active in every club, organization etc. to keep himself busy. Which I think is good, why not keep yourself busy. The behavior, however, is inexcusable.
Because my son is very involved with the Airport and flying there is really no way of avoiding one another. Any advice would be appreciated.
This man was always asking me personal questions, I always avoided them. I didn't and don't feel it is anyone's business to know personal information. I could tell it bothered him at the time.",18Jun2018,3

342,"As the title says, I have a neighbor who constantly throws his trash into the street or next door into my yard. When he does throw it into the street, it always blows over on to my property and I have to pick it up. This is an every. day. thing. Literally, every day when I get home from work, I walk around my entire property and find at least one or two things to throw away. I have seen him do it many times before, but don't have access to a camera to catch him in the act. I have tried to talk with him about it once before and he basically forgot English after our greeting (I've heard him speak perfect English before VERY loudly) and resorted back to his native language, shrugging his shoulders and shaking his head. I pointed to the trash and he just shrugged, so I stopped trying after that. Short of just picking it up and throwing it into his yard, which I don't want to stoop to that low-life level, I'm not sure what else to do about it. Can't really afford a camera at the moment and I could put up a sign, but I doubt that will do anything since he acted like he didn't know what I was talking about. Trying to talk lead absolutely nowhere. Any advice or help is greatly appreciated.

-A lot of tall beer cans
-Shattered 40 oz beer bottles
-Empty containers of motor oil, cleaners, other car products
-Ripped open bags of topsoil
-So many plastic bags
-Garage sale signs
-Dirty food plates and napkins
-Microfiber towels with motor oil or something related
-Soda boxes and soda cans (like if you buy the 12 pack, the cardboard box it comes in)
- Occasionally cigarette butts, but those are on the other side so that might be my other neighbor.

They had broken up once before, which resulted in them both sleeping with other people, and then getting back together again, within the span of a week. She told me about how she didn’t trust him anymore (since he slept with someone else first), etc... and casually mentioned that he had physically attacked her. 

I was pretty shocked so I probed for more information. Apparently he was really angry at her for sleeping with someone else (despite the fact he did the same thing) and would take his anger out on her. He choked her once to the point of her nearly blacking out, he’s hit her multiple times (although hasn’t left any bruises), and once he was punching a wall and when she tried to calm him down, he responded “its the wall or you”. 

She tried to justify it a little by saying that the first time he did it, it’s because he was self harming, and she urged him to take his anger out on her instead, but every time after that she apparently had not consented to the abuse. He also apparently has a bad relationship with his family, and has been on antidepressants for a while. 

I was disgusted by this revelation, and didn’t think any of that justified what he did. I urged her to do something about it but she doesn’t want to. Now they’ve split up she just wants to stay away from him and put it behind her, and has begged me not to tell anyone, which I haven’t yet.

I have been stuck with this feeling for months now but it never had such a big influence on me and I don't know what to do with it, and I wanted to ask if these feelings that I have right now are normal and if they are warranted or if I'm just exaggerating and should calm down.

I’m 32/F in Boston, MA USA.

I’ve been going through a lot emotionally and mentally  for the past few years but promised i would take care of myself this year.

It’s been 6 months and I’m happy to say that I’ve completed my first milestone - got all my dental work done after over 6 years of not going. It’s been five visits, and super stressful but it’s done. 

Next I need to take care of my body and my brain. I haven’t been to a doctor in about 4 years.  I went to planned parenthood because I was laid off at the time. I had a breast cancer scare which thankfully turned out to be nothing. But I’ve never had a monogram before (family has a history of cancer / breast cancer so I really should). I also have an IUD for four years out of five. PP was so amazing to me. 

I need a general checkup, lady checkup, and i also would like to try therapy. Part of my procrastination comes from being really down on myself and feeling worthless. I don’t want to feel that anymore. Lately I’ve been having really shitty thoughts about myself and in particular disordered eating behaviors.

I just don’t know where to start. I have great benefits through my new job (United) - including I think up to 9 free therapy sessions. 

But as soon as i start searching i get overwhelmed and just stop. I have no idea how to choose a doctor in-network. I have United’s app, it’s just a ton of information i struggle to process. 

Where should i start?

356,"Backstory: I've been working with this guy (Tim, we'll call him) for two years. We literally started at the same time, got promoted at the same time, have the same job title, responsibilities, etc. When we first started working together he and I hung out a few times outside of work - played video games, ate dinner, simple stuff. At one point I was going through a rough break-up and he offered a lending ear. I told him the story and he basically just said, ""huh, how about that,"" and proceeded to tell me about his relationship with Jesus. I'm not religious and didn't appreciate his attempt to evangelize or his basic dismissal of my story. At this point I became wary of the guy.

Later he invited me to a dinner, I agreed to go, and he then told me it was also a Bible study. At this point I felt conflicted because it would be very obvious if I suddenly backed out upon finding out it was a Bible study. I regrettably went anyway and felt uncomfortable the entire time. 

Then he pitched me some MLM (multi-level marketing) scheme and that was pretty much it for me. I decided I'd stop hanging out with him altogether outside of work. I didn't tell him outright I didn't want to hang out - I just gave excuses, ""I'm busy/have other plans/too tired"" etc. Obviously I didn't want to be mean and create a potentially hostile situation at work.

But then he started getting passive-aggressive. He'd ask me to hang out, I'd say I couldn't, he'd say something like, ""Oh I get it, you just don't want to hang out with me."" Eventually he'd say, ""Hey man, I feel like we never hang out anymore."" He probably knew I didn't want to but either couldn't take a hint or, for whatever reason, felt the need to call me out about it.  I had a one-on-one chat with him and gave a half truth. I explained that I was not religious, respected his beliefs, but didn't want to be a part of it (bible studies, etc). He asked if I wanted to keep hanging out as long as he didn't mention anything religious. Again, I regrettably agreed.

I started dating a co-worker which was against company policy. HUGE mistake on my part, learned my lesson. I eventually ended the relationship and came clean to my boss, apologized for violating company policy. She was understanding, gave me a pass. But while I was dating the coworker, Tim constantly disrespected the need for privacy. He'd often make comments in front of other coworkers suggesting that I was in a relationship with a coworker. He seemed to be intentionally trying to blow our cover. Again, I shouldn't have dated a coworker in the first place but he was aware of the situation and only made it worse.

At this point I don't know what to do. I sincerely cannot stand this person. Unfortunately I have to see him almost every day and work directly with him. I don't feel like I can go to my boss about it because I'm already on thin ice for dating a coworker. He's started doing things to jeopardize my safety at work. I've asked him to stop, so far he has, but I fear he'll do something again soon. He's become predictable. Unfortunately I'm afraid I've given him the impression that we're friends by hanging out with him in the past. I don't know how to communicate to him that I don't want to be friends outside of work without provoking him. 

TL,DR: Started hanging out with a coworker, turns out he's a passive-aggressive, disrespectful, religious, MLM advocating, jerk. How do I make it clear I want nothing to do with him without creating a hostile situation at work? ",18Jun2018,1

I always figured I had some issues growing up, but I kept treading on and sweeping all of my problems away under a rug. After alot of isolation and thinking about my problems, I brought my upbringing to the forefront.

My mother and father, embarrassingly, greatly spoiled me and my sister.  As a kid, my parents brought me and my sister to their store everyday after school where I sat in the back and played on the computer all day long. My mother would give me anything I ever asked for and never said no. This includes fast food, video games, etc. We were pandered and served to the fullest extent and rarely were declined. I kicked, screamed and yelled until eventually, they would give up. I literally had no worries in the world except for myself, no responsibilities to take care of, and didn't feel like I was held accountable for anything, EVER. I literally just wanted to sit at home to play video games or browse the web. If I didn't get what I wanted, I would kick and scream to whoever and didn't care whose feelings I hurt. Anybody reading this would be absolutely disgusted and write me off as a decent human being upon a good summary of my upbringing.

My father worked all day, everyday and I barely spoke to him growing up, or even now. My mother controlled everything I ever did and made sure I was with her at all times. I barely had any interaction with any kids my age outside of school and therefore have stunted social skills. I hated this and developed a hatred for my mother. Literally every single interaction we would have together would be confrontational and arguing and yelling were the only means of communication around our house. No ""how was school?"" or any pleasantries. If something was bothering us, we would bring it up with no hesitation or consideration. I seriously had no care for my parents growing up and only saw them as obstacles against what I wanted. I'd guess that 95&amp;#37; of my interactions between my parents are negative. I remember a time when I was seven, my mother was talking to a customer whose daughter was the same age as me and my sister and brought her to the back with her mother's consent and tried to get us to socialize. For some reason, my sister and I hated this girl's guts and started yelling and screaming at her to go away and leave.

I actively kept my mind away from any kind of new knowledge or experience. I never came to this epiphany until recently and I always thought what I had/knew was already enough. I kept myself away from new people and only kept myself around people who (for some reason befriended me, will be covered later) approached me and I eventually felt comfortable with. I realized by mother has a very strange approach to new things or people and this kind of mindset stems from her. She straight up told me at one point that the outside world is ""scary."" If I wanted to hang out with friends, she HAD to know their names and makes sure she meets my sister's friends before letting her hang out with them. This is the case even to this day (my sister is 16, by the way). I get slight anxiety nowadays when meeting new people or going to an unfamiliar place.

Somehow, despite my shitty personality, people have introduced themselves in my life and considered me a friend. after evaluating every single one of my past relationships, it seems like everyone has had to simply put up with me or try EXTREMELY hard to make a friendship work out. Of course, they all eventually grew out of me or left me and I'm now left with nobody (which probably prompted a much needed period of self-reflection). None of my relationships have been stable or salvageable after a certain time period and I just end up either impulsively, or out of having no choice, burning bridges.

My father had no role in my upbringing as he just lets my mother do whatever. Whenever I need to consult someone, it was always my mother, never my father. After some talking, I realized that my mother is an extreme sexist. ""I can't pick up these groceries by myself! What did I have a son for?"" After talking to my mother about why my sister is in a perpetually bad mood around the house she replied, ""Oh, she's a girl. It's okay."" After asking her why my sister had her own personal AC while the one in the house was broken, she said, ""She's a girl--she needs to be taken care of."" My sister and mother are both alike. Kick and scream when they don't get what they want. My mother has repeatedly screamed at me, ""SHUT UP,"" when I want to bring up an issue and discuss. She screams and complains to my father and he does nothing.

The only two interactions my mother decides to initiate with me are either babying me or yelling at me. I guess she has no fucking clue what kind of stage in life a 19 year old is supposed to be in. I'd be chilling on the couch and she'd come up with me and try to touch my face, tell me how such a good boy I am and all that shit. I've tried everything and she would simply not stop. She has no sense of boundaries (opens doors without knocking, texts me when she knows I'm at work and gets pissed when I don't respond within seconds, etc.). 

My parents apparently had sheltered upbringings. My mother moved out at 29 when she got married, and my father lived at home at 40. Figures.

I've been trying to change my habits and be at least a decent adult. I've been working on fixing my impatience, delaying gratification, and just not being a little shit in general, but it's hard and I tend to fall back on habits. I am seeing slight changes, though.

I don't know how to recover from this. I'm very certain my parents have no clue how to raise a kid or even be decent people. My mother is a child and my father is an absolute pussy, and I can't discuss anything.  I don't have enough money or insurance to speak to a counselor and I feel like my issues are impossible to resolve on its own or through therapy anyway. Fuck everything. Any advice or anything to help?",18Jun2018,1

360,"In order to pay for her portfolio book, my girlfriend prostituted herself for 3 months or so, because she wants to be a model, but she doesn't put any effort on her career. She just hopes to God and that's it.

She quit prostitution 2 months after meeting me for the first time, that is, I knew she was a prostitute when I met her. She fell in love with me, but I told her we couldn't be together. I told her if she wanted something serious with me she had to quit that life. She didn't and I left her behind.

She felt bad and a couple of months after that we got together again.

After one month when we were back together, she told me she was on Tinder to get Instagram followers. Well, that was another truth as she proved me, but I didn't like it.

Now I cannot see her modeling career and her Instagram normally. To me they are an obscure part of her past to me, and I cannot get past this.

What should I do?

Sometimes I think I am being toxic because I asked her to delete her Instagram and to quit her modeling career since they are the reason she's done stupid things.

361,"So, same guy I mentioned in my previous post messaged me today, and was a bit rude (joking, but still) and we had a long talk about a bunch of different stuff. I said I'm cool with hanging out as friends and he said he is ""wifed up atm"" which, I have to say, is fair since I've been contacting him a lot and could have been coming on a bit strong. Weird part is that he and his wife are not even friends on facebook, although he did say he thought everything was up in the air, and called me aggressive but said he was kidding. I feel awful because there is definitely some truth to what he said and it really sort of hurt  my feelings since I've always been really aggressive, and social media tends to get me into a heap of trouble with men...I am very scared I weirded him out for some reason and then he joked about my english major and me not being cool, and it just sort of hurt my feelings today, but maybe I am being overly sensitive. I also thought he wasn't married and admit I was being maybe a little predatory, but I don't want to do anything with him if he is married. He had also asked why I was shy before I said the thing about hanging out with friends, and I wasn't directing the comment at him...I just feel very confused and hurt. I'm not sure what to do?

362,"A while ago I was diagnosed with cancer that had spread to different areas of my body (stage IV with metastasis). After chemo, surgeries and procedures I was NED, no evidence of disease, for a while. My storybook romance wife and I had been planning a family and this looked like it would be our shot. We were able to book our honeymoon dream vacation and make good on our plans.

Fast forward a few months and the same week we found out the cancer was back and had multiplied and moved organs again we found out we were going to have our baby. Talk about a big week of great/terrible news!

After further treatments it looks like my cancer has become immune to the chemo and other treatments and surgery is no longer an option. The internet gives people in my situation about 9-18 months to live depending on all kinds of factors. After swallowing that big fat pill of desolation I decided I would use the time I have to leave behind a legacy for my daughter to explore.

I want to video myself saying happy birthday to her and telling her some fun facts or tidbits about myself when I was that age. I want to be able to leave her 21 happy birthday messages so every year she has something to look forward to and she will get to see my face smiling (and probably crying) as I tell her how much I love her.

What are some other ways that I can leave behind something special for her at milestones or holidays where she can still be daddy’s little girl even if he isn’t alive anymore?",18Jun2018,2

The dude had no pants on and she was giving him a blowjob. They didn't see me because I watched from the door which was in the corner of the room (also because they were a bit drunk). I was kinda hurt but I thought oh well, she has every right to. I kind of lost interest for her because I'm a virgin and not into one night stands. I want someone who shares similar values as me.

They have refused to increase my hours and now my manager is changing my hours so that I can't get the overtime in different departments.

So I now want to work towards an actual career and not work a simple dead end job.

I've always been interested in game design and development but never really took the dive to learn anything. Also thought about website design and management. 

Problem is all the courses are full time and none are part time. I can't just drop my current job and my child for a career. So I am kind of stuck in a rut now. 

So now it is getting to the point where I'm just letting the dream die and work a shitty job for the rest of life. Unless I can self teach and build up a resume for companies without any actual qualifications.

All I am doing now is existing. I want to be happy and be the best father and husband I can be. But at this current job I think I'm starting to get to the depressed state???

So now I'm working out on what else I am good at and what I enjoy. There isn't much to be honest. 

Im good with my mathmatics,physics,logical thinking,kinda good with technology and like to think im creative..
What Im not good at:Socializing

I enjoy:Card and strategic games(yugioh,pokemon etc),Puzzles. Being a dad. Researching certain topics.

371,"I’m 33f and have numerous physical and mental problems. The main ones being chronic fatigue syndrome, depersonalisation disorder, personality disorder, plus stomach problems. I haven’t been able to work for about five years now or form normal relationships. My dad (and my brother) believe it’s all in my head and that I’m a hypochondriac and just lazy, and when I even mention anything about my health in passing I get a very quick subject change or completely ignored. I tried to explain two or three times via email to no avail. They were ignored completely. I don’t make a drama about it or talk about it all the time, but if he asks me how I am on the phone I’ll occasionally pluck up the courage to say ‘I’m actually not very well just now’ he’ll ignore it and change the subject. So I’ve learned to mostly say ‘I’m fine’. He often asks me to travel to visit him despite trying to explain in the least dramatic way possible that I can’t because I’m not well enough but it just doesn’t register. I won’t come to see me because he doesn’t want to come back here since he separated from my mum. So I’m kind of backed into a corner. My brother is with my dad on this and they both emailed me once to say ‘me and dad discussed your hypochondria and think you should get help for it’. That was the height of their involvement in my issues and that was three or four years ago. I don’t get it because my brothers ex gf had fibromyalgia and he talked about her condition and how badly she suffered. Anyway, I can go a year or two being nice to them and then I just get tired and angry and I don’t email them for months on end. Because I feel really sad and hurt and abandoned by the people I trusted most in the world. My friends and other family members are baffled by their behaviour because they see me struggle on a daily basis. Well, I guess what I want to know is, should I keep pretending and keep talking nice to my dad and brother so I don’t lose them completely and regret anything down the line?
I miss both my dad and my brother so much and i cry thinking that we might never be close again because of this.
Any new perspectives would be appreciated because I’ve thought this to death and I can’t see this situation for what it really is anymore.

372,"We're both mid-20s. I'm a black guy. A friend of mine was formerly a white guy but transitioned to become a woman. She's had a lot of mental issues since she came out of the closet four years ago because of the shit she's gotten for it, and it's turned her into an asshole and slob. She refuses to get a job and wants to make a living as an artist. Only she rarely makes art. She used to be a great artist and have people throwing 20s at her online. Now she just goes on Youtube and Twitter to talk to what is left of her community and complain about her life. She manipulates people with self harm and gets people to give her enough money to pay rent.

After she was asking me for money for the tenth time, I finally decided to tell her off in a nice way and say the same things people have been saying to her for the past four years. Sitting around complaining does nothing but harm for her mental health. Getting a job will put her on a routine and pay the bills. And she responded to that with racism and a lot of it. I'm a dirty N for not giving her any money and she criticized everything about my appearance and the way I talk. I've had to work with an actual white supremacist who never went half as far as she did. I finally blocked her after being her friend since we were kids. But now I'm getting scared.

373,"This might sound stupid as shit, but I’m genuinely really curious. 
Let’s call this boy Joe.

(Joe’s not the kind of person to get anxiety about eating in front of people either btw)

Me and Joe had been friends for a pretty long while before, but we became much closer in the past month or two because we ate lunch together every day. For the first 2 weeks, he was perfectly fine with eating. He’d get a whole plate of food, eat it all and then we’d go walk around and talk for 30 minutes until our lunch break was up. 

But as soon as we became romantically connected, Joe hasn’t been eating at lunch at all. He wouldn’t be even slightly hungry, so he’d get a lunch and then end up throwing it all away after two bites, and then we’d walk around and talk. When I wasn’t eating with him once, I saw Joe eating from across the room so I came over to surprise him, and he got up and threw everything away as soon as he saw me. He later told me he would’ve eaten more had I not shown up.

I get that this is a really specific question, and I’m not too concerned about him because his appetite is just fine when I’m not around. He says he has no idea why he’s not eating either.

The only problem is one of our clients recently downsized so the data load also downsized. I don’t have enough work to fill my day, not even close. This has also affected my manager so she is aware and we’ve spoken openly to one another about it. We’ve won some new business so hopefully we will see an increase in work which is great. I don’t want to leave this company just yet so I’m trying to stick it out and not leave for at least another year.

The main problem is that I work in an open space. I work from home one day a week and I can’t do more than that. So 4 days I’m in the office and everyone can see me at all times. I can get away with some stuff at my desk but there at least needs to be the appearance that I am working. I’ve tried updating paperwork we have on file, updating trainings, etc but there’s only so much. I’ve asked coworkers in other departments if they need any help on projects and they either don’t need help or what they need help with would require giving me additional training which would take longer than just actually doing the work so they don’t think it’s worth it. I’m at a loss! We don’t have a large training program so there aren’t many training classes at work.

381,"TLDR: 12 yrs together, 7 yrs married, no kids. He wants kids, me not. About a year we don't understand each other, no proximity, no love, no sex. He comes from work and sits to TV with phone in hand and thats it. Can't be surprising that I fell in love with another man (nothing happens here). I don't see any common future, wanna end it, but am not sure how.
___

We've been together for more than 12 years, almost 7 married. About a year my husb usually comes from work and doesn't talk to me. Takes his phone and plays some stupid games. He used to help at home, but he isn't now. 

On December we moved from flat in block to flat in family house at my grandparents, what is hell, they always check what are we doing and where do we go and why and and and. 

Also he wants children, I don't. I told him this at the very beginning of our relationship and he accepted it. But later when we were talking about it, I said maybe we can have some, but no hurry. But when I see the last year of us, I was more and more convinced that I wanna have some, but not with him. (This is too cruel to tell him.) So at the Christmas time he asked me again and I refused. He didn't talk to me about three days. 

During the moving we had many arguments and on the end of January, when I pissed him off again, he asked me in anger if he should unpack his things at all. I was crying whole afternoon, but didn't find any reason to staying together. We had a small talk  and agreed that after selling the flat (which my mother bought for us) we'll separate. 

On March we had to euthanize our dog of 11 because of serious illness. That time we were a bit closer, but not enough. 

But the time flies and the flat still isn't empty, because too much work and the summer is here and sports and friends... I have to say it's my bad, because we used to be just the two of us together most of the time, going to pub together with common friends, walking the dog together, sporting together, shopping together, meeting families together. And now I have many new friends from new work and wanna have fun with them, having many opportunities to visit concerts and tearooms and games playing parties. He was invited many times, but never went with me.

Last month it seems that he is satisfied as it is, he doesn't care about the shituation. I sleep badly and started drinking a bit more. 

Furthermore I fell in love with another man, but I don't want to move on until the marriage is officially over. Just don't know how to open the separation discussion again. Help me, please.

So for the last 2 years or so I have owned a Nikon d7000 with a 55-200mm and 11-16mm tonika. I’ll admit and say I’ve probably picked up my camera 5 times since I got it. 3 of those times I barely knew how to use my dslr let alone understand shutter speed/iso etc. sad I know. 

I’ve been in film school for a year now so I fully understand iso/fstop/shutter speed and their reciprocity. I like to think that I would be comfortable on using the manual mode. 

I’m going to Europe this summer for a month and I’ve been reading up on how to start photography and travel photography. Everywhere says 
1)pack light
2)make your camera look beat to avoid theft
3)small tripod
4)filters/ND

I’ve been thinking lately that my 55-200 might be a little too telephoto. I was thinking something like 30-100? What do you think? 

What are some good filters I should look into? I want to get a high contrast/saturation filter. But that’s the only one I’ve seen suggested. 


And my main question. Composition lol. I understand achieving composition for a narrative but photography is challenging honestly lol. I know leading lines, balance, frame within a frame is implemented so I’m just gonna make this broad 

When you get ready to go out and shoot what are your thought process for composition? What are things you look for? Do you go out with a certain style you want to make/recreate? Do you just go out and go shoot as many things as possible? 

I’ve been wanting to start photography as a passionate hobby (maybe as a career too) for a while. So why not start it with a great opportunity!

389,"So this is something I've been mulling over for a looong time and I'm sorry if this is a bit of a read.

Sometimes I feel that my mental health isn't right. I often get spells of pretty bad depression where I don't feel excited about anything and often have suicidal thoughts, but I know I would never follow through with them. Just more thinking about how I've nothing to look forward to and I wouldn't mind not existing.

Then cut to a few days later I'm feeling fantastic and I'm so happy with life. These are the spells that make me think that there's nothing wrong with me. That these bad spells are just times that everyone goes through and that I'm just being a hypochondriac and I'd just be wasting a therapist's time.

All through out, I always seem to have a constant feeling of anxiety, not strongly but I always feel like I'm worried about something new and to top it off I have a hard time concentrating on one task for prolonged periods.

I guess it'd be great if someone knows if these things are worth seeing someone about or if these are just regular patterns and I'm actually being silly! 

Thanks in advance ",18Jun2018,1
390,"Hi. So just for context I’m a university student. I’m majoring in mechanical engineering. 

Why is it that some people decide they don’t like u even if you haven’t talked to them yet .How can you just assume that. So basically the story is that there’s this girl, let’s call her X, and I’ve seen her around but we haven’t really talked. We have like 2 mutual friends but besides that nothing much. I am taking a course with her so I thought I would start having conversations for her. For some reason, she can’t be asked to even talk to me for two seconds. She looks away when I approach her and doesn’t give me any attention. And the thing is , she is known as the nice person in my uni, she speaks to everyone and they all like her. But I just don’t understand why she doesn’t give me a chance. Out of everyone who she speaks to, it’s really not a coincidence she hates me. I find it so stupid how people can hate someone prematurely, The worst part is I like to help people, I never hurt anyone in any way and this feeling that someone hates me is driving me crazy. Any advice? sorry if this was a rant.",18Jun2018,2
391,"He is aged 19 and has a crush on a 16 year old who lives in another country (Norway). When he told me about her it started off as innocent. And I was not aware of her age. But it soon turned sinister. He said he wants to ""leave her"" for another woman to make her cry and shit like that and seemed to take pleasure off that thought. I used to have SS but they were in my old phone which shattered. 

Fast forward a few months and we talk again. At that moment, he says she is 16 years old which kinda creeped me out. I am now going to gather as much info as I can in case something bad happens. I used to have her username in a SS (Also in my old phone which I deleted that time like an idiot) But should I really? I have seen their convos and its all innocent. They just talk about politics, schoolwork, etc. I need advice please help me. 

PS: He also managed to type her name up and found her family. I comfronted him about and he was like ""I know I know I couldn't help myself"" So he appears to be a stalker. Unfortunately, I no longer have that convo either.

396,"Throwaway account because my wife knows my main one.

So, long story short, I love my wife to death but because I'm not her, for the love of all that is good in this world, I do not understand her compulsive need to be almost exactly 130lbs. She's binged and purged throughout her life starting in her teenage years, and has continued just for the sake of seeing ""130 lbs"" read on the digital scale. She allows it to be 130.5lb at the most before she tries to make herself chuck up whatever's in her belly to dispel the extra weight.

I've tried convincing to her to go to rehab, but she refuses-- it's only until recently that she's agreed to go see a therapist about this. The only thing is, the first appointment isn't for about a little over 3 weeks.

During this time, I want to rig our digital scale so that everytime she steps on it, it reads 130-130.4lbs, regardless of what she actually weighs so she can start stopping this bad habit of hers. That, and I think as long as the scale fluctuates a little on 130-130.4lb, she will be none the wiser for the short period of time we'll be using this.

Anyone know how to rig a scale to do this? Thank you in advance

397,"A few years back, I used to be confident and smart - I had top grades in school, and I could cram the night before an exam and have a good night’s sleep, knowing well that I had learned everything and would ace the exam. And I did, back then.

These exams I used to ace with little/no revision, I now find myself clueless and panicking in them despite revising for a whole week before.

I did a lot of maths olympiads, and was in the top 15 in the country for my age; now, I struggle to even get past the first round.

It used to take me just a few minutes to grasp a complex concept, but now, my brain feel sluggish and shuts down the instant I need to think more deeply. Things that used to take me an hour or two to learn now take me days or even a whole week, and even then, I worry that it won’t stay in my memory.

The moment I see a question I don’t instantly get, my confidence collapses, and my subconscious sees its as further confirmation that I’m turning irreversibly dumber and dumber.

I don’t know what’s going on - my grades, my mental agility, the things I used to value the most about myself, are failing. Everything I do now is riddled with self-doubt, and hard as I’ve tried, I can’t shake off the thoughts. They just keep getting worse and worse, and it’s making my anxiety skyrocket, especially as I’m in the middle of really important exams right now. 

I have a maths exam tomorrow, which normally I wouldn’t even bother revising for, but I’ve done dozens of past papers and I’m still panicking.

Financial (and parental) difficulties means I won’t be able to get therapy - if I even need it at all.

It’s a vicious cycle I can’t break - I feel unconfident and I panic, which makes me perform badly, and that kills my confidence and makes me panic again.

I would really appreciate advice or thoughts on this - thank you for reading.",18Jun2018,0
398,"In my 26 years of living, I’ve never been able to find the help I need to escape the mental anguish that’s possessed me for as long as I can remember. Before I could walk or speak, I experienced extreme physical and emotional trauma at the hands of strangers. Moreover, I was severely neglected as a child. As a result, I developed severe attachment issues at a very young age which have completely prevented me from bonding with people altogether, and I’ve suffered from the myriad of other sorrows—such as depression and anxiety—which inevitably accompany such a lonely existence. My life has always been this way. I’ve never experienced any lasting happiness, any sense of belonging, or any deep connection with another human being, and I’ve never felt even remotely hopeful that I might someday lead a normal life where I can enjoy normal, healthy, and loving relationships with other people. The few joys I have experienced have been shallow and fleeting. Such moments only last for seconds or minutes, and are always separated by years. Honestly, I never expected that I’d survive as long as I have, but I’ve managed to make it this far by cutting myself off from my emotions, by studying/mimicking the behaviors of others, and by forcing myself to abide the rules of man, despite the fact that my instincts are constantly telling me that people are to be feared and mistrusted.

I’ve always been at risk of hurting myself and others, but somehow I’ve managed to thwart myself—without fail—whenever I feel compelled to act on such impulses. I’ve sought professional help *many* times in the past, but it’s never come even remotely close to working out. Doctors invariably throw pills at me whilst making no little to no effort to properly assess—let alone effectively address—my condition. At this point, I am so mentally and emotionally exhausted from constantly having to battle myself without support or guidance that I can’t even lift my facade of normalcy anymore. I’m no longer functioning, and I feel as if I’m at my breaking point.

402,"I suppose a little bit about me and my life would be a good place to start. I recently finished secondary school, I'm quite bright but only achieved average results, and the teachers constantly reminded me how much more I was capable of if I ""applied myself."" Socially I was the quiet kid, I had very few loose friends and no close ones, never received invites to any events, and I was so alone I would sometimes do other peoples homework just to converse with them for a while.

I have a physically disability which affects my nerves and muscles. It makes it so I have a hard time controlling my limbs precisely, and subsequently can't walk unaided. This also makes working out ridiculously hard, and my BMI has stayed around 13 for my entire teenage years, despite trying many diets (gallon of milk a day, meat rich diet etc.). I have good hygene, shower every day, brush my teeth twice a day etc. but have never had any confidence, making my relationship history with women nonexistent.

I tried throughout school to include myself in groups and with others, and succeeded to some extent, sitting next to someone in CS and helping them understand something, jumping in conversation and becoming comfortable with a small group (I was the only driver, and we went to mcdonalds at lunch, so that may have been a factor in their acceptance of me...) These small things brought me brief moments of euphoria, but in comparison to what other students had, it was nothing.

I still attempted to try harder. I started doing my hair in the morning (previously just brushing it over), doing my tie neater, and generally attempting to have more pride in my appearance. I began attending a chess club outside of school, it's mostly old men, but still..

Now school is over.. I now have to not only make myself likeable and converse well, but also have to make these situations from nothing?!? Seriously?!


And here I am.. it's been a month since school ended, I've went to the chess club each thursday, seen a movie with my family, and have a lunch planned next week with *teachers*....

How the hell do I ""get myself out there"" more? I begin university in september, I NEED social skills by then, I can't go on like this for 4 more years..

How would a young adult looking to make friends over the summer go about this? Are there any websites or resources you'd recommend?

How do you counteract having an unattractive physique in the dating world?

How do I even get INTO the dating world?

404,"Hello reddit. I am in need of some advice. I've recently been accepted into a 2 year nursing program at a nearby community college. I spent about 1 and a half years taking prerequisites for both the 2 year and the 4 year nursing programs so that by the time I finish the 2 year program, I can jump straight into the Bachelors of Science in Nursing program right away. I did this because I wanted to get a job sooner and work while I'm getting my BSN. I chose nursing mainly because of its job security. I used to work as a medical assistant for a year and learned a lot about the field during that time. When I first started, I went out of my way for each and every patient and loved to see their happiness and satisfaction. As time passed, my enthusiasm began to fade and the excitement I used to have disappeared. I still took care of the patients as best as I could and I never neglected my responsibilities. However, the amount of paperwork, workplace drama, and everyday problems with difficult patients began to drive me away from the field. I could feel myself growing colder and apathetic. It scared me and I was afraid of  who I might become if I continued on in this field. I didn't want to admit it then but this is the truth. I don't want to be a ""bad"" nurse.

My back up plan is Computer Science. Earlier this year, I transferred over to a local University and declared my major. I did not enroll in classes yet. I wanted something to fall back on if I got rejected from the nursing schools I applied to. I did not choose Computer Science because of the money (nursing is probably better in terms of money due to its job stability) or any other similar reasons and I'm fully well-aware of the difficulty of getting programming internships and jobs. I chose it because I like coding. I find it relaxing and fun. There's something really cool about putting a bunch of letters, numbers, and symbols together to make a working program. I love to create my own solutions to problems and I try to never looks at other peoples' code when I'm lost. I'm mostly self-taught using online courses or any books I can find. I currently have a solid understanding of Python and Java (I can probably pick up C# easily too). 

A few days ago, I was at the new student nursing orientation where they explained about classes, clinicals, and just overall everything nursing school related. While I was there, I had a very odd feeling in my stomach. It was like I got lost while driving to a destination but I'm not exactly sure if I'm lost so I just keep pressing on. It didn't feel.... right. I was overjoyed when I received my acceptance letter but the feeling quickly died off as doubt began to fill my mind. I hate myself for thinking this way because I've spent the past two years trying to achieve this goal. My friends and family are very proud of me because I will soon have a solid career in a rather difficult but rewarding field. I'm also slightly afraid of pursing Computer Science as I'm not exactly confident that I'll be able to secure a position after college. I'm turning 23 later this year and most of my friends already graduated or are graduating soon. I know I'm not supposed to compare myself to others but I Just can't stand the feeling of being behind. I want to make something out of myself. I want to make my parents proud and myself happy. I don't know why it's so hard for me to choose. I love helping others but I don't know if I could pursue it as a long-term career. I love to code but I am unsure about it's job security.

Thank you in advance for all your advice.",18Jun2018,1
405,"Since high school I knew what I wanted to do: get a PhD and work in Academia. After getting my bachelor degree, 7 years ago, a family member passed away and it crushed me completely.

So one of my old friends got in touch with me a few weeks ago. This was a person which of whom I fell madly in love with years prior. I felt comfortable with him, I trusted him, I could tell him anything, and so on and so forth. So I accepted his offer to become friends again happily. So while chatting on an instant messenger he told me his feelings about me and that they stemmed from when we met years ago. Thinking he was being honest I confessed mine for him too, but assured him that I wanted nothing out this but friendship because we're both married to different people. I did however tell him that if we were both single that I'd want to be with him, but to reiterate that's if we were both single.  I just wanted him to know how I felt about him and move on because it was eating away at me.  


Well I'm not sure if he actually listened to me, because he started flirting with me and admittedly and regrettably I started flirting back. I flirted with him because my husband and I at the time were very disconnected and weren't giving each other the attention that we both needed and deserved. So being very flattered that this ""friend"" wanted to spend time with me, get to know me, etc. I began to tell him anything that he wanted to know (my fetishes, family life, struggles, etc). But whenever I felt like he was crossing a line, like when he asked for a pair or my panties, I'd say no, or when he kissed me I pushed him away and said it was wrong. 

I feel so stupid for giving this guy so much trust and being apart of something I know I shouldn't have been. But it was only talk and flirting, no sexting, certainly no sex, no dirty pictures, etc. We met up a few times in public and talked over coffee. I always told my husband where I was going and who else was going to be there. But later I found out that this ""friend"" didn't tell his wife anything and treated the whole thing like an affair. Stupid me just thought I was meeting up with a friend to go talk and have coffee with.

So before he blocked me on instant messenger he sent me a message telling me to ""have a happy life and that he lead me on"". And now the group of friends, who are/were friends with both of us, on instant messenger won't respond to me. I know what I've done wrong, but I don't know what this guy has told any of them. Does it even matter at this point? 

I've told my husband everything and doesn't see this as an affair at all, emotional or otherwise. He wants to go kick his ass, but violence won't solve anything and we both know that. He's been there for me since this started, but I feel so ashamed and I don't know how he can be so forgiving. 

I feel used and taken advantage of for telling him all the things I did (and I regret telling him too). I fear that everything that I told this guy will be used against me somehow. Maybe I'm paranoid and going to extremes? Is there anything else I can do other than be accountable for my actions? What advice do you have for me going forward?",18Jun2018,2

The plan was that I won’t be supplying alcohol (I don’t drink) but if someone else sneaks in a bottle I won’t care. I can easily get away with this since although I’m still living with my parents, my bedroom is a part of a guest house that has a kitchen and bathroom separate from the rest of the house.

411,"I hate confrontation. It’s usually exhausting and not really worth my time, so whenever someone criticizes me or points out something I’m doing wrong or something else along the like, I don’t try to argue back, even when I know I’m not wrong. I just take it and move on. I know my self worth and whether or not that person’s critique actually matters.

But recently, my manager (I work at a bakery) has been constantly wearing me down, saying that I’m slow or I’m not working fast enough and that the past few times I’ve worked that it’s been horrible. I’ve been working here for a year, so I know what I’m doing. I finish my tasks on time and I haven’t made any big mistakes to the point where I’d have to talk to management. 

It’s been extremely frustrating because my manager has known me for a year and still treats me like I just started working 2 days ago. I always finish my tasks and keep everything clean and I always do what I’m told. She constantly criticizes everyone in the bakery for doing things that aren’t exactly like she does it. For example, she can stop a task and start another one and go back to a task perfectly fine, but I’d rather finish one task, then go to the next. We both finish at the same time but she gets so mad when I try to finish the first task at hand and calls me slow. She’s starting to think I’m a bad employee but I’m not. I always finish everything on time, I don’t see why she’s saying that. 

Ironically enough, she loves to criticize everyone but when she gets criticism she’ll be in a bad mood for the rest of her shift. She’s recently been getting on my case for wearing a hoodie under my work shirt because hoodies “aren’t allowed” and claims that the manager will get on my case but the manager literally does not care. It’s extremely cold in here and I’m anemic so I’m constantly freezing.

Me at work is just one example of how I just willingly let people rip into me for no good reason, but I’m tired of people thinking one thing when I’m actually doing another. How can I stand up for myself and explain to people how I feel about their assumptions? ",18Jun2018,2
414,"Long story short I had some problems with this instructor during the semester and went to the Department Dean to solve it. At the end of semester I received a D while I thought I would get a B, so I went straight to the Dean without talking to the instructor first. 

Basically it’s a hybrid course and the point breakdown in the syllabus is: 

25% online discussion
25% journal 
25% final essay 
25% final portfolio 

To make it easy, the course is 1000 points total so each of them would be 250 points, but he only gave the journal, essay, and portfolio 100 points each. Thus the online discussion took the rest of the points (700 points) and I fell short in discussion so I got a D, even though I got 300 points for the other 3 assignments. If it happened according to the syllabus, then I would’ve gotten 750 points instead of 300 points from the 3 assignments. The points from the online discussion would be enough to make the total more than 800 points which is 80% and a B. 

The Dean said he had many students complaints so I waited more than a week to email him again. He then told me: “Based on the calculation of your instructor, you would get a C. I can get all the documents now and change your grade.” He didn’t tell me why or how the point breakdown is not what it is in the syllabus, didn’t tell me why I got a D if my instructor’s calculation is a C. 

There’s another option which is Student Grade Grievance where my instructor and I have to meet other teachers and administrators and they’ll decide. But that won’t happen till next semester. That would be too late because I am transferring to university and have to send my final transcript to the new school within 3 weeks. 

I don’t know what to do at this point. I don’t want to accept a C or a D without understanding why I got it. But a C is still better than a D, should I change it to a C now? Will I have a chance to change my grade again? It doesn’t seem like the Dean is willing to help me figure it out...",18Jun2018,1

Ive got an exam tomorrow and need to sleep and maybe also not to look like freddy kruger. (my face also exploded in a big rash) 

Any advice? (sorry for bad eng)",18Jun2018,3
419,"While out for dinner at an establishment, where my wife of 13 years used to work, a waitress other than ours comes to chat, nothing out of the ordinary. The waitress then says ""he was just here like 1hr ago"" and it catches my interest. She then introduces my kids to the waitress/ex coworker as follows( in front of 3 others besides me and my kids)
Kids, meet ___? If you were ever gonna have a step sister, this is her. 
Otw home, my eldest son told me how it made him uncomfortable how his mom introduced the girl and how it made him feel. I, was obviously upset as well, confronted her to which she 1st replied "" it was just a joke"" after she denied every knowing him or who he was. She maintains that shes never even met the guy, who happened to be the waitresses dad. Would you believe it was just a really bad joke at a bad time in our lives or do you think theres more to it?

1. Someone fainted and went to hospital because of my disturbing behaviour.

When I was kid about 10/11 yr old I found porn in my parents room and was really curious about what it was (porn and sex education is a taboo in asia country and my parents never try to explain anything to me ) as I don’t understand anything about it I saw the cover of the CD but really confused and asked my dad what it is, he just say “that’s adult thing children cannot know about it”. After that the image of it had been bothering me because there’s image of women with super huge breast which looks really weird to me as I thought that was a monster or some weird robot. 

Long story short I was attending ballet class since 6yr old every weekend so there’s a CD player in the admin office, since my dad hid the porn and doesn’t allow me to watch it, I found the porn hidden place and always begging the admin ( a 40/50yr old lady ) to let me borrow the cd player to watch tv when I was waiting for my parents to pick me up but she never allowed as it was school property.

So that Christmas the admin asked everyone what their wish was, so as a dumb kid I asked can I borrow the CD player, and she allowed and said we can watch a movie together with all the kids at Christmas party.

Then it happened I consciously brought the porn and some movies and wanted to wait when no ones was around to play the porn because I remembered my dad said kid wasn’t allow to watch it. Me being stupid enough played a cartoon at first (so back then you need CD A &amp; CD B to finished a whole movie ) 
I freaking switched the second CD to the porn because I thought we won’t finish the whole movie and the kids will go home early.
Then halfway through the movie some kid inserted the porn then everyone freaked out and cried while I went to toilet and came back with everyone left and being scold by the admin and my ballet teacher.

After that incident I wasn’t sure if the admin called my parents or not but she treated me like I am a monster. I felt unfair because I don’t even know what was going on while she interrogate me and asked me why did I do that to the kids, am I a lesbian blablabala. I was afraid and don’t know wtf is lesbian but she doesn’t believe me. 
After that incident the admin asked me to not get close to her girls ( which her adopted child was taking classes there and I didn’t know about it )  I took it by wrong meaning as i am not allowed to talk to anyone. 

Starting from there I became really depressed and always eating and crying alone when I needed to go to ballet class and I didn’t tell my parents anything about it because I was ashamed . 

One day I think I really went nuts and decided I wanted to end my life there I do all sorts of crazy things like pretend I was possessed by ghost and used my ballet fees to buy flowers and give it to girl A in the class because she the nicest to me after the incident ,
plot twist she is the admin’s daughter and I only found out when I was giving her the flower and pretending to propose to her like in the movies with one knees down ( I was a dumb kid as I was thinking to end my life that day so I do all sort of things I’ve seen in the movies ) I wasn’t genuinely wanted to propose or like her or love her just as a thank you and last gift because she always taking care of me like a sister. 
She was laughing but say “I can’t marry you you are a kid and not a boy” and then I was fooling around I jumped on her back wanted her to piggy back carry me but I was playing along and said “whyyy ? if you don’t accept me I will choke you hahah” ( again from watching too much tv as a kid ) somehow at that moment her mom aka the admin saw me on her back with my hand pretending to choke her, she yelled at me really loud “ I WARN YOU TO NOT GO ANY NEAR TO MY GIRL “ 
I was afraid and confused I wanted to get down from her but she was too tall I couldn’t reach the floor then end up accidentally choking her for real then she fainted and i fall down then her mom fainted too because of heart attack, her sister was the witness of the whole incident. After seeing them fainted I don’t understand what’s going on as it happened in split second and I couldn’t process the whole thing. I ran downstairs and my parents were waiting for me in the car, I told them the admin fainted I think we might need to call ambulance. 

I don’t remember anything afterwards but few weeks later I went back to class the admin wanted to see me. She thank me for saving her but still think I am a monster because I harmed her girl, she strongly disagree of me coming to classes again or else she will leave “ Is either you stay or I stay “ at that time I was upset and don’t know what I’ve done. 
I don’t know what did I told my parents they were gonna sue her for something and then she interrogated me again with my ballet class teacher allowed?? While I was supposed to attend the class. She locked me up in the office with a camera recording me asking me a bunch of things I don’t remember now. I don’t understand but scared because who wouldn’t ? And then she went out and ask me to stay in the office, which I thought she locked me inside and then I was confused and alone in the office wondering why did deserve to be treated like this I started to breakdown and crying under the office table hiding. She came back to check on me after that but I was afraid of her so I keep on hiding underneath, she thought I left then she close the door and went away. I don’t know how long I cried then when I get up and checked outside the office everyone left and is dark. I panicked then yell then scream and shout and tossed everything around in the office.

No memories of what happened after that but I remembered I was being hypnotised and then woke up with my family asking me if I remembered them or not. 

The thing is I requested to be hypnotised to forget about everything happened including what I’ve done and harm that I’ve caused. 

Everything came back to me this year,  I relived to the memories over and over again I feel ashamed and always blame myself for the same reason. I tried seeing a therapist but he wasn’t really concerned about me.

422,"I applied for a job with a CV I decided to not disclose my last “very-short-job” on neither mention it throughout the recruitment process thinking it was not worth mentioning. I got to the final stage of the process, today I have done some research to find out that the guy who held this job before me has actually move to the company and the exact same manger I was last with “which I decided to not disclose”.

Now I am worry if my new manager would know about this by an outsider and would consider this as a lie, or should I just tell him before accepting the job or should I just stay silent about it?",18Jun2018,1
423,"I lost my virginity at 19, and have since used sex as a way to entice men into having a relationship with me. Of course that has never worked but old habits die hard.

I do not recall ever enjoying sex, other than once which I remember was the second time I ever had sex. I was 19 and the guy went down on me. Even now I tell myself ""This time will be different, I will enjoy it"" but once I'm there I can't wait for it to be over. I find myself faking orgasm to get it to be over with, because I really just can't feel anything. The guy will be going down on me and I will be laying there thinking how I can get it to stop without hurting his feelings.

I have had sex with quite a few men to convince myself that nothing is wrong with me, but the truth is becoming glaringly obvious, I have no sex drive...

I am far more interested in the romantic aspect of relationships, I cannot seem to find a guy who is interested in anything more than sex. I have been tricked into thinking a real romantic conection was being worked on so many times, but once sex happens, they're gone. I don't even want sex but I have figured its a sacrifice I have to make to find ""the one"".

The strangest thing is that in reading about asexuality, I see a lot of people saying they realised early on in life, like preteen and teen ages. Personally though, this is only something I've experienced since age 20-21, I am now 22. I used to feel intense sexual attraction to men, and even female porn to the point id have to masturbate right away. I used to have intense crushes and extended fantasies about guys I crushed on. I'm thinking that maybe excessive masturbation and porn ruined my sex drive. There were times in my late teens early 20s that Id masturbate like 7 times in the day. Another cause for my lack of sex drive could be the medication I take for depression and anxiety (duloxetine).

Anyway I made this post wondering if there is any hope for me as a ""heteroromantic"" woman, I guess, to find love, or anything like it...or how can I just forget about relationship and move on with my life?

I think I am going to abstain from sex...I don't enjoy it at all, and the men I am giving it up for are obviously not worth it.",18Jun2018,0
424,"So i just finished grade 9. And i have to decide to change school or not. My school is 46th in my country and i took an exam to get into a better school. I passed exam with 72% rating and i now have to decide whether to change school or not. That school is 13th/14th place in my country so its a big upgrade from my current one. This exam guaranteed place in math class which is very good and only smartest kids go in math classes. If i go and change my school , i will lose all of my friends in current school but i will get better education. Would be nice if you could help me clear my mind and help me decide what to do. Maybe it is a time for change and it's not that bad to lose some friends in order to get more friends.",18Jun2018,5
425,"So, a coworker approaches me and asks, essentially, if I have another job or source of income. He says he likes the way I carry myself, that him and his wife are doing entrepreneurial things, and wanted to introduce me to what he does and his contacts. 

Set up a meeting a few days later with the guy and his wife over coffee. Very vague and essentially just a conversation about life values, goals, etc. They give me a task: Write down 30 things you'd like to be, have, or do if money was no object. They also asked me to watch a video by Simon Sinek called ""Start with Why"". 

We meet again a few days later, and  go over the list I wrote. Then we discuss the video, and they invite me to meet some of their people at a meeting this Tuesday. Some kind of lecture and a little meet and greet with a bunch of people.

I told them I'm not interested in anything even resembling a sales and marketing pyramid, will not sign anything or give anyone any money, and they assured me it's nothing like that.

Still have no idea what's going on, but I am very curious. I know I should ask, but it seems  like part of their 'vetting' process, here, is incumbent on me being patient with them and going with the flow, which I'm cool with. 

Has anyone experienced anything like this, and what happened? Or, if not, can anyone postulate what might be going on? ",18Jun2018,1
426,"I love next door to a family with two teenage boys, a teenage girl, a mum and there's a new male partner who I've seen smoking outside on occasion (I don't know if he's moved in).

Sometimes at night I hear shouting next door. It's usually an argument between the daughter and her mum or sibling fights, but this time I hear screaming and crashing about. The kind of screaming you'd hear from someone who is being threatened or physically hurt, but they were short screams and have only happened twice tonight. I can't hear that much since they are downstairs and I'm in bed upstairs.

I was wondering if stuff like that warrants calling 999? I don't want to be a nosey neighbour but sometimes it's hard when it's 1am and I'm trying to sleep. I'm beginning to be concerned that the new partner may be abusive, but I've only heard this level of distress  once in the past 6 months.

TLDR: heard screaming and banging next door. Not uncommon for these neighbours to fight but this time it sounded serious.",18Jun2018,6
427,"Made an account just for this. I'm a 23 year old guy, I was waiting for the bus at a nearby station and decided to charge my phone. I ended up sitting next to a woman who was already there, with her two kids and presumably boyfriend. So as I'm charging my phone with headphones in, I hear her constantly complaining to someone about how shitty her boyfriend is and she won't be putting up with it much longer. Along with something about long hours at a hospital, so I assume she's a nurse or caregiver at an elderly home. 

Anyway this dude definitely seems the asshole type, he's yelling her name across the station, telling her hurry the fuck up, cursing at her etc. You get the picture. So he leaves with the kids to get them food, I look over and notice she's downright beautiful aside from looking stressed out and I decide fuck it I'm going to flirt with her and try for her number. Yeah roast me if you want I know, cut a guy some slack.

I ask her if she's alright to which she says yes, which I doubt. I have a thing for feet so I comment on her feet in her sandals, she gets bashful, smiles at me like crazy, then says ""How old are you little boy? Can't be older then 17"" to which I laugh and say otherwise, turns out she's 33. So we're flirting back and forth, she asks do I always look at women's feet I say only beautiful women like you yada yada suave shit like that. Keep in mind she's not showing any signs of being uncomfortable, or disliking the attention just all smiles and intense eye contact otherwise I would have backed off.

Finally I say I have to go and catch the bus soon, and before I even open my mouth she asks if I have a Facebook. I say I don't use it, and I ask for her number instead to which she gladly gives along with her name. At this moment her boyfriend came back and she stopped for a second and whispered the last numbers to me. I wish her a good day and leave. 

That was Sunday at 9 before I went to my night shift that same day, I text her in the morning around 5Pm and say ""Hey it's the good looking guy from yesterday, it was really nice meeting you. Anyway I was wondering would you want to meet up for some coffee sometime this week?"" She texts back ignoring the meet up question with ""Good looking guy? Send me a pic"" to which I send a selfie saying how's that? That could be where I fucked up but I didn't just want to hand out dick pics or shirtless pics and she's like wtf man? After that she replies ""Foot fetish ;)""

She then tried to call me two minutes later but I was on the phone with my bud at the time. I've dropped my phone so many times so it doesn't always notify me of calls, so I noticed upon checking my phone a moment later that she called. I immediately tried calling her back but I got voicemail. I assume she's busy with a lot considering, kids, shit boyfriend, job, and all that according to bits and pieces of her conversation I overheard Sunday night.

So I don't say anything else after that, the next day which is today this time at 3pm I try calling again and get voicemail. I assume she's probably busy or just lost interest no idea. So what should I do? Delete the number or try again tomorrow with a text or call or just give up? ",18Jun2018,1
428,"My best Friend since about 10th grade over the last few years seems to be progressively getting more and more sucidal. I know he used to do alot of drugs to as he puts it ""not feel the same"" recently he's moved to alcohol and stopped going to work. Over the last few years ive tried to help, we'd talk about why he feels this way, I suggested he seek help which he did, he was placed on antidepressants but he says they did nothing and doesn't want to keep taking them. He also seems to care less about his safety, putting himself in pretty dangerous situations, especially while driving. This after noon he sent me a msg that he is getting close to ""ending it"".

429,"So, in every other area of my life, I have pretty immense self control. However, when it comes to my diet, I really struggle. 

After some trauma when I was 16, I gained a lot of weight. I'm 22 now, and I still haven't lost it. I can still fit in the ""regular sizes"" of clothes, but I'm venturing into plus size category, and I hate it. I absolutely hate how I look and feel. 

Previously, I was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome and put on Metformin so I could try to lose weight on a low carb diet. Every time I get on it, (which I've done on and off for probably 5 years now), though, I end up binging on carbs and fucking it all up. I honestly think I'm addicted to sugar/carbs. It's so easy for me to go out with friends or family and forget about the diet and just end up eating/drinking carbs with the rest of them. Or, I get in a tough emotional situation, and all I want is some candy or pasta. I don't enjoy eating meat very much, so it's tough for me to feel full and satisfied while on low carb/keto.

How can I get over this? I want so desperately to lose weight but with the way I eat, I know it won't happen for me. I want to break this addiction to carbs and emotional eating. Any tips?",18Jun2018,1
