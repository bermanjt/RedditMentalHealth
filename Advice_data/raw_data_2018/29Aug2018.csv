It sounds really stupid, but I've always wanted to have sex before I was legal. Obviously this won't be happening now but I'd still really like to meet someone.

I'm not sporty at all but am interested in joining clubs, I've talked to a lot of boys at school and they just aren't my type. One boy asked me out and he is lovely, but I just can't imagine ever being intimate with him. Then again, I'm starting to get quite desperate...

4,"Growing up asian you either had to be an engineer or something in the medical field. Funny, my dad is an engineer and my mom is a nurse. Due to my love for science I decided to be a nurse like my mom. Most importantly because they rejected any other offer I made (ex: pediatrician, occupational therapist). This is because they want me to have a career quickly. 
However I feel like I giving away my youth to something I don’t even want. I’m 20 and I never got to experience the typical university life because I started at community college. I start nursing school next year and in two years I’ll be a registered nurse at the age of 23. I’m in tears because nursing school will be stressful then being a nurse will be stressful. So the highlight 20s of my life is just going to be constant stress before I have to start a family. This bothers me because when I want to be something more. I don’t mind being in school a little while longer it’s just that tuition might be difficult with my family. Help me I’m so confused with life. ",29Aug2018,1

I get too attached too early, if I date someone it's because I really like them and see a future.

I'm used to long-term monogamy so the past two years of dating have been no fun, there have been 3 'relationships' in this time which have all only lasted 2-3 months, but in all cases it's taken me too long to bounce back and I've just felt too downtrodden to get back out there - I'm in my thirties and don't get to meet many people so it's not like I can risk taking forever to heal following bad dating. It shouldn't be taking me 2-3 months to recover after these experiences!

I'm coming across too many jerks on in the dating scene, it leaves me cynical of dating. Of the three guys I've had a 'relationship' with one turned out to be a womanizing narcissist, one was a closeted alcoholic who strung me along before I found him back on a dating app, and the last I thought was the real deal but he turned out to be emotionally abusive. I don't need a man but I want one, unfortunately I rarely meet people which limits me in trying to find a new partner, but when there's such a high number of men like this it really puts me off putting myself back out there.

It's not like I'm super attached, but I think a bit part of the problem is I have no family or friends - that doesn't just mean no support, but also no validation. My self-esteem isn't low and it's not like I seek validation from others, but the fact is that everyone gets validation from the people in their lives...so I guess those of us without anyone in our lives end-up feeling especially rejected after a 'relationship' has failed, it's hard to face the fact no one seems to see any value in you.

Yeah yeah, I need to make friends - *I KNOW* \- being friendless isn't a choice and if it were that easy I'd not be in this position I'm in now. I can't afford to take time out from dating to focus on friends or other things (no friends means no social life, I've too much time on my hands so I find keeping busy post-breakup hard), I have to work on both at once.

So...

I need to get better at not getting so attached.I need to get better at not taking rejection so personally.I need to get better at healing, moving on, and staying positive.I need to get better at accepting the other person just didn't work out and/or was a jerk.

But HOW?Any suggestions?",29Aug2018,1
9,"I’m really uncomfortable talking about issues with them (not because of them in particular) and so I haven’t talked about some problems because of the discomfort. Like I haven’t said anything about being compelled to non suicidally hurt myself as I am afraid of the repercussions of saying that (I’ve talked very generally about compulsions just not this example). I’ve obviously said enough to be diagnosed, but not everything.

They are also super neutral about things so I don’t know what issues are completely real vs  partially/fully delusional. Idk I think the focus right now is building a relationship but I just want to be able to talk about issues and be certain about reality.

Should I just go with their process or should I say something? Should I say something about self harm compulsions?

Also, not sure if this is the right sub to ask but if anyone is willing to be a “sounding board” for input on if things seem unrealistic or not please let me know.",29Aug2018,1
10,"This is gonna be a bit of a long post, so bare with me through this wall of text. I just wanted to make the history a little clear and what not.

I'll start with a little background. The woman in question is 23 years old, and an engineer in my workplace. She was an intern when I met her. I'm just a lowly forklift driver, but when we met we really hit it off. It soon came that we were either talking face to face, texting, or phone calls from morning till night every day. This went on for several months. We both made our feelings for each other clear, and everything was going great until I pushed a little too hard for more out of our relationship (i.e. let's be boyfriend/girlfriend). All of her feelings for me disappeared, but we had also became like best friends and we couldn't imagine never talking again so we attempted the ""just friends"" thing but that went horribly.

 I was still hurting because I was head over heels for this girl but when we hung out the one time after she called it off, she spent the entire day texting another man. It was extremely painful for me so I didn't hang out with her again. Some other stuff in my life went down hill hard and the depression caused by all these things together caused me to have a mental breakdown, in which my bestfriends wife took advantage of me when I came to the 2 of them, crying and looking for advice. After this I began seeing a therapist, who sent me to a doctor, who prescribed medication for depression and anxiety. I continued seeing the therapist every week for several months. I also switched to a different shift at work to get away from the stress she brings upon me. And that brings us to today.


I came back to the day shift last week after 7 months on afternoons because I missed my friends I used to work with who genuinely care about me. I have not spoken a word to this girl in 4 months now when I decided enough was enough, but in the past week I have seen her quite a few times. When I see her, my heart starts pounding, I start sweating, and I have the urge to run away. This girl hurt me so badly, I am honestly just terrified of her.

Today towards the end of the shift, a super nice 61 year old lady who knows nothing about the 2 of us asked me ""That girl over there, what's her job?"" I told her ""Shes an engineer."" And then I pointed to one of the engineering technicians we work with and said ""She is his boss."" She kind of laughed and said ""No wonder he's so grumpy, he works for a girl less than half his age"" but she meant it as a joke, nothing against the girl. I replied by saying ""Well she earned it, she worked hard and went to college. She was an intern here for 2 years. If he wanted that job he should've done the same."" 

I then find out that the girl has been saying bad things about me to my coworker's. Not her coworkers, but mine. The ones that I work alongside all day every day. I didn't want to know what things exactly because it hurt enough already. I know many of her secrets that could make her life a bit hellish, but I would never hurt her or her reputation like that. I still care deeply for her. It really hurt that when someone asked me about her, I had nothing but nice things too say, but shes saying bad things about me behind my back. I know I'm not perfect and when she broke things off I didn't take it as well as I should've, but I've always blamed myself and never blamed her and never spread things about her to anyone else.

This doesn't sound like her. The girl I fell for wasn't a jerk, and I knew her better than anyone (not being weird or creepy, but we spoke every minute of every day and we know literally everything about each other.) It leads me to believe maybe something is going on with her to make her act this way. I'll admit my initial impulse was a typical testosterone fueled, angry one. I wanted to confront her and ask ""What the fuck?"" In a less polite way. But I kept my cool and continued talking to that older lady whom made me feel a lot better. Sidenote, I dont usually lose my temper, I usually stay calm. But the impulses are there ofcourse. I have never yelled at this girl before incase any of you are wondering.

 (Shout out to the older lady for not judging me based off what the girl said about me and instead asking me about her and finding out if I'm as bad as the girl says. I thanked her and she told me ""Theres always 2 sides to a story and you never seemed like a bad guy. You were quick to defend her and that's honorable."")

My question for all of you is, what should I do? 

I've made an appointment with my therapist for tomorrow after work, but my mind is racing and I doubt I'll be able to sleep a wink tonight.

Should I calmly ask her why shes saying bad things about me? Should I ask her if shes doing okay, because this isnt like her?

As a reference, if I did decide to talk to her tomorrow morning it would go something like this:
""Hey, do you have a minute to talk?
Is everything okay with you? I heard you were saying some not-so-good things about me and that doesn't sound like something you would normally do.
I'm not mad, just hurt. I would never do that to you. But luckily I'm not in a position where a bad reputation can affect my work status and the people that care about me won't believe you anyways. So I'll forgive you if you promise to stop.
I've gone through months of therapy and I just came back to day shift, please dont make my time here unpleasant.""

Something like that. Ofcourse, if she does end up saying something IS in fact wrong, I will address it because well... I still care for her and I want to help her if possible.


Any advice would be helpful. This girl just has a knack for smacking my heart around, but she made me truly happy for the first time since my mother passed in 2010. That was a great feeling and I'll always be grateful for her giving me that gift, even if it didn't last as  long as I would've hoped. I dont wanna handle this the wrong way and end up hurting her or her reputation, but I also can't allow her to talk about me in a negative way too my coworkers or else I'll end up losing my temper when one of the guys inevitably goes too far. My stress tolerance is still on the weaker side.",29Aug2018,1
12,"I am currently a junior in college and one of my friends texted me back in March to be house-mates for our senior year next year. I was on board back then but since March I have realized that I really do not want to live with her. She is an extremely negative person and I feel like she thinks everything revolves around her, plus she always complains to me about her life but as soon as I talk about mine she always seems disinterested- I doubt she knows very much about me despite claiming that I'm her ""best friend"" here. Not to mention she always shit talks people in our friend group to me all the time, just making dumb remarks that frankly are super unessecary such as ""ew why would she go to that party, they suck"" or ""she's annoying as hell have fun hanging out with her ha"". She also made a girl cry before and had no remorse and told me ""wow that girl is so sensitive she needs to suck it up"". So basically this girl is a bitch. Just not to me. To me she's just kinda negative and acts uninterested yet is SUPER clingy to me and tries to claim me for everything, but she's never really done anything awful to me which makes me feel even worse for not wanting to live with her.

​

So, we have been planning to get an apartment together for a while but we've been trying to figure out where and with who else. I had just assumed other people in my friend group would maybe live with us and it would make her more bearable, but no one wants to live with her either. Three of my friends approached me yesterday and said they really want me to live with them senior year. These girls are some of my greatest, most positive, caring friends. People that I know will always make me happy and who genuinely listen to what I have to say- they are amazing girls. I cannot express how much I want to live with them, but I'm supposed to live with this other girl. So now I am stuck between doing what would make me happy, or being stuck in a living situation that would frankly make me possibly become depressed. I just don't know what to do because I don't want to be a total bitch and backstab her out of the blue like that, because I'm also pretty much her only friend left that isn't graduating. I did ask the other 3 girls if they would be ok with her living with us too, to try and make the situation good for both parties, but all the girls said they absolutely do not want to live with her, especially because she has a dog she has to have and they don't like dogs. I know the best option is to live with these 3 other great girls, but I am a very nice, non-confrontational person and I'm gonna feel AWFUL about telling this other girl I can't live with her anymore. And i know she is going to hate me and talk shit about me to any one who will listen, which I get and I probably would too, but I just want to be in a living situation where I'm happy. 

​

I already had to deal with an awful entitled, rude roommate both freshmen and sophomore year and thinking about having to live like that for my SENIOR year is really upsetting me. So if anyone has any advice on how to handle this situation please let me know! I know she will be very hurt and blindsided if I tell her I can't live with her- especially after discussing it for so long but the thought of living with her is making me already feel very sad about my senior year.

​

**TLDR; My friend who is super negative and I don't really like being around and I are supposed to live together next year, but I've realized that I would be sad and upset all of my senior year of college so I want to move in with 3 of my other friends and I feel like an awful person for wanting to do that.**",29Aug2018,1

14,"First year college student. I decided to attend a military school. Anyways, I've always been a homebody. I loved being at home, having friends minutes away, and if it got boring, I could just go home and talk to my family. Now I'm at a military school with limited technology use, seldom free time, constant yelling, constant alertness,  lots of sweating and stress. Not to be selfish, but I think my case needs some different advice. I can't just go home on weekends (not allowed for first year), talk to them on the phone, or go into a corner and listen to music or watch tv. I know they're super proud of me because I get emails about it everyday and my sisters talk about how much they talk about me. 

How im trying to deal with it:

\-Telling myself they'll visit a lot

\-Knowing that if I went home, life wouldn't be the same as it was

\-Although they'd still love me, they wouldn't want me home really

\-Theyre are always breaks

I'm likely to pick up sweets as a 'treat' to cheer myself up, as I know I'll want them later, if on sale/reduced, if something new, etc. and it's so automatic it's not until after I've bought them I realize it's a bad idea or I feel guilty after eating them.",29Aug2018,1

18,"So my fiancé and I just moved in together earlier this month. During the first week we moved in, my younger brother stayed with us one day and was playing video games and the bass from our sound system was apparently too loud. This had been the only time we had left it that loud and it was still early in the afternoon but not even an hour later the upstairs neighbors left a note outside asking us to please turn down the bass because it was shaking their walls upstairs. I honestly felt like they were just being picky but we turned it down regardless and have been careful to not be too loud since then. However, I’ve been noticing that every single night after 12 or 1am they are always stomping around upstairs and being loud. One time I did notice that our glass dinner table was even shaking because of the noise. During the whole day it’s pretty quiet but it’s always after midnight that they start making noise and stomping around and it’s really annoying and keeps me up for a while. 

I’ve been wanting to write on the back of the note they left us to stop being so loud that late every night but I don’t know if I should just ignore it and deal with it.

Just wondering if anyone has any advice or has gone through the inevitable break up that comes with going to college.

My boyfriend and I have been together over a year and we really care about each other, but I’m going to college and he has one more year in high school (which just sucks lol) even though he’s a little older than me. 

The part I’m worried about is that we have been through a lot together and have a strong connection. We are huge parts of each other’s lives! Realistically, I will meet so many new friends and stuff in college, but I am just nervous and seeking some advice as to how to go about it. 

We have decided to break up when I leave, as I think it’ll be the best decision for me, even though I know he’d like to do distance. We will only be two hours away from each other, but that’s still too long and I don’t want to be “that girl” who drives home every weekend and is constantly in contact with her high school boyfriend.

I want to start this new chapter of my life and I’m wondering how to do it gracefully. Should we be friends? What if he sees other girls? These are the questions in my head which make me nervous. I know it’s for the best, but just seeking some advice as to how to take it in stride. I’m very excited for college, but worried about this.

27,"I am pretty sure my car was scrapped by a staff member at the college I attend. 
I go to a community college in a beach town in California.
So my boyfriend and I share a car (it's his car, and he's kind enough to let me use it from time to time). I took the car to campus today, and was lucky enough to park up by the admin building for my one afternoon class. When class is over, I walk back to the car and notice a deep scrape on the back left bumper. The red SUV parked to the left of me had a scrape on the right hand side of their front bumper. There was also white paint on their car (the color of my bfs car). The scrape was not there before I left for class, I know this because I look at the car, inspecting it for door dents and scratches as I walk up to the drivers side everyday (out of habit from baby-ing my old car. RIP.). This scrape is about 6 inches long, one inch in height, and had compleatly taken off the white paint, exposing the grey metal underneath. 
The red car has a staff members parking pass in the window. So I am livid. 
I call the security office, and the officer came out to write up a report. He said that because there's no video servalence in the parking lot, and no witnesses,  I cannot prove that the red SUV hit my bfs car. I called my bf, he said to call the police. But, now 15 minutes has past and I am now running late for work. The security guard said calling the police would be a waste of time, I cant prove the staff member in the red car did it, and I cant leave a note on their car because I didnt see it happen this I don't know for sure that it was them. Security guard said the police would just take picture of my bfs car take a statement from me, then go, and he highly discouraged any further action.
I'm angry. I feel helpless. I left without calling because I didn't have proof the school staff member did it. My bf is mad that I did. He wants them to pay for the damage. 
I don't know what to do at this point. I'm at work, and my bf is mad. Please help reddit!

TL;DR: my bfs car was scraped by somebody else in the parking lot of my college. I think its staff, the security guard said there's no proof, so nothing can be done.

29,"It's a dumb question but I feel I'm not doing well. I'm going to try tutoring tomorrow but I otherwise have no job, no car and no interest in my major. I'm only in my second year but I already had credits for core classes prior to coming here. I don't know what I want and I don't know how to figure it out.

30,"First and foremost, I am incredibly lucky to be at this school. Growing up we didn't always have enough to eat and were even homeless for a while, and it's honestly a miracle that I'm even here and have the opportunities that I do. I just want to make it clear that I'm not complaining just to complain because I definitely am super aware of how lucky I am to be here.

That said, it is very difficult to be poor at this school. The level of wealth and privilege is just hard to stomach sometimes, especially because it's assumed to be super normal so no one ever talks about it. I've never really felt all that comfortable here because of the massive class difference, which is obviously fine because I'm reaping huge professional benefits from being here, but it starts to take a bit of a personal toll when people subtly snipe at the fact that you're poor or ignore that fact that it's an option to not be fabulously wealthy.

Institutionally, there has always been a great amount of support. I've had to stay over Thanksgiving and shorter breaks in the past, and the school provided food and housing for free, and they've helped me with books and free tuition and housing. I am exceptionally grateful. They even funded me to work with refugees and do research on migration for 8 months abroad, which will absolutely help me get into grad school and law school and provide some financial security for me and my family in the future. That's all that really matters in the end, but going to this school has been massively unpleasant at times. I also just got back to the country like two weeks ago, so maybe I'm just more bothered by all of this right now.

One example is just tonight when I was showing a friend of mine my apartment. She stumbled in kind of drunk because classes haven't started yet and there aren't any real consequences to her actions because she's a literal fucking hotel heiress, but the kind of drunk where she was clearly trying to act more drunk than she actually was. It was that kind-of-jokey to mask something serious tone, and she started absolutely ripping on my dorm set up.

She made fun of the fact that I don't have much wall art (I can't afford it, I put up a couple of flags and a brochure/poster thing from my job that deals with human trafficking) and started going through my things and making kind of rude comments about how few clothes I have (I'm poor, I get it). There was more that is difficult to express, but it like was not even subtle. In the same sort of joking tone she made a comment about how I couldn't afford to live off campus (my mom had medical bills and I ended up giving her some of the money I would have used to live with friends to help her out because she's given me everything) and said that the windows don't open fully because some people are depressed because they do things like work with refugees over the summer. This is actually the happiest I've been since I started at this school, but I was massively depressed my sophomore year because of things like this. I used to internalize the class difference a little bit, but now I know that it's absolutely not my fault and I had to overcome very long odds to be where I am now. I kind of told her to fuck off and get out of my room after that.

Things like this are very common here even if they're not often as overt or mean as this was, and I'm just kind of ranting and hoping for some advice. Has anyone else here been in a similar situation, and even if not can you give me some advice on how to get through it for one more year without losing my sanity? I absolutely deserve to be here as much as anyone else, which I didn't believe in the past unfortunately.

TLDR: Friends at my elite college subtly poor shame me sometimes either intentionally or unintentionally, and while I know how lucky I am it gets a bit draining. Do you have any advice on how to get through one more year without sacrificing my mental health?",29Aug2018,4

32,"I have always had different interests in life but I was never able to stick to one thing.I had phases where video editing was my passion then creative writing then music.. but the problem is that I never really stuck with any of those passions long enough to be great. Fast forward a few years after finishing university i started learning web development and i managed to land a job as a developer and i have been working as one for two years. In the beginning I was loving it and I did everything I can to improve. Now all of a sudden it feels like a burden and I cant bring myself to learn in my free time. The thing with being a web developer is that you have to constantly keep learning new things in yiur free time to improve, otherwise you fall behind. 

Now that i am in this rut i keep thinking back to my older passions and wonder what could have been. Then I waste time trying to pick up music again etc.. 

I have many issues bothering me but it has been really hard to bring myself to talk recently that I am just blurting out whatever i can now just to start. 

What I want advice for is what do I do about this rut I am feeling? I know the wisest thing to do is to follow through with web development until I regain my motivation..

And I mean a lot. I’ve tried making things better but I always fuck it up, yet she’s very controlling to me. Doesn’t let me do a lot of things and gets on my ass and nags over little things that shouldn’t warrant that. But today after a huge argument, I told her I don’t wanna keep hurting her. I want to keep dating but I’m sick of watching her suffer over my mistakes. And I’ve tried changing everything, I don’t know how to fix it anymore. She said we’re not good for each other but she wants to keep dating. I honestly don’t see us getting better, but she’s very suicidal and I’m deathly afraid of pushing her over the edge.

36,"I just got in a fight with 2 strangers. Was sitting at a restaurant when my husband pointed out the window at 2 people leaving a car, all windows up, with an adult pit bull. It’s 80 degrees. As we waited for our check I saw the couple sit at the bar. By the time, I walked over they already had drinks and   I told them I saw them leave their dog and I asked them if I could watch her since it’s hot. They said they would only be there 30 minutes (on an 80 degree day a car is 100 degrees in 10 minutes, which I told them) and to leave them alone. I told the bartender what I saw (in front of them) and told them they need to get their dog or I’m calling the police. 

At that point I was told to 
- mind my own business
- stop harassing them 
-it’s not hot out (80 degree on dark sky app)
_leave 
-go away
- bye
-bye
-bye.....
- (each bye was followed by a hand flick toward my face)


So I again showed them the outside temp on my app and said get your dog

- bye

That’s when I called 911 in front of them and the lady ran out swearing at me calling me every name possible (including entitled white trash). She sped out of the parking lot while I was acting like I was taking a photo of her plate. Because I was pissed. 

I’m sure I could have done it differently like called the police right away. Right before that, we had gotten a doggy bag for our leftover steak for our puppies Lucy and Jack. When we got in our car to leave, it was steaming hot.

He handles paying out our vendors and receiving new product shipments. We both take care of daily inventory tasks like cycle counts and bringing back stock to the floor as needed.

Instead I'm staying in my hometown, living with my family while I take courses at a community college and then transferring in 2020. This was a quick decision that I had to make that I obviously think about every day. 

Mostly because I never really connected on an intimate level with anyone who lives near me, and was looking forward to the prospect of starting anew in terms of people.

I'm working in a tech support job (for Apple, it's like a call center but via online chats) and it's whatever. I have a crush on a coworker but idk what's happening with that. I'm overthinking it naturally. none of this is important.

I just have these little, meaningless experiences that keep replaying in my head. stuff related to a guy I liked previously. situation is too confusing to explain every detail. it was just confusing, and my issue is literally that I remember too many details. this is just the most recent incident that has confused me this way. I feel so detached from people. co-workers are pretty cool, my family has its ups and downs but blessed from most people's perspectives, at least in terms of love. anyway i just do not feel attached to anybody except in short bursts? and the hurtful memories make me experience fleeting moments of blind anger. and I mean fleeting. like my body tenses up, and my eyes kinda glaze over, I can't think straight. nothing actually happens. it's just internalized and it lasts a few seconds and I hate it cuz my body rejects negative feelings, so i just try to push it away. I can't stop rethinking these negative memories. I distract myself sometimes and can appear carefree and even bubbly at times but internally it's just wtf?

it's shame more than anger though. I feel ashamed that i let myself be treated this way. i expected more from myself, and it wasn't abuse (unless you consider mindgames abuse, and even that I'm not sure of?) and it wasn't a random fling with mixed signals. it was a close friend (or so I thought) and a lot of really creepy coincidences that i genuinely want to believe were just coincidences, but something about them has resulted in me thinking this person was literally mindfucking me.

I don't even want to go into the details because again there are too many, and quite frankly? I'm aware that time heals most wounds so it won't be a problem forever, and it's already gotten better, but I've just not been able to look at life the same way since it happened. I feel like I'm psyching myself out at this point. 

I just do not feel attached. I seem to be very easygoing despite certain setbacks. I literally get so excited over minor stuff (bbq at work? awesome day) it's just these fleeting moments of deadness inside. interacting with people is fine, it's just that I can't help but secretly project the hurt that this one guy caused me, onto these new people. it's making me too scared to do something as simple as showing interest in this guy at work, like I refuse to give any indication I might be interested, just out of fear of what may have happened with the other guy previously.

okay I really don't know what kind of advice I'm asking for and I really do apologize for the stream of consciousness vent. I'm usually an okay writer but i wanted to make sure to follow my thoughts as genuinely as possible, because I've also just been struggling with being ""myself"" lately. many reasons why.

44,"So I am 17, my younger brother is 16. I have a job and am saving money so the second I turn 18 I can leave, because the state I am in law dictates unless my parents give me permission I cannot legally move out until I am 18.

So I have to deal with this until March of next year.

But lets take the latest example, I work after school 4 to 9. I got home and right when I walk in the door my younger brother starts yelling at me for something that apparently ""I did"" and my mother and grandmother both took his side.

He claims that I hit him and pushed him out of my car when we left school.

I don't go directly home after school as I am getting help with a subject and the school provides tutoring until 3:30. So he rides a bus home.

Apparently my mother and grandmother didn't remember I do this or like always they just blindly trust everything he says even though he lies through his teeth about everything.

So, I walk in, he is cursing at me, my mother is telling me I am a disappointment to treat my younger brother like that and my grandmother tells me the next time I ""hurt"" my younger brother she will call the police on me and that she doesn't want to see me the rest of the night or she'll be tempted to call the police on me tonight.

So here I am in my room, waiting until my grandmother goes to bed so I can get a shower and food.

This is just the latest in a web of lies my brother tells them and they believe EVERY word of it and never even ask for my side of the story, it's always my fault even if I had nothing to do with it.

The worst time was when he stole $200 from my mother and she blamed me when I wasn't even in town when it happened. I was at a sport event because I am on the basketball team and we were traveling. 

So when I get home, she starts yelling and cursing threatening the cops on something I had no part in because she blindly believes his lies.

I'm at the end of my rope, honestly, I can safely say when I move out, I will never speak to my brother ever again, I don't want my mother and grandmother to be the same but they are pushing me away by believing his lies. I don't know what to do.",29Aug2018,1

I am a first year teacher. My first day teaching was this past Monday. This is the first time I have ever ran my own classroom, including managing an assistant teacher (lets call her P) and an aide (lets call her H) to help me out ( All F, 20 somethings). Everything between the 3 of us has been great, until this afternoon.

After my students left, H was telling us about her husband and two kids. I was not paying much attention to their conversation because I was setting up some of the centers in my classroom. However, I  did hear P ask H what her husbands name was and when H told her, P immediately started acting strangely and didn't want to talk about it anymore. H left not long after this conversation as our shifts were over. I stayed back a little later to work on my classroom some more when P said ""that was awkward."" I asked why. It turns out that H's husband has been cheating on her (I don't know if its current or not) and P is one of the women he's cheated with in the past.

This immediately freaked me out. If H were to find out, our teaching team would fall apart and it could effect the classroom, me, and my students. I'm really not sure what to do... I have asked some friends and they are not sure either. I am a first year teacher who is trying to get a hold on my classroom, I don't know how to handle potential issues like this!

What should I do? Just wait it out and hope nothing ever happens?

I met them online and we clicked really well, talked about a lot of things, both really random and really personal, opened up and helped each other, but also joked around, like friends usually do. It’s all been great for a few weeks.

About a werk ago, told me that they’ve been feeling kind of antisocial and that they didn’t feel like talking, to which I responded with giving them space and time, checking up on them from time to time, so that’s all been cool too.

But tonight I found out that they had an Instagram profile that’s been used days ago, even though they’ve said that they deleted their social media because it was bad, fake and didn’t do anyone any good (but had withdrawals from time to time and was thinking of opening one up again, even though this was their old account). I was supportive of that attitude, don’t get me wrong, but now I feel weird and kind of like I have been lies to.

How should I approach this? I can’t really tell them I found their Instagram account since that would sound stalkery, even though I did kind of just wanted to check since they’ve been feeling weird and therefore acted stalkery, but almost everyone does these types of things on social media, so I wouldn’t be the first or the last. He actually may be feeling antisocial, but it’s just weird to see him posting stuff on social media then...

I feel kind of betrayed and this coupled with them kind of avoiding talking to me sort of hurt me... I don’t know how to feel about it or what to do... So please help me any way you can. I think the best idea would be to talk to them and ask them if they still want to be friends, but kind of have to give them the reasons for asking that question... I don’t know.... Just please help me in any way you can.

Again, I don’t feel that sad about it, but I’m still a human, it hurt, and just want to resolve it somehow... And I know this has been an online friendship where everyone can act differently, but they really have been genuine with me for the most part, it’s just that they have been acting weird for a week, so I don’t know what to think and do...

61,"So there's this friend of mine I've known for around two years. Her and I had a friend in common who introduced us and we at first really hit it off. We both were ""weird"" and liked things that most people don't. Around a month or so, possibly longer, after we met, she started talking to me less and less. Every single conversation I had to initiate (which is how it is with most people tbh). 

Recently, she invited me to her graduation party and soon after I started developing serious feelings for her. And just a few weeks ago, her and I started up a conversation involving politics in which I made a joke about Trump that she found hilarious. This made my day because I genuinely like talking to her as a person and thought that maybe she felt the same. Immediately after, she left me on seen for days and now weeks, even though I clearly see that she's online. What could this mean? Could she be privy to my feelings and trying to ""ghost"" me? 

Also I think I should add that she's been in and out of relationships over the last few years. Almost all of which have lasted for less than two months (her most recent one was only a month).",29Aug2018,0

64,"I recently graduated from college in May and am still interviewing for jobs in my field. I have a seasonal job and am studying for a certification I need to truly break into the field. I am experienced but need to fill in some gaps before getting a good job.

I am working with about 5 different recruiting agencies on different jobs. I much to my shock got an interview at my dream company, its a Fortune 500 and I can list easily 15 reasons why I want  to work there.

My issue is upon getting the confirmation of the interview (Friday) the location I would be interviewing at is 1hr 15 min north of me. And will be a couple toll roads. The headquarters is about a hr east of me and would be free to travel to. I also know a lot of people who work at this headquarters but not at this location.

I am seriously tempted on passing on this interview. I am sick as as much as I would love to work at this company, I hate the idea of commuting on toll roads. I last week had a similar scenario as it was 2 exits on the turnpike and would be $5 one way. 

My home scenario is I can live at my parents rental rent free but I have to work around the houses (theirs and mine) and pay for sewage etc. So I am not totally keen on the idea of relocating.

Also can you help me as I do not wish to burn a bridge with this recruiter. There are tons of jobs in my field so I know the right one will come up eventually.",29Aug2018,1

66,"I’ve known this guy since 8th grade. Used to be a really nice fellow (still is, I guess), we used to hang out all the time and talk about all our problems together. We even went to the same high school together, so you can imagine. Then college came and, long story short, a few years later I’m in LA and he’s in Salt Lake City.

Now the problem is that for about 2 years I think, he has gotten really into drugs. Not heroin or extremely heavy stuff like that, but he loves to listen to techno while stuffing his mouth full of MDMA pills and snorting a line of that sketchy random dealer’s 99% purity coke (ahem, “c’mon man, that guy’s really trustworthy and knows his shit”). It’s gotten really annoying, he’s talking about this shit all the freaking time. He’s always telling a story of that time when he snorted speed a couple of weeks ago and “had soooo much fun, dude”. 

On top of that, he’s trying to belittle me for not using drugs. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not the “weed is the devil’s cabbage” type, I smoke weed if there’s a party and I do psychedelics once in a blue moon, but I’m much more focused on studying and being productive. I don’t really feel like doing any kind of drugs in the near future.

It’s gotten to the point where I don’t care if we talk or see eachother anymore, I just want to be left alone and not have anything to do with him anymore. A couple of days ago he told me that he’s gonna take a vacation. Have you guessed where? LA! And he’s gonna stay at my place, obviously. Aand he already bought plane tickets. Me, being the weak person that I am, reacted excited over text upon hearing this. He knew that I didn’t have plans for that period, unfortunately. Then he began telling me how excited he was because we are “totally gonna take shrooms toghether, dude”. As I said, I like psychedelics, I’ve taken them before, but I don’t feel like doing any kind of drugs at this point in my life. I just want to be left alone with my classes and work and not have to deal with wasting weekday nights on boring parties where people are too drunk or high to have a conversation with. I feel like this will knock me off of my routine that I’ve worked so hard on building, and have negative consequences on my morale and stability. It’s more about me now, I couldn’t care less about him to be honest, he’s not the friend I used to love hanging out with.

Anyway, if anyone really read all of this, thank you. If you have any advice on what to do or how to cope with the anxiety, it’s more than welcome.

71,"I moved to a foreign and took up a difficult topic to write my masters thesis on. My supervisors came and went, retired, moved away etc during my masters. One year in, I developed a serious case of depression and anxiety and was bedridden for months. I kept taking extensions, kept trying to work despite being unable to communicate so much with my current supervisor. I was unable to go to office because it made me really anxious. My supervisor didn’t know much about the topic i was going to write about so I read and understood everything myself. Three years went by with me struggling with my medications, personal life and school etc, My family had had enough, they were really pushing me to finish, so I did what I could, submitted the work that did do (I had generated a lot of data) but since I had a time limitation I was not able to analyse the data too much. Fast forward to my thesis defence day, the external sensor (who was on his phone a few times during my presentation), grilled me in all ways possible and i answered everything with confidence and yet I was ‘just’ passed. I was told I hadn’t discussed my thesis enough, even though my supervisor had told me to keep the discussion brief and concise. I’m not happy with a just passed grade. I feel like I’ve failed everyone’s expectations of me. I understand that I wasn’t in my office everyday but that doesn’t mean it was by choice. I feel like my supervisor wanted to guide me only if I came to the office. I don’t know what to think. I don’t have any other talents in life. Feeling rather disappointed with myself. 
I don’t know if I amount to anything or if I’ll ever be a functioning member of the society. My confidence has really taken a hit. Is there a life beyond this? I feel humiliated and feel like this is going to stick to me for the rest of my life.",29Aug2018,1

Found out through other people about his past of getting girls drunk and raping them. He got away with it of course since it’s been a couple years since then. I like hanging with him but I don’t agree with his past decisions, he genuinely doesn’t feel like a threat to me. He opened up about it and says he doesn’t do that anymore and that he knows how wrong it was. He said it was a bad time in his life. I don’t think I’m in any place to forgive him since he never did anything to me, but I can’t help but think about the victims and how they felt. There was no justice for them. 

I feel a little weird knowing this fact about him but everyone else knows and seems somewhat cool with it. I believe people change and I’ve always considered him good people but now idk, my judgment is a little cloudy and I feel uncertain. I wanna keep him around but then again there are good people I’ve cut out of my life for less serious reasons. Id feel like a horrible person and a hypocrite if I didn’t cut him out.

74,"I have been diagnosed with severe anxiety and a social phobia. When someone is hostile towards me, I can no longer be comfortable in their presence. I can avoid people that aren’t family, sure, but this guy lives *in my house.*

My therapist knows he lives here too and tries to console me and give me coping skills to try out, but I cannot stress this to anyone enough, I can hardly function. I go into a dissociative state, get a pounding headache, sweat profusely, become nauseous, and try to evade the situation as quickly and quietly as possible. 

For one thing, I am beyond tired of having to undergo that state *in my own home,* and the other thing is, my grandfather just died a horrid, bloody death. I don’t want to go into detail about what happened, but he was incredibly close to me and my immediate family. I have also been diagnosed with severe depression. I’m a very pessimistic person too, top all of that off with crushing anxiety, a social phobia and some rude stranger living in my home, and you can easily imagine how I’m doing right now. 

This boy, if you’ll refer to one of my recent posts, is garbage. Rude, disrespectful, disgusting garbage. 

I’ve protested his living with me to my parents. They refuse to make him go back to his own home. They know the full extent of my anxiety and even after three panic attacks in one day, they won’t help me. I’m their daughter. They shouldn’t be putting a stranger’s feelings in front of mine. I feel trapped and disregarded. Perhaps if I ask my therapist to suggest having him leave to my parents they’ll listen. I don’t care about this boy. I don’t care if he is angry at his father and doesn’t want to go back to living with him. He is invading the only place I have ever felt safe. This is made even worse considering I am homeschooled. I have no friends, so no one to stay with or confide in. Essentially, I am alone and facing the wrath of my disorder every day.

I had been introduced to Sarah a few months back through a mutual friend. I always thought she was cute, but never mentioned it to my friend since I knew my friend would be weirded out. From that day on we started talking, and I got her snapchat. 

Anyway, as time has passed I've grown to have feelings for her. The more I've gotten to know her the more I like her. I think she's adorable, and beautiful. 

But to my luck she has never been in a relationship before, and I like her a lot, I wouldn't want my heart to be broken because she decides she wants to do some exploring. Also, I'm not even sure she likes me in the way that I like her. The first week we talked a bit, hung out during our lunch hour, but now we haven't talked much if at all, she's always on my mind, but I get too choked up to even send her a message. I feel like such a coward, but also I don't see there being potential on us ever having anything other than a friendship.

The most I've been able to really do is tease her, call her a loser, which she typically responds with a cute emoji, and the word thanks. but that's about as far as it goes.

I never real choose to be in this business. There was a need for help right after I graduated college and it was my family so I stepped in. 

My dad started the business and his brother was a minor partner. I'm not trying to insult my dad or my uncle but neither had a life outside of work. Work was their entire life. Neither of them have friends or hobbies. I think it gave them a purpose in their lives and made them feel important and superior. I think they liked the idea of being the ""boss"" and people knowing who they were and treating them special because they were the ""boss."" 

Our business has been around for years and is kinda an institution in our area. We easily have hundreds if not thousands of customers walk through our doors daily. I'm pulling ten to twelve hour days on my feet running around. My main priority is a smooth running, profitable operation with quality products and a good reputation. I really don't enjoy my work or have any emotional attachment to it. I have friends and hobbies outside of work that I enjoy. Apparently my dad and my uncle enjoyed working in our business and it energized them, it drains me. There is actually huge turmoil in this business because my father and my uncle can't seem to understand my aspiration in life isn't spending my entire life in this business and changes need to be made for this to happen. 

It's one thing to say hello to people that are regular customers and have a very quick conversation but there are some people that want to stand there and become your best friend. In my experience these types of people almost always want something from you down the road and they think because they know your name and have talked to you they are entitled to it. It's either a discount or imposing on me and my staff way beyond a standard customer / staff relationship. Lots of these people seem to want to feel special and they seem to expect that every time they come in the fucking red carpet is to be rolled out and me or my staff have to do something or say something that reiterates the fact they are special and superior to other customers. Some of these people expect me to come running over if I see them and they don't want my staff helping them they want me to do it which is a fucking pain in the ass. Then some want me to have a long ass conversation with them. I could see if I own a slow shop or restaurant but I'm operating a business with a decent sized staff and lots of volume and I simply cannot accommodate these ""entitled regulars"" wanting special treatment for no other reason than it makes them feel good or strokes their ego.

92,"Tl;Dr at the end, sorry this got way longer than I expected.

Hi all, I need some help here... But first some background info. 

I have been friends with this girl (BF) since we were in high school, roughly 13 or so years now. For about two years we didn't speak and ended our friendship over some very dark stuff I'd rather not get into unless more context is needed. Eventually we became friends again and we've always said we would be each other's MOH whenever we got married. 

Well, my wonderful then boyfriend (M31) of almost 6 years finally proposed to me about two weeks ago. We live in the south now and she lives back in home state. 

I was visiting roughly 3 months ago and we were discussing my ""mother"" whom I don't have a relationship with and my choice not  to invite her if I get married. It's important to know that when this occurred, she knew that my fiancé was in the process of planning the proposal, she asked again if she'd be my MOG. At the time I said yes, however the night before we had gotten into a nasty fight over the stuff from years ago and essentially told me I had abandoned her when I moved and hadn't been a good friend. 

I spoke with FDH (future dear husband, sorry I lurk on JNOMIL a lot) about all this and he was astounded she'd actually asked me, at the time I didn't understand why he was so concerned with it. We started discussing his sister, with whom I have a very close relationship with and have for many years. I honestly feel as is FSIL would be a much better fit for MOH than BF would for a multitude of reasons. 

The issue lies in that, I know BF will be hurt and upset if/when I don't choose her. I have a feeling she will be upset enough to not speak to me for some time, however I'd still want her as my sole bridesmaid. 

I found out from my dad last night, that at the surprise engagement party that FDH, FSIL and in a very small part, BF had planned for us back in home state. That she was blatantly saying in front of my father that she ""couldn't wait to be the first one to hug me"" and it really upset my dad. Her whole behavior regarding that seems very selfish even though I know she was thrilled for me and excited to see me. She also invited a guy she had broken off a friendship with because of her ex, someone that I hadn't spoken to in years and was never really friends with. 

She also left at the end of the party without saying goodbye, showed up at the after party over an hour late with our ""friend"" and also invited her current love interest and an old coworker of hers to the bar. I've already  spoken with her about this and told her I wasn't thrilled with her choice of plus one, to which she apologized. 

So reddit, how do I gently break it to her that I don't want her as my maid of honor? And also try to salvage a friendship at the same time, even though it might not be worth saving? Do I send a cute gift box just asking her to be a bridesmaid or speak with her before I do that? 

Tl;Dr : I don't want my best friend as maid of honor based on recent actions. Need help figuring out how to break it to her.

96,"So for reasons unsaid, but probably clear, I'm going to give myself name myself Murfy. I'm a 20 year old male living in a run down apartments in Southeast Michigan. I live with my fiance, and my roommate.
Now I've been with my fiancé for 3 years we'll say semi-straight, 6 years of knowing her overall. I met her through my ex actually. Funny story for another thread. But my desire to be in a relationship has been a dying thing for a long time. For several reasons.  1. Being that I'm only 20 years old, and have been with this woman for 6 years essentially, since we we're teens. We carry a lot of the same desires, and goals, but, we also have a lot of things that we don't have in common. &amp; I understand that you're not going to have everything in common usually with your significant other, but these are pretty big things to me. She doesn't get along with any of my friends. And I also experiment with drugs and she absolutely hates it, gives me shit for all the time. Now typically I don't buy anything, because I got friends that'll just do the shit with me for free or little cost, atleast lately, because my financial standing is pretty fucking horrible rn. Again, for another thread. Like for the most part, she just isn't so much, like my dream girl. Ya know? Like I honestly love her, but I feel like I'm settling. She's beautiful, but she is somewhat overweight, And that sometimes limits her to doing the more physical things tnat I enjoy doing. And she actually works her butt of at the gym but can't really seem to lose the weight. So that's another thing. And honestly the fact that I can't like get stoned with her bothers the hell outta me. Like I want a woman that I'm not only attracted to but also does things with me. 
We do stuff, like go to the mall, and walk around downtown places, and go out to eat together and to the gym. but there's also not much else we can do without a vehicle and struggling with money. 
But okay here's another thing.
Like I said earlier, I'm 20 years old and I'm not really even too sure I want to be stuck in a relationship, but due to my circumstances, or really our circumstances as a whole, it makes it difficult for me to break up with her. Because if I do that. 1. I'd have to find a new place to live, because out of the almost year or so we've lived together. I've almost broken up with her a good 5+ times, because we get into these massive arguments a lot, or she gets an attitude over something petty, and then I get riled up because she starts acting crazy. And then it's just a big whole mess. But anyways, every time it's happened, we end up staying together after I have this concrete decision to call it quits. But then because we love together, we always end up in this kiss in make up situation, when ultimately, I feel like I just need my freedom. I'm caught up in such a dilemma and I'm looking really for anyone's input. Plz help",29Aug2018,1
97,"So I've been good friends with this dude (27 y/o) for over ten years. We recently moved in to the same house after living in different cities for the past few years. The Fortnite craze hit pretty shortly after we started living together and he plays it nearly non-stop and usually stays up super late. His relationship (of 2+ years) is on the fritz, he's very unhealthy/overweight, never walks his dogs, and his senior year college semester started two days ago and he's already missed his morning class both days. He just seems like he has no desire to take responsibility and do anything with his life. 

Now, I gave up trying to give him advice long ago because he's an extreme ""never my fault"" kind of person that will bullshit himself out of any situation. BUT, I feel like I might need to do something this time. Will he grow out of his Fortnite obsession? Or does it really have the capability to ruin all the other aspects of his life. I'm not a gamer and haven't experienced this with anyone close to me before so I really don't know.",29Aug2018,2

However, we've been internet friends for a minute now and and I recently came very active into her life as a good friend. She's getting over someone, and I've been a solid rock for her to lean on. We had drinks the other day and it led to some physical activity and the following day she stated that she's not available and ""not to expect it"" when we hang out again. I agreed and I am doing my best to stay in my lane. With this being said, I'm an attractive guy and I'm fairly used to the girls I'm interested in to be heavily interested in me. But in this case, I feel like I would be fucking up pursuing someone not available, when down the line it could be a very promising investment friendship and/or relationship wise.

100,"I've always had bad knees, probably around 20 subluxations on each one throughout my life. My junior year of high school, I fully dislocated my right knee when I fell backward over a trailer. It didn't bother me for most of high school, but now in my third year of college, for some reason, the image is just flying back into my head, over and over again, multiple times throughout the day. I instinctively reach forward and hold my knee, pulling it back towards where it should be, when it's already there. I feel a shadow of the tremendous ungodly pain, and then it's gone, and all that's left is a slight nauseous feeling, which has only resulted in actual vomiting twice.

&amp;#x200B;

The second time I threw up is the reason why I came here though. It happened after I woke up after reliving it in a nightmare, holding my knee, and screaming. My girlfriend and roommate both were on either side of me, and the police had been called by the downstairs neighbors, who thought something was actually going on. I was only aware of my screaming when I woke up, but apparently it had been going on for five minutes, during which time I threw up.

101,"Hi everyone, I need some help with some sleep anxiety I've been having. It started a few days ago when I was woken up early to a sound. It ended up being my ceiling fan (I think) making a vibration noise. I thought, well that's annoying, and tossed and turned until I fell back asleep.

Next night, the noise was worse! I live in an apartment, so my fiance and I thought the people who live below us, who live somewhere else during the summer, had returned, and it was taxing the AC unit on the roof. I discovered that the noise was less prominent at the foot of the bed, so that's where I put my head for the night (and every night there after). Even so, slept horrible due to the constant noise of this rhthmic vibration. I should mention that my fiance can hear it if he tries, but it doesn't bother him.

Next night (Saturday) took a sleeping poll, slept at the foot again, and had a decent night of sleep, but very groggy in the morning. Next night figured out for sure there is both noise coming from the fan and AC. It's like a hum, hum, hum, over and over. Driving me crazy! And why is less loud at the foot of the bed!?

Sunday night was again horrible, so tried a sleeping pill again. This was a HORRIBLE decision. It did not work! I felt drugged, but still couldn't sleep, and still heard the noise! So will not be taking those again.

I am so scared to sleep tonight. I'm soooo tired,  but I'm afraid it won't be enough. I've lived in this apartment for months so I don't know why this is happening all of a sudden! I have tried the following to no avail: ear plugs, pillow over my head, white noise, different fan speeds. Tomorrow some of that sound absoring foam is being delivered and I'm going to try installing it on the wall by my head, but I just don't know if that will work.

So after this long ass post, I guess I am asking does anyone have any advice? Has anyone experienced anything like this? With the fan and/or AC off, everything is fine! But that's not feasible in the summer. Does this sound like something I need to see a doctor for? (because now it has turned into a constant worry of not being able to sleep). Or should I call the AC repair guy? Is this vibrating sound normal? Or could the AC and ceiling fan be broken? Thanks all, I really appreciate any help or advice.  

TLDR: Can't sleep due to mechanical vibration noises, which has turned into major anxiety over not sleeping. Help!

107,"To give some context, this isn't my first time moving. I moved out for college a couple years ago, but it was still within the same state. Though, I think moving for college, I was inherently more excited and optimistic since it was my first time having that freedom away from my parents. 

Now - moving for work -  I don't have any close friends in Colorado, I'll be living on my own, and won't have the same accessibility to meeting new people as I once did in college. Leading up to moving (also the reason why I wanted to move), I've been looking at this as an opportunity to grow as an individual and am genuinely looking forward to that. However, during these last couple of days, the idea of leaving all my favorite people for what seems like just a job has hit me pretty hard. 

I've had friends comfort me by saying things like ""you'll make new friends in Colorado,"" or ""you'll be so caught up with new activities and evolving, that you'll be fine being on your own."" Although I'm certain both will happen, it still doesn't change the fact that I won't be able to spend time with the people here as I do now. Of course, there's phone calls and texts, but I've found that it's really easy for people to get busy with their own lives and caught up with what immediately surrounds them. I'm 100% confident that the friendships I have will remain the same no matter the time nor distance, but I feel like drifting apart is inevitable and a part of growing up.

Soulless and repetitive.  I enjoy my co-workers, but this is a far cry from what I want. I want to work in a history museum, if it's about aviation that would be perfect. But I don't know if I should go back to school for it. I don't know what else I would want to do though, learning and being around history is so inspiring and makes me happy. But I hear the hire rate for them is abysmal.

112," I recently got hired for a seasonal position doing something I really love and I'm also in the middle of a personal project that has to do with my career. The seasonal position is at night and my part time job is usually in the daytime. Only thing is I'm switching positions at my daytime job and long story short I asked my new PT position manager for the schedule so I can work with these different things I'm doing and make sure I have time for everything...My current part time company's management really sucks :\^) they apparently don't have schedules (or at least the manager says) and I should ask a different manager who won't be back from his trip for some time.. 

I'm putting all this out here to better help with this case: should I attempt to work with my part time (non existent) schedule and possibly have job/project I'm doing get screwed up? Or should I try to have myself off the part-time job schedule until the final days of my seasonal position and my project is over? 

The part time job is a company I've been aching to leave for a year now and if I had to, I'd sacrifice my good standings there than on my project or the seasonal position. But that job is still a job that pays. The seasonal position pays well but I could use the extra money. The seasonal position also holds the possibility of become a new job just working something different.

I don't know, I want to try and see if I can be taken off the schedule until the seasonal position ends in November but I can't tell if that's a good idea. I'd for sure spend the time I'm not working at the part time job hunting but yea..",29Aug2018,1
113,"I'm a 20-something dude in a decent professional career field, I'm living with my parents at the moment to save some money up to buy a place.

My family is fairly religious, though accepting. I've followed their specific religious sect strongly throughout my life, and it's been a great and supportive environment. However, one of the components is avoiding drinking. Which (sure, I'm a horrible person) I've done and enjoy with my friends. It is important to note I'm not a super heavy drinker, I do not have an alcohol problem (seriously). 

Despite the fact that I was raised to believe I was an introvert, I am actually extroverted. Turns out social anxiety is a thing, as is simply being sheltered. ""Wow, I can talk to people at bars like a real grown-up, all right!"" 

I know reddit in general isn't the kindest towards religion, but I've been hoping to get back into it again, even if it's a different sect. I've chosen, over the last few months, to stop drinking as it was somewhat of a roadblock having to hide it. 

So now that I've done that, I'm kind of...not sure what to do. ""Sober"" activities and groups don't really appeal to me as they tend to be more recovery-minded, and partying without drinking is real hard; people tend to give you a hard time about it. Also still socially anxious. Yet, throw a beer or two my way and let me chat with strangers and all the bad feelings go away. When I can't do that, weekend nights end up being by myself, at home, on reddit, lamenting over it. 

More alarming is the fact that looking over my history through college and such, it seems the trend is to do the ""be normal until I hate myself, then not do that until I hate my life"". 

I really don't like being stuck neither here nor there. It's not ideal, it's not fun, it will not lead to success in either realm.

It feels like I am forced to choose between happiness or being able to look my parents in the eye. 

Advice on how to pick? Must I pick? 

Or just any advice in general.

117,"For context, I'm one of the younger people in my graduating class, so I turned 18 mere days before my first day of college. During my first semester, I had a 23 and a 25 year old pursuing me romantically. As much as I cared about both of them as friends, I was uncomfortable with dating either of them partly because of the age gap; the way I saw it was that if they had met me even a month before the semester began, their advances would have been super inappropriate. There was also a decent gap between me and them in terms of life experience, which I wasn't sure how to handle at the time. Age wasn't the only reason I didn't date them; for their own separate reasons, neither felt like a good match for me.

Now, almost two years later, I'll be a 20 yr old junior in September, and have found myself interested in a guy who might be 26. I have no idea if anything will come from my infatuation seeing as I only met him a few days ago, but this recently developed crush has gotten me thinking about my boundaries when it comes to romantic relationships. Just two years ago, I would not have been comfortable dating him at 24, but now I don't think I'd mind the 6 year gap much. Me still being in college and under 21 means that there'd be a distinct difference in life experience between the two of us, but now I feel more willing to look past that if I felt he would make for a good partner.

My worry is that this change is too sudden, and that my attraction to him has made me put up blinders, but I'm not sure. I could just be maturing and becoming more open minded as I branch out in the dating world.

So I guess my question is: am I a hypocrite for changing my mind like this and being suddenly so willing to date someone out of college? Should I pursue him if I find that we're compatible, or am I still at a point in my life where age really matters in terms of dating?",29Aug2018,1

Sound great but here is where the problem is. I have always wanted to do a certain thing in my life, but I have had unfortunate setbacks in my life and kinda ruined my game plan. My parents haven’t really been to supportive with my plans of my life and would always encourage me to do something else. Something that fit the way they think. It got to the point where I was considering exactly what I wanted to do, but it always made me miserable. I’ve had the mentality that you should do what you love or else it becomes work. So thinking outside of where I wanted my life to go made me feel not so bueno. So in order to do what I would enjoy I would have to work really hard and finish high school in a year, because the job requires a high school diploma, with a chance of not being able to make it(not an artist or youtuber lol).

120,"I'm going to try my best to explain the situation and keep this short and sweet. Structure and staying on point is a struggle for me, and it's late and I'm emotional. I've been losing so much sleep over this. 

I'll try to paint a picture with some background. I'm 32 years old and I'm 8 months sober. I moved back in with my mom to try and finally get my life on track. My parents are divorced but live right beside each other. I have a 2 year old daughter living with me, but my dad has temp custody. 

I have an 8 year old step brother. I love him more than he'll ever know. His mother was an addict and had him in jail.  She gave my dad custody and has seen my brother a total of 4 times. I've tried to put all the pieces together on why he has been acting out and making no effort to change. He has been getting in trouble at school, he has no friends, and he's insanely jealous of my daughter. I have tried talking about all these issues for awhile with him,  but i will admit, I've often lost faith and patience because nothing has seemed to work. I've been hateful to him and mean lately and it kills me when I lay down at night. I explain to him it's out of frustration because I know where this path is leading him and I don't want him to go through what will happen if this continues. Tonight, I talked to him again. 

He tells me he is always sad and hates himself. He says that most of the time when he is told to do something, that he does the opposite on purpose. I asked why. He states that when he tries to do the right thing, that somehow it gets so twisted that it ends up being wrong anyway. Now, I'm going to do my best to not bash my dad too much,  but this is something I know all to well myself. I have to blame my dad's many head injuries for his behavior and actions, because if I don't, it fills me with so much hate that I can't stand myself. At this point in time I think it's impossible for my dad to feel empathy, compassion, or love. My brother is terrified of my dad because he is such a wild card of emotions. You never know what will set him off. This is the longest I've made it staying at my mom's because I'm completely focused on my goal of getting my kids and getting tfo. He's a scary person. He has beat me as an adult, bit me with bub in his arms as a baby, and did the mental hygenie warrants for spite. (Ive told my brother that sometimes you cant change the way youre treated, but you can change how you handle it) But it's not just my dad's fault. I'm guilty of being negative to him and never praising him for anything he does. My mother coddles him. She says he has a miserable life and that I just need to be nice to him, but it's just not that easy. I'm not perfect and sometimes I lose it. He is allowed to play with any of my daughter's toys, but she is not to touch one single thing of his. If she comes out to play with the neighborhood kids, he instantly states that he just wanted to play with them and not her. It instantly gets me going and is very difficult for me to keep my composure. I don't want an eight year old hating life and more importantly hating himself. I've self analyzed myself for many years and I'm constantly trying new ways to benefit myself and my family. I'm trying and I want him to try too and know it's okay to not get it right, that I get it wrong all the time but I'm not giving up. 

Reddit has changed my life in more ways than I could count. So I'm hoping you all can guide me on this as well. I have the start of an idea to build his self esteem but I'm just at the beginning phases. 

My brother wants to make YouTube videos. We have discussed this so many times. He doesn't do sports, he's a little overweight, he just doesn't feel like he's good at anything. My dad forced him into basketball last year and it didn't go down well at all. I need to come up with a direction for the videos. My dream would be to mask intentions of building his self esteem with fun content. My brother loves puppets and has maybe 3 of them. Maybe we could make a stage for the puppets and that be our first video together. Recording us building and painting it may help him feel accomplished. 

I thank you all for even taking time to read my mess of thoughts. Below is a link to a video of my brother and his dreams of being a YouTuber 3 years ago. He's a funny kid, and I love him so much. I want to make a huge effort to improve his life and I will. 

Much love,

123,"Hi everyone. I am currently a hair dresser in training. I have my license and could go elsewhere where I don’t have to shadow a stylist for a year to two years. I’m at a point now where I’ve been at this salon for two years and I am now 9 months into my apprenticeship.

I hate this job so much. I panicked and chose this career thinking I’d like it. I can’t stand making no money at this point. I went to school for almost 2 years, now I’m halfway into an apprenticeship and I want out. I keep telling myself to be patient and to wait it out until I get my own chair with my own clients but I can’t see myself happy even then. 

I’ve been thinking about normal 9-5 jobs. I want a “normal” life. My hours suck, pay sucks, and I work weekends. I am engaged and too broke to move out and start my life with my fiancé. We are in no rush to get married....but I can’t help but feel embarrassed that I make minimum wage and can’t afford to pitch in to support us. 

I guess I am just curious to hear if anybody else has done “drastic” career changes to help their mental health and how it benefited them. Thanks for reading.",29Aug2018,1
124,"I've known this girl for two years now, we just recently started talking due to us getting a job together a few months ago though (neither of us are working anymore).

We got close pretty fast, I think it's actually a bit weird. I got her number a month ago and she quickly became the one person that I can rely on.

We've been outside together three times, the first 2 times has been with friends. We didn't really talk much during the first 'outing', in the second one my friend pointed out that she was with me 90% of the time, and the third time she insisted that we go alone.

That third time was probably the best day of my life, I've never had someone I could depend on or be as open with. I was pretty down due to me lacking confidence, my anxiety giving me thoughts that I'd be boring her, and my self-hate. She knows that I have these problems and was comforting me throughout the whole thing. We held hands throughout most of the day, exchanged a couple of hugs, and on the way back she had her head on my shoulders.

The weird thing about this is how fast it happened, we have barely anything in common, and for the past 2 weeks we've talked on the phone from around 8 to 2 in the morning or however long she can stay awake with the past few days being throughout the whole day (minus when we have to eat/take showers).

We've exchanged completely platonic 'I love you's' and both tell each other how much we appreciate one another. 

I've never had a friend this close but I've had feelings for her for as long as I can remember, I'm scared about asking her out not because of the rejection but because of it possibly hurting our friendship.

I'd also like to point out that she's amazing in looks AND personality, while I get compliments about my personality.

Should I ask her out? Her last breakup was around three months ago.

also, I'm only 16, I've never had a girlfriend before, and while I have had crushes I've never genuinely thought about asking a girl out until now.",29Aug2018,2

My mom rescued a duck she claims was being abused/attacked by other ducks. We found out it was about 2 weeks old and we figure the mom duck is dead or absent in some way. We tried calling different organizations so they can properly take care of the duck, unfortunately none of them would take the duck in (not even animal control). I'm out in Florida. So far we've been feeding and caring for it but i personally don't like to keep an animal that is suppose to be in the wild confined (although it's young) so what's the deal here?

127,"We both got hired at this place at the same time so we started talking to each other a lot at work so I started to like her. We both quit the job about a week ago since we are both going away for college starting this fall but I kept talking to her via snapchat. We are both moving out on sep 1st, so I thought what there would be no harm in asking her out even if we end up going on one date only. So right before I ask her out, she asks for my instagram and I follow her back without checking her photos (BIG MISTAKE). So I start asking her out and I wanted to make sure this is a date and nothing else. She says yes and I set a place and time, and while doing that I looked at her instagram and realized she has a boyfriend. Now me trying to act as cool as possible ask if she thinks her boyfriend is cool with us going out and she says that he is cool and she was like that he is cool and if she misled  me into thinking this was a date. Again I try to be cool and was like yeah I knew It wasn’t I just didn’t want this to be wired and anything. So we are still going out and I have no clue how to act. I really liked her as friend and wouldn’t mind having her as a friend since her college isn’t too far from mine and she genuinely is a great person. But I have no clue how to act since this is my first time being friendzoned like this. Keep in mind that we talked A LOT at work and not once did she mention her boyfriend which I find odd.

132,"Note: I'm going to be vague so I don't get doxxed.

I'm an Account Manager in responsibility at a software company. I deal with customer inquiries via email, and call them if necessary. Often they need troubleshooting help, because our app is complicated.

Originally I was in one team, then moved to another. From day one in my new team, I'm getting my emails reviewed for accuracy/language/etc.

A woman and her friend on my team didn't like me from day one. I don't know why, it just happened. Apparently she has a reputation for being toxic in the company. 

Two to four weeks after I joined the team, two part time students in Computer Science joined my team. She was nice to them because they are laid back and took her aggression OK at first.

My emails are constantly being nitpicked. Asking for help to learn the software was stressful, so I made a lot of mistakes. On top of this, I guess I sometimes miss questions in a customer's email, or ask to clarify when I don't have to, or misread a question and think the issue is A but not B. 

I was gone last week on vacation, and on coming back, the new guys no longer have to have their emails reviewed, while mine still are. This is very stressful and depressing as I can see the guy who's reviewing my work is annoyed and snips at me. He says how don't I get some of the things.

Another manager read everything a few times and told me my answers are friendly and polite. She just said that woman is mean. They're now moving her to another team. I feel a lot of the tone feedback is semantics, but things can always be better, I guess. 

What's killing me inside is misreading or misunderstanding what the customers say sometimes. I know it's minor, but sometimes the whole email has to be rewritten. I'm very discouraged as I understand the software, but the only thing that's holding me back is misunderstanding or misreading a customer's question.

Today morning, all my emails were fine - everyone was happy with what I wrote. In the afternoon is when I constantly got negative feedback on my troubleshooting or interpreting what the customer wrote. When I explain my thought process, they go ""Oh, when someone says x they usually mean y in an email"" or they understand what I meant to say.

If I call a customer, the customer never has an issue with what I'm trying to say, and I can answer all their questions in ~10-15mins. 

I'm getting anxiety attacks at work over everything, and I'm finding it hard to sleep at night.

133,"So I'm starting my 11th grade school year tomorrow. A few years ago, I severely dislocated my jaw on an injury while playing sports. Ever since then, my jaw has been growing in a deformed manner and now my face looks like shit. And because of that, people have started to treat me worse. Other guys act superior when talking to me and now I'm often ignored by girls too. About the time of my injury, we consulted an oral surgeon but they recommend that I wait until my jaw bones are finished growing before corrective surgery which they project will take another 2-3 years.

And now I'm starting school tomorrow. I just can't take it anymore. Being treated as inferior, ignored, invisible to girls now. I even lost a lot of my friends I use to have. Nowadays I'm so angry at everyone for the way they treat me because of   the accident I had. Every night I cry because I'm so sad that I was denied a happy life. I don't have motivation for anything anymore and am constantly either super mad or extremely sad. I don't know who to blame, or even if there's anyone to blame. I just wanted to experience high school the same way everyone else does. Instead, I'm forced to suffer as everyone sees superior to me and my deformed jaw.

138,"My brother cheated on his girlfriend with a prostitute, who left her underwear in their home. She found it. Then my brother asked my mom to tell his girlfriend that she put it there because they don't like each other and she wanted them to argue. My mom, thinking it belonged to some kind of a next girlfriend, agreed.

2 weeks go by, my mom not only finds out that it was a prostitute but she also finds out that the strange men that have been coming to the family business have been their pimps. The pimps that my brother had a very heated arguement with, the day he cheated.

Mom refuses to lie anymore, sends text message to both him and her explaining the situation vaguely. He comes to see mom, explains his life is starting to look bright, please don't ruin it, she is the love of my life, i want to marry her, i want her to have my babies, please dont tell her, i am not going to tell her but if you do i am no longer coming to any family meetings. Mom agrees not to tell her anything more than this. Brother leaves.

From this part on, we are only guessing what happened and everything is reconstructed from the messages he sent and what his friends told us, etc.

He partly told her what really happened, she left. He didn't sleep. started drinking, went through 3 bottles of liquor in a night, cocaine, wrote goodbye letters, last will, slit his wrists. Collapsed. Regained consciousness, called a friend, had him passcode his phone, burn the letters, then the friend called help.

Family gets notified, but also gets the message ""everything should be all right"". My mom heads to clean up his apartment, I drove her there, rooms full of vomit, feces and dried, lumpy blood.  After finishing we head to the hospital, mom sees my brother, brother says: ""I didn't do it, because of her. Girls come and go. I did this because I asked for your help and you didn't help me"" with tears in his eyes. My mom heads out of the hospital and breaks down in the park.

To add to this, my brother always had suicidal tendencies, he slit his wrists 2 times already (all after long time girlfriends left him) and tried to jump off a building once. We only just discovered that he might have been using cocaine for a long time.

It's 6 am here, I haven't slept, have been researching how to handle addicts, cocaine, suicide and how to talk about it, etc. I have so many questions and need advice on so many things, but mostly

- do you think he really did it because my mom didn't help him?
- or is he just manipulating her (just as with the wont come to family meetings)? I am thinking this, because he left everything to the girl in his last will, and also wrote/carved ""you were the soul in everything"" over their picture.
- what help does he need and how? I read addicts need to hit rock bottom, but you wouldn't let someone with suicidal thoughts hit rock bottom, would you?
- will he be able to decieve a psychiatrist to let him out?
- should we get him home to my mom's place if he doesn't want to stay in the hospital?
- would it be good for him to be locked up in the hospital for a while if the psychiatrist decides so?
- I have never heard my mom cry like this in my 27 years. I have been telling her it's not her fault, not to blame herself but I am feeling useless. How could I help her?
- I so want to yell at my brother for making everyone go through this, because he wanted to fuck a prostitute while high on cocaine. But I also love him and don't want him to feel attacked and want to protect him from himself.

140,"I have been really scared these days about being tracked online/in general. I get pretty stressed about people watching me through my cameras or microphones. People (both friends and strangers in passing) say thing which indicate that they are talking about me. Sometimes when I’m stressed or very tired my thoughts get loud and it makes me afraid that other people can hear them, and they even act like they are reacting to my thoughts when this happens. I know this might sound crazy but it’s not like that in real life because I have my shit together mostly. None of this is bad enough that its seriously impacting my life or anything, but I am just a little concerned that maybe this isn’t good. I am inclined to believe that there is something going on like a conspiracy. But I know the more likely answer is that I am being crazy. However I can sometimes be a hypochondriac so this is probably nothing. But I don’t know and I thought the best thing to do was ask someone. 

I couldn’t ask anyone in person because they could be in on “it”. And although this message will be probably read by a bunch of regular honest people, I know that YOU are also reading this. yes YOU. To the normal good people: I don’t know who this person is or why they are monitoring me, but they are. And If I ask someone, of course they would say I’m crazy to cover up their intentions.

Now back to where I was before. Something is going on, but I don’t know what. Its either the world against me or its in my head. But there is much evidence pointing to the former. I feel so stupid saying all of this.

141,"Okay so here’s the situation.

I am a first year college student living on campus. My roommate was “matched” with me on the residency website and unbeknownst to me I clearly recognize that he has autism on the first day. 

Now, I have had classmates in the past who had autism and it doesn’t bother me. I have respect for others no matter what kind of situation they are in, however this is vastly different. I’m living with him. 

I literally hate being in my dorm when he’s around. He asks me really uncomfortable questions about religion and he’s persistent. He also will ask many questions about my plans for the day, where I’m going, where I’ve been, who I was with, etc. It’s exhausting. 

Also, he’s obnoxiously loud and doesn’t understand any sort of personal space. For instance, he has a tick where he coughs very loudly every few minutes or so. This is keeping me up for hours at night since it literally startles me awake. He’s very loud He leaves his shit all around our common area, (I share a suite with another bedroom occupied by two other guys) and I constantly have to tell him to pick up his stuff. 

He takes forever in the bathroom to the point where I have to stay up very late to shower or wake up very early. He does this because whenever he feels any sort of anxiety he goes in there and coughs and sniffs his nose for minutes upon minutes and it is quite frequent. 

Another thing: his parents show up all the time to check on him. They live 15 minutes away from campus so this can happen at any time. 

What do I do? I spoke to my RA and he said I would have to do an open room swap. This doesn’t solve anything because: 

1: Whoever moves in to take my place is going to have the same troubles. 

2: My suitemates still have to deal with his antics and their eventual replacements will have to as well. 

3: Everyone loses. My suitemates and I have to pack our shit and move into separate dorms (we get along quite well), our replacements are going to hate the living situation as well, and he has to go through another transition of routine which is very difficult to handle for those with autism. 

The worst part of it all is that I feel like we are getting treated like we hate this kid because he has autism so we look like the bad guys. 

We all pay thousands of dollars to live on campus, and I don’t even get to consent to this? Am I wrong or is this legitimate?

Also, inb4 you reply with “just talk to him in a very straightforward manner and explain your frustrations. Tried that multiple times, and it only makes him more nervous around us and he ticks out a lot more.

My family has been using this vet since before I was born and now that I’m an adult, I bring my pets there too. 

I’m not getting into the complete background but at the time of cut contact, I hadn’t been calling her as much as I was focusing on a career making project (worked out but I chose a different career after graduating college a little while after this happened) this person called me 4 times in the middle of the night when I was sleeping &amp; falsely accused me of driving her to attempt suicide because I didn’t pick up in a Facebook message 12 hours after the call. I have a full confession telling me otherwise from her years later begging me to be friends again. She has a history of lying, using, and disgusting acts I won’t get into. 

I would rather avoid her at all costs but my vet is the best small animal vet for both my bunny and birds, they hired her as a vet tech/receptionist &amp; I live in a remote resort area so my family has been using this vet since before I was born, all of our friends use them and I’ve been getting calls about her working there asking how I feel about it because they know what she did.

She knew that’s my vet, she has been trying to get in touch with me for a while and I rejected her. I don’t want her anywhere near me or my animals for any reason and I believe she is stalking me as there are a lot of vets in our area who focus on cats and dogs which she used to show interest in, and this is the only one who also treats birds and other small animals. 

Could this be seen as IIED? How do I tell my vet after growing up with my family pets in their office to keep an employee away from mine? Her mental instability is so shaky I wouldn’t put it past her to hurt my pets as a sick payback and I would be willing to get a restraining order.

147,"I’ve been lonely and alone pretty much all my life. Never really had anyone I could call a best friend or anything of the sorts; I’ve pretty much only had close friends. I guess it’s pretty hard for me to find people who I enjoy being with and have a lot in common (also I’m an introvert). I knew I would probably never find love because of the nature of who I am but I always wanted at least one person I could call a best friend.

About two years ago, I met the most amazing person I had ever met and built some great memories together. He was the only person I could really ever be myself with. The problem was, I started catching feelings for him, and these feelings only got stronger and stronger. He became the most important person in my life along with my mother. 

I thought I’d he fine, though. We had so many exciting things planned out; we were gonna go on many adventures, we were gonna move in together, and I was gonna help him put his life back in order; we needed eachother. Our future sounded very exciting and I thought being his best friend would be enough. But then the pain was too much. He blew me off in favor of girls and I just had to sit back and cry in pain.

I tried putting distance between us so that we could drift away (I could never confess my feelings for him because I didn’t want to put him through that). As hard as that was, I gave it all my energy; I even fabricated problems out of nowhere to make him not like me. Problem was that I was his best friend and one of the most important people in his life. He couldn’t let me go.

Essentially, I was backed into a corner; I could not bare the pain anymore; I had to tell him how I felt so that he could understand that we needed to part ways. It was the ultimate sacrifice for both of our sakes. Thing is, this is a critical point in his life where he needed me the most; he needed my help and now I can’t be there for him. I can’t be there for him because in order for me to help him, I need to be happy, not a slump in pain. I even tried sacrificing my own well being so that I could be there for him and I just couldn’t do it; the pain made me useless and not being able to help him caused me even more pain.

Anyways, when I told him how I felt, he rejected me. It was the expected outcome and I don’t blame him. But, he wants to remain my best friend but I just don’t think I can deal with the pain anymore. Just looking at him and knowing that I can’t hold him destroys me on the inside. We need to go our separate ways so that I can heal.

I also don’t think I’ll ever find someone quite like him ever again (you’re probably thinking, that’s how love works, but no, not in my case, this was the first time I’ve met someone like this and it took VERY long). I feel like I will never find love and like I will never have another friend like him. Again, I’m not exaggerating, I’m a person with very peculiar tastes, high standards, and probably not a huge price myself. I have good reason to believe what I believe.

I don’t blame him for any of my pain, it’s not his fault that he’s straight and that he doesn’t feel the same way. He’s not at fault that my love/social life is a failure. With that being said, I still want to talk to him and ask him for advice. I want tell him how I’m feeling and ask what he would do, because he was also my best friend and the only person I had that I could talk to; but I don’t want to put him through any more problems or make him feel guilty. I feel like I have to bottle in all these emotions; I have no one to talk to and no one to help me feel better.

Letting go of him is probably the smart thing to do. But I don’t know if I can do it; I want to be happy but I don’t think I can be with or without him in my life. I want my best friend more than anything in the world right now, but I feel like I need to try to get over him before bringing him back into my life; I don’t know if I can get over him while he’s in my life...

I really don’t know what to do... Right now, I feel so hopeless and lost; I keep crying and I can’t get out of bed. It wasn’t so much the rejection that’s causing me to hurt so much, but the hopelessness I feel right now. He was pretty much everything I had and now I have no one to talk to and no one I can be myself and have fun with. I feel, empty, alone, and in despair; I feel like my life has no meaning, like I am destined to be alone. I want to find someone to love, but I’ve been looking for many years without even getting close. I have nothing to look forward to in the future now that our plans are out the window. I don’t feel like I have anyone I can cry to for help and honestly, I’m afraid. This is the loneliest I have ever felt and I don’t think I’ve ever felt this much pain in my life.

What should I do? :(",29Aug2018,1
148,"I (22F) was sexually abused as a child by my cousin (28ishF). This happened when I was about 8 years old. She did stuff to me and made me do stuff to her.  This happened when my sister (28F) asked my cousin to watch me while she goes somewhere for a while. My cousin also introduced her brother (at the time he was about 8 as well). She instructed him to do things to me. Eventually he continued even when she wasn’t around. This continued for about 1 year before they moved. 

Life was easier without them around. I kinda forgot about the abuse until a few year later when I realized the extent of what I’ve gone through. Since then I’ve battled depression, anxiety, ptsd, and a suicide attempt. 

Just recently my girl cousin moved back to our area. Growing up and and my sister we’re best friends. They’ve started hanging out more and I’ve been put in more situations where I have to be around her (funeral, family events). I’m worried because my sister has kids and she’s unknowingly allowing them to be around a child abuser. I haven’t told anyone in my family about this because when I was younger I tried to tell some of my other cousins my age and they said “Don’t say that. Why are you lying? You’re going to be in trouble”.  I know that’s not the truth but the little voice in the back of my head won’t stop saying that when I want to tell someone. I’ve gone to therapy and that didn’t help. My boyfriend is a good support system but I feel the need to tell my sister so I can protect my niece and nephew. 

I also feel horrible because this is her best friend. AND the first time the abuse happened it occurred when my sister left me alone with my cousins. I don’t blame her but I don’t want her to blame herself. There was no way she could have known. I’m afraid I’ll hurt her by telling her this. 

TL;DR my sisters best friend (our cousin) is my childhood abuser. Looking for advice on how to tell my sister or if I even should. ",29Aug2018,2
149,"Hey guys, I’m a junior in high school (17) and over the past few years I’ve gotten incredibly close to one of the greatest people I’ve ever met. She is one of the most important people in the world to me; she’s probably my best friend. She is the type of person who I want to know for life past high school. Within the first few months, I developed a pretty strong crush on her, but I figured that would go away, so I didn’t think much of them. The feelings, however, did not go away. Instead, she did. I was working up the nerve to ask her out when she announced that she got into a study abroad program in a country she had been dreaming of living in for years. So I figured, best to not mention those feelings before she left. I didn’t want to stress her out. While she was gone, I had a lot of time to think about her and our friendship relationship. We called on the phone every couple weeks for an hour or two, and those feelings did not go away, if anything, they were reinforced every time I learned more about her.  When she returned that summer, we picked up right where we left off, and our friendship got a bit more intimate as we revealed deeper truths of our lives to one another. During one of those times, we kinda talked about our relationship in a contrived way. We agreed that strong friendship was much more sustainable than any sort of long distance relationship that would—realistically—end. After such a relationship ended, the friend would be lost and the intimite connection along with it. Better to live with some suppressed emotions for a bit (two years) and have a lifelong friend than risk it all and lose someone you love, right?  A major factor in making this decision is the fact that she wants to go to college in the country she studied abroad in (she’s already gotten many scholarships to go) and I want to stay closer to home. All I know is that I want a future that has her in it as much as possible (not to a creepy level of course but I do enjoy her company and I believe she has made me a better man and I believe she’d say the same about me. Should I risk the established relationship for the potential for something deeper? I know teenage love is often short lived (hence my silence for two years) but this doesn’t quite feel like some passing attraction. What should I do?  ",29Aug2018,2

I got very very tensed up after I realized I have no future plans. I spent my entire childhood playing online games and watching cartoons and stupid TV shows. And then I spent my teenage years online browsing the internet. I've spent thousands of hours simply browsing Reddit and 4chan (I've got a strong collection of memes tho).I am not much of an interesting person irl. All these scrolling through memes and jokes didn't get me any skills. I am just a useless person. So my parents are saying that I should study hard and become a doctor.

I had two incidents happen involving others in the community. Both were really upsetting. I turned to a long time friend, someone I thought I could trust... both to vent and to ask for advice on the situations.
This was a long time, trusted friend and yes, I DID ask them to keep it between us... so of course they didn't. Shit I said in anger, believing it to be in confidence, got back to the people in question.

I'll find myself lusting over men. It's very confusing...

I've also noticed that I seem to be more romantically attracted to men. (I want to marry and make love, kiss, ect)
But sexually attracted to woman.

I can't see myself getting married to a woman.
I don't really see myself having sex with a man I have found men sexually attractive before, but I just feel wierd about actually doing it with them.

I'm...extremely confused. I always have been...maybe I'm poly? I don't know. It feels like I might not be satistfied unless I date both a man and woman at the same time.

To top it all off...I've never dated before. Or 'done' anything with another person. Which makes it harder to tell. I have anxiety issues...I'm too afraid to date. I'm slowing getting better these days though. I've even started casually flirting. I've had major crushes on both men and woman. I've thought of asking out both before.

However we stayed in the villlage where there are like 10 houses in the entire town and the nearest shopping center or mall is 2 hour drive. And so i miscalculated the amount of underwear to bring in my luggage and only brought 6. we stayed there for 8 days and i thought we would be able to do laundry but our machine broke. so whatever clothes we had we could only use once and couldnt wash it anymore. and i only realized that i was out of underwear after coming out of a shower 30 min before we all had to go to a family party at some restaruarant. i told my mom i had no underwear what so ever and we were in a rush to go to the party too. i was going to wear jeans and well i did not want to go commando in jeans so MY MOM AND SISTER CAME UP WITH THE GREATEST IDEA EVER... LISTEN TO THIS.... they said ""just put on one of your sisters underwear on"" (because me and my sister are both kinda the same size and fit into similar sizes). and well i was against it but they said its either put on my sisters pair of underwear or go commando in JEANS i said fine ill wear the underwear. come to find out my sister ONLY CARRIED G-STRING/THONG UNDERWEAR. I guess she never heard of granny panties or something to cover ur butt area.

It was an easy choice for me but i was effected emotionally. There is no regret at all, ever since then I am afraid of repeating the whole situation and going through it again. I have convinced myself I am pregnant or might be over nothing and being a day late on my period. I have taken too many tests.

164,"I was with a boy for 8 moths and I fell in love with him. He was my best friend. Everything was going great until he ditched me to secretly hang out with two girls that I didn’t know while I was at work, and claimed they were just friends. This happened at the beginning of August. The whole situation was really sketchy and I know he was lying about some aspects. After that I couldn’t trust a word he said and he became really shady and distant. Some girls I know told me he had been trying to hang out with other girls and had personally encountered him flirting with them. We had broken up for a little less than a week because of those things. He texted me saying that he loved me and wanted to be with me and I decided to give him a second chance, but I regretted it pretty quickly. He told me “to get it off his chest” that he had almost taken a girl on a date and had been talking to other girls over Snapchat and instagram. The day before yesterday we had gotten into an argument about those exact things, but we were still together and on speaking terms. Last night I was with a couple friends and we decided to go to a freshman football game that I had no idea he was at. We were sitting down in front to where people behind us had a straight view of us, and my friend looked up behind where we were sitting and we realized he was up in the stands sitting with a group of people. I didn’t really know what to do because I knew that he had seen me and hadn’t made an effort to say hi. I went against my better judgement and we went up to say hello. The only thing he said was “Hey, what’s up?” and gave me a fist bump. He wouldn’t really talk to me, he even pulled out his phone and started texting someone on Snapchat. I said goodbye, he didn’t respond, and my friends and I left the game. I texted him that we should break up because he treats me like a stranger now, and it’s obvious he doesn’t want to be with me. He didn’t really argue or try to save the situation he just let it happen and now I have no idea what to do with myself. He blocked me on Instagram and Snapchat and probably blocked my phone number, I just don’t know cause I haven’t tried to text or call him sense. I love him so much but I’m the only one who cares and I don’t know why I always push people away to where they don’t stick around. The thing about it is it’s probably for the best but this is the most depressed I’ve been in 2 years. I don’t know what changed, I have no idea what I did wrong to make him want to be with other girls, and my head always goes to the thought that Im just a shitty person and he lost feelings.

165,"There’s a group of people I met online that I frequently talk to on Discord, and as much as I enjoy talking to them, I want to abandon the server.

I have various reasons for doing so, one being that I think idling there is holding me back from experiencing what life has to offer. I keep stopping myself because I struggle with social anxiety and the internet is the only place where I find comfort, but I know I can’t live like this forever. This is only a small reason, though.

The major problem is that my brother talks to a lot of these people and others related to them, and it makes me uncomfortable since I don’t like when my IRL and online life get mixed up. I also get paranoid that he spreads rumors about me, or they to him. Teenagers gossip. I go online to speak my mind without worrying about being judged, and in this situation, anything I say could easily be told to a family member. That’s terrifying.

But I can’t exactly tell him to ditch them, and I wouldn’t do it even if I could.

My brother is flawed in many ways that no one online can see. It irritates me that they don’t see him for the jerk he really is. And sometimes, as people who frequently talk do, I want to vent about my problems with him. About life in general. But I can’t, because they know him, and either someone would start attacking him or he would slander me for revenge.

Everything feels so complicated.

And if I choose to walk away, I don’t think anyone would understand because I can’t tell them my reasons, specifically about my brother. Which means I’d probably choose to disappear without telling anyone.

It started in 2007 when my parents split up. Long story short my father was abusive and threatened our lives, so that was the end of it. But, in 2005 my mother sank over $100k into a house that she had Rights to, but just gave it up to my father after the divorce. Along with most of her possessions.

I don't know why she makes these horrible decisions, but in summer if 2008 she bought a small house for $400k. Of course the economy crashed and now it's worth under $200k.

Over the past 10 years she has never even once taken care of the property outside. She sweeps, cleans the bathroom once a week. That's it.

Now, she is in denial that my brother is autistic, and won't even think about getting him treatment. He's 19 and acts like he's 10, all naive. Never used drugs or done any teenager stuff.

She has a boyfriend who is a good person, but is a mess. Has Parkinsons, and is set to be completely disabled in 10 years.

Because she never had taken care of the property, we now have infestation of multiple ant species, and clover mites.

She is in a fantasy world with our animals. She believes that they really are intelligent and love her, and she spends $100's of $ to pay veterinarian bills because they are sick.

She refuses to get an exterminator in our house because it's too expensive and she's got ""too much to do""

We've talked about him introducing me to people he knows in hopes of finding me some companionship and he was very open to it. He's a good person so I'm sure his friends would be good people as well. However, his job is very demanding and we haven't been able to make it happen.

I am considering asking him to cut out the middle man (i.e. himself) and connecting us directly, like through Facebook or text messages. Like, he'd let the friend know who I am and that I'm interested in hanging out or something. Or he'd give me the friend's number and I'd reach out. Would this be a strange thing to do or is it a viable option? This is definitely a better option than just sending a Facebook friend request to someone who has no idea who I am, right?

168,"TL;DR: Promised a new position/promotion at a company, after getting told to wait for a month more than I supposed to they informed me I can't get the position anymore. I found a new job, put in my two weeks, and now I'm going to work for another company doing the same job I was promised at the other job. Did I make the right decision though?

&amp;#x200B;

I moved to a new state for a job transfer and was recently offered a different position with more pay and better hours last month. Then I was told I had to wait due to coverage issues (we've had a lot of people quit recently). I wouldn't have minded too much, but apparently someone was coming in from another store to replace me and I could have left when I was supposed to. I missed the training classes due to this set back and was informed I had to wait a whole month until I could start the new position.

&amp;#x200B;

I am very, very annoyed, but the end is almost in sight so I decided not to complain. Then the week before I was supposed to start my new position I was written up for an attendance issue from several months back (I was out sick for a few days and when I offered to a doctor's note they wouldn't accept it) this meant that I am no longer able to start the new position. I have to wait six months for the write up to drop off and then I can reapply for the position that may or may not be there.

&amp;#x200B;

I went home that night and applied to literally every job that appealed to me. Several job offers and interviews later I accepted a job in another city 45 minutes away. It's literally the same job I would have gotten at the other company, with the same pay and benefits. The commute isn't terrible, but I will be attempting to move closer once my lease if up. I gave my current job my two weeks and now I'm packing up again to move and dedicate myself to a different job.

I am so burnt out from the other job and so tired I don't know if I made the right decision or if I am making any good choices at this point. I can't think clearly right now it's very hard to focus as this has all been very stressful. I honestly didn't expect things to change this quickly, and I have no idea if I've made the right choices.

 Tl;dr at bottom.

I’m not sure if I’m depressed still, I’m not crying all the time, or breaking into anxiety attacks, or sleeping all the time, but I do snap and get angry at my family members at times and I am exhausted a lot. 

I’m(26) really upset with myself and not necessarily disgusted but just almost giving up with the idea that I’ll ever lose weight. I’m 300 pounds now, I’ve always been 230-250 since 10th grade to about 2014. 

2014 I graduated college and moved back to help at home.

My aging parents had custody of my nephews and only my dad brought in an income so i thought ‘hey good idea I’ll save on rent and go help for a bit.’

Well it’s 4 years later and I’ve only gained weight, white hairs, and lots of stress.

I’m financially in debt because of school, a car I needed but honestly could’ve spent less on, some needless buying, and covering expenses on credit cards.

My parents allowed the kids mom(my oldest sister henceforth Lazy) to move into the our back house once she completed her rehabilitation classes and whatnot, but Lazy(36) never wanted to be a mom she doesn’t know how to spend time with her kids and they don’t respect her. They are 6 &amp; 8. They want her love and attention and act out in search of it... i know that because they are sweet and loveable and I do a lot of work with them to teach them coping strategies for when they get angry, have anxiety and just need to express themselves. But let them spend a few hours alone with Lazy, or go off for the weekend with Dad and just play video games and the kids take 3 steps back.
I wish I could hold the kids back from going to their dads because he is toxic... he(35) has no job, lives with his mom, and plays a lot of violent video games with them but my sister lets the kids go... why? Because now Lazy doesn’t have to watch them.

My parents(64&amp;66) raised us right they were strict and pushed education on us, me and my middle sister(31) are very mature level headed adults with a big work ethic. But Lazy and my older brother Idiot, are his that lazy idiots.

Idiot(39) has his own series of issues lots of drunk driving on his record and spent some time in jail. When he got out he got clean, got a good job, met a girl had some kids and I was starting to forgive him. But this past year he has just been fucking up. He got into credit card fraud, quit his job and now keeps bouncing around. His gfs mom kicked him out for finding drug paraphernalia and my parents let him move back in. He’s a good dad and watches his kids a lot but idk what he does at night (I can guess) and it’s not sleeping here so he’s always tired the next day and brings his kids round and if my mom is home he just falls asleep.

My dad has been falling in lately he has always had diabetes but was managed but recently he has been plagued with neuropathy and sciatica pain. He’s 66, and he still sorta works he no longer does carpentry but is the face and does estimates and some installs while outsourcing most of the labor. He does get his Social security now but not nearly enough to cover expenses, and of course nothing saved for retirement.

We owe the exact same of what the House is worth, but it’s not worth moving anywhere else as our mortage is way lower than any rent you could find here or other low cost of living area.

I make enough to cover my bills and whatever they cannot pay however I feel this portion is only growing and will continue to grow if my dad is out of work longer.

I’m tired, I want to let go of all this guilt of feeling like I need to stay and just do what’s best for myself and move out. However if I do, I leave the only good role model and calm person these two kids have, I am my fathers rock and emotional support, and financial support. My sister does contribute a portion, but as a single mother covering daycare as well I know she gives as much as she can. However she won’t withhold kids from the Dad in pursuit of child support since either way he has no income.

So I feel guilty of the “what if I leave...how will they pay for everything, how will the kids be treated....”

But I acknowledge I am enabling their behaviors by staying and they enable my negative traits of binge eating or eating unhealthy or buying things unnecessarily. My parents and I are as much to blame for my sister and her kids behavior, but I can’t force the kids to go to therapy if she as their legal guardian now won’t sign them up. I’ve asked my dad to kick her out so she could learn how easy she has it here with a babysitter, food cooked and my mom helping clean but my dad won’t because of the kids....

And ultimately I know they are  all inhibiting me from living the life I want and getting healthy.

I would like to figure out how to talk to them and set a plan that I stick to. Essentially moreso need help sticking to the plan,  because I have  set ultimatums “my sister needs to contribute her share....” she then did.....“ you all need to stop buying random crap” but I couldn’t enforce that one I never know when or what they buy ... and the last one I gave my dad was my sister needs to get the kids in therapy and she needs therapy to learn to be with them and we need to fix the back house (it’s really bad foundation wise) and just said “it needs to get better or im loving “ but I don’t know how I will enforce this as I fear I’ll be too scared and guilty to actually move out.

So I end up angry when the kids lash out and my head goes “ spank them like you spanked me” but I don’t want that I don’t want them to be scared of us , so I get sad  or angry or hurt and I end up binge eating... I used to bite my nails, pick my skin, harm  my self, have panic attacks, cry and cry but now I just get angry and binge eat.

I have tried therapy but have not found a good therapist after going through about 5, “just think happy thoughts” “I understand tell me more” I read a lot of books on coping strategies, try to draw/write, go on reddit but I end up not taking care of myself and giving into the quick indulgence ... food masturbation sleep.

I’m so upset at how I feel, how I look that I shut myself off from other people, I have a handful of close friends and they know the hardship I feel and can talk to them about the home life but I’m embarrassed about talking to them about how heavy I am, or how I’ve never been in a relationship. And how this effects not just my weight but my skin, health, and lack of purpose at work where I stay at a comfortable position instead of pushing to be promoted.

And I’m scared the anger is just going  to turn back into sadness and I’ll end up crying a lot again or worse....

Tl;dr I support my parents and nephews financially/emotionally and feel too guilty to leave. 

How can I be more strict with myself to hold them and myself accountable? What are asks that are realistic goals?",29Aug2018,1
174,"That's all really. I'm a 19 year old girl with OCD, depression and an eating disorder. I've also been semi-diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, and will be getting a full diagnosis later in the year. I have a boyfriend of about 8 months, and things have been utterly awful with him over the past few months.

When we first met, he didn't find me interesting at all. He didn't like my sense of humour, and he had no care for who I was as a person. The only time he seemed to care about me was when we were having sex (we were friends with benefits at the time). He'd always talk about how cool he found my best friend (who he had a crush on), and another girl who he knew. I just felt like absolutely nothing.

Eventually I told him I didn't want to do anything with him anymore and cut him off, but he came back to me asking for a second chance. I gave him one. Now that we're officially dating and have been for about 6-8 months, he's a lot better and genuinely treats me like I'm worth a damn but I feel like my self esteem is basically nonexistent because of before. 

I tried to hide how depressed and insecure I was for about 4 months, but in mid July I had a breakdown and finally admitted how awful I felt about myself because of how he treated me. We've just been arguing ever since, and I've relapsed in self harming and binge eating. He keeps blaming himself for my mental health, and it just makes it doubly worse when he does that, because I need to switch from dealing with my own issues to reassuring him.

I feel like I am nothing because he saw me as nothing. While he's admitted that he was shallow and inexperienced, I still feel like I'm inherently a defective person. He's literally interested in everyone he meets and I just happened to be the exception. I fucking hate myself, I'm a useless piece of shit with nothing to offer any guy other than sex.

He promises he'll be better from now on but the past hurts so much. I don't know what to do.",29Aug2018,2

I've had this in the past, and the problem kind of just went away for no apparent reason. I went to the doctor for it, a sleeping specialist, and a psychologist but none of them could come up with a solution.

180,"I'm just a few disasters away from attempting suicide again. Suicide bot, I'm not calling the helpline.


I almost succeeded before in 2016, were it not for my now Fiance making me vomit the two entire pill bottles I'd swallowed. Now, it's looking more likely that it may happen again, but this time I'll find a better way. This isn't a ""cry for help"". I am quite serious about it.


I feel like my life is finished. I'm going to be 32 next month. I have no ability to have or keep a job, no education, and a history full of trauma and abuse. I've amounted to nothing, just like my mother always said.


She's a large part of the reason I am the way I am. I grew up with a twin brother who was indoctrinated to hate me because of my severe lack of mental and emotional health. I've got Aspergers, Borderline Personality Disorder, Bipolar, severe generalized and social anxiety, and CPTSD. We were ripped from our extended family at 6.


We did not have a father. We had my mother's lesbian partner. My mother lied to us our entire lives about who our father was. I found out through my extended family as an adult. He died when I was 25; I never got to meet or contact him. Zero male influences were allowed around us, sans my brother's friends.


Our family was involved in the cult of the Church of Christ. It's a real cult organization. My mother hated religion and so, we weren't allowed to see our relatives more than maybe once every 4 to 10 years. This is not a hyperbolic statement.


I was constantly shipped in and out of mental health facilities. Psych wards, residential living units, hospitals and group homes. I didn't get to grow up with my family. When I *was* home, it was made known I didn't belong. I was an intruder, constantly being told she couldn't wait for 18 to come round.  I was locked and kicked out of the house often. I was told ""you came to the wrong house"" whenever I managed to convince my twin to let me in.


My mother has abandoned me, neglected me, forced me to walk for miles back home from a drop off point on a cold night, locked me in my room, my basement, has ""whipped"" me with a shoe, an underwire bra, belts with buckles, and a switch (long branches tied together). She has stripped my room leaving nothing but a mattress and pillow. I had to ask to use the bathroom. I was denied food. She forced me to have a child against my will later in life.


I was raped when I was 20. She didn't believe me because I was fat. I wanted an abortion. She withheld my SSI and stopped paying for my apartment. I was forced to move in, go through it all, be ridiculed every step of the way, and then my child was adopted by them 2 days after. I am not allowed contact. 3 weeks after that, I was shipped back to college, and was raped in my sleep by a drunk friend while I was still healing. He tore stitches. I am permanently damaged.


She has apologized for all of this once. She told me I should have been there with her and not in these places. She only said this because she was on put on some meds I'd been on and understood what they did to me. She has Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Undiagnosed, but her Doctor of an ex wife's friends know she does. Some are therapists.



There's more, but this post is already long.



As a child and adolescent, I was never taught how to function in the outside world. It was individual therapy, and group therapy. As a result, I know more about human feelings and interaction than how to survive the world. She made me drop out of school so many times.


I feel hollow. I have no identity and the things I love, I wonder if they're just parts of her presenting herself in me. I can't function. I can't work. I can't hold a job at all...I've tried so many times. I've been fired and let go, or have walked out and never come back, often on the first day. It's too much.


I mentioned college. I went because I had nowhere else to live. I bombed out. I was 18. I now carry crippling debt I use my SSI to pay. I would go back again, but there is no college near me that would accept me and I could afford.


I live with my Fiance. I'm lucky we've gotten to 2 years. We fight and argue constantly. It's mostly about money. I'm good at managing it, he's not. He works such a low income job that it makes me angry. I know he's capable of so much more, and to see him refuse to do better is infuriating. I don't know if it's apathy or laziness, but it's stressful.


We've both been married once. I was cheated on and divorced. No children. I don't want children, ever. My Fiance is still married, but separated. He has 2 kids we never get to see because the mom hates me and won't let them come over because of that. He pays his child support. She just denies him and ignores every text. He's given up there.


We have no car, no ability to save for one no matter how we cut our expenses. We've tried. Our town is so small and so splayed out, you need a car to get anywhere. There is nothing here but fast food and retirement homes. I wanted to try to work for one, until I discovered what they all do to the elderly. I won't take part in that. Everything and everyone in this town is corrupt. The cops, the justice system, the doctors, everyone.


When I say this town is small, picture a Hallmark card. It's small. Everyone knows everyone. Everyone is related.


The town has a huge drug problem as well. I've thought about it, but I'm too poor, and probably too stupid to use them correctly.


I'm obese. I know I eat like shit. I don't leave my house at all. As a woman, I know I have absolutely zero worth because I don't have a good, ""hot"" body. Everything on me is deformed from fat. I could never be the beauty I was as a teenager if I tried. And even then, everyone called me fat and ugly. I thought otherwise. But, I was a different person.


We're too poor to even afford food in the cabinets regularly, but make ""too much"" to qualify for SNAP. We qualify for zero government assistance. We currently don't even qualify for HUD.


The apartment we live in is on a hill but in town. It's a 10'x13' efficiency. It does not have a bathroom door, but a shower curtain and a shower stall. It's a very old house. We pay low enough for it, so I'm not surprised the landlord is a slumlord.


Thing is, he's a pillar of the community. He runs our local 911 call centre. We had an issue with bedbugs he was unwilling to deal with in early summer. They've since been eradicated due to the intense heat in the house.


No one is allowed to have air conditioners here. He is more concerned with wood rot. There's already black mold, bowed walls and ceilings, water damage, pipes bursting and not working, appliances breaking from the heat etc. This efficiency is the hottest room in the house.


It was all the way up to 98 degrees inside the room, with a window open and fans going at 11pm. It's currently 79.


My saying for the last few years has been, ""Without bad luck, I wouldn't have luck at all"".



With no car, no education (he has a HS diploma), no jobs that offer any good pay and the nearest city being well over 100 miles from here, what the hell can we honestly do? I just want it to change, get better, or I'm going to end it...This time for good.


I'm sure you may have read books growing up about characters trapped in small towns, living and dying in them because they had no way out. That's what this is. We are trapped. I am trapped. My life is over.

181,"Long time fan, first time poster, not too much hate please. 
I live in a small neighborhood where all the residents have a history one another, you know the old family generations of friends thing and such. So, back when I was a kid, I used to be friends with my neighbors (brother and sister) until they had to travel abroad. We’d hang out on weekdays after school and sometimes during the weekend.
They had to travel around 5 years ago. The brother is around 2 years older than me and his sister is maybe 2 years younger than me. Anyway, I was chilling with my friends like we always did, and my sister (6 years older than me) came up to me and asked me to invite our neighbor sometime since she’s back and staying in the country. I gave it some thought, and came to the conclusion that yeah my friends and I wouldn’t mind if she hung out with us and it’d be fun. So, my question is how do I approach her? I’m not shy or anything, I’ve got my life in track but we haven’t spoken since we were kids and I just thought it’d be weird if I come out of the blue and invite her over. Don’t want anyone getting the wrong idea or anything. 
Social media could work, but I’m not active on any sites. I’ve deleted my Facebook account around a year ago, and my instagram/Snapchat is empty (mainly use it to check up on a friend of mine who travelled).
Don’t know if this’ll help, but I didn’t know she was back in the country until my sister told me as I haven’t seen her around the neighborhood at all.

183,"It's been an entire year since I've spoken to my younger brother. 

In January 2017, my brother and his partner had gotten a new car (C300) and offered to let me use their older car (14 Audi A5) ""for a small fee"". 

I had been saving money from working, so I agreed to pay. There wasn't a given timeframe for usage of the car, but I assumed $1000 would be enough until I was able to afford my own car. 

Well, three weeks later, they wanted their car back. I was in complete shock, but returned the car to them. I was disappointed, but at fault for not discussing the details of my payment and usage of the car. 

I then asked a few days later to use the car for the weekend. They allowed me to, but wanted four brand new tires for the car in return. I returned the car how I received it and didn't buy any tires. 

I received a heated phone call asking why didn't I buy any tires. I said I didn't have any plans on buying any, because I felt like I was being used. $1000 for three weeks in the car was ridiculous to me. 

We stopped speaking for a few weeks. 

Fast forward to August 2017. They had gotten a brand new Porsche and offered me the opportunity to take over the car not for the Mercedes they had just gotten at the beginning of the year. 

By this time, I had saved up enough money for a down payment on my own car, but decided to take over their car note to save money (and because it was a brand new Mercedes that I know I didn't have the credit to afford). 

I flew to them to retrieve the car and paid them $900 upfront to cover the first month and insurance. 

I enjoyed the car for two weeks only to have it repossessed while I was shopping in the mall with my friends. To make matters worse, it was the day before my birthday. I had over $7000 worth of clothes in the vehicle that I wasn't able to retrieve, because he didn't make an effort to. 

I immediately called him and he was very non-chalant about the situation. He said the car was up for repossession and that he had already told me that (he didn't). I asked for a full refund of my money, and he offered me $300 based on some foolish math that he came up with. I declined it and spent the following days depressed and embarrassed. 

I haven't spoken to him since, but he has reached out a number of times and apologized. I don't trust him and I don't see how I can move forward in a relationship with someone who would do such a thing to me. 

Am I obligated to accept his apology and move forward? How can this situation  right when the thought of him makes me nauseous? ",29Aug2018,1

I am a 15 YO Male who is going through a particularly tough time in life. I am quite a shy person and don't talk to many people but I think that in ways I can be extremely confident but it is hard for me to express this currently. My friends I find are tough to relate to at times and are quite negative, who don't really care if you do something good and will often criticize you or just say ""nice"" and move on. We also only talk about games and school which is quite irritating. They are all not very outgoing people around people outside the friend group. I am sort of ""locked in place"" in this friend group, as we have group chats, sit at the same place at lunch. I am getting sick of this sometimes but would still like to remain friends. I often get depressed about this and would desperately like some change. The only people that I basically talk to at school are these friends and I find it difficult to talk to anyone else most of the time. I do have a few other acquaintances or friends outside of the group however.

I also go to a private school (male only) and find it difficult to be able to have opportunities to talk to girls (as I said, I'm quite shy) but I'm quite interested in it. My friends are not interested at all. What do you suggest I could do about all of this?

Even with my gpa being a great as it is it’s not enough. I would like to keep my hopes up but I can only handle a limited amount of disappointment. I want to be with him but i don’t if he wants to be with me. He will send me snapchats about how happy he is with his new roommate and new apartment and I’m here miserable. How can he be so happy without me? And how am I so miserable without him? I don’t have the best guidance at home and I don’t have any close friends so if any one could just shed a little light on my situation any advice is appreciated. Thank you for reading  ",29Aug2018,1
194,"In early May my husband was bit by something while working construction in Missouri. He didn’t realize it was a tick and that he had contracted Lyme disease until around Memorial Day when he was bed ridden with full blown flu like symptoms, migraines, muscle weakness etc. He was started on 30 days of antibiotics and seemed to get better. However since then he emits/sweats out a strong odor when he’s sleeping. In the morning his side of the bed and pillows reek something fierce. It’s so strong I can’t even curl up with him when he’s sleeping. I’ve tried to tell him about it but he can’t seem to smell it himself. Could this be a side effect of the Lyme Disease?

197,"TL;DR is in the title

So my dad went from your fairly average upper middle class American man that was a pastor part time on the side to the unrecognizable junkie he is today. He was married, had kids, a dog, white picket fence, the works. The last few years has apparently been a downward spiral. I haven't lived at home since 2012, and things were still pretty normal when I left. I knew he quit his job and had bounced between a few places, and I knew he had become addicted to pain killers because our lovely doctors like to over prescribe super addictive medication. 

What I didn't know was that when he lost his job, he lost his insurance and shortly after, doctors started prescribing therapy instead of the pills he became addicted to. He started buying pills from a dealer and when that got too expensive, he got hooked on heroin, and has dabbled with crack, coke, and meth among others. 

From what I understand, he's burglarized several family members, started selling, and has been doing stupid insane shit like showing up to my sister's work and demanding her tips. None of this is like who he used to be.

I moved out of the state 'permanently' in late 2015, and since then, while I've talked to my family frequently, I have largely been kept out of the loop. Most of the information above, I've learned since July of this year. I was told they were getting divorced, and according to dad, my step-mom cheated. According to her, she didn't feel loved and couldn't deal with him buying pills from dealers anymore. Dad has chronic pain. How much of that is legitimate from the botched knee and shoulder surgeries, and how much of it is his brain convincing him he's hurt to get him to feed himself more opioids, I don't know. 

Before July, I didn't know he was in such bad shape. He was talking about going back to the VA to get disability worked out, and for life insurance policies through the VA or some crap or another, he needed my SSN. I stupidly gave it to him because I believed he actually needed it to get the paperwork in order. Ever since I was a kid, He's talked about how he doesn't think he'll make it much past 60. I figured this was just more of his doomsday ""I'm going to die young"" that he's always believed. 

My one of my sisters and my brothers came to visit me over the weekend of the 4th and they told me some of the crap that he's been up to and I started to worry that he'd tried using my SSN to apply for credit cards. I've been watching my credit, and nothing has happened, though I had delinquent medical accounts (that I've since taken care of) so even if he tried applying for a card in my name, it would have been declined. 

This last week, I went back home for a sister's wedding. I was talking to mom about everything that has happened with dad, and she verified everything my siblings had said, added more, and said that he had warrants for his arrest in that state and basically said that he couldn't ever come back. She also said that he'd been selling food stamps for heroin and that was the reason he wanted all of my siblings and my SSN. If what she's saying is true, he claimed we lived with him to get a higher payout every month. 

I don't know where to start. He moved to a different state with a friend that tried to put him in rehab, but he refused to kick the habit and is now living in a halfway house. How can I check to see if he's actually used my SSN for government benefits that he doesn't need, and I certainly wasn't using? If he did indeed do it, what are steps I can take to prevent it from happening in the new state?

205,"So I've been in this circle of friends for a little over 2 years now. I'm sort of the newest person there.

There's about 7 of us all together and they're 18 years old and I'm 20 years old as we met during a multi age school trip. The past two years it's all gone well, we talk in group chats every day and go out every weekend.

However 2 weeks ago one of them randomly fell out with me. I have no idea what for as we were speaking the night before perfectly fine until about 3am in the morning and the next day he, as admin of the three group chats, kicks me from all three. That surprised me as I had no clue what I did even going back into my messages with him but nothing was said that was bad.

I try to find out what happened by messaging him and he just kept replying sarcastically so it was no use with him.

I tried asking the others what was wrong but they didn't want to get involved because they don't want to fall out with any of us and he's the sort of person that if you call him out on something like that he'll hate you forever.

I was fine with him hating me but now he's starting to tell people that I can't come to places because he doesn't like me anymore and they don't want to cause any problems so they just go ahead and go out but they still speak to me often so I don't think they hate me.

As of right now he's blocked me on everything but not after saying that they all hate me but don't have the courage to say it but they said that's all untrue.

I've been thinking of ways to sort this mess out but I can't think of a single way and it's stressing me out. If any of you have any tips or advice that would be great.. Thanks

Tldr: one friend hates me and won't let me come out with the rest of them anymore and the others don't want to cause any problems so don't force him to let me go",29Aug2018,1
206,"Hi guys. So my [21 F] boyfriend [26 M] and I have decided that we don’t mind the other occasionally going out on excursions with other people. We’ve already set up our rules for what the other person can/can’t do while on/after these instances. 

I already have someone in mind that I would want to get with just for a night. It’s a guy that i briefly met after high school. We went to different high schools in different areas &amp; were both in the same club, so I knew of him but had never really met or talked to him prior.  After I graduated high school, we went to an international convention in the early summer where I had an opportunity to do stuff with him. I was young &amp; extremely naive so I ultimately panicked &amp; refused, which really sucked because i found him extremely attractive. We happened to meet again during the summer at a separate event where we danced for a bit before parting ways. 

Now, don’t get me wrong, but I still find him really attractive &amp; regret not taking that first opportunity. It’s been 4 ish years since &amp; i kind of wanted to ask him out for drinks *hint hint* We both still follow each other on Instagram and I see that he’s viewed all of my stories, telling me that he *may* be somewhat interested (kind of a reach, I know, but that’s me trying to reassure myself lmao). I’m kind of an awkward person so I don’t exactly know how to go about casually messaging and asking him out for drinks without telling him that I’m in an open relationship (since that’s not entirely the case). I’m honestly not even sure how to greet him since I don’t exactly know him too well?? I’m pretty sure he’s seen some, if not all, of my Instagram pictures with my boyfriend, so I’m afraid he may think I’m trying to cheat on him. I don’t exactly know what to tell him &amp; I honestly would rather not tell him over a private message that my boyfriend &amp; I have this agreement (for privacy reasons ofc).

I’m extremely anxious &amp; get a little awkward when it comes to approaching people. It’s a bit of an odd advice post but I would really appreciate some help on what to do/say! I am also in no way guaranteeing that he’ll definitely say yes to drinks &amp; will be somewhat prepared for that outcome (although I would appreciate any additional advice on how to take rejection in this scenario).

TL;DR: in a *somewhat* open relationship &amp; want to mess around with a guy I briefly met in high school. dont know how to message him &amp; casually ask him to go out for drinks with me without seeming creepy or how to avoid telling him I’m in an *open* relationship ship over a message.",29Aug2018,2

Shes also said things like 'dont depend on me' 'you should talk to other girls i don't mind' but then hits me with 'i would be pissed off if we stopped speaking' 'id be pissed off if you kissed/ got with another girl' and the final thing which plays on my mind...

213,Hi there I am a 30 year old Australian who moved to London with my gf of 8 years in 2016. She dumped me almost upon arrival. This broke me completely and I somehow lingered in Europe and travelled and backpacked for most of 2016 having amazing experiences. I work as a mri radiographer . I came back to London and met an incredible English girl. We dated for a year and a bit ; and became very serious over 2017. We kept travelling and I got sponsored to keep living in England and working. I went back to oz to get a new visa in late 2017 and came back in 2018. I turned 30 in Romania in feb and was dumped by her a month or two later. I’m now realising I absolutely despise my job as an mri radiographer and I’m extrenely lonely in London and I’ve never made a huge network of friends here.  Work a lot of weekends and my job is tedious and there is no challenge. I’m also deeply afraid of going home too. There is no chance to rekindle things with English girl ; she’s cut me out of her life and is moving on. What should I do given I’m 30 and I dislike my job am lonely in London ; can’t save a dime here and I’ve lost two big relationships that were potentially forever things .

Today I recieved a letter with two photos of her and I and a concealer I had forgotten at her place last time I visited. No text accompanied this letter which I found really curious.

I messaged her just now and thanked her for the letter, and now we’re just casually talking.

219,"So I'm f16 from one of the world's most broke country Pakistan. Saying this I meant, easily gaining wealth here is tough as fuck. Even the highest damn jobs here like chartered accountant etc provide a monthly wage of 5000$ or maximum would be 7000$. The exception is that when youre a landlord or owner of a company or CEO like Nestlé or coke then you'll earn like billions a month.

So this is going to be long and it's a personal issue ive been battling from years now. My dad still thinks I'm a child and I shouldn't think about these things but guess what HELL YEAH I DO!. Me even after being the first child before my younger brother , doesn't have frankness with my dad. We barely talk and always talk seriously. Its rare that we ever joke.the problem is that he works at an international textile industry and is a brand manager there. I think he gets paid like 3000$ a month. This 3000$ gets divided into so much shit like the maid, tutors, SCHOOL FEE that there's literally NOTHING left for us and we always face financial constraints. This is the main reason we don't have our own house. We live at a rented house and have been changing 'rented houses' ever since I know. These are just small problems. The big problems are my studies. Im gonna be starting my A levels soon and the fee is FUCKING HIGH. Like 800$ for two damn months. We have literally had fights in our family and dad constantly bugs mom about how expensive my A level is. He says he'll make me do it anyway but I DONT want us to face more financial constraints than their already are!. My brother's school fee is also like 400$ for two months.

The most annoying piss off thing is that he has a bit of a broke family background and the people in it are greedy as fuck and he spends so much money on them financially supporting them even though he's not well off himself and it pisses me off!!. They can help themselves!!! Why my dad!?. In return they never even thank us but that's a completely different matter. Ive talked to mom a several times about dads job and why did he chose such a low paying field like textiles since the beginning and she just shrugs and tells me 'idk'. He definitely has progressed since a few years but these financial constraints are increasing. If I don't get the finance based scholarship I applied for we'll be even more broke and not able to buy our basic needs.

I myself searched for online jobs so that I can earn for myself and not depend on my family but the bullshit thing is that in this SHITTY HORRIBLE country all money making websites are scams and I've stressed over finding a way to make money for months! But I just gave up.

My parents haven’t really been to supportive with my plans of my life and would always encourage me to do something else. Something that fit the way they think. It got to the point where I was considering exactly what I wanted to do, but it always made me miserable. I’ve had the mentality that you should do what you love or else it becomes work. So thinking outside of where I wanted my life to go made me feel not so bueno. So in order to do what I would enjoy I would have to work really hard and finish high school in a year, because the job requires a high school diploma, with a chance of not being able to make it(not an artist or youtuber lol).

230,"It was my best friends wedding and his now wife had a friend who I was introduced to and we hit it off pretty well. Here’s the kicker in all of this, I live on the east coast of the US and she’s on the west.

The wedding was Saturday but was an extended weekend in the midwest. We didn’t talk too much the day of the wedding because I was the best man but some of us went hiking the day after. It was the couple that was married, the girl I met, three friends of the bride and myself. 

They didn’t set us up or anything but once they noticed we were talking at hitting it off, my friend and his wife talked to us separately to see if we were interested in each other.

We got to our destination of the hike and were sitting next to each other talking about different things and the stars (someone had an app where you point it at the sky and gives you a depiction of what you’re looking at). I thought about putting my arm around her there but thought it might have been too much since I just met here and she lives on the other side of the country and wasn’t sure where it could go from there. I didn’t want to go too fast but still wanted her to know that I was interested, which I’m sure she did because my friend said she was into me.   

The next day we went to breakfast and she went straight to the airport after that, I asked for her number and said we should stay in touch, which she happily agreed. My friend said whatever I was doing to keep doing it and his wife, who she’s friends with told me to take it slow, which I thought was funny since she’s on the other side of the country.

I had a flight later that day so I shot her a text before I got on mine and asked if she got home ok. She responded she did so I told her that I had a great time hanging out with her and we should do it again soon. She said she also had a lot of fun and that we definitely should.

So pretty much, I have no idea how to take it from here. I figured we could setup a time to skype at some point but how long would I wait for that? I know I just met this girl but if I wanted to make it work, what would I have to do to get this to a serious thing?",29Aug2018,5
231,"My mother has been divorced twice and is on the verge of her third. The first man, my father, was hardly home and wasn’t very emotionally attentive to either of us. He fought my mom for custody of me and lost but tried to make up for it by being the “fun parent”. Looking back, he was kind of manipulative during that time period. Eventually, he met another woman and had a child with her. He gave me money as a teenager but now he doesn’t speak to me unless I speak to him first and I haven’t spoken to him in a year. 

The second man was an immigrant who, at first, seemed like a genuine family man. He worked hard, he paid attention to us, we went out and had fun often but he was an alcoholic and he hit my mom and the family dog one night while I was out. 

The third man is hardworking but he neglected my mother emotionally and gave her money to basically go away. He even said it himself that his only job is to provide financially for the family. His job is physically strenuous and he never wanted to do anything on the weekends. His family also does not care for my mother. He kicked us out once before when he suspected my mom was cheating on him (she wasn’t). It has finally reached the breaking point. After about seven years of a dead end marriage, they finally confronted each other after having an argument about why my mom didn’t invite him to a party she is going to next week.

And I also accept that there will be many negative comments - I am asking you to be honest about all of it, I don´t want bulls\*it like ""It will be okay just let time do it´s thing"" ... Please.  


It all started when I was 18. I got into my new entrepeneur mindset - starting blogs, selling things, trying to make money everywhere. Also started to care about my looks by going to the gym, wearing nice clothes and was looking for a high profitable job. I got into network marketing which in short I didn´t like at all and after I quit, I got an offer by my friend on instagram to go into Modelling. Too good to be true I thought. Yeah...  


Of course, it was NUDE modelling. Yeah. I am a male by the way. 20 now. Corrupted and manipulated by the amounts of money I could make in this industry I got into it. I mean - I looked perfect in the pictures, I enjoyed it before the camera but I Wasn´t thinking about the consequences AT ALL. After few photoshoots I got praises from the firm ( very sucessful multimillion dollar company ) and they told me I could become a star in no time. I just got sooo manipulated, I Was so dumb to believe all their shi\*. Well, to become a star, they told me, I would need to do something else. Become a pornSTAR. Gay one even........ It was so unnatural and horryfing to me.   
You know what I did? I shooted a scene. 2 scenes, to be exact. It was horrible - both the sex and both my feelings after. I quitted right away and told them I never want to do this again.   


I got an offer from them that I could be a webcam model instead - and I accepted. There, I don´t even get naked anymore. I just talk to people, enrich their lives, be friends with them, make them love me and they send me money. I am pretty good at it. I thought I could propose them an offer - If I make enough from all this webcam modelling they would delete all the scenes.( Probably tomorrow..) And this is my plan. Though - there is a big BUT.   


I ""stream"" from their studio in my city. But I want to move in to another city in 1 month where I couldn´t do this webcam thing. I want to take a normal job - currently having an offer to be a Real Estate seller. A very good company. And study in college ( This is in Europe ). 

But if I move there - I won´t have the chance to somehow make them to delete all the scenes.   
If I don´t move there - I will have to spend another year minimum in this city. Getting all the Why´s that I have to stay. ( No one know this thing about me. NO ONE. )  
And it is all planned that I am moving in 3 weeks. Should I cancel and save myself? Should I just say fuck it, deal with it if people find out ( my biggest fear is that I would be fired from a job if people find out in the future, not being able to work certain jobs, maybe it would limit me in other aspects of my life?... I don´t know.... ) or do you think of any other way?... I know I made fu\*king dumb decision and now I Have to pay for it. It made me realize so many things about myself and about world overall. I just can´t imagine the future at ALL...

It will be on the internet forever. Wow.  


Thank you for any comments. I hope it is readable to all of you. ",29Aug2018,1
233,"I have a friend, let’s call her Shelly, who wants me to do everything with her. I’ve known her for less than a year but Shelly feels like we are best friends (I think). 7 times out of 10 I invite Shelly to hang out with me and my other friends. The other times I tend to not invite Shelly and I do my own thing with other people. Shelly gets made and passive aggressive whenever this happens. For instance, this past weekend I went to the movies and this is the text exchange between Shelly and I:


Shelly; come to brunch with me today!


Me: i cant,I’m at the movies!


Shelly: with who?


Shelly : 🙃


Me: I went with a couple of friends 


Shelly: thanks for the invite 


Me: seriously? You know I don’t have to invite you to everything that I do, right?


Shelly:  you’re right, we are pretty far from being best friends.


Shelly: what movie is it?


This text exchange frustrated me to no end. Shelly has done this multiple times and I’m at my wits end. 

I invite her to so many things yet she isn’t satisfied unless she’s intertwined with everything that I do. I confronted her about it and she didn’t understand why I would feel frustrated by this. I’d like to add that Shelly does not invite me to everything that she does but expects me not to do the same? How do I weaken/cut the ties of this friendship!? Am I being melodramatic in wanting to do so? What would you do?",29Aug2018,0
234,"In middle school, I was a loner because I just couldn't communicate. I had terrible anxiety where I would dizzy at the prospect of going to school the moment my alarm went off. It was so bad that if I heard the sound of that alarm anywhere else, my heart would start beating out of my ears and I couldn't breathe. I was also bullied a lot but I don't blame them I was basically a walking target sign. I would go to school and stare at the clock all day and count down hours until we could go home. *First period's over! Only 7 more hours!* I would do this everyday and even for the days of the week, counting down to the weekend. I told myself if I let this pass, I'd be in high school, and this would be over. 

Then fast-forward to high-school, I was very happy for the first year because I thought I had friends. Then my friends starting hanging out outside of school. Though I was invited, my parents did not allow me to go. My mother even made me then them that I didn't hang out with them by my personal choice rather than her command. Then my friends entered a new world, I was left behind in mine. I could not participate in their conversations and again I felt left out. Then I started my whole process of waiting the week to be over, waiting to get to college. I began cold-shouldering all my friends until we really no longer talked. This was also a time I was severely depressed and attempted suicide many times only to chicken out. 

Now in college ,with a lot of other things, my anxiety hasn't gone away. I still groan at the alarm waiting for the week to be over so I could be one more step towards vacation. I don't want to wait my life away because so far I know it doesn't get better. I have to get better. I still want to die but a part of me wishes for something better. I need help. I don't have any friends in college, but do I need any? And this communication issue only happens when I'm in college or surrounded by people my age. Not outside when I'm ordering from a store or talking to an uber driver (the only other communication I have).

236,"So, I’ve had a lot of problems with my younger brother.
You can see from my last post.

I’m trying to get him some help from my school’s guidance counsellors, but it’s a slow process. Don’t know why. 

‘Jason’ never does his homework or projects and just tells me he’ll do it later and he never does.
When I confront him, he says that the assignments are boring and pointless. 

He almost failed a few classes last year and I don’t want him to do the same this year.

He recently got his car taken away for always leaving the house and staying out past curfew without texting or calling for hours. 

He’s done this in the past. He’s perfectly capable of getting straight A's (He got all A’s in his freshman year), but he just doesn’t care. 

He’s smart. He can not study for a test and get a B or an A. Imagine what he could do if he actually tried to do his work. 

I’ll be leaving for college soon. 

I’d like him to take responsibility for once, so that he can get good grades, [college is optional], get a job and live on his own.",29Aug2018,1

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my Gf has been together for around 1 1/2 years with very little issues, until last week. So last week I(M,29) discovered 2 things about my Gf(26,F). 

1- She had sent another guy nudes in exchange for items in a videogame

2- She was having an online relationship with another guy. They met through that game. 

Now obviously when I found out, I had ended the relationship.Her mom had called her (she was at my house packing her things) and pretty much yelled at her for being stupid. After the phone call, my GF had, what I could only describe, as a complete mental breakdown. I had never ever seen her like that. 

And I felt bad. I felt empathy. 

So I took her back on 1 condition.

She will never ever talk to that guy again. EVER. I told her If she ever does, I will break up with her permanently. She agreed.

Today, I had just found out (she left her pc on, I did a bad thing and snooped) that she ignored me. She is still talking to this guy. And her messages, more or less, when like this

""Can't talk on here. Somebody might be reading this. Talk to me only on snapchat""

&amp;#x200B;

Snapchat, for a quick reference, deletes all messages and photos once you view them. There is no way to see your history.

&amp;#x200B;

So now, IDK what to do. She violated the only condition I had. She broke my trust 3 times now.

241," 

Hey guys - I could use your advice on my paycheck negotiations. I am with my company for 2 years now, and I wanted to ask for a 10-15% raise, which would have been likely to happen. However my colleague was fired recently and from now on I will do about 40% of her work additionally to my actual tasks. Before I was occupied for 90% of my time, now I am 110% busy all work day, but its doable.

I planned to ask my superior for is a basic 15% raise and an additional 23% for the new task that I will perform. This amounts to a 42% raise, which will most likely not be going through even though its sounds logic. I have a bad feeling asking for that big of a raise.

What are the weakpoints in my argumentation? Did you have similar situations? If yes, how did you negotiate?

Many thanks in advance.",29Aug2018,1

243,"Okay, you read the title. It sounds horrible, it *is* horrible. It’s also confusing as fuck and I have no idea what to do. REALLY long story. Idk if this is the right sub. Throw-away account

So backstory. I’ve known this guy since we were both like 12, we went to the same school. Let’s call him Derrick. Never really hung out, never really got along. We were chill though.

When we were 15, he texted me and asked if I wanted to be his “fuckbuddy”. I’m guessing it’s because we live really close to each other so he thought it’d be convenient. I said okay since, what the hell why not, and we had sex. It was really awkward and bad since we were both virgins and afterwards he left without really saying anything. I regret it to this day, and I’m sure he does too.

After that, I moved to another town and got a girlfriend, Derrick got a girlfriend as well and blocked me on every social media account he had. We saw each other maybe 5 times during 3 years, through mutual friends, and it was always really awkward.

Cut to six months ago. He and his gf broke up and he texted me, apologizing for having blocked me on everything. He kept texting me for weeks, complaining how he hadn’t been able to have sex for a while. I responded with stuff like “go out to parties”, “talk to people”, etc. After a while of this he texted me and asked if I wanted to try to be “fuckbuddies” again. **UH.** Kind of disgusted and weirded out, I answered that I was occupied. Maybe in a few months. 

So, we’re cool, he’s put moves on me (though I know he’s not that into me, nor am I into him), but nothing weird. He and his friends visit the city where I live to go clubbing and I meet up with them and flirt with his friend. Nothing more happens, I go home.

Again, cut. Two weeks ago. Derrick and a large group of his friends visited the city again and I suggest that the group that I’m with link up with his. When they arrive I’m drunk out of my goddamn mind to the point where I don’t really know where I am. Keep drinking. I have no idea how drunk anyone else is, but Derrick seems fine. They leave my group and I leave with them, before getting a text from a friend that she wants to smoke weed. I therefore leave Derrick’s group and go smoke weed, before returning to the apartment where they are (and getting lost on the way to it). 

So I’m high, drunk and disoriented. I have no real idea where I am, and know no one else but Derrick, who starts throwing up (from being too drunk, I assumed) and I take care of him for a while - giving him water and a blanket. He’s really out of it and falls asleep on the bathroom floor. His friends tell me Derrick hadn’t had that much to drink and he thought he’d been drugged.

Here’s where my memory disappears, and when it returns it’s early morning and I’m still drunk+high. I’m in one of the beds - fully dressed - with a guy I know *a little* (also dressed, separate blanket). It’s that half-awake, drunk, high, magical phaze when nothing feels real. 

The owner of the apartment comes in, and we hook up. He disappears. Ta-da, I’m naked. My memory is really jumbled but I remember the feeling of “*nothing is real, this is an illusion”.* Derrick enters the room, alive! He gets under my blanket between me and the other guy. 

I cuddle up to him. I’m *naked*, so he gets a boner, and we have penis-vagina intercourse. I’m really passive during it (not to the point where I said no, but I don’t really move at all) and when he orgasms I roll back to sleep. I think Derrick leaves the room, and when I wake up they’re all gone. It’s around 10AM and I’m *still fucking drunk,* so I leave and go to a friend’s job where they give me food and water. I text my sister that I’m still drunk. I go home, have some anxiety over it but *hey, shit happens, I was drunk/high and horny as hell and it was kind of fun.*

So, I’ve been back home living with my family for about two months now which means that I’m neighbors with this guy. He invites me to come over to smoke weed with him a few days later, I decline. He asks me if I can buy ecstacy for him, I say I’ll try.

Two days ago he blocked me on all social media out of nowhere. Our mutual friend told me a few days earlier that Derrick’s gotten a gf and I assumed he blocked me because of that (since he did the same thing when we lost our virginities). Until the same mutual friend asked me about the ecstacy.

I told him, since I don’t do E myself I’d be buying it as a favor to them, but now that Derrick’s blocked me Idk about the whole thing.

This is when the bomb drops. Our mutual friend tells me Derrick feels like shit because I had sex with him when he was drugged, that I used him like that. He feels so bad about it he had to block me on everything, and he’s told people that if I’m at any parties/hangouts he can’t come because he’ll feel to bad. ~~Then he asks again if I can buy e for them.~~

It felt like my whole world collapsed around me. I’ve been raped and it’s traumatized me to this day, the fact that someone feels like I’ve forced myself upon them is so so horrible. 

I immediately started rambling over text to this dude, apologizing and telling him to apologize to Derrick, saying how I won’t be going to any event where I know he’s going to be, etc. 

Our mutual friend says he’s not blaming me, nor is he mad at me, because Derrick probably just regrets it severely and needs something to blame, but I don’t buy it. If Derrick feels like I forced myself on him that’s his reality. And even if I had no idea, even if I feel like he started (and finished) it, that’s his reality.

So, sorry for the wall of text, but I really need advice. What should I do? Reach out to him? Call him? Go to his fucking house? Just leave him alone?

I’m freaking the fuck out, the shame is killing me. And a small, bad, selfish part of me is horrified that he’s telling this to people.

I didn’t perceive the sex as forced at all, and thought that he was more sober than me. Am I still a rapist? Should I encourage him to take this to the police? What the *fuck* should I do?

I’m sorry for how badly this is written but I needed to get it out. Thank you in advance for any words.",29Aug2018,1
244,"I’ll start with some details somewhat significant to the plot: I’m 26, I left home when I was 15 years old, have been on my own ever since. How did I do it? I was a thief, I sold drugs, I did odd jobs, I did actual jobs. Why did I leave home? I was raised in terrible neighborhoods, I had to fight nearly every day. I did not fit in. My family did not take the best care of me, I decided I’d be better off on my own. Here’s some things that happened in the past to give some context to the actual problem:

When I was 17, one of my older sisters and 2 of her kids (because she had to give one up because she had him at 15) moved from her city, to mine (she was adopted, I only saw her on weekends growing up until we were older). She moved to a pretty bad area, I moved in with her for a few months. In this time, we struggled, emotionally and financially. We were miserable, and every night we would drink a lot of wine and smoke a lot of pot and just... appreciate each other. Something happens where we have a falling out for some reason, and she kicks me out, which was fine. I had a job and a hustle, after that, we stayed in contact but I had only seen her once or twice in about 7 or 8 years. By this time she has another son....

MORE CONTEXT: A few months ago, I lived in Orlando FL, again, I struggled. I was considering dropping out of school, and was just making it to pay rent. I talk to my sister and she says she live in a small town that is much better than where she was before. There was a very decent college here and many resources for people in need. Long conversation short, it would have been convenient for me, because I was alone in Florida, and convenient for her because she was alone with 2 kids (yes, there should be three, but again, one of her kids had to move). One of her kids has non-verbal autism, he doesn’t require much attention, but he is difficult for some people to deal with. She says that in order to get a job, she needs someone around with him so that she can get another job and “not pay a babysitter her entire check”.  I love and missed my nephews, so I said yes, I will come and help, and transfer schools.

Now I am here, in her house, sleeping on her couch, struggling more than ever:

1. The deal was supposed to be that I help her until we both figure something out. Eventually I will be back in school, and move.
     a. Found a job in a couple weeks at a real estate office, ended up spending entire check on bills she didn’t pay, food she didn’t buy, and her personal weed habit. 
     b. Turns out, she lives in section 8 housing (which she did not mention) on the worst block in this town, where they sell drugs and boat music all night in my steps (I sleep on the couch right next to the door). Section 8 is based on income, so you have to report your income whenever you make more money, and your rent spikes by hundreds of dollars, making it nearly impossible to save the money and put a security deposit and first and last months rent anywhere. And the rent here is the same as it is for a nicer house with no dealers outside.  It is the only block where shootings happen in this town.
     c. Her 7 year old son whom I was not as well acquainted with, turned out to be extremely disrespectful, not very clean (no surprise because he’s young), very ungrateful, and wasteful. He tells me to shut up, the whole nine yards. My sister encourages me to “beat his ass”, but because I was abused so much as a child, I refuse to do that.  His father lives around the corner but only picks him up every other weekend. He only comes around to borrow money and food, and fuck my sister. She’s pretty loose and promiscuous if that hasn’t been made clear. Yes, she has sex right above my head while I’m trying to sleep. 
      d. Her autistic child eats enough to satisfy 3 people everyday. He is rapidly gaining weight. I try to cut him off and feed him more vegetables and fruit, but my sister undermines me every time. (Same when I try to discipline the 7 years old without hitting him). He is 15, and never leaves the house. 

There are SO many things she does to me that I could go on and on about, likemaking me walk to get her weed and blunts and not sharing, but taking mine when I get it, talking shit about me on the phone when I’m in earshot, calling me names, all that. She’s an absolute nightmare because of her internal issues. I could post her on r/iamverysmart many times over. The problem is, I want to leave, but I know she’ll have hard feelings and I may lose contact with my nephews again, and the next time I see them, they could be worse. If I leave, this lazy notch will quit her job and blame me because “no one can watch her special needs son”. 

Before you say “you gotta do what you gotta do”, remember there are children involved, one of them special needs. I have spent my entire life being a selfish person. I’ve robbed, hurt, and manipulated many people. Now I go to church everyday (mostly out of curiosity, and to help them run their audio equipment because no one there knows how, I am not a Christian and they all know that), and I’m doing my best to take care of these kids while I’m here because I never had any and I truly love them so fuckin much. Plus, I no longer work (long story, wasn’t fired), and will not start school for a few more months. How can I leave when my rent keeps going up? What will I do about my nephews? How can I get my negative sister out of my life or at arms length from me?

TL;DR
I made a mistake and moved, now I’m stuck in a small town with hostile family members. Out of money, no other resources, concerned for the children involved (who are not mine but may as well be). I need to move again, but without causing discord. How?

I don’t know if I got into my own head or what, but I didn’t want to do the deed if we were both that messed up.

They keep saying they need to know how much it is so they can charge my rent accordingly. They seem to think I'm being ridiculous for not telling them. My gut feeling is that I shouldn't tell them if they wouldn't tell me theirs. What do you think? Am I being ridiculous?",29Aug2018,82
255,"My friend currently owns and operates a small, nonprofit, specialized wildlife rescue based out of the midwest. She has struggled for the last 10 years to get her degree in business and enrolled in an online program a few years ago to continue to work towards her degree. She is finally at her last semester of school and is no longer eligible to receive financial aid because she reached her cap (too many credits or something?). Working for a small nonprofit full time means she has no income of her own and all available resources go the animals. Her family has refused to help her with tuition, which is $3500 for a 6 month period. She can set up a payment plan but the payments are still substantial for a person with no income and I can't afford them myself because I have my own student loan debt. However, I am so proud of her for working so hard to get her degree and she has come such a long way that it breaks my heart she has to consider dropping out...I want to be able to help. I have tried to reach out to some mutual friends to see if they would consider chipping in but of course as soon as you ask someone for money, you never hear from them again. And these are people that without my friend, would not have the opportunities and experiences that led them into their careers. What can I do to help her get the money? I have picked up a few extra shifts at my second job, I've looked into grants or scholarships but I am having trouble finding one that would she is appropriate for. Any advice as far as where I can look to hopefully fund her last semester, would be greatly appreciated.

256,"I'm a junior in college and I don't know what to major in. I was confident I was going to be premed before I realized the loans and time involved wasn't for me. I'm transferring from a community college to go to an elite university, but I'm terrified of leaving home. I've never lived without my parents and I'm so dependent on them. I'm terrified I'll fail the hard classes. I'm scared I'll major in something I hate, or useless, and not get a job and waste my saved up money (I'm low income) and not be able to help my parents. I'm scared I'll major in something like economics or computer science for the money solely, and then regret not following through with something I might want to explore further - like being a PA (I was hoping to shadow soon to really solidify my decision). I have so much anxiety and depression right now and am seriously considering taking the semester off, but I feel like I'll be missing opportunities that way too? I'm really at a standstill and don't know what to do. If I take the semester off, I delay things and won't be able to support my family sooner.

257,"Okay, so I have a problem which I dont really want to disclose unless someone wants the information, but the basics of it is, do i solve the problem easily and quickly, which would lead to me living a worse life (not by that much though) however me being 10000x more relaxed and happy and around people I knoe and love, but many smaller problems could occur (which i could disclose if someone necessarilly asks for it) which could lead to me basically becoming extremely sad and underacheived and depeessed and all of that orrrrr

I still have a lot of time on my side, so i could tough it out here for a couple more years, and the quality of my life would be better, but i wont be in the place i love, next to people who i love/ care about me and also I would be pretty damn sad like all the time, but then in the end, I move to the other place where my life would be worse but much happier and surrounded by people i want to be around. Also there would be a minimal amount of problems left.

Couple things to note,
1.) I do not care about my style of life, as in I would give up so much to live at that place.
2.) Currently, to me the first option is more attractive 
3.) If I do choose the second option, I feel like I would regret not moving sooner, leading to me thinking I missed out a lot and ultimately be less happy then if I moved out beforehand

I met her at a bus stop because I recognized her from when she worked at the McDonald’s down the street from my house. Every time I saw her, her face lit up with the absolute most beautiful smile, and my stupid face couldn’t stop grinning... anyone that knows me knows I don’t smile often. We stayed in contact and chatted online every now and then. She gave me the most obvious sign that she liked me, sent me a message saying she liked my face, just out of the blue, instead of commenting on my picture, but I was just getting into a relationship that ended up pretty serious. She ended up in a relationship, we still talked once in a while. About 2 years ago she quit all social media, and I figured it wasn’t going to last long. I was dead wrong, and I have a feeling she’s not coming back any time soon. As a millennial, I’ve never really had to deal with this before. I’ve long thought of doing the same thing but the thought of getting that friend request notification from her stops me. I don’t want to be weird and ask one of her friends to put me in contact with her. I already asked her best friend if she quit social media about a year after the fact, and felt weird as fuck doing that. I keep hoping I run into her someday but every time that thought crosses my mind, I push it out. I’m not asking for advice on how to find her, but how to deal with these feelings of regret.

266,"brief background: My wife has never been the most gifted person, but she makes up for it through sheer hard work. Hours and hours studying, weekends too. I don't envy her one bit. I've always been the one to cheer her up and keep her happy through all of it. Not only that, but but taking burdens off her. She's been so busy finishing up her last years of study, I've virtually assumed them all. I do 95% of the cooking, cleaning, pet maintenance, all of it. Thank god we don't have kids (yet), or I'd be dead.

On top of this, I work full-time. My job is largely remote, which is nice but also stresses me out as I have to focus on work while also having the home duties to juggle. Some weeks are easy, some I really get swamped with work. She'll be making a lot of money, and soon, but for now I'm the breadwinner and I pay the bills/handle the finances.

I've been managing this all. I'm pretty Type-A, so I don't actually mind it. But what's been a problem for me is I feel like I've lost that extra ability to be involved in her problems. I don't have patience or time to cheer her up the way I used to. When I try, I feel like I can't, which makes me feel more helpless. 

We've been together for close to a decade now, and she's constantly been worried about getting into the right programs, etc, every few years. Her stress levels have just continuously gone up, and because my responsibilities have too, I just feel like I can't help like I used to.

Beyond this problem, we are extremely happy together. She is my soul-mate and I am hers. And I don't think she resents me at all for this-- it's more a personal feeling of failure.

I also know things will get better once there's no more damn program to get into, no reason for her to stress like that, just a job she goes to everyday. Word to the wise: practicing medicine ain't worth it.

At first I thought I was being sensitive or that he was just that way to everyone...but he's not it seems he really just doesn't like me. I'm just at a loss and pretty hurt because I try to be nice and friendly with everyone at work. I just got this job and would really like to make a career out of it so I've been trying to work as hard as I can. 

Yesterday he called me a ""fucking retard"" (sorry) under his breath after I asked him a question trying to make small talk, then turned around and was joking with the other new people. Today was worse, he followed me around constantly and anytime I got a little overwhelmed by the work load(which is normal for everyone during a rush) he would just stand behind me asking me if I was able to do my job and if he should send someone over who would be ""more capable"". 

I just don't understand!! I have been trying so hard to do everything right and some of the other supervisors have been nice to me and have told me I'm doing a good job. It really got to me today and my work was affected, I just wanted to cry so bad. I've never been bullied by someone at work and I really don't know what to do because he's my boss.

The worst part is I'm competing for one of the ten permanent spots in September. I thought I really had a chance before but now I'm just hopeless. He is the one who would have to give me the recommendation.

269,"I started working at this company about 6 months ago, I was hired in as morning management (6am-4pm). I’m in school, so working nights is very difficult for me. During the interview I reminded the boss that I am not available to work nights. For the first couple months this was my schedule, until suddenly I was put as management closing shifts. Not just one, but closing the entire week. 

I let him know, again that I can’t work nights and he needed to find someone else to. Fast forward to now and I’m still working the nights. Even told him at least 10 more times to find a new closer. Whenever I need time off he doesn’t accommodate. He recently had a baby and I was forced into doing his job for a week, and then he decided to take a vacation and I once again was the person who took over his job; inventory, ordering, employee management etc.. I am a college student who is low level management and recognize that I was not hired in to be the stores manager. Nor am I the assistant manager (who should have been doing these things). I’m not trained in the ways I need to be for his job.

I can’t work on sundays because I babysit my little brother. He always “forgets” this and schedules me, trying to make me look like the asshole for needing my shift covered. Well on this Sunday I slipped off some steps and dislocated my kneecap, I was supposed to close that Monday and was scrambling to text him and find someone to cover my shift. He didn’t text me back, or call me back. I had to go above his head and call his boss in to cover my shift. I texted him asking for a couple days off so the swelling could go down and so I could walk again. He didn’t text me back or call me back and then proceeded to post the schedule in which I am closing the entire week. 

I am beyond frustrated. The job they promised me has turned into me only closing. I am going through hurdles trying to keep my personal life under control so he can have an easier schedule for himself. And this final blow of him not giving me the time off for a very serious injury is too much to let it slide by. How do I go about telling him that I will not be working nights, and I will not be working weekends when I’ve told him at least 100 times already? Clearly he doesn’t care what my time needs are but I don’t want to leave because I’ve only been here for 6 months and am afraid of trying to find a new job during the fall semester.

We were together for a short time only four months but during that time he brought me home to meet his family a lot, enough to develop relationships with them and am even in their fantasy football league. His sister follows me on social media and posted she just got a house and she always replied to my stuff and was nice to me so I wrote her a congratulations. My question is did she not know if we were broken up or not? Conversation below:

Me: Congratulations!!

Sister: Thank you!!!❤️❤️❤️

Me: Of course! Wish you the best of luck! I’m sure you guys picked a beautiful home ❤️

Sister: Ugh that means so much. Thank you. 💗😘

Me: No problem! ❤️ you’re so sweet you deserve it

272,"I have always been a really great student. Honors and AP courses, but just last year I went through severe depression due to losing a friend to suicide and a family member to old age. Near the end of the school year I lost my dog to cancer, resulting in me totally giving up. As well my roommates constantly bullied me and I would hear other students whispering about me behind doors. I lost sight of what was really important to me - to me that is my education. I still earned a series of As and Bs and one C in my math course, despite rarely studying. 

I have now received help from various doctors and I’m excited and ready to go back! I have learned that I can’t let these people control me and now I have my own room to continue to studying, which I love doing.

My one problem is that the school would not approve of me taking the Advanced and AP classes I want due to not receiving perfect grades. I don’t know how to convince them that I am passionate about this and I really want to switch into the AP level courses. 

I have tried emailing my academic Dean - I can’t figure out how to fix my Spanish class to Advanced Spanish or change ap calc AB to ap calc BC and my regular history class to ap history. I emailed my old Spanish teacher (who gave me a 89.49 and would not round up 0.01 to give me an A-) about why his recommendation for me to go into advanced Spanish didn’t go through and this is what he sent to me 

“Thank you for your note. While I did originally recommend you for 3A, your performance on the spring final exam makes me think that you would be better served further strengthening your Spanish foundation in Spanish III Regular this year. That being said, if after the beginning of the year you still think 3A is what you want, then I encourage you to have a conversation with your academic Dean and advisor as well as your current Spanish teacher.” 

I’m just bothered that he wouldn’t tell me that he changed my recommendation and the reality is I lost my dog who I’ve grown up with one week before the finals. I don’t know how to change this and I really don’t want to have to wait to get this change. 

I’m just super overwhelmed why no one is helping me and they all want me to stay back. I understand it is for my own good, but I know I am capable of harder level classes and I wish they could see that too. 

What should I do? How should I respond? How do I really prove to them before school starts that I am capable of these hard courses so I can get those changed? ",29Aug2018,1

I needed to move because of this plus the company I worked for closed doors suddenly and I got laid off from my job all around the same time.  It was not a good time for me and I was very stressed and I vented this to a male friend that I've been close friends with for over 20 years (I'm a female). He's someone I've always been able to talk to when I'm stressed and vice versa. My friend said, ""Why don't you move in with me?  You can stay here and you won't have to worry about paying any rent until you find another job.""  I was very appreciative because I didn't have the funds to just get a place of my own once my relationship ended, especially since I had just lost my job. Well, within the first few days of moving in, it became clear that my friend/new roommate wanted to be more than friends.  We have been friends since we were kids and the idea of ever being anything other than just friends was never brought up before so this was a surprise to me now.  I've also had a couple other male roommates in the past, it's never been an issue before so it really didn't occur to me that this would be an issue now.  Anyway, it started with just some hints and flirtations at first but then moved pretty quickly to him straight up asking me if I wanted to date him.  I let him know that I wasn't ready to get involved in another relationship yet.  He seemed ok with this answer for a few days but then the flirting continued, the hints became not-so-subtle and it eventually got to the point where he has asked me a few times since then if I'm ready for a relationship yet.  Kind of like a little kid on a road trip asking ""Are we there yet?"" over and over lol. The answer is still no every time and quite honestly, I'm so annoyed at this point that I'm not going to want a relationship with HIM once I am ready to be in a relationship.  I have a good job now so that's a step in the right direction but I haven't been there long so I don't have the money right now to just up and move out and get a place of my own yet.  I also don't want to have to keep saying no over and over again to being in a relationship with him but it continues to come up.  It's made this a very uncomfortable living situation for me.  I also feel guilty in a way because he really did help me a lot by letting me move in when I didn't know where else to go and barely had two nickels to rub together.  If anyone has any advice on how I can nip the boyfriend/girlfriend conversation in the bud once and for all, keep my friendship with my roommate intact (if that's even possible) and not feel like a complete piece of sh\*t doing it, I'd love to hear it.

My plan was to go apartment hunting while staying at a friend's place in town (he has an empty bedroom until next month) and then sign a lease (or sublet) somewhere else.

This bullshit is even worse! Sure I dont really worry about money anymore, but now I'm just dead tired once I'm off work 5 days out of the week and then take my weekends to sleep in and get rested. I can see why someone who wants to have a family one day would be willing to make the sacrifice of leisure time for the sake of a well paying job, but that motivation just isn't there for me because I don't want one. On top of that I look around at all of my other friends who have real jobs...

- one was a pretty socially awkward good guy I knew in university and ended up going to one of the biggest accounting firms worldwide. He now has a cocaine addiction

- another has a decent job in finance. He hates his life and his girlfriend cheats on him all the time but he doesnt care because she always ends up coming back to him

- one became a teacher only to now find out she honestly does not give a flying fuck about her students. Some of them she does. But by and large she has outright told me the majority of her class can go fuck itself. She used to want to be a mom. Now shes planning on getting her tubes tied next year 

I was also recently accepted to law school. I applied last year because I wanted a way out of my job. You know what though? I don't know if I honestly want to go anymore. Why? Literally the only one of my friends that i honestly think has the kind of life I want got a liberal arts degree and us working at a tailor shop which is basically retail. Sure he gets shit pay and hardly any benefits, but at the very least he had time and energy for things he enjoys. Meanwhile I'm over here working a big boy job and am too tired to even play and enjoy video games during the week. What's the point in going to law school if I'm just going to put myself in a shit load of debt for another exhausting job that's going to leave me too tired to even enjoy my time off?! What's the point to life if no matter what we do, or how hard we try, or how good our jobs are we're all just FUCKED?!",29Aug2018,0
288,"I'm faced with a potential career move soon and would like to put myself in a much better position in the future. I am deciding between one of the following... and I need to choose ASAP.

My current full-time job

pros:  health and other benefits, mission/cause I’m extremely passionate  about, sick leave/vacation, supportive supervisor, easy commute

cons:  toxic culture, not feeling valued by colleagues, lots of micromanaging  by senior staff, drama between teams, terrible/incompetent leadership,  understaffed, low retention rate, a physical office that’s falling  apart, low salary, little room for advancement, few professional  development opportunities, not truly diverse nor inclusive

OR

A contract position 

pros:  health and other benefits, mission-driven organization that I’ve worked  with in the past, huge salary increase (which can be used for future  job salary negotiations), supportive culture, supervisor/team that  trusts my ability

cons:  one year contract/the overwhelming stress of having to find another job  in less than a year, unpaid sick leave/vacation, longer commute, longer  hours, potential for team being understaffed, lots of red  tape/bureaucracy when dealing with other departments

289,"Need a bit of advice. Recently I was interviewed for a job promotion for a job I have been currently doing and the employer chose someone that had a few months more then me at the job. However, the person chosen is going on maternity leave and they are asking me to do their job to cover for them. However, there is no extra pay or promotion placed with it. I have been in this situation before and did work that never led to extra pay and my time was not compensated well. My question is, should I accept and hope that this brings light in? Or should I say no and just do my normal job?

The company has only been hiring part time help in multiple numbers rather then one full time.

290,"Long story short - Parents got involved in a lawsuit that they had to go into, as it involved money they needed to fix.  These fixes were for something that is apart of their income, so it was 100% needed.  All legal advice said it was a close shut case. Sadly, it got thrown out of court, and we have no money to appeal.  My parents pretty much lost everything to lawyer fees.

Someone who used to be a close friend, later falsely accused me of driving her to attempt suicide after not picking up the phone while I was asleep, her excuse was being left out of her boyfriends mom having some family over, she later in the day emailed me with retractions and said she wouldn’t have cut herself if I was awake to answer those calls, she never needed medical attention but she wanted some form of it as her boyfriends mother was busy with her family, I wish I was exaggerating but I have the emails saved. This sick manipulation had  been going on for years. I was done and hadn’t talked to her in years until she got work there. 

She is a proven user, liar, and fucked her cousin... People in her life who have personally attacked me because of her later messaged me with apologies.

We hooked up and the festival and spent a couple of nights in a tent and made out. I met up with her today after getting back yesterday from the festival and she lives in another part of England. I'm not sure if she's looking for a boyfriend because she seems that she just wants to travel etc. Even though she kept telling me how amazing i am/ wanting to hold hands and kissing. I know we both had a connection and now when she left she said she's scared that she'll hurt me because I seem quite ""precious"" after asking her she just said that i'm really fun and nice and that i'm an amazing person to hand with. This came after me saying ""I can't believe you don't have a boyfriend"" and her replying with ""boyfriends"" in a sort of laughing tone. She also then said that she's definitely going to come and see me next month followed by ""or maybe"". Before she got on the train we kissed and said good bye.

296,"I wasn't sure how to word the title better, I'm not actually IN the situation, but I'm being put in between the two people that are in the situation.




Okay so i live with my Aunt and Uncle, and their two adopted sons. I also work for them at their moderately successful company. We do a lot of international travel for work, my Uncle and I were in Hong Kong almost 2 months ago, he was talking about how my Aunt was mad at him, it's not uncommon for her to be mad, she likes to go on fiery war paths but I let him vent to be about it anyway. He never really told me why she was mad, but he mention that he met this lady in CA the week before, he was out there for work as well. The way he explained it to me, it sounded like it was nothing but professional between them, he was teaching a class and she was one of the people in the class. I told him that even if he didn't do anything questionable with this lady, it makes sense why my Aunt is mad, she is probably assuming something did happen.

It's Saturday evening in Hong Kong, we are packing up our hotel as we are flying out the next morning and my uncle gets a notification on his phone, my aunt cancelled his ticket home. So I get home, and at the time it's July 4th weekend, we go to the neighbors house to light some fireworks, about an hour in, she asks me to go on a walk with her so we can talk. We get to walking and she just straight up asks me, ""so what do you know?"" I tell her about the conversation that my Uncle and I had, and she just responds with, ""Yeah he is fucking her."" I was actually shocked, I've lived with them for almost 5 years now and it just doesn't seem like something my Uncle would do. She tells me that she is probably going to be leaving the company, and moving to Florida, Texas, London or Hong Kong to work for our competitor (they have offices in those 4 places) and she wants me to go with her, I told her that is a huge decision and I'd really need to think about it. I also told her that making a decision like when you are mad isn't a good idea. 


So my Uncle finally flies home a week later, he gets in late Friday night and doesn't come home, I still don't know where he went but I'd assume he stayed in a hotel for the weekend, my Aunt wouldn't let him come home, but she finally gives in and lets him stay at the house but he has to stay in the east wing of the house and has to be an absolute ghost. 

For a little bit, things seemed to get better, my uncle and aunt were sleeping in the same bed, and it seemed like they were working through the problem. At the beginning of August, their youngest son had to get surgery, he was born with some very serious digestive issues that required surgery. They had to drive to Ohio for it, the original plan was for my Uncle, Aunt and their son to go, the day before they left, it turned into just my aunt and their son. The next day, my Aunt and their son leave for Ohio, and my Uncle decided that it'd be a good idea to head up to the office and get some work done, everyone leaves, but about 5 minutes later, my aunt, uncle and their son come home. I walk out to the garage to see what is going on, and she said that she cancelled the surgery, I then look over at my uncle who is standing next to his car, he looks PISSED, I then look at this car, my Aunt took a hammer to his Porsche windshield, I joked with him and said rather your windshield and not your knee caps, he didn't find it very funny. I asked my Aunt what the fuck happened and she said that she got mad that he picked work over their kid's surgery. It didn't surprise me, he has always put work over his kids. He isn't a bad dad, he just doesn't know how to be a dad. 


Another week goes by, the windshield is getting repaired and from what I can tell, everything is fine, they are sleeping in the same bed, one day they tell me they are going to the grocery store, they are gone for like 8 hours, they get home and I walk down stairs and I ask where the groceries are at, he tells me that they didn't go grocery shopping and instead both bought new BMWs. I was so confused. I mean, maybe they thought that making big purchases like that would help them out. 


Since the car purchases, they still have been hot and cold, one day acting normal, hugging and kissing each other and the next day they want to kill one another. 

Fast forward to yesterday, my Uncle is in California, my Aunt is out in her car smoking and she texts me asking me to come out to her car, she says, ""You aren't in trouble I just need to talk, I've lost all will to live, the only thing that keeps me going are the boys. The emotional pain is turning into physical pain."" Then gave everyone the rest of the day off.

 I didn't really know what to say, I've never been put in a situation like that and I'm not a fan of being put in the middle of it.

**So I have a few questions.**


What the hell do i say to my Aunt after what she told me yesterday?

How do I get them to stop putting me in the middle and pick sides without them thinking I am mad at either one?

She wants me to move with her and the boys, there has been a running joke that I'm a single father of 2 as I am the one that takes care of them for the most part. So if I were to stay here, they'd be leaving, I know I need to do what's best for me, but it would still be so hard.


I think that about wraps it up, if I can think of anything else I'll edit it in, if anyone needs any clarification on something or has any followup questions please let me know

297,"Hi everyone, thanks for reading this and giving me some advice, English is not my first language so sorry for any spelling errors.
Lately I've been losing trust in my girlfriend and it's getting worse everyday, I'm a very jealous person and I know it but I feel that she is just pushing the boundaries of a normal relationship, it affects me a lot because I've been losing my tranquility and I'm always thinking that she will cheat on me Wich is not good for any relationship, I'm thinking about breaking up with her but I don't want to take that decision yet.

I want some advice that's not just ""if you don't trust her break up with her"" please, I love her and I don't want to end it now. I will give some background info of our relationships and 3 situations that made me get to this point of not trusting her.

Background info: My girlfriend is Bisexual, she ended the relationship with her ex ( they were together for 4 years) so she could be with girls and explore that side of her sexuality, We were dating for about 6 months but she then went on a trip with his ex to see if she still wanted to be with him, she didn't so we started dating again but I got mad because she didn't wanted anything serious with me so I gave her an ultimatum, I told her that she had to choose between me or being with girls, she choose girls first but then changed her mind and chose me (this is one of the things that bother me the most), we have never been boyfriend and girlfriend because she said she didn't wanted to harm his ex by having a boyfriend so fast, we have been together 1 year and we still aren't boyfriend and girlfriend for the same reason.

She has always been really unexpressive and she never gives me any gifts, she never really invites me to anything or do any effort to make me fall in love for her, but lately I feel she is comfortable with the relationship and she is even worse, on the other side Im really in love with her and I have always showed her that I love her, I give her a lot of gifts and invite her to do a lot of stuff, I am very special with her and she is not with me.

3 situations:

Situation 1. She has always talked about how perfect and especial her ex was, that she was really bad with him and she feels bad about it, a week ago she started crying in front of me because she felt really bad about her ex, because she felt that she was a bad person and etc...this got me really mad because I think you should never do this with your SO.

the next day she told me that coincidentally her ex wrote her and that she wanted to go out and talk to him to see that he was ok in life so that she could stop feeling bad about him, I was relatively fine with that, she told me they went to get coffee and talk a lot with him and that she felt better now. Yesterday she told me that his ex wrote her again and asked me if she could go out with him again Wich I immediately said no to and got mad, we didn't talked about that further so I didn't asked her any questions about it, when we got home she went to get a shower and she left her phone outside, I was so mad about her ex stuff that I took her phone to look at her messages (I know that this isn't good), I found that her ex was inviting her to smoke weed and look at the sundown, I got really really mad by the fact that she even considered doing this with his ex because clearly his ex doesn't want to be just friends by his behavior.
Do you think I'm overreacting about this ? I talked to her about this later ( I didn't told her that I looked at her phone) and she told me that she just didn't wanted to lose his friendship with his ex, she told me that I should do the same with my ex but I feel that talking with your ex all the time and going out with them when you are in a relationship with someone else is not right. clearly his ex wants something more than just friendship and I don't think she is that blind to don't see it too, and they already went out to talk some days ago and she is already asking me to go out with him again, I think she is pushing the boundaries here, what do you think ? What should I do if she asks me to go out With him again ?

Situation 2. When we where dating she told me that she went out with a woman and had sex with her couple of times ( she always tell me stuff like this, like it was nothing and it pisses me off, I think that you shouldn't talk about this kind of stuff with your boyfriend or some guy you are dating).

2 weeks ago she went out with a ""girl friend"" ( she didn't tell me any name ) to have some drinks, I was fine with that, they were out drinking in a bar till 2 am that she told me that she arrived to her home, drinking untill 2 am alone with someone for me is a red flag but I didn't pay much attention to that, Yesterday she told me that this ""girl friend"" was in fact the woman that she had sex with a couple of times and I got really really mad, she told me that they just talked and nothing happened, that they didn't have any feelings anymore for each other, just friendship. 
I asked her why she didn't told me her name when she told me she was going out with a ""girl friend"" and she told me that she thought she did but must have forgotten, this makes me really angry because I would never go out with a girl I had sex with when I have a girlfriend, and to drink in a bar untill 2 am it's even worse, she is always playing the innocent card but I think that nothing good will come out by going out and getting drunk with someone you had sex with and you're atracted to.

Is this normal and I am overreacting ? I feel that she will cheat on me anytime now by playing the innocent card and doing stuff like this, what to you think about this ?

Situation 3. A week ago She went out to have some drinks with a friend I have never heard of until that day, they went out to drink until 2 am, this is a red flag for me but I didn't pay much attention to it either ( it's a red flag for me because I would never go out alone with a woman, just the 2 of us, to get drunk until 2 am and just want to be friends with her, i do that when I want something more, but maybe that's just me ).

This Friday she will be going out alone with this same guy again, to get drunk and I feel this isn't right, I talked to her about it and she told me that I should worry about him, she doesn't like drinking that much so I asked her why she wanted to go drinking with him again ? Why not go have lunch or get a coffee ? Is drinking the only plan ? But she told me they were just friends and that's it, I personally feel that this guy wants to get laid with my girlfriend by inviting her so frequently to drink with him, if he wanted to just hang out with his girl friend (my gf) he would invite her to do something else not just drink. 

Maybe I'm overreacting about this, maybe it's my insecure mind and my mistrust of my girlfriend playing tricks with me, maybe not every guy thinks like me, that inviting a woman to drink in a bar it's not normal and that you only do it when yo want to get laid with them. I feel that going out drinking with a friend would be okay if they had been friends for a long time but this guy just showed up so I don't trust this situation. 

What do you think ? Am I overreacting ? Am I wrong for not trusting my girlfriend ?. I told her that I would go out drinking with a girl friend too that same day just to play with her mind but I feel that she is so innocent about everything and sees nothing wrong with that, Wich makes me even angrier because I feel she doesn't care about me and doesn't get jealous at all about anything (for me getting jealous is caring about someone), I feel that if I keep following this path of doing to her the same stuff she does to me, that the relationship will fall off, both of us will stop caring about anything ( I don't think she cares anyways) this kind of stuff will become normal and there will be no point in having a serious relationship anymore ( Wich thinking about it we don't have because it would harm her ex) 

TL;DR I'm really in love with my girlfriend but I don't trust her and this are some situations that got me to don't trust her, because she is always playing the innocent card but this situations will eventually lead to her slipping and cheating on me: 
1. Crying because she was a bad person with her ex and going out with him repeatedly 
2. Going out to drink untill 2 am with a girl that she is atracted to and had sex with. 
3. Going out to drink with some random guy repeatedly untill 2 am ( she doesn't like alcohol that much) .

What should I do ? Do you think that I'm overreacting about this situations and I should trust her more ? Do you think I'm doing wrong for not trusting her ? I feel that the solution is to slowly stop being so special and in love with her and eventually get on her same level, to just enjoy the sex with her and go out with other people and that's it, but I don't want this because that's just not me, when I'm in love I'm all out, I'm either really unexpressive or a love machine, I can't find a middle point. Please help",29Aug2018,1
298,"I've been struggling with this for a bit and could use some advice.

My ex boyfriend broke up with me awhile ago. I honestly don't care and I'm over it, he's a liar and cheater. Well shortly after we broke up he got a new girlfriend. And she was rude/a bitch to me, even though I didn't do anything to her. Anyways a couple weeks ago i found out he's cheating on his new girlfriend (he had a fake profile on a dating app, the account is made within the past month and it's under the name he used to cheat on me with). At first It felt good to know he wasn't cheating on me because I wasn't good enough, but that he's literally just a piece of shit. But then I got thinking, and well i kinda want to tell her. Because

1. I wish somebody told me, he was cheating on me. He was with many girls and some of those girls knew about me but didn't bother to tell me. And maybe if they had I wouldn't of stayed as long as I did.

2. I don't want him to be happy

3. He probably thinks he can get away with it, because she trust him more, and doesn't snoop. (Yes I snooped that's pretty much why we ended)

 I just know how it feels, he always would spin these lies to make it seem like it wasnt that bad that he was cheating. I just dont think anybody deserves to go through that kind of pain. But I don't want her to think it's because I want him back, and is it really my place to say anything? It honestly was by chance I found that profile. Plus she was rude to me and i don't want her to think im prying and then lash out on me, I really rather not get yelled at. She also might just ignore me.

301,"I'm a woman from America currently working in a small-ish town in Japan. One day, I met a man from India who asked if he could talk to me because he wanted to practice his English. I agreed, and I was happy to have made a friend.

However, after the second or third time we hung out together, he tried to kiss me. No ""may I"" or anything, just straight for the face. I pulled back and asked what he was doing, when he said he wanted to kiss me I told him no. He asked why and I told him I have a boyfriend. He said he understood, and the rest of that time was fine. But the next time we met, he asked again if he could kiss me. I thought maybe he didn't really understand me the first time, so I said no, and very carefully explained that I have a boyfriend, I will not kiss anyone except my boyfriend, and I think it's a bit rude of him to keep asking to kiss me when I've already said no. I told him it made me very uncomfortable and if he kept asking I wouldn't want to meet up with him anymore. We had to resort to Google translate to get across a couple of words he didn't understand but in the end he said he understood entirely and wouldn't ask again.

The next time we met up he asked again. I said no, and asked him why he kept asking when I've already told him I won't kiss anyone except my boyfriend. He said ""Because in my mind, I am your boyfriend."" I immediately told him he was not my boyfriend and I wouldn't be able to hang out with him anymore.

I've been avoiding his texts for the past couple of days, but I'm wondering if there's some cultural thing for Indians where this is acceptable, or if there's any better way I could have explained my discomfort to him?

304,"Hi there. I don't post much, so hopefully there aren't many formatting errors.


The title pretty much says it all. I'm a full time student with a part time job (28 hours). I just started my last fall semester where I'm taking 6 different classes (all of which being more involved than I initially thought). I cannot financially afford to drop any classes.


My job is only 28 hours a week, but its extremely physically intense. Right now we're short staffed. Normally we would have 3-4 members in our team/day, but right now we're down to 1.5 to 2 workers/day. 


My long school hours, intense job, are compiling on top of my chronic depression. I feel like I'm one event away from some sort of mental breakdown. I am being treated, but I probably need a higher dose medication or something. I'm struggling to focus and quickly losing any motivation I have in the day (more so than previous years). 


I'd love any advice on what to do. I can't drop any classes, but I'd feel like a massive jerk if I left my already overworked coworkers to carry my weight if I quit. Would I be right to just leave my coworkers (who are great friends) to focus on school?",29Aug2018,0
305,"Okay, I’m gonna make a really really long story short. I feel three ways about the breakup: 

1. I’m mad. I’m mad about how she did it, I’m mad that she didn’t even try to fix things she just gave up. I’m mad that she could just leave our whole relationship behind without a second glance, it made me feel reallllll big when she did that

2. I’m sad. I’m sad for the exact same reasons I’m mad for. I can’t help feeling like she did everything the way she did because she never gave a damn about me in the first place. Obviously I loved her more than she loved me because it took her literally less than a day to say “okay things didn’t work let’s be friends instead”

3. I’m excited. Near the end it wasn’t a healthy relationship, I know that. I tried talking to her, but she would refuse to talk to me about things so I can honestly say I tried to make things better but she just wasn’t having it. None of it is my fault, and it’s her loss. It hurts that she didn’t care enough about me to try to fix things, but I think the next part of my life will be good. 

Some secret part of me deep down inside wants her back, but I just don’t want to admit it. She doesn’t want me back. No part of her wants me at all, but it’s a feeling I have and I can’t change a feeling. I want so badly for her to be out of my life but I feel like that’s never gonna happen because I’m never going to just un-love her... what do I do?

306,"Hey all, 

I just needed some advice on something.

I am turning 30 next month. In like... 2 weeks, actually. I had asked my wife and friend repeatedly if I should not plan anything. Their regularly stated that nothing is being planned.

I asked again to my wife, if I should invite some friends over, she said yes, invite whoever you want. I told her about some things I thought were fun, like getting drunk and watching a horrible movie.

She said that did sound like fun. 

So, today, I sent out some invites over Messenger saying that I'd love to have some people over for my birthday just to drink, grill out, etc.

My wife and friend message me saying, ""Well, we better let the cat out of the bag, we were planning you a huge surprise party.""

I'm like... then why did you tell me to invite people over and plan my own day? 

I feel like they made me spoil my own surprise by telling me to invite people over and do whatever...

I realize this sounds strange, but birthdays have always been weird for me, because I've always been forgotten by my parents for them, as they were always doing their thing. Youngest child, and whatnot.

So, it feels like... again, I was told to plan something on my own, then they had to tell me about the surprise...

I'm not sure how to feel. I feel upset, but at the same time, just kinda let down. 

They made a big deal about how I'm turning 30 only once, and I should plan something I want to do... then they ruin the surprise. 

Just some insight. I realize my plight isn't exactly interesting... just not sure how to feel.",29Aug2018,1

309,"I work at a pretty small tech/web design company and we all are forced to work in the same room now. My coworkers and boss are convinced that working in minimal light (two-three desk lamps on) are better for your eyesight than just turning on the overhead ceiling lights that came with our office space. 

This has given me such a great headache. I’ve tried to talk to them about it but there’s just no reasoning. I can’t really find any internet research to back up the claim of darkness somehow being better for your eyes? I know bright fluorescent lights aren’t exactly gold either, but I’m finding myself having to take breaks just to go outside and sit for a few mins in the sun. 

I know I should ask this maybe on a scientific sub too but I’m not too sure. There’s a lot of empty office rooms around us, so should I just ask instead to move so I can work in some decent lighting?",29Aug2018,1
310,"I feel a tremendous amount of anxiety ever since the first night I got really drunk, and started crying and throwing up everywhere. (14m).

My family expect so much of me and never expected me to drink, because whenever I've previously been offered alcohol I always refuse it. Aswell as for slating others in my family for doing so. This has now led to them constantly tormenting me about this incident. 

This has also led to me unconsciously saying a bunch of my secrets, that I now get asked about by my family. This now makes me uncomfortable to speak to them or be around them.

Btw one of the secrets was about a girl I liked and my brother saw this girl yesterday hanging out at the same place as him. I don't know if told her about me liking her, but she might be going to the same place as him today aswell and I'm worried about him telling her.

312,"My parents have been divorced since I was nearly 13.  I am now 20 years old.  My mother has various untreated mental illnesses which are obvious (but she claims aren't there) and she has been very clear that she doesn't want me, my brother, or my sister talking to my father.  I'm stuck living with her and technically speaking we are supposed to hate him, or something close to that.

I started secretly communicating with my father when I was 18, and my mother never found out.  He used to be using drugs and alcohol heavily, which sort of led to their divorce in the first place, but now he's been clean for almost a year.   He mentioned moving back to my area a couple months ago, and since I'm the only one left that he really speaks to, he said he was only going to tell me and I agreed that that was the best course of action, as my mother's reaction was likely to be explosive and dramatic. 

He finally made the move a few days ago, but informed me that his stepson, whom he lives with, would be going to high school with my younger brother.  My younger brother is still a bit brainwashed into thinking our father is this awful, dangerous person (though he seems to be getting better with it,) and the first thing he'd do if he so much as saw him driving down our street would be to call our mother. 

I'm holding this secret in me now, preparing for her to find out and have what is likely to be the outburst of the century.  Part of me thinks she'll accuse me of knowing.  Part of me is terrified she'll find out I've been speaking to him.  And before you say ""just tell her the truth,"" look- that would be easy if she wasn't abusive.  You CANNOT reason with people who respond to everything with blame and anger.  Believe me, it would make my current living situation close to unbearable.  

Now my dad has given me two options- he said he could call and say he moved back and wants to see the kids, or he could wait till the sons go back to school and see each other, and then my brother would naturally report back to my mom and she'd find out that way.  I'm nervous about either.  But I feel that my mother finding out naturally would make the most sense... I just, I really don't need this.  This is too much family drama and my intentions have never been anything but pure, but of course, I can't expect a house full of people who wants to see my father as nothing but an evil man to understand that.

Please someone just clue me in as to how the hell I should handle this.  I am on her phone plan so she could always check records, but she won't see our texts as they were on iMessage which uses data and I've tried to keep calls scarce.  I'm terrified of my mom, terrified of whatever backlash I may face.  Am I overthinking this?  Is this as bad as I feel it is?  She would flip out when she heard he was even in town, let alone him moving here and sending his stepson to school with my brother.... 

Please be compassionate.  I'm a nervous wreck.

313,"I'm pretty confident I'm not socially awkward since it's easy for me to get friends regardless of gender, I'll admit that I'm a little dense, not that oblivious to the point where it would be a pain by itself but enough to be unable to recognize emotions directed towards me (if there's any) while being able to understand those directed at others.

327,"Ok, first let me give the TL, DR version:

I'm an engaged guy and I still have feelings for another girl, and I don't know what to do because she keeps interacting with me on FB, Kik, and Instagram. I don't want to lose her friendship but at the same time, I'm trying to get her out of my mind.

Now the full version:

So, me and my fiance were into a very weird relationship, we broke up and got back together a lot until we move together (first as friends) and we decided to get engaged. The last time we broke up I decided to met new people, I met a girl on Facebook and I was completely in love with her. She lives in another city but she had a few problems with her mother and decided to move to her father's house, which was closer to me. Things were getting pretty great until she said that she wouldn't move anymore because she felt like she wouldn't get adapted to the new city.

After that my ex (and best friend) moved to my house, he got into the same university as I am and we thought it was a great idea to share the loan. The problems with the girl I was in love and her mother got bigger and she took a break from social media, and we lost touch. A few months after she sent me a direct on Instagram with the link for ""We don't talk anymore"" video and we started to talk again, but that time I was already back with my ex and we were already engaged.

Since we started to talk to each other again I have crazy dreams about presenting her to my family as my girlfriend or stay the whole dream looking after her. Everything I post, she writes a comment, every silly game I play with my friends on Facebook, she wants to join in. Today I was doing that silly Facebook game 'Comment with a color and I will tell you what I like about you' and she was there. I replied with a very generic thing, I didn't know what to say, everything I thought would probably get me into trouble, so I keep writing and erasing until I gave up and wrote something pretty generic like 'you're cool'. I had to hold myself to not send her a message on Kik apologizing about it.

When we talk, she makes sure to talk about my fiance and about how happy she is for me, so the problem is not HER feelings, are MINE, that is getting crazy and I don't know what to do.

I honestly like her a lot more than I expected to from just hanging out with her once. i’ve dated other girls before but i’ve never had this feeling before.. it’s messing with my head. the problem is that I can’t really tell what she wants and we go to different colleges. i’m also leaving for australia this week to work a credit based internship. I won’t be back at my home college until the spring. I’m worried that i’ll lose any momentum I currently have with her if I don’t let her know that i’m interested before I leave the country.

I feel like this might be classier to do rather than through text. we’re college kids so we currently just communicate through snapchat and text.

So far I’ve had two encounters with this guy, neither of which have been very pleasant for me, both of which have happened after the same class and at the same exact time.

The first encounter started with my walking past the same apartment as I’ve done for the past 2 years, and that’s when I saw him around the corner on his patio. I immediately got a bad feeling but I chose to ignore it, until he stopped me, asking if I smoked. At this point he had not approached me and was just asking from a distance. I told him no and he responded with “Oh.” At this point the conversation got incredibly awkward as he just stood there, staring at me silently. I’m should also add thats this entire time he has not moved a muscle, and I mean he was eerily still. I told him to have a good day, but he just continued to stare at me. After that I walked away.

The second encounter just happened recently and is the reason I’m making this post. I had all but forgotten this encounter until I saw his back to me on the stairwell leading down from the apartment. I immediately turned around and started to walk around the other side of the building until I heard him call from behind me. He was just a few feet away from me, a distance he couldn’t have covered just by walking. He then asked me if I had a car, and I said no, he said “Oh.” This situation was the exact same as the first, the same stare, stillness, response, he was even wearing the same clothes from 2 days ago. No one has ever made me this uncomfortable before.

341,"So, my husband and I have been friends with this couple for years. They're our best friends and we do everything with them, we are even the godparents to their children. They are like family to us. 

Now, most of the friendship, my husband and I have struggled with fertility issues and have been trying to grow our family by two little feet. Our godchildren have in many ways been our surrogate children and we have done everything in our power to make sure that we are good godparents and friends that are there when needed.

Recently the dynamic of the friendship started to change. They needed someone to watch their son during the week and since I work from home, I offered to take him one of those days. This was fine at first, until he started having behavioral issues and then, surprise, I got pregnant!

Now my best friend is pregnant too and they say they are happy for us, but with my pregnancy being high risk and I have been on bedrest, a lot is changing. I figured my best friend would be understanding. She's pregnant herself! Add to that, I have been very sick this pregnancy with nausea and vomiting that last all day, which is being addressed through my doctor but still currently a pain in the ass.

Now all of these things seemingly have nothing to do with each other, but yesterday for the first time, I had to tell them that I couldn't watch my godchild. I gave ample notice that I was feeling awful and would try to weather it to watch them, but it just didn't happen. So I let my friends know that I wouldn't be able to take care of my Godbaby this week, but once I get my antinausea medicine, things should be fine and I'll be able to take care of them. I apologized profusely and genuinely had anxiety over having to say no to them, I hate having to do it.

Instead of understanding, they both got very passive aggressive and my best friend started texting short messages and said, ""You should have known you were going to be sick sooner."" I can't predict my pregnancy symptoms. She's pregnant too, I thought she would understand this. I texted her back saying as much. Since then, silent treatment.

My husband is currently infuriated with them. We do a lot for them and try to be considerate of their feelings and needs as people. The moment the situation changed and we inconvenienced them, they both are acting very strange and petty. My husband spoke with her husband and he acted like we did this on purpose and my pregnancy exists to just fuck up their plans.

Now, we're in a weird position. We love our friends. We love our godchildren. But this isn't right. I haven't been able to sleep about this and I feel like it is going to hurt the friendship. We have been friends for years. We have had disagreements. This feels different though. It's not a big thing in the long term. It's not. But their reaction is very confusing to me. Their reaction makes me want to not let this go, which is probably wrong on my part. We give them support and we would try to be understanding. Why is this not being afforded to us?

I know she is pregnant and I am trying to be mindful it might be hormonal. But at the same time, I'm like what the fuck. One time I say no and I'm some sort of monster? Am I missing something? Should hubby and I even be upset? Sorry this is so long, but I am very in my feelings about this. TYIA for reading. ",29Aug2018,1
342,"So I have pretty much never had a job I enjoy, and I can’t fathom the idea that some people might actually LIKE going to work each day. I’ve tried a few different jobs in my time, but no matter what I do I hate everything I try. Like, earnestly HATE. Like, I would rather starve to death than continue.

Basically it has come down to this now, where I just don’t want to work, period. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t want to leech off someone else and sleep on their couch for the rest of my life either, if anything that’s worse. But at this point I’ve started to wonder: if work is a mandatory part of life, why would I want to continue living?

And I know how this sounds. “Look at this bitchboy, too spoiled and good for labor! Do you want a piggyback ride to the malt shop so you can cry salty tears into a milkshake?” But I’m seriously at my wits end here, otherwise I wouldn’t be posting this at all.

They tend to be fairly small, since we both have busy lives and can't always afford to go out and buy things, or go visit a museum, everyday, although those are possibilities for the weekends. They can be relationship-centric or individual. 

It has been fun to do, but I'm having a hard time consistently thinking of new things and I would love to have some input from other people! Any ideas?

Examples of things that we have done are:
* spend 30 minutes reading somewhere new / read something just for fun, not work

352,"My husband and I have two cats. One of them, my favorite one, the one who can best be described as love in a fur package is dying of cancer. He is almost 12 years old. He has a tumor in his leg the size of a large grapefruit and the rest of that leg is swollen to about triple its original size. He is unable to use the leg and is moving around using the other three legs. 

The vet has been consulted repeatedly and basically by the time we caught it, he recommended against amputation/treatment due to the cat's age and also his suspicion that the cancer had probably spread already. The vet said that basically at this point the cat is ready to go any time that we are ready to let him go. He recommends that we do not prolong this as an emergency may occur as the cancer progresses which could put the cat in a lot of pain and he does not need to suffer like this. 

My husband and I agreed to pick a date sometime in September after our kid is back in school so we can both go with the cat to comfort him. Now that the time is coming to set a date my husband doesn't want to do it because the cat is still eating and not constantly crying out in pain or in visible distress. He says once that cat goes that's it and we should let him live as long as we can. The cat does eat and enjoys cat nip and treats. Beyond that he sleeps, rarely moving from my bed. He doesn't want to play and shows no interest in anything other than food and pets. He does still love being petted and snuggling.

So my question is - is it OK to let him keep living until he stops eating or shows more visible distress? Based on what the vet said at the last visit, I worry that an emergency situation will occur and he will suffer needlessly whereas my husband doesn't want to euthanize him a minute sooner than we have to. Opinions please.

353,"alright so i need someone to tell me if this could work. i am fully aware that this is unethical.

long story short i am 21, in college, never got laid with a girl before, never succeeded in that. as i was reading 3 genres of books, one of them about psychological human manipulation strategies and one of them about marketing, i came up with an idea. i was thinking to mix marketing and psychology together to exploit my goal.

i met some girl on tinder and she lives across my college, very close to me. i added her on snapchat and we chatted a lot. she sent me lots of pics and videos even though i never asked for one. she also started flirting first. she seems like a regular slutty college dorm room girl which is what im looking for.

so because i got rejected by every girl for sex, imagine this conversation with this girl:

Me: by the way i was wondering, are you dtf by any chance?

She: no... (most probable response would be rejection. If thats the case i continue)

Me: ah okay. because i have to go to Dubai in like 2 weeks, gotta do some hard work for a lot of money so i was thinking to do it with you before i go because you're beautiful

Obviously that is not true. But that sentence should make her question again because she will think im a serious, hardworking guy (i actually am but not yet to that level) and possibly very rich and would want me to take her to dubai (who wouldnt want to go there?), since everyone knows going to one of the worlds most expensive places like dubai is not something everyone can do.

It seems in the last 6 months or so, every day I go into work I am having my quality of work brought into question by a clique of old women coworkers that are quite hostile to me for some reason. I cannot think why they dislike me but that is beside the point, what matters is they do and they collectively work against my effort to improve by fabricating events, reporting incredibly minor things and trying to pin any mistake on me.

The group has been reporting all types of problems to my boss and I've had multiple meetings with him at this point. I've told my side of the story and have evidence that supports my case in many examples. However, there are hundreds of little things that have been reported so refuting them all is impossible. My boss has taken the womens' side and has given me four weeks to go through a ""capability test"" to see if I can go four weeks without being reported. Word has got out to the other workers about this capability test and I have told him that it is virtually impossible for me to go one day without a problem being reported nevermind four weeks.

I have found out that this capability test is formal NHS procedure prior to redeploying an employee to another job or simply firing them. So it is really a formality that he is going through, otherwise I think I'd already be fired.

Hey all. 

TL: DR : a plumber cut himself and his blood went over the walls i am to paint. He has no intention of cleaning it up. My emphasis of blood stains where shrugged off and i was told to clean it when i do come to paint it. Im not happy.

-- 
So straight to the point. With some pre info for context. 

Im working with another fellow, doing a full board and skim of a brand new house. All is going well, or atleast has been.

Aswell as plastering i do decorating (this is on my own) , i gave the price to the customer and he is happy with it so i shall start it a week or 2 after the final bit of plastering has been done. 

Earlier today we are working on the top floor, a plumber is also working in our vicinity (changing pipes to a more suitable position) , while he is cutting pipes or wood he gives a yell out... he cut himself. It wasnt bad and he went to go clean it up and put a plaster on it. 

After we finished our first set, i go to the ground floor to get fresh water but as go down all i see is his blood. Like drops and splashes everywhere. And to my annoyance and as to actually how its even possible, over the walls and over the stair treads. After he 'cleaned himself up' he had a tiny plaster on it, he also carried on working. So for one im baffled as to how one can have sooo much blood drip. 2 Why did he even let it drip. And 3 why the fuck was it all over the walls??? 

At first i was like wow and i asked him to clean it up to which he gave a me a nonsensicle remark. At his point im not thinking as a plasterer, im thinking as a painter. Im not happy with it.

I went and spoke to my plastering colleague and he said to just clean it up when i paint. I felt offended. I told him blood will stain the walls and it isnt my responsibility. And it just got shrugged off. 

I left after the conversation and went to the outhouse bathroom, to find blood drips leading from the door to the sink, and yep, blood all in the sink. None of it cleaned at all. 

After i seen this i went to speak to my collegue again to mention it and stress my annoyance at the blood that was just literally left where it landed and i emphasized the blood on the walls, this time as a plaster and again as a painter. To only get shrugged off again.

Anyways i went and carried on with work. 

About 3 minutes later, the blood dripping dude came up to ask if we wanted any tea, i said no thanks and my colleague said yes. Another 5 mins past and colleague got shouted down. 
He comes back up 10 minutes later and says to me. ""He"" got blood on the kitched units (a kitchen which has yet to be fully installed, the kitchen fitters were out on a break) , he then suggested the blood dripper should clean it up. Emphasizing that the kitched is brandnew and in the process of being installed. To which the blood dripper tries to clean up. 

I didnt really pay attention after that. I became frustrated in that scenario. As if my work was less significant. And for whatever reason my opinion isnt significant. 

---

Am i overreacting? I have expressed and asked for it to be cleaned politely. 

I will admit that at one point i may have been out of place. After asking the blood dripping plumber twice for him to clean it up. I did offer to clean it up for him but at a cost. Was i wrong in doing this? Wrong in just the suggestion? 

If anything doesnt make sense then let me know. 

Advice and input is greatly appreciated 

Thank you.

360,"(sorry for the wall of text)

I've been planning to move to LA after college for 4 years now. It was my dream, and it was the best place for me career wise (I work in film). A couple months after graduating, me, my boyfriend, and my two close friends set out to move together.

When we got to LA had a plan to stay in an (studio apt) Airbnb for a month try to all get jobs and an apartment for all of us to live in. Things were going relatively well, my boyfriend and I had interviews lined up, I had a interview with my dream company (although it was for a temporary position). One of my friends that I was living with had a family friend in the valley that offered us to stay in their guest house for free for as long as we needed.

There were a lot bad things though. My boyfriend and I had $4000 saved up and that was draining FAST. We couldn't find an apartment that would accept us. The area that our Airbnb was located in was dangerous and we were all afraid to leave the apartment because every time we did, we would be chased or harrased by someone on the street. My dog wasn't adjusting well to the change and she didn't get to spend any time outside other than to go potty. LA didn't feel like home to me like I thought it would. Our friends didn't really seem to want to try to get jobs as much as we did. I hated living there, nothing was working out, and I wanted to go home.

So I did.

My boyfriend and I drove back to Illinois and we're now living in my parents basement trying to try again in Chicago. The thing is, I feel happier here. I'm happy to be closer to my family, I'm happy that my dog has a better life here, and I'm happy to not worry about money for a while. Living with my parents isn't ideal though and I feel like I'm going insane with boredom (they live in a really small town).

But there's still a lot of doubt. We miss our friends terribly. We've been applying to places in Chicago every day to no avail. We even miss California (the nice parts of it at least). I'm sad and I feel like I let fear make me give up my dream. 

So right now we have several plans in place. If and when we make it to Chicago, and we like it there, we'll stay. If we make it to Chicago and still miss our friends and LA, then we'll go back after a year, but with more money and more job experience under our belt.

But the thing is that I don't know what I want. As soon as I think I know what I want, my mind flees towards the other option and I get all confused. Everyone is telling me that I did the right thing but I'm not sure that's true. I just want some objective advice on what I should do.

My field has a bachelors program, but it is not required to practice, that's what our board exams were for. The bachelors degree is relatively new, and people in the field who want to advance to managerial roles usually take it. I'm not interested in that route, and aside from rising to training new employees, I am happy doing what I do. 

However. 

I have frequently been thinking about going back to school for art. It is my side hobby and second passion, and I want to go back to learn the key concepts I never got to learn. I do fine teaching myself but I can tell I'm lacking some fundamentals in the painting realm and I would really like to get some structure. I do miss school, and the thought of going for art is very appealing as I can branch out and market my skills. 

The pros as I've thought of them are:
•The school I want to go to is not an AI (Art institute chain school) but an institute 10 minutes away from me. 
•I can pay for classes out of pocket and dont need financial aid. 
•I'm 26 and have had time to think about what I want to focus on. 
•I've got 75% of the basics down which will make the fundamental classes a bit easier. 
•I'm not aiming to enroll until next year or 2020.

The cons:
•I work full time nights. 12 hour shifts and then I'd have class at 7 or 730. I'd have to try to stack classes so I can sleep in the afternoon. 
•Its a pro too but I'm 26 and easily 7 or 8 years older than the undergrads 
•I would have to cut most of my free time down to accommodate both. I know it can be done, but it would be very difficult initially.

368,"Alright, first some backstory: So I'm a leader (19 y.o) in something similar to boy scouts in America, but not really. Basically, every Sunday, we organise activities for kids, from 2 to 6 pm.  The kids are split into age groups, and have 3-5 leaders (like me) depending on the group size. 

So, in September I will start my second year as a leader. Last year, my group were 8-9 years old. Because it was only my first year, I got 2 experienced co-leaders with me. They did most of the work when ""handling"" the kids, i.e making them quiet, explaining games, resolving disputes,...

When it came down to it and I had to handle them, they wouldn't listen. I always had to ask one of the others to tell them. If I actually had to get angry at them (this happens regularly with large groups), the kids often just brush it off and laugh at me. If I got mad at someone in particular, they often just made a witty comment and make me look like a fool. 

Now I'm nervous because the group I have this year are 12-13 year olds, and I don't have a more experienced co-leader to fall back on this time (only my age or younger). 

So finally for my question: How do I get them to listen to me, while they still like me (i.e they don't see me as a ""bad guy"" who gets mad all the time)

369,"I've been thinking about quitting my job. I work at Robofun which essentially teaches Robotics to kids. I started having a problem when they refused to take me full time this summer and had me working inventory although they put interns out to do what essentially I got hired for-- being a Teaching Assistant. Inventory gave me more hours since most teachers and interns work half-days but I was still mad that I wasn't doing what I got hired for. Even if it weren't for that during the school semester they do afterschool programs which is only about 6 hours a week. I knew this going in but at the time I was dorming with my mother's financial support and only needed money for food. Then I into an apartment with my sister of which we split the rent. Can't pay rent with those hours. But they let me come in 1 day a week for the full day and do inventory. That combined with private tutoring has been paying my rent. However, I'm not sure if they intend to keep letting me do inventory as it was mostly just needed for the end of the school year and during the summer. And I'm not sure if they will have other projects for me. I've only had this job for about 5 months by the way-- since April. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got a Mathnasium and Launch position. Mathnasium is math tutoring and Launch is programming for kids (like Robofun but more advanced and competitive-- with pay too! 20-45 dollars an hour but still not many hours and only if i do tasks that require heavy preparation, lesson plans, etc.). I am not sure which position to take or to stay at my current job. 

&amp;#x200B;

Launch is similar to RoboFun in that it does afterschool programs meaning the same bad hours but higher pay. Also they have private tutoring opportunities but then I would have to stop the current private tutoring I'm doing AND Robofun. This would mean letting down two companies, presenting myself as unreliable in addition to more than likely having no future references. Launch also offers full time positions in the summer but I think when I graduate I may want to look into other programs like this BETA teaching apprentice position I'm applying to for next year which focuses on helping historically oppressed communities with group teaching methods; and I'm pretty sure Launch wants long-term commitment. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can make more hours doing Mathnasium but will also have to quit current private tutoring. Mathnasium has the most solid shifts so far, it's easy, I could make enough to pay rent and then some, and since all positions are part-time,leaving probably wouldn't be a huge deal. It also leaves my Fridays completely free. It's less stressful than Launch too as they're curriculum is prepared and math tutoring is generally less strenuous than programming. This added to the way their schedule works makes it optimal for me prioritizing my last year at college.

&amp;#x200B;

There's also the possibility that if I stay at Robofun AND they keep letting me do inventory combined with private tutoring that I will make the same as either of those jobs. Of course, if I only do TA stuff I will make way less. That said, I am mostly wary about quitting two jobs at once in turn for either of these potential positions.

370,"(F20)    Hi, I have been struggling lately with self-image issues. I've always been very self conscious about the way I look and how others think of me. 

I wouldn't call it complete ""self-hatred""...maybe a more ""self-dislike"" of sorts. I dislike the way I look, and my personality. I have bipolar depression, and I always feel like I bother those around me. Because of it I don't like talking or reaching out to anyone. I also just dislike my skin, my body. Acne, tummy chub, etc. Just so overwhelmingly self-conscious that I can't even leave the house lately without a struggle. 

I know that many people out there probably have had similar feelings before...I was wondering if anyone had any tips on how I can just learn to accept myself; to love myself. I always see people around me so happy, so confident. I want to be at the point where I don't have to worry about what other people think anymore. 

tl;dr: how can I learn to just love myself?

371," 

First  of all I'm sorry I had to post here, but the fatherless sub seems to be  inactive so i thought my best course would be to post here. I'm really  sorry if it's inappropriate.

**1) The problem:**

Now this is an issue I've been discussing with myself for the last year **(I'm 18)** and I've always saw myself oddly different from other boys who had a proper functioning family **(by this I mean a family where** ***both*** **parents are involved in their kids' growth to a certain degree)**, I'm not saying these boys had it perfect or even more than just ""alright"" but their chemistry with ***BOTH***  parents is always either equal or leans more to the father, and thus  they are more hard working, more focused and have more responsibility  than me from what I've observed.

**2) My relationship with my family:**

Now  let me clue you in with all the important details, I DO have a father  and he is here but I've always been VERY VERY close to my mother, she  always mentored me, cared after me and always been there for me  throughout my ENTIRE life. On the other hand my father is absolutely  useless, he NEVER asks about me or any of my siblings, he knows nothing  about me (**barely knows my age and I doubt it)**  and It's not like there are any sort of problems in the past or present  like parents fighting or anything, my mother isn't a crazy feminist **(Even though I live in a first world country but this has nothing to do with politics or parent problems)**  nor does she keep me away from him... He just doesn't acknowledge  responsibility on his end. He thinks his duty is to bring in money to  the table and that's all he has to do. Nothing else. He just goes to  work, gets back, take a shower, eats, goes out until 11:30 PM and  sleeps. Repeat. Now I'm not going to say he is exactly a statue, he does  talk to me every few months for a couple of minutes,  he does talk with  my mom everyday but they're not that close either as they should be  given the fact they've been married 30 years **(Nope, not an affair or any other relationship problems again... just sheer irresponsibility on his part)**  and whenever she told him about this issue he starts screaming at her  and telling her how her way of raising me and my siblings is shit even  though HE should be there for us too. I mean the other day a huge piece  of  glass cut the hell out my leg to the bone and he still has no clue  about it. The last time i talked to him was in April so it tells you how  that qualifies him as being a ""Father"". 

**3) Where I think the problem lies:**

My father is almost 60 and mom is almost 50 **(both work full time)**,  I'm the only male out of my siblings, we live in the suburbs so that  doesn't help either if i wanted to interact with other kids around my  age on a daily basis when I was younger, and although my mom did sign me  up for a lot of after school activities that i enjoyed when i was  younger, it just wasn't enough time.

So now growing up and preparing for University **(currently working in a nursery too)**,  I'm struggling with being a responsible guy, a coward, extremely  unsocial and socially anxious, very sensitive for a guy, I have ADHD **(which I refuse to take meds for)**,  i just can't tell you my future is going to be good. Also, within me  lies a real psychopath. I don't know where it stems from but I always  think beating the shit out of someone that bothers me is the answer and  if it gets heated I probably wouldn't hesitate to kill too. But that's  beside the point, I'm really silent, respectful, and just... not there. ***A nobody***.  In school I had a couple of good friends but other than that in class I  was a ghost that no one cared about. So if I got hit by a car right  now, the only ones I see caring about my are my siblings and mom.

I  never had someone give me the felling i had a father figure, and  therefore I was never guided on how to clean my own mess or solve my own  problem. I'm straight as a needle but I can't keep a chat with a girl  longer than 10 seconds, I'm very depraved sexually and watch porn  EXCESSIVELY.

So the questions I have are very simple:

How  will being fatherless for my entire childhood and teenage years affect  me for the rest of my life? Can I break out of this bubble? What should I  do?",29Aug2018,1

373,"So I just graduated from college and this girl tweeted about a job opportunity that fits my field. I'm thinking of messaging her about it but after checking my twitter messages with her (from 2013 lol) they were really embarrassing. Although she was nice, I sounded so childish and weird so I don't want to message her again if she's gonna re-read the messages. (I'm assuming she forgot)

In the messages I was asking her some advice about uni because I was thinking of attending the same one she goes to. But the embarrassing part was that I assumed we were friends and messaged her apologizing that I didn't say hi cause I didn't recognize her in public due to my weak eye sight. Which sounds so childsh now because I'm sure she doesn't care lol.

I don't know if she deleted the messages, but if she didn't and I message her about the job opportunity, it will be awkward since the old chats will pop.

So should I message her or no? ",29Aug2018,1
374,"r/relationships (temporarily?) removed this and suggested that I try r/rape, for reasons that will become very clear, I don't think that's a good idea. Maybe they'll reapprove it, but I don't want to sit around. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to be incredibly, purposefully vague in this post for reasons that will be very clear. I'm also going to log out of this account and set it on fire immediately after posting, so PM's will not be seen.

My husband and I have been together for more than five years. We have one child under three. We are trying to conceive a second child. For the past few months we have been working *very hard* toward this goal, with all the cycle tracking and ovulation tests and stuff that you do when you're trying to make a baby. I am currently in the Two Week Wait after ovulation but before you can take a pregnancy test, so I might currently be pregnant, I don't know. This is relevant, I promise.

Last night my husband needed to talk to me. He was shaking and at times appeared to be on the verge of tears. He confessed that before he met me he had molested a relative. At the time the relative was under ten and he was a teenager. He said that the relative behaved suggestively towards him multiple times and he did not put a stop to it until it became physical. The way he described it sounded like the relative had previously been abused or exposed to inappropriate content and was acting it out. I know this might not be the truth or it might be sugar-coated, but I'm including it in case it is relevant. He said that there was never any sex. I didn't ask for further details, I don't want to know them.

He said that he'd never had any inappropriate thoughts towards children before or since, that he had never and would never harm our child, and that when he remembered this occurrence he was so ashamed. He said he would kill himself before he hurt anyone again. Again, this might not be the truth, I know. But I have no reason to doubt that it is.

He asked if I was going to divorce him or take our child away. I didn't have an answer ready so I said no, I wasn't. I said that it happened before he met me and that he was still the same person I had married. I'm not sure yet whether or not I genuinely believe this, in the moment I was just trying not to commit to a course of action too hastily or do something that would cause him to hurt himself. I don't know how I feel yet, but I believe it's common advice here (""here"" being r/relationships) not to let a dangerous man know you're leaving him, and although I'm not sure yet if my husband is dangerous, it seemed the best course of action. I told him I was not leaving, but secretly I have not yet made that decision.

He told me that he had hoped this relative had forgotten about what had happened, but that they had just messaged him confronting him, and he admitted it to them. He said that he knew this gave them evidence against him, but that it was the right thing to do. He is currently very afraid that the relative will go to the police and that he will be sent to prison and our son will grow up without a father, and with everyone around him telling him that his father is a monster. After some Googling, we've decided that the location in which certain parties now live might mean that the statute of limitations has not yet expired, despite this occurring more than ten years ago and the victim now being an adult. I'm not going to provide enough details for anyone to disprove or corroborate this, I value my privacy more.

I believe that the relative is unlikely to go to the police after so long and is instead likely to speak openly on social media to inform their family of what happened, with screenshots of their conversation as proof. If this happened I'm not sure if I would stand by my husband even if I concluded that I wanted to. I might need to distance myself to protect our child. Or he could be correct and end up being sent to prison, in which case the choice would be made for me.

Currently I have done nothing. It's been less than 24 hours since I found out. I have suggested talking to a lawyer but he doesn't want to unless or until something happens. I'm not sure if my knowledge and lack of action makes me a negligent parent or not. I'm not sure what I feel right now. I'm not sure what I will do if we were successful at conceiving a child. I'm not sure of anything.

I was not prepared to be put in this situation. I thought that I had married a good man. Maybe I did. Talk to me, Reddit. I don't know what to do.",29Aug2018,1

376,"Hi guys. So my [21 F] boyfriend [26 M] and I have decided that we don’t mind the other occasionally going out on excursions with other people. We’ve already set up our rules for what the other person can/can’t do while on/after these instances. 

I already have someone in mind that I would want to get with just for a night. It’s a guy that i briefly met after high school. We went to different high schools in different areas &amp; were both in the same club, so I knew of him but had never really met or talked to him prior.  After I graduated high school, we went to an international convention in the early summer where I had an opportunity to do stuff with him. I was young &amp; extremely naive so I ultimately panicked &amp; refused, which really sucked because i found him extremely attractive. We happened to meet again during the summer at a separate event where we danced for a bit before parting ways. 

Now, don’t get me wrong, but I still find him really attractive &amp; regret not taking that first opportunity. It’s been 4 ish years since &amp; i kind of wanted to ask him out for drinks *hint hint* We both still follow each other on Instagram and I see that he’s viewed all of my stories, telling me that he *may* be somewhat interested (kind of a reach, I know, but that’s me trying to reassure myself lmao). I’m kind of an awkward person so I don’t exactly know how to go about casually messaging and asking him out for drinks without telling him that I’m in an open relationship (since that’s not entirely the case). I’m honestly not even sure how to greet him since I don’t exactly know him too well?? I’m pretty sure he’s seen some, if not all, of my Instagram pictures with my boyfriend, so I’m afraid he may think I’m trying to cheat on him. I don’t exactly know what to tell him &amp; I honestly would rather not tell him over a private message that my boyfriend &amp; I have this agreement (for privacy reasons ofc).

I’m extremely anxious &amp; get a little awkward when it comes to approaching people. It’s a bit of an odd advice post but I would really appreciate some help on what to do/say! I am also in no way guaranteeing that he’ll definitely say yes to drinks &amp; will be somewhat prepared for that outcome (although I would appreciate any additional advice on how to take rejection in this scenario).

TL;DR: in a *somewhat* open relationship &amp; want to mess around with a guy I briefly met in high school. dont know how to message him &amp; casually ask him to go out for drinks with me without seeming creepy or how to avoid telling him I’m in an *open* relationship ship over a message.",29Aug2018,0

378,"I honestly don't even know where to begin with this post. I feel overwhelmed at the mere thought of trying to explain how I feel, but I have felt like this for too long and just want some sort of advice. When I share this kind of thing with loved ones, they don't know what to say. They usually look helpless and sort of shrug it off - not because they don't care, but it's a really big intangible thing and if you've never felt this way, it is difficult to grasp. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am in my 30's, I have a stable career, a phenomenal relationship with my partner that is moving in exactly the direction that I want it to, an awesome vacation to another country on the horizon, and a great set of friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I hate my job, even though it's stable. It isn't something that I ever wanted to do. I found myself on this career trajectory because it was easy and I honestly didn't know what else to do. I knew that I had general interests but I didn't know how to translate that into a job, and here I am, 8+ years later at the same place that I don't like or enjoy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am so passionate about politics, and law, and the communities around me. I want to be a part of something more. I KNOW that sounds easy. It seems like ""just quit your job and find something to do in that area."" But it isn't. First, I struggle with OCD. I have anxiety about a lot of things, but I especially get hung up on focus on everything needing to be ""perfect."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I also have a really big expense coming up this year that will not allow me the opportunity to quit my job until at least sometime next year. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, I struggle with feeling like I'm not good enough. I look around and I see people dedicating their lives to making *something* better - laws, communities, the world, and I feel like I am just not smart enough to do it. I feel like I'm on the outskirts, looking in and that when someone notices, they laugh at this insignificant, puny person who presumes that they are capable of much more than they are. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel foolish, and worried about failure. I know the sayings about failure, and I know that many ""great"" people have failed often, but it is very intimidating, and a part of me feels like an idiot for waiting this long to do something about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I don't really know what I'm asking. I know that there will be new things and challenges, and that you just have to deal with them. I know that the only thing that I can do is change what I don't like. I just don't really know how to go about doing that to ensure that it translates into success? or even if I can?

384,"I dropped out of college. I dropped 2 days ago, August 27th, 2018 and I also told my parents the same day. They were not happy, at all, and strongly recommended I get my classes back and finish my degree, however, that is not possible as it is too late. My parents are very traditional and have worked very hard in order to see me go through college and graduate.

I am majoring in Film/TV Production, but a little over a year ago I got into photography and I loved it. I wanted to switch my major to photography but I did not bother as my current Film/TV Production timeline of classes were extremely similar. I had 3 years of college left. 1 year of community college, and 2 years at a university (I live in the U.S. and this is the cheaper option for my situation). I have talked to a few friends who have dropped out and are doing pretty well in the business world, and other friends in the same major as me. Friends in the same major had mixed emotions about it, some said go for it and gave me an inspirational speech so to say and others did not recommend it.

The reason I dropped was because I wanted to use those 3 years in order to gain experience from many different types of shoots such as real estate, portraits, birthdays, etc. I did not think a degree was necessary and that I was wasting my time for 3 years, not learning much. My parents are extremely disappointed and upset, which in turn, is making me feel the same. I have a plan with my photography work and I am currently trying my best to put myself forth in order to show them I can do it. I even promised them if within a year I have nothing to show for it then I will go back to school and finish my degree.

On the other hand, if I have nothing to show for my photography, then that's not the right thing for me. I have 0 interest in any other major other than maybe welding/engineering. My backup plan if all else fails is to go to a trade school for 2 years and focus on nothing but that and get a degree in Welding, Gas, and Electric.

My brain is going into overdrive and I am not so sure what I'm even doing. Everything feels so weird. I feel uncomfortable all the time and feel like time has screeched to a halt. Did I make a good decision? Are these weird uncomfortable feelings just from the fact that it's happening now, but they will go away later? I feel absolutely miserable right now.

385,"It's my first post here, English is not my first language, but I seriously can't take it anymore. 

Back in September I had a career opportunity which I postponed because I didn't have confidence that I could make it. In hindsight, I don't see it as difficult anymore and I want to kill myself for missing on it. Basically there was this exam I should've taken, and now it's too late to register. However, without that exam, chances for me to succeed in this career path are minimal. And I can't sit the exam next year, as I don't have the money to do so. So I kinda screwed my future because I didn't believe in myself and I postponed the exam. 
Besides, career has always been the most important aspect of my life, not only because I was quite gifted in school, but also because I am seriously incapable of having any kind of human relationships. Which adds even more to my recent failure. I have always seen myself becoming a crazy cat lady and I never feared it. I don't see anything wrong in it at all. I just seem unfit for relationships, I've never had a boyfriend and it never bothered me. But that was before my failure. 
Now I can't count on my career and I feel really lost. Not only that I'll end up alone, but I'll also fail my whole life.

Basically, I had asked my bestfriend (19f) if she could pick my sister up from school today since I also just started college and am trying to get used to my schedule and figure out my babysitter situation. My sisters school is pretty close to our apartment, but far from my best friends house. Since she doesn’t have a car, I offered to pick her up in the morning before I went to class and bring her to my apartment so she could just chill and wait there until my sister got out of school.

392,"I'm currently starting my senior year at a large university majoring in Engineering. I am considering dropping a class, which would mean I wouldn't be able to graduate in the spring, and would have to stay at university an extra semester next fall.   

&amp;#x200B;

My reason for dropping the class would be that I am continuing to work at the company I interned for over the summer, and am taking two capstone courses (one for my major, and another for a business program I'm in) both of which are supposed to take up A LOT of time, combined with a couple of other difficult classes. If I dropped this class I could put more effort into those, which are supposed to be very helpful with getting jobs if you put the work into them (they are both project based). I would also be able to move some gened/elective requirements I have in the spring semester (currently also packed)  to the fall as well, so I wouldn't just be taking one class. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I am leaning towards dropping the class, but staying at University an extra semester is obviously a pretty big deal, so I'm waffling a little. I put together a pros and cons list to try to help. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pros

\- Bring grades up 

\-Focus more on capstone projects 

\-Less stressful time during the rest of college 

\-I can fit in another Internship over the summer to help with career decisions

\-I know some people who will still be here as well, so I'll still have people I'm friends with in the area

&amp;#x200B;

Cons

\- I'll have to spend a whole extra semester at college before getting a job

\- I won't graduat with a lot of the people I've gone through college with 

\- I'll have more debt after college 

\- I won't have the group I have now to work/study with 

\-I worry that other people (potentially future employers) would look down on graduating late

I'm facing anxiety, stress, emptiness, and other negative emotions/feelings that can be drawn out from this post. Why? I simply feel overwhelmed. For one, I am in a major that I'm not even sure I want to take on. Civil Engineering was just from a whim, there is no exact ""foundation"" or strong reasoning behind it. I enjoyed building things in games, that's simply it. I've had no experience with real life civil engineering (except for having volunteered for Habitat for Humanity last weekend, something I'll talk about later.) Likewise, I'm in a relatively prestigious college. It isn't an Ivy college, but it's definitely one of the best engineering institutions in the state and possibly in the nation. I come from a small city, particularly an impoverished one. My school barely had any AP classes for me to take, I couldn't take on dual enrollment because I had no way to do it (transportation, but I probably could have carpooled with someone. I regret this decision for sure, but I felt like it was too much of a hassle, which is also a terrible mindset.) I was able to graduate as Salutatorian, I enjoyed High School and experienced moderate levels of stress and anxiety here and there. I applied for this college, got wait-listed twice and was finally able to be conditionally admitted due to my position as a salutatorian (something my college does for in-state students). This makes me feel like I was the wrong person for them to admit, and that I was only able to be admitted based on some sort of handicap.   


At this point, I had two weeks left of summer before I headed out for their summer program, which was the conditional part of my admission to the college. It was a great experience where I took three classes that were relatively basic (english, an introductory class, and an elective) and had no tests/quizzes/exams. They were solely based on light homework and projects. It was an overall easy ride, so I thought I'd be fine come fall. This all came crumbling down by the first week. Now, I'm taking five classes: two maths (calc 1, linear alg.), chemistry, history, and english. I've been swamped with work and information from the get-go.  In particular, calculus was out worldly for me. My high school didn't offer anything like calculus, only pre-cal which was during my junior year. I came into the college with only one AP credit under my name, while everyone else comes from richer and better equipped schools. As such, I have no friends that I know from before. I only know my room mates and some of the people on my floor, though I work hard to maintain these limited relations. Because of this, I feel out of place both academically and socially. I'm a shy person and often times people are already in their own cliques and I feel too isolated to try to approach anyone. It's something I know I can overcome, but I'm not sure if it's something I can find myself doing just yet in this troubled state of mind.  


Back to academics, I feel underprepared and so far behind. Everyone else seems to be understanding what the lectures for calculus are about, while I'm here stumped and trying to read up and do these homework assignments in pure confusion. With the demands and expectations from the other classes, I am left with no time to really ""be myself"". I'm up late at night trying to finish homework and do my readings/studying. I know I can step back and take a break, but I feel like if I do that, I'll fall behind even more. It's like a neverending race to me, one where I'm left mentally and emotionally broken. I have taken some breaks, like volunteering with Habitat for Humanity (which was on a weekend, where I had to wake up very early). I enjoyed it, but I came back to my dorm and had to go straight back to work.  


I've talked to many of my close friends (most of them online as I'm too afraid of talking to some of my close friends from high school) and my brother. They offered lots of advice that have helped me stabilize, but this would only last for fleeting moments. They've told me to continue on, that the degree will be well-worth it. But they also told me that if it doesn't work out, then it simply doesn't. College might not be for everyone, they say.. but is there much an option for me anymore? I've been thinking about several options outside of college, but I'm not sure if they really offer any growth in terms of the future. Maybe that's normal since that degree truly brings in the money. But talents and bright ideas can bring in money too, I know that. But.. I don't feel like I have any talents or gifts either. All I have for me is hard work, which is what I thought brought my up to salutatorian in high school. Hard work, not smarts. I know I'm not smart and I had no expectation for being outstanding in this college, but I didn't think it'd be this bad.  


I'm sorry if this whole thing is a mess, I'm just writing down what I can think. Ultimately, I'm looking for some advice from a different perspective. The thoughts and desires of dropping out fill my mind every moment, and surely that changes my judgement from being clear. What should I do?   


I have an appointment with my academic adviser tomorrow, and maybe it would help to get some ideas/advice/perspective/etc. for this meeting. I was thinking about withdrawing from the calculus class to lighten my workload, but I'm still not sure if that'd be enough. I've been told tutors and study groups are great, but I'm not sure how to go about that yet, so it's definitely something I want to talk to my adviser about. I'm just afraid I'll do something I'll regret because my mind has just been fuddled with negative emotions. Thank you for reading this though, it feels slightly cathartic to let some of it out.

395,So I am 33 live in Texas in April after 12 years of marriage my wife asked me to move out temporarily and then proceeded to not let me see my kids and got to the point where she wouldn't talk to me and would only communicate through my father( they are both very religious and in the same church) I still give her 2k a month. We are not legally separated or anything. I am just wondering what legal action is available or if any one has advice on how to proceed from here. The reason she asked me to move out was that she viewed my occasional use of porn as the same as cheating on her.,29Aug2018,9
396,"[NSFW] -ish.

I met my ex on Tinder and we eventually got into a relationship that lasted a long time, but the love between us eventually faded away so I broke up with her about 4 months ago or so. We both went our way and there wasn’t any problems about it. 

Just recently I got back into dating apps trying to see if I could score a date. Eventually I came across a single milf (she just hit 43) and she offered to have sex with me without any sort of commitment (I’m 20). I thought to myself, “well why not? I missed the sex in a way so it was a good way to relieve some stress.” We do our first encounter and we have sex, and both enjoy it. Now, we set up for a second encounter and decide to do it again. During the second encounter, in the middle of the sex, I felt this ethical side of me just hit me hard. There I was, having sexual intercourse with someone twice my age. It disgusted me and made me feel uncomfortable, and disappointed in myself. I know I’m not an ugly person, so I really could have waited to build another relationship with someone else of my age. So I told her that I was done for this encounter and we went our way. 

Now, driving back home made me think about it all again. Made me feel disgust at myself. I can only think about any future relationship, what am I gonna do? Am I supposed to tell my future partner that this happened in my sexual life? Am I supposed to keep it to myself forever? I don’t mind having it in my head, but I don’t know how I’d feel about my partner knowing or not knowing I did such a thing.

Sorry for the rant. At least so far I can share it here on reddit with you guys under a random username.",29Aug2018,3
397,"Hi there,
not a surprise that working life is different to your easy and fun student life. I get it and except that for the most part. What I think is bothering me is not being around life energy charged people and - I got to be honest - opposite sex's attention, which was always a confidence booster to me. Anybody can relate to it or has an idea of where and what to look for? Important to mention is that I am not willing to have family and kids, at least for now.

So I’m 17 and about to start my junior year of high school on Tuesday. What’s making me so nervous is that I was in a head on car accident over the summer that shattered both of my legs. They put rods and pins in both legs and casted them both from my toes to my upper thighs. Of course I’m in a wheelchair.

I’m afraid that everybody will stare at me and come up and ask me what happened since I’m gonna be in a wheelchair with two gigantic casts. I’m afraid that some people might even laugh at me. And I’ve got a little chubby cause I’ve been stuck in a wheelchair all summer and that’s bothering me too.

They think by mid to late October I should be out of my casts and walking with a walker but that seems like such a long time away. I’m not sure how I’m gonna make it. They don’t hurt much anymore and I’m used to getting around and going to the bathroom and everything. But it’s what I’ll look like that bothers me.

So will everybody really stare and laugh? Has anybody else been through something similar? Any general tips? Thanks.",29Aug2018,1
401,"My sister is in grad School and she is set to Graduate in Spring 2019. Her school requires her to take a comprehensive exam and clear it in order to secure the degree.According to the program guidelines, the exam is offered **only** the final semester for the student and is offered on a **single day, each semester.**

Unfortunately, earlier this year in March 2018, my sister and I lost our parents in a car accident. Our parents used to live in India and as a part of religious customs, both of us have to go to India after 1 year since they passed away. The problem is that the days we are required to be in India clashes with the day the comprehensive exam is offered by my sister's school.When she spoke to the exam coordinator, she was hoping they would accommodate one of the two options

# 1 Have her take the exam this Fall -

*There's a course requirement to be met for the comprehensive exam and she is taking the last course that meets the requirement this Fall*.The coordinator was blunt and said that was against **""policy""**.​

# 2 Accommodate the request to have her take the comprehensive exam on an alternate date in Spring 2019.

The coordinator said my sister was being **selfish** and that they cannot either reschedule the exam  for one person, nor make an alternate question paper just for her at an alternate date.

I'd like to add that he was rude and asked my sister to come back when she could *""manage""* herself, after she started crying while talking to him. I'm clueless on what my options are here. Please advise.

403,"TL;DR: best friends with girl for three years, met her in person first time last summer, went back this summer, some fucked up shit went down with her family and i, now we’re drifting and i don’t know what to do about it. 

judging by everything that’s happened here, i’m assuming this is going to be a long post, so bear with me. 
on july 3, 2015, i became internet friends with a girl whom i will refer to as savannah. savannah and i got closer and closer, and she became my best friend and reason for living. she gave me hope and was all i had in this world, and we laughed together so much and so hard because of all our stupid inside jokes. fast forward two years to when i was fifteen, my mom and her dad have made arrangements for us to meet in person. i fly across the country by myself, stay with her for a few weeks, then she and i flew down south by ourselves for a family reunion. everything was great. she flew home, and things went back to how they were: texting all night, laughing to tears on facetime, crying when the other cried.
then, this summer, my mom told me she got me a plane ticket to go see savannah again. i was to stay there for three weeks. it was so much fun, savannah and i went on a road trip, and we went to build a bear and we went wandering and pulled over so we could pick flowers. after the first week, which was spent at her moms house, savannah and i were going to go to her dads house, and he would then take us to florida for a vacation. 
big problem: her dad isn’t a very nice person. his girlfriend is much worse, and she was going along with us too. she was bearable at first—just the occasional rude comment or glare in my direction—but when we got to florida, she cornered me in a hotel room while savannah and her dad were outside. she yelled at me for about fifteen to twenty minutes about how my friends dad wanted to send me home that morning, and she was ready to send me home that night. she was apparently done with all my attitude, although i had given her none, because i knew that even if i respond with the same amount of respect i receive, i’ll always end up being the bad guy. she yelled st me for not helping her carry her suitcase around the airport (she said it was 40 lbs; i saw her weigh it, it was 30) even though i had my own suitcase (which actually was 40 lbs) and a bag to carry. she yelled because when we all got to the rental car, i asked savannah if she wanted help loading the suitcases into the back of the car. she said no, so i rolled her the suitcases. apparently, that was the wrong thing to do. apparently i should help even if i’m told they don’t want help. i should automatically know when that woman needed help, i should just automatically know that she has a headache even when she doesn’t say anything about it. i’m used to being in an environment where if people want help, they ask for it. they don’t expect people to figure it out themselves. i’d been holding doors for her and saying please and thank you, and i didn’t think anything of it when she didn’t respond, because i don’t expect anything in return for doing things like that. i don’t do it for the thank yous, i do it because it’s a little thing i can do to help someone out. turns out, she never heard any of them, which by extension makes me a liar when i told her that i did say please and thank you and hold doors for her. 
i made an extra big effort to help her with things after that, even when i had my own shit to carry. she would glare at me and make mean comments, and i would try to start conversations with her and offer to help in any way i could. 
we were down by a pool, and savannah and i went off to do our own thing, and went back to the wicked witch of the midwest. i asked if she had fun; she just snapped, “im fine.” she glared at me the whole day. savannah went over to get a towel, and i didn’t know what was going on at all but i went to help anyway because i didn’t want things to get worse, and the witch said “why are you going with her? she’s just going right there to get one thing. you don’t need to be with her all the time.” by that point i’d already had my mom book me a plane ticket home early so i could leave. i was having panic attacks and crying myself to sleep at night again, when i’d made so much progress with my mental health. it’s like she just sucked my well being right out of me. so, after she said that to me, i said something along the lines of “jesus christ, i didn’t know, i was just going to see if she needed help. and we both know you would’ve gotten mad at me if i didn’t offer to help, so.” 
she would talk shit about me to their friends, make a point of only thanking savannah if both she and i helped her with something, and at one point she even lied and told some people i was her daughter. 
savannah and i both hold the elevator door for her? she says “thank you, savannah.” and glares at me. we both help her carry something to the hotel room? “thank you, savannah.”
i was done with her shit, to be honest. so i offered to help savannah and her dad, and make a point of not helping the bitch. passive aggressive, i know, but it was nothing compared to what she’d been doing to me. 
i left the next day. i got accused of doing so without saying goodbye. i did say goodbye, and i know damn well she and savannah’s dad heard me because they responded. what came next was a string of cruel text messages from savannah’s dad. he tried to diagnose me with borderline personality disorder, even though he is in no way qualified to do so and knows next to nothing about me. he told me they had a great rest of their trip without me, that i treated savannah poorly, and that i twisted everything that happened. 
i don’t let people talk to me like that. i stood up for myself. i stood my ground. 
that led to savannah being mad at me. we’ve since made up, but there’s underlying tension and we’re drifting apart. 
how can i get things back to normal?",29Aug2018,0
404,"Hey guys, I’m pretty new on Reddit and i’m loving it, so i decided to ask a question that is probably a big thing for a lot of us out there trying to make a living out of sport.

I am 25 y old and i’ve been training, competing in Kickboxing for about 8 years, before i moved to USA, and just couple years ago i entered the scene of MMA. Fast forward to today i’m 3-0 in MMA and the guys I’ve fought were not even near my level, so it’s time to move on to another level. I’ve been looking at it like a video game, you win you go to next level and you keep doing until you reach the max level or you win the game in this case make a decent living out of it. 

Now the trick is that in order for me go to a next level of fighting it is recommended for me to go to a lower weight division which is 155lbs. (I compete at 170lbs) and i walk around 180lbs.
I am very serious about this and i need help, financially, i have a full time job that I don’t want to do, and i can’t quit because i have to make money, because fights are not providing enough at this level so I cannot afford to full time train at this moment, so it makes it hard for me to cut down 25-30 pounds, which is why i compete at 170lbs

What can I possibly do, so i can afford to train twice a day, have time to rest and recover, and be able to afford healthy and expensive food and supplements?

Note that do i do not have a sponsor, gym i train at is not on a high level in MMA, we are lacking a lot of things, even people to work with. And i do not have a management team

Should i consider moving to a place that has good MMA gyms like arizona california nevada etc leaving this gym behind and taking that risk, or should i stay and build my self and my professional score slowly here? Note that guys from around here that leave state and go to fight on bigger promotion get their ass whooped (which tells me that folks out there are a lot more serious). 

Thank you everyone, i am sorry for this long text i hope someone out there have been in a similar situation and will understand the struggle.

405,"Let me provide a bit of background really quick.  So at the beginning of my senior year, my family had to move to a new state because my dad got a new job.  I was allowed to stay and complete that year of school.  I went home over the summer and I’m not back for college to be closer to my friends.  

Here’s the problem, the place I’ve “chosen” (or rather, was the place I could afford to live) to live is giving me anxiety.  I live and am renting from the friend of a friend.  I assumed the anxiety I’m feeling is just due to living in a new place.  I was just starting to get over it when I come home from class and the woman I’m renting from (who already gave me weird vibes) was either asleep or passed out on the floor of her garage.  I don’t even know what to think about that other than it gives me anxiety and I want to get the hell out.  

I’m still to the point where I could drop my classes free of charge.  I haven’t gotten a job to nail me down yet, just the offer of one.  I am loving college so far, the people at the job I interviewed for seemed amAZING.  But the place I’m living, the place that I come home to after a long, hard day, gives me anxiety.

409,"Hey everyone, I am quite uncertain right now. You might say I'm insecure about my major.   
First off, I don't live in the USA and therefore have basically no chance to ever get into the notorious Silicon Valley. I live in Germany and I tell you later why that's important.   
I'm 22 years old and have already spent 1 year in college, but I didn't really do anything, because I didn't enjoy it at all. I was studying Economics and English in order to become teacher for these two. I've chosen a course which is catered toward becoming a teacher. 

Now let's get into my problem: I have time until 30.09 to decide what I will study from now on. I have decided to throw english overboard, as I have literally no interest in the classes I have to attend. I started studying english because I was always good at it, not because I was interested in it. I basically read every book and watch every video in english, but I have no interest in Linguistics and that type of stuff. But let's just say english is more or less out the window.   


Now I have recently decided to switch from Teacher(Economics/English) to Teacher(Economics/Computer Science). But here is the problem.   
I don't know if I want to do CS on a teacher basis, or if I want to do raw CS. I have no flippin idea. It would be hard for me to ""just try"" raw CS and then decide later, because I already wasted an entire year. And I'm 22, so every year I lose is a problem.

So what I'm wondering is, what you guys think about it. I will give you a brief list of things I thought about concerning each course.   


CS:   
\- I would probably not get into the big CS game, like Silicon Valley, or whatnot.  
\+ I would have the opportunity to learn about AI and everything related to it   
\+ I would have the choice to either start working after Bachelors(3 years) or keep studying.

&amp;#x200B;

Teacher:   
\+ In Germany teachers are hired by the state, making them immune to getting fired, receive special benefits and in contrast to the USA a rather good salary.   
\- I wouldn't learn anything about AI or anything related to it  
\+ the holidays, shorter workdays  
\- I would have to do a Masters degree and on top of that do 2 years of ""training"" (in training teachers get about 1k a month, after the 2 years I would get \~ 3k a month net income) 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a lot more - and + points for each, but I figured I keep it brief. Otherwise nobody is gonna read all that stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR   
OP knows nobody can make the decision for him  
OP wants to know opinions on wherever he should go for a teacher career, or a CS career   
OP is fucking confused about it   
OP is scared of the math that comes along with raw CS   
OP needs help

414,"I had a very emotional breakup with a guy that I was in love with. He was going through some mental health issues (anxiety) and he basically said he couldn’t do a relationship at the time. I respected his decision. He seemed really broken up about it too and the breakup hurt me A LOT. 

He’s the dumper though, to put it simply. 

I couldn’t eat or sleep. I tried to keep myself occupied in every way (gym, etc)  but was quite emotional. I feel like he feels the same and may even regret what he did, but I know it’s objectively not healthy for us to be together. I do wonder if it was a ‘cop out’ but my intuition tells me it was not. 

I had sex with a friend of mine bc I thought it would help me move on but ended up crying during it...it was a mess. It was horrid. Terrible idea, obviously. I really missed my ex. 

I’m so scared that he’ll change his mind and...maybe I might even consider it but I wonder if I’ve sabotaged everything. It’s been 2 months or so. I feel sick. 

I will probably be running into him in a few weeks for some friends  related get togethers.

418,"So my mum just came into my room and read me a message she got from my ex best friends mum: dear Sarah,
Could I am a monkey help persuade Amy to go to (schools name) for sixth form. I’m worried she will mess up her life otherwise.

So the back ground: my ex best friend is the most toxic person you can imagine. She was in my friendship group but would ditch us when it was good for her, guilt trip us when she wanted, force us to do things through emotional abuse. It is because of her, I think, that I developed anxiety, depression and started self harming. She went off the rails around 14, lost her virginity to an 18 year old (willingly) and showed off about it. Fast forward a year and she’s had sex with more people than she can count everyone thinks she’s a slut and she thinks that’s cool. She starts mixing more and more with the wrong crowd and doing drugs. She drunk so much one night her heart stopped and she had to have her stomach pumped whilst her mum sat next to her in hospital crying. Now her dads been sent to prison for dealing drugs, her mum is desperate for her to become sensible and it’s pretty much up to me. She wants me to persuade her to come to my sixth form when she wants to go elsewhere to one with her dodgy friends. Going to the other school will cause her life to go dramatically off the rails... she will skip class and smoke, drink, do more drugs and in the end maybe end up homeless, in prison or dead. If she goes to my sixth form she will still do what she’s doing but my school is private and strict and she won’t skip class take drugs and will get a very good education and may end up going to uni. All my friends hate her too. No one in my school likes her, they all actively hate her and right now I don’t even think my school will be good for her because she won’t be happy at  all with no friends. I don’t want her to go to my school because I’m sure she will come back wanting to be my friend and I’ve suffered too much of her abuse and can’t do it anymore but i fully understand I am purely being selfish and in not doing so could be ruining her life. I understand what will happen if she goes to the other school because that’s what happened to my older brother. He ended up hooked on drugs and being out of it so much. I know how it fucks up family’s and how shit and stressful it will be for her mum if I don’t do this for her but I just don’t know if I can because it will fuck me up... 
what should I do?

419,"I’m an 18 year old dude, generally considered by most a typical “dork”. Not super attractive,  i dont really take care of myself in terms of my appearance (frizzy hair, graphic tees, broken glasses, etc).

At the beginning of my senior year in high school i happened to become close friends with a girl who was a part of the “popular” group, out friendship never really made sense because we were from such different social groups but we didn’t really care. Anyway, imm now about to start my 2nd year of college. Since day one of being friends i’ve been head over heels for her and shes literally the only girl i can ever think about. 

But theres two issues. A) shes super attractive and way out of my league,  and i can tell shes not interested in that way, so even thinking about being romantically involved is out of the question, B) when i think about it, shes doesn’t have a lot of the traits i’d normally look for in a girl. But for some reason i’m dumb enough to hangout with her and text her all the time. I’m pretty good at hiding feelings, but recently we’ve been hanging out more often, like last night we were at our friend’s house and i think she could start to tell i liked her.

Shes very open and hooks up with a lot of guys who shes still friends with afterwards (which i think is gross and weird), she also tells me about it all the time and obviously i get uncomfortable, shes also loves drama (shes not a bitch, but she loves gossip, i hate it), and imm a prude and shes the opposite of that. Literally everything she is, i am the opposite, so on paper, i shouldn’t be into her. But i get super jealous when she talks to other guys. 

Everytime i talk or hangout with her i tell myself i shouldn’t, but i can’t help it. I don’t really know what to do or how to interpret this. ",29Aug2018,1

424,"Back in May, my bf and I were in a situation that we had to lend some very close friends (a couple) a large sum of money that we had to pull out of our asses, because ""they were absolutely broke and needed to pay rent"" and could not afford to pay for a situation that they could've easily avoided. They end up disappearing on us as summer progressed, so when July came around we decided to reach out to them (we were invited to the same group outing), stating how excited we were to see them soon. They ignored it. That was a red flag to us so we decided to share this incident with our group who were all wondering, where are so-and-so and why haven't they been around? It was eerily suspicious. As summer went on, our friends noticed them posting on social media (i.e., Facebook and Twitter which we both don't really use) about them going on trips/concerts/getting overseas tickets/affording a new apartment with a pretty hefty down payment. So of course, it raised the question in all of us: where are they getting this money that they stated they couldn't get until November for my bf and I? Because it seemed like they were spending thousands more than what we lent to them, and they also make thousands more in a month compared to us. That was simply all we discussed, nothing else. And all this time, I grew to notice one major thing: the girl was ignoring/avoiding me and definitely subtweeting absurd things--you can imagine how confused I felt at this point.

I decided to confront the girl because she's my close friend, so why should there be this awkward unresolved tension between us after I tried helping her out? I told her that while I'm happy they finally saved up for a new place, it was still weird seeing them go on so many trips while owing us that money that they said they wouldn't have for months. I asked why she wasn't talking to me but she would reach out to our friends saying she missed them and to see them soon. Her response was that all their flights and tickets for everything were free or paid off by her parents, and **she was avoiding me because she ""heard I was badmouthing her to our friends.""** I was baffled at this point, still confused and overlooking the first question she answered. Our friends have not even contacted her besides responding that they miss her too. Nor did they have anything against her, we were all just questioning their actions over the summer. So it definitely made me question where she heard that assumption from or if she just created it in her head.

So back to my question: what do you guys consider bad mouthing to be? Were my actions of simply sharing this incident with others in our friend group considered bad mouthing, or am I just overthinking on a false statement that she said for me to feel guilt? Sorry if I sound really naive right now, I've never been told anything like that in my life so clearly I am feeling some typa way lol. I'm generally a really nice girl, this is the most drama I've ever dealt with before. I just wanna know if I did something wrong, so I can take this as a learning experience.

**tl;dr: is it bad mouthing on my part if I was sharing truthful concerns to others about someone who may have been dishonest with me?** 

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. - the girl's bf told someone in our friend group that he had been working over time &amp; picking up side jobs just to pay for their vacations... so my gut feeling that she was lying to me turned out to be true. Trust your instincts, guys lol",29Aug2018,2
425,"For the last year I've been recording most calls I have, largely for the purpose of notetaking (if I need to factcheck something or forget I just check the recording) and in a couple cases to hold a business accountable to what they said and later try rolling back on.  The latter was not intent though it just turned out to be an accidental ""perk"".

Anyway I have a childhood friend in prison, and he calls me sometimes.  Nothing criminal is discussed, I'm not a criminal and whatever you want to think about him for being in prison he isn't that dumb either.  Anyway the prison call service is on its own pay system, you have to set up an account with them for autocharge and everything.  Anyway I went back to doublecheck something that was mentioned during the account setup call, and I noticed whenever I spoke it was recorded, but whenever the employee spoke the recording just registered it as robotic noise.  The rest of my recordings with other people have been fine since that, so it wasn't because a software glitch or anything.  To further ensure this I recorded a conversation I had with my friend in prison, and same thing there, when I spoke it recorded me but when he spoke it was robotic noise on the recording instead of anything he was saying.  I had to call back into the prison phone system to talk to an employee about something else and again checked the recording after this, same thing.

Any idea why a prison would use technology to deny recordings from the end of ""outsiders""?

431,"Hello there. There is something that has been concerning me for quite some time, but only recently I have been starting to consciously fully realize it. Whenever I start to get angry or really focused towards an activity, I flex my jaw and hold my teeth together in this kinda hateful mimic. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not quite sure what to think of it but I've noticed it mostly when being either actually angry or hating a person previously in my life or in harmless situations, for example playing with my cat or dogs. While I'm playing and the games get quite heated up, I get in this focused state and I grin my teeth together and flex my jaw of almost ""now I have to do bad"" way, where I feel like I should start doing something more aggressive. It's like my brain is trying to make me go on and do more even if it's not right thing to do, but as I catch myself on that, I stop and realize.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was younger, a kid, I only noticed it after I've done some of the more aggressive things  but it's an automatic reaction I catch myself doing. Could there be an underlying issue for this or maybe it's completely normal? And no, I'm not grinding my teeth back and forth, it's just a really flexed and ""biting my teeth"" motion. ",29Aug2018,1
432,"I’ve been lonely and alone pretty much all my life. Never really had anyone I could call a best friend or anything of the sorts; I’ve pretty much only had close friends. I guess it’s pretty hard for me to find people who I enjoy being with and have a lot in common (also I’m an introvert). I knew I would probably never find love because of the nature of who I am but I always wanted at least one person I could call a best friend.

About two years ago, I met the most amazing person I had ever met and built some great memories together. He was the only person I could really ever be myself with. The problem was, I started catching feelings for him, and these feelings only got stronger and stronger. He became the most important person in my life along with my mother. 

I thought I’d he fine, though. We had so many exciting things planned out; we were gonna go on many adventures, we were gonna move in together, and I was gonna help him put his life back in order; we needed eachother. Our future sounded very exciting and I thought being his best friend would be enough. But then the pain was too much. He blew me off in favor of girls and I just had to sit back and cry in pain.

I tried putting distance between us so that we could drift away (I could never confess my feelings for him because I didn’t want to put him through that). As hard as that was, I gave it all my energy; I even fabricated problems out of nowhere to make him not like me. Problem was that I was his best friend and one of the most important people in his life. He couldn’t let me go.

Essentially, I was backed into a corner; I could not bare the pain anymore; I had to tell him how I felt so that he could understand that we needed to part ways. It was the ultimate sacrifice for both of our sakes. Thing is, this is a critical point in his life where he needed me the most; he needed my help and now I can’t be there for him. I can’t be there for him because in order for me to help him, I need to be happy, not a slump in pain. I even tried sacrificing my own well being so that I could be there for him and I just couldn’t do it; the pain made me useless and not being able to help him caused me even more pain.

Anyways, when I told him how I felt, he rejected me. It was the expected outcome and I don’t blame him. But, he wants to remain my best friend but I just don’t think I can deal with the pain anymore. Just looking at him and knowing that I can’t hold him destroys me on the inside. We need to go our separate ways so that I can heal.

I also don’t think I’ll ever find someone quite like him ever again (you’re probably thinking, that’s how love works, but no, not in my case, this was the first time I’ve met someone like this and it took VERY long). I feel like I will never find love and like I will never have another friend like him. Again, I’m not exaggerating, I’m a person with very peculiar tastes, high standards, and probably not a huge price myself. I have good reason to believe what I believe.

I don’t blame him for any of my pain, it’s not his fault that he’s straight and that he doesn’t feel the same way. He’s not at fault that my love/social life is a failure. With that being said, I still want to talk to him and ask him for advice. I want tell him how I’m feeling and ask what he would do, because he was also my best friend and the only person I had that I could talk to; but I don’t want to put him through any more problems or make him feel guilty. I feel like I have to bottle in all these emotions; I have no one to talk to and no one to help me feel better.

Letting go of him is probably the smart thing to do. But I don’t know if I can do it; I want to be happy but I don’t think I can be with or without him in my life. I want my best friend more than anything in the world right now, but I feel like I need to try to get over him before bringing him back into my life; I don’t know if I can get over him while he’s in my life...

I really don’t know what to do... Right now, I feel so hopeless and lost; I keep crying and I can’t get out of bed. It wasn’t so much the rejection that’s causing me to hurt so much, but the hopelessness I feel right now. He was pretty much everything I had and now I have no one to talk to and no one I can be myself and have fun with. I feel, empty, alone, and in despair; I feel like my life has no meaning, like I am destined to be alone. I want to find someone to love, but I’ve been looking for many years without even getting close. I have nothing to look forward to in the future now that our plans are out the window. I don’t feel like I have anyone I can cry to for help and honestly, I’m afraid. This is the loneliest I have ever felt and I don’t think I’ve ever felt this much pain in my life.

437,"**Backstory**

Let me start off with that I've had some set backs in life. I've struggled with Bipolar depression, ADHD, and PTSD (I no longer suffer with PTSD due to successful therapy) I dropped out of high school due to family problems, BP and bullying. Spent 4 years doing unproductive things that lead me no where. In those 4 years I moved out at 17, lived on my own in a low income area of SC with an abusive ex boyfriend. I did that for 3 years until a traumatic incident happened that forced me to move back in with my parents. I developed PTSD and sever social anxiety. I didn't leave the house (unless i absolutely had to) for around 11 months due to fear. The next year I met someone who I thought was right for me but wasn't. Ended up emotionally abusing and manipulating me, gas lighting and using my traumatic experience against me. After I found the strength I ended that relationship. I spent the next 7 months building myself up and becoming more self-aware. Learning who I am, forgiving myself, and learning to love myself. 

**Current problem**

Over the past month or two I've discovered what I want to go to college for. Which is either to become a Recreational Therapist or a College professor in psychology. I **adore** learning about psychology. Learning how our minds tick and what chemicals make them tick. I love learning about mental aliments. How lower levels of certain chemicals can completely throw you off mentally. It makes me incredibly happy to learn these things and better help my friends and family even strangers. I want to pursue this dream so badly. The thing that holds me back is my self-doubt. I'm 22 years old and I don't even have my high school diploma or GED. I have passed all 3 subjects, math is the only one left. ( I am terrible at math it's laughable.)  The career's i'm interested in all requires you to be in school for around 4-8 years or to have a Masters or PhD. I'm anxious that i'm too late. That this is something I should have pursued when I got out of high school.

&amp;#x200B;

**To sum it up**

I'm 22, about to get my GED, is it too late to be dreaming this big of going to college for 4-8 years to possibly pursue a masters degree?  Facing self- doubt. Looking for reassurance / possible validation of feelings.  ",29Aug2018,0
438,"I'll start off with some back ground about the people and ourselves. My husband [23] and I [21] have been married four months now, but been together for three years. He's just about to start college, and we are both currently looking for work. We live with his family and have been for a year now, his father [59], disabled step mother [64], and sister [15]. His step mother has many issues. She can't walk well on her own, she has to have a walker, breathing problems, and a slew of other medical issues as well as being elderly. His father is also getting high in age. He is much better at handling himself and still works, however his age is wearing him down and he too has health issues. His sister is very unreliable even as a kid with behavioral issues. 

Now, my mother in law and I get along great, until we just don't. Some days are good, other days she's harsh, unfair, treats me like a slave, and just all around expects incredibly too much out of me for the age I am. I have taken the role of a mother, a caregiver, and maid. I'm very exhausted most of the time, I feel like I don't have time for my husband and myself.

She mumbles things under her breath often and is very petty. She goes out of her way to pick apart things she doesn't like and enjoys drama. That's the bad parts of her. The good parts include that she can be caring and passionate. She has helped my husband and I out many times in the past and paid for things she didn't need to. I'm forever grateful for her generosity, however I feel like it's another strategy to keep us around because of her back and forth kindness and attitude. It's unfortunate I feel this way about some who I'm close to, but the events that lead me to this are very blunt. Her yelling when things are not done her way, her patronizing, and the classic I will only buy you what I want not what you need or specifically like. I mentioned she can't walk, I mostly mean not a long time. She can reach the bathroom, bedrooms, etc. She can even cook, clean, and other things. She is not immobile by any means.

As for the rest of the family, his father loves us and cares for us. He paid for my husband's GED, welcomed us into his home, and has been incredibly supportive. He needs our help around here as well as his wife does. I'm thankful for all their help. He has told us time and time again that he just wants us to succeed and I truly believe it. 

As of late, my best friend [24] from my childhood has told me there's two job positions that could be coming up at her job soon that she could easily put us on because she's higher up. She also told me we are more than welcome to live with her since she has her own car, house, and everything. She is completely independant and opened her home to us so we can begin building our life while we save up staying with her. She's a very dependable person and has helped me out when we were younger with my family issues, we we're quite poor growing up. So I fully believe her when she tells me she has something and that she has no issues. 

The problem is that these two places are two hours away. I wouldn't be able to check in on our current family. If I leave I won't be coming back for awhile, and that will crush them. They depend on us fully now, even though we aren't going anywhere and have zero income except for government assistance. I want to be able to support myself and my husband and build a life. But I know if we break the news, his step mother will be crushed, angry, petty, and most likely furious. She will guilt me, use her disability, and tell me, ""how will she go on without us?"". It's very hard for me to hear because I care about them. They do need help. But I'm also young, I want my own family one day, and I want to be something. I'm scared to hurt the people who have helped us so much, but I don't know what to do for myself or husband. 

TL;DR- Husband and I live with his family that includes disabled mom, older father, and teenager. We have most of all the responsibilities in the home and help with every. We have a job opportunity that is 2 hours away. It will crush and hurt the family we are with if we go. Not sure what to do. ",29Aug2018,1
439,"For a bit of bg info: I'm 29, and currently living with my parents. I moved into become my mom's live-in caregiver (yes, she actually needs me and will have a home care aide once I'm gone) about a year ago, as I'd be able to live relatively rent free - I pitch in on cable, buy some of my own food, and pay my own cell bill, slowly paying off debt, etc with money from occasional freelancing. Not enough to ever save, but enough to subsist, somewhat.
I started a new job (as a caregiver, shocker!), and will receive my first check mid September. Mid September, I start school, and will receive financial aid, in addition to student loans (I hope!). During the times I'm in class, it turns out her insurance will cover a home care aide to assist her, 60hrs a month. 

Here's the issue. I'm in a decent amount of debt still (5k or so). I've been working on paying it off, but my credit score is trashed. The debt is credit card based, and not that it matters to potential landlords, but for anyone curious, it was incurred during a medical hardship, when I needed to pay for gas, food, power, water, etc, while I was unable to work enough hours. The situation went from bad to worse when I was fired for my inability to deliver results (a way to shift blame when it amounted to my attendance and medical issues. I did not have accommodations in place for my medical issues because I'm an idiot). 
My parents moving to the area coincided with my struggles coming to a head, and it made sense to move in and help my mom while I stabilized myself. 
So far, it's been okay. However, since I started my job and talking about eventually moving in with my partner (we've been together for almost 5mo, and are in the stages of loosely planning a future together) every little argument gets blown out of proportion, and ends with her shouting about me finding someplace else to live if it's so unbearable (which I've never said it was unbearable). She has even taken to calling me ungrateful for her and my father's financial assistance (it was offered by them, asked not to be repaid by them, and was told to me by them that it wasn't a big deal, they were happy to help, etc) during the previously mentioned medical hardship, over the course of our disagreements. She has told me that I'm unpleasant to be around - when I point out she seems to be the only one that thinks so, I'm told that I'm wrong, there are lots of people that think so (hinting heavily at my sibling, which I know isn't true) that I alienate my friends and family from me, and when I ask who, she ""isn't going to play this game with me, anymore,"" and tells me to quit speaking to her.
I get that I'm probably not as bad as she says. I get that it kind of seems like she's baiting me, likely because she's upset or scared at being left by the only caregiver she has ever known (20yrs and counting as an on again off again ""little helper"" to eventually becoming a CNA to better assist her), in return for a (qualified) stranger's help (she's terrified of this). 
And I do my best to help as much as I can, have already offered to pay up some late bills when I get my financial aid, etc. I don't think I've come off as ungrateful, but I could be mistaken. So I've kind of been in this weird headspace over the course of the last month where I've gone back and forth, wondering if I'm ungrateful/hard to be around, and fearing I'll stop being a positive thing in my partner's life once we live together, that maybe there are these negative qualities that will come out when we're together, and my partner just hasn't seen them yet. 


*TLDR;* I work from home for my mom most of the time, in return for relatively rent free living.  My credit score is screwed but I'm paying off my debt (5k left) as quickly as I'm able, with a new job. I'm about to start school, and if I find I'm able to balance work and school well enough, I'll be considering moving in with my partner sometime between Nov and Jan, if possible (credit score, bills etc). I'd move in with them sooner, but I'd like to do so when I'm sure I'm able to, and because we want that fully, not because I'm afraid/not feeling happy with my current living situation, and my partner is looking to help me solve that (they have offered!).


*I guess my questions are:

In the meantime, how can I bring up my credit score as quickly as possible, so that when I'm prepared to move into a place with my partner, I'll be able to without much issue?*
(I do have one credit card still open that will reflect positively on my score, that I pay monthly on - I maintain a balance of less than 35% of it's limit (financial advice on raising my score from a credit card employee), and two in collections that I'll have paid off within two months of this new job.)

*How can I best handle the recent fighting and toxicity long enough to move out?* 
My plan is to ""lay low"" by going to school, working as much as I can, and hanging out in my room as much as possible, while still keeping it friendly at home. Advice on avoiding falling into arguments, when a parent uses emotional tactics, is appreciated. ",29Aug2018,1

So, my mum recently got added into a group chat with all the people she used to attend school with and she was constantly glued to it and started talking to a guy (let’s refer to him as x) out of the group chat. She would always be talking to him, at first about their families and partners. He’s married with kids, my mum is married with kids. They talked, a lot. Today I was using my mums phone when messages from him started coming through, I tried to swipe away the notifications but accidentally clicked on them opening the WhatsApp app and their conversations. 
There was a LOT of messages. Sexual messages, them talking in depth about how they wanted to sleep together, telling each other they loved each other, real deep conversations. 
I am so bad with my feelings so I just put the phone down and went back to my room after she saw I was on her phone and got really secretive and protective of it and demanded I gave it back. 
I am in total shock and don’t know what to do? Do I tell my dad? Do I leave it be and let her carry on?

445,"  

I apologize in advance for this being such a long read, I am in desperate need of advice and I would really appreciate any advice on our situation. Thank you in advance!

So, let me provide a little bit of backstory, my girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years and we have always had a healthy relationship, never had a fight, always communicated openly, put each other first constantly, etc. She had a very rough upbringing, physically abusive father who she has a restraining order against, emotionally abusive toxic mother. She has always suffered from severe anxiety. 

We have lived together for 2 years, have planned our futures out together, including marriage and a family, we’re all we’ve ever wanted. Being full time college students as well as working full time has really taken a toll on us and over summer things began to change. I got really down for about a month (June-July), become tired of feeling how I felt and made a change to live a healthier life, not just for myself but for my girlfriend as well. This is where things started going downhill. In mid-July, my girlfriend’s anxiety peaked, I suppose we can say. She had started to become cold, not wanting any affection, being very moody, I assumed it was stress catching up to her, as well as taking summer courses and not having a break. 

About a week into her being this way, I ask her to go for a walk, because she absolutely loves walks and she declines, which is when I realize how serious this issue is. She finally agrees, we go for a walk and talk and she explains that she no longer enjoys doing anything that she used to (standard characteristic of depression), she tells me that she never feels like she can breathe, she randomly gets angry throughout the day, and just wants to be locked in a room alone with sad music on. After talking for a while I recommended that maybe she needs to change things up and go to her mother’s to sleep and relax for a few days, I could take care of the apartment and our cat (Her mother was very toxic to her growing up, they’ve been working on a relationship and she hasn’t been as terrible.) 

She agrees to stay at her parents for a few days, but when she comes back things are even worse. Colder than ever, if I try to comfort her or support her I am pushed away, when I look at her she’s not there anymore, it’s like she’s dead inside. 

The night she came back, she was very upset and angry, I offered to sleep in our spare room because she said that she needs to be alone, she agreed and I spent the night away from her. This has been hard on me for obvious reasons, and seeing the person you love with all of your heart change in this way is painful and when you’re trying to help, but nothing works, you kind of lose your mind. She saw what this situation has been doing to me so we sat down talked and we discussed taking a break from our relationship. Neither of us wanted to lose the other but we agreed it’s not healthy for us to currently live like this.

She says that she can’t take care of herself right now, so she can’t give me what I need in a partner, and that she’s failed me as a girlfriend and friend. 

So our senior year of college has begun and we have been sleeping in different rooms for the past week, she doesn’t want to do anything besides lay in her room. We still walk to campus together, eat together, talk (less than we used to), like best friends, but obviously being on a break there’s no affection, etc. 

I love this girl with everything I have. We’ve always been each other’s rock and biggest support system, we’ve been best friends since we started dating, and neither of us have had an issue with the other at all. She says that it’s not a relationship issue it’s a personal issue. I hate not being with her, but I hate seeing her like this even worse. If letting her go meant she would get better, I would have to let her go (even though that isn’t the case, just explaining how her well-being is more important to me than my own feelings). 

What I’m asking for here is advice on what to do. What can I do to help her? What can she do to start feeling better? What should we do as a relationship? Literally any advice or comments are welcomed, I’ve tried everything and I just really need some help. Thank you for taking the time to read this!",29Aug2018,1
446,"My co-worker, we shall call her ""Beth"", is seemingly unhappy that I have returned from to work after my maternity leave. This is my first week back on the job, and she has said all of two words to me over the course of three days - ""Welcome back.""  

Some back-story, my department at work was looking to hire another position, and she was an internal employee that applied for it. I advocated for her to join our department, because she has a great work ethic; but she has such a piss poor attitude when it comes to working with other people that I was not aware of.  

I trained her; and during training, she would go to my (now our) supervisor, and say that she was overwhelmed by the amount of daily tasks, steps, etc. that needed to be done each day. I told her many times that while it's a lot of information, this is a department that works together, and she doesn't have to do everything by herself. She would just nod and say ""OK"". Never mentioned any concerns during training when I asked if she had any; yet she would say the aforementioned to my supervisor. That should have been my first clue in that she doesn't know how to communicate. This brings me to the issue at hand.  

While I was on maternity leave, things changed in terms of what I now could and could no longer do. I work with patients, and there are five different clinical groups. Each person in my department is assigned to one of the four clinical groups as their own - Beth has two groups, I have two, and my other co-worker has one. While helping each other out in times of need is encouraged, it was decided that each person monitor their own groups without interference from the others in the department. Fine. Drawing a hard line there. Well, that line, in my opinion, is not beneficial to a cohesive working environment; and, to me, it doesn't seem like my supervisor knows how to create a comfortable working relationship between the two of us.  

Beth likes to do everything herself. When I attempt to help her, I either a) get an earful from my supervisor about how Beth would like me to stop, because she likes to know what's going on with her patients' accounts, or b) she gives me the silent treatment after sending me an e-mail saying, ""thanks, but no thanks."".  

It seems like everything I used to do to try to make the day run smoother (ex. handing her the paperwork for her patients, adding all the newly admitted patients to the reports, or following up on a phone call for her) just makes her more irritated by me, because I've been talked to by my supervisor about all of these things.

My first week of being back from leave has been trying, to say the least, because Beth won't even look at me when I'm in the room; and she comes off as irritated every time I talk.  

Also, she continues to complete tasks that are my own, when it was made pretty clear to me that we are not to involve ourselves in another patient's account if it's not assigned to us.  

I also failed to mention today's petty complaint that I put the new patient paperwork on my other co-worker's desk and not her desk, and I was questioned by my supervisor why I did that. Seriously?!

TL;DR: My co-worker complains about me to my supervisor for dumb things (like, helping her); and my supervisor just wants us to all get along. I am slowly dying inside having to drive to work every day, knowing that I have to work next to someone that strives to do it all, then complains that she does it all. My co-worker will absolutely feel attacked if I try to sit down with her and talk about things. What can I do other than kill her with kindness to show not only her, but my supervisor, that I am not the problem? It's her attitude.",29Aug2018,0
447,"Last night I was in my bed and around 2am I saw lights in my room like when someone pulls into your driveway you can see the lights in your house. About a minute later the door opened and the dog barked once.

Then they got up and went to the bedroom. They didn't close the door all the way and they sat on the bed.

I’m sorry I feel like this post is probably pretty boring as far as giving advice goes. 
But I’m so lazy, and unmotivated, I not left the house in about a week. I made plans for the weekend yet I’m already thinking about flaking on them. Which is stupid cause I always enjoy it when I’m out. 

In the day time, I get up, shower, then pretty much just watch YouTube videos till the evening. Where I have a brief chat with my housemates and sit on the sofa watching Netflix with them. Until I go back up to my room and watch YouTube or Netflix till I go to sleep. 

I’ve never been very motivated, but idk usually I do a bit more. 

I’m not depressed, I know these all sound like depression symptoms. But I’m not sad. I’m just bored but also too unmotivated and lazy to do anything.

450,"Ok so, here goes the long story short.

I started a cookery course at the start of this year with my best friend “Tiana”. 

In July I dated a boy from my course named “Jay” for a month, and ended it because my feelings for him weren’t strong enough to continue the relationship. 

It is now August and we all still attend course and see each other everyday. 

And he still likes me. A lot.

But I don’t like him like that. At all.

Now we all get along in course perfectly fine. But the other night this happened;

Jay drove Tiana home after course, and he confided in her his feelings for me. He told her “I’ve genuinely never met anyone like her, she’s literally the nicest person I’ve ever met and I don’t want her out of my life” and “There’s nothing I don’t like about her, I’ve never had that before” and “I really want her back”. 

(It was really weirdly flattering to hear, but even weirder to type that up lol)

It’s been 2 months and he still feels like that towards me. I’ve already explained my feelings towards him and that there’s no chance of getting back together. 

What would you do? 
Should I just carry on and hope his feelings fade out eventually?

I have an issue though. I'm really bad with knowing my way around. I have to use a GPS everywhere I go. My family talks crap about it all the time.

It makes me upset when they say these things. I see so many people who know how to get around without relying on GPS. I honestly don't see how they do it. I don't know how to get to far distances from just memory. Without GPS, I would be lost.

So, 2 days ago I went out with a friend of mine and we stumbled upon our old group of friends, which had a couple of new people in, but we joined them and thought we would have a great time all together. Yeah, everyone seemed to have a great time except me. Don't get me wrong I'm not antisocial or anything like that, but I just froze the whole time and just kind of followed them with a beer in my hand. I don't get why I was so shy, I don't know why I couldn't speak. We had tons of things in common, yet I just couldn't talk. I am a bit introverted at times, but this was something else. Right before I leave, I kind of awkwardly said goodbye to everyone and left feeling like shit while everyone was having the time of their lives. 
Incident 2:
So, yesterday, being kinda pissed I was so bad at socializing, I challenged myself to go out and make some new friends. Found a group of people, and started socializing with them. My excuse was that I kinda knew a girl in the group. We were never friends, but she and I always had a nice hi/bye relationship. Pretty much fucked every aspect of socializing up. And to top it all of, I made a 9/11 joke which *no one* laughed at. Again, I kind of awkwardly got out of there, while still feeling shit.

Spent all day home today, and called in sick at work cause I felt like shit.

457,"This ended up being way longer than I thought I’m sorry. I think I really needed to rant. 

We’ve been friends for 10 years, we are both female in our mid twenties. We met in college and both have dated the worst most abusive men due to horrible childhood trauma we both experienced and had not resolved or coped with. We have both always been in each others lives and like everyone have had ups and downs in our friendship but we always leaned on each other... She’s so generous, smart, and creative and we are almost like sisters at this point. 

Now up until 3 years ago as I mentioned we had always been in toxic relationships and leaned on each other. I finally realized at 25 what I was doing and that it needed to change or my life was going to always be miserable. I ended a 4 year relationship that was soooo horrible and soon after I met my husband. 

While I was going through the process of leaving my ex, she married the guy she had been dating for a year. I should mention she’s an alcoholic and so is he. She tried to sober up off and on but he always refused. 

About my relationship. He is compassionate, loving, and not the least bit abusive in anyway. In fact he is wonderful and everyone around me loves him (especially my mom, and she hates EVERYONE). I married this man so the days of calling my friend to vent about my partners in the past abusing me, drugs, alcohol, and all that drama are OVER! Now the only news I have is “oh everything is good, just planning a trip... or oh just got back from the gym with hubby... how are you?” No drama, no arguments nothing. 

It was a different story from her end though. She called multiple times a week to talk for hours about him. I listened and gave her advice and FINALLY she took it last year got sober and left him. Well maybe it was discovering his secret heroin addiction that really convinced her. 

Well within months of leaving him she met this new guy. She chose to stay in the city away from me and her family because her work is there. This whole time living there she hasn’t had a support system. So this new guy: he doesn’t drink or smoke so she thought it was a match made in heaven.... she had gotten herself into AA which has helped many people be successful in quitting alcohol and they tell you do NOT date within that first year of sobriety. Well she met this guy and didn’t tell me until she was in a relationship with him!!! Now they’ve been dating for 6 months and plan on moving in together. She’s been sober for a year... only a year now. And she calls me all the time about some argument they’ve had. It’s like history repeating itself. I want to be a good friend but I am losing focus of my goals because everyday I’ve been talking to her for hours trying to help her. 

She tells me he doesn’t have empathy or compassion for her. They fight over very small irrelevant things and neither of them admit they are wrong until she does. She told me they plan on moving in together and I was floored. I feel like she just is stuck in this toxic cycle and thriving on the drama. I feel like I’m roped into this way too deep and I’m feeling so frustrated and over it. 

TL;DR or whatever you write.... sorry I’m pretty new here....

Now I remember almost nothing from my childhood except the occasional memory that makes no sense but I do remember media, but I can’t seem to remember Disney even though I KNOW I loved it. Could I have been abused on multiple occasions to Disney movies to make it be such a strong trigger?

460,"So, I’ve recently became single. I’m male, 29 and I still keep in touch with my ex. We’ve met up a couple of times, slept together and still do love and care for each other deeply but we broke up because we probably aren’t right for each other. We are different people. She’s a lovely person to be with when she hasnt been out to town drinking, if she’s drunk, she’s a completely different person and I can’t stand her, she’s quite destructive in that sense and some aspects of the relationship were problematic. 

I’ve recently started going on the dating apps, and to my surprise I’ve had quite a lot of matches and have been talking to a few really good looking and seemingly great women and will most likely end up meeting them for a date.

The thing is, I feel like I know I won’t be that into them. Like none of them seem to make me think wow, what a catch. And whilst I know I would probably meet someone who is ‘good for me’ it will never be her. 

What I’m driving at and trying to understand is how, why or what is it that makes people want and desire people who aren’t necessarily good for you and are in effect disruptive to your life instead of just picking the right one? Like there’s something about my ex that I can’t put my finger on. 

But the more I’ve thought about it today after speaking to her and comparing her with the new people I have been speaking to, there’s something about her that just fucking makes me want her! 

Just intrigued to know your thoughts? I was going to google it, lol - but I’m sure I’ll get some great answers on here.

Thanks!

466,"Ok so some basic background, when I was at Uni (class of 2017) I worked for 18 months as a casual worker in my universities AV department. I loved the job, the job loved me, my boss gave me more hours than other casual workers and basically groomed me for a full time role (I studied Geography, not a natural career path into AV). When I graduated in July of 2017 we began the process of trying to create a new full time position in the AV department for me. Unfortunately, 4 months pass without progress as the Uni struggles financially and goes through a restructure. I run out of time and get another job back home, and begin a job search for another career. 

Flash to June 2018, I start work as a recruitment consultant. Due to circumstance, my old university and my old boss in the AV department fall under my client file. I move back to the area I went to Uni in, as I know the area, have a contact for a place to stay, and is a commutable distance to my new job.

Flash to the present. I am about to complete my probation at the recruitment consultancy (confirmed on Friday, 90% certainty I'll pass). I go for drinks with my old co-workers from AV. It is announced that one of my permanent ex-colleagues is handing in his notice for a £25k position, and my boss is sourcing from former casual staffers to fill it. I know from conversation with him I am the preferred option. £25k represents a 5k raise on my basic salary, in addition to the elimination of commuter costs in time and money, going back to a job I loved with far superior work/life balance, leaving a career path I was never married to in recruitment to one I thoroughly enjoyed in AV.

Here lies the moral and ethical dilemma. As a recruitment consultant, the vacancy falls within my client base and it is my professional responsibility in my current role to pursue it as potential business. My current boss knows about the vacancy, but not about my potential to fill it. Currently, the vacancy is in a state of internal channels to fill, which I am part of as a candidate looking to apply. The uni may then go out to recruitment agencies such as my current employer to try and fill it should they struggle.

I ALSO do not know what the implications may be should I be offered and accept the AV role. I am literally days away from passing probation, and the process in the AV side may be a few weeks from interview/offer. I don't know what might happen should I hand in my notice at the agency having only just passed probation. Would I be able to see out my months notice? Would I be immediately let go as those who quit within probation are? Would I be put on gardening leave, and if so, would I get paid for that interim, and would I be able to start within that time period or would I have to wait? I feel like it would be stupid to ask my HR department about notice period procedure as that could easily filter back to my boss and bite me in the arse.

I'm sort of set on accepting the AV role should I be offered as it's a way better fit, it's just negotiating  a happy resolution with my current role that worries me.

Thanks for taking the time if you read this absolute essay, tbh this was just as much about putting my thoughts into words as it was about getting advice.

467,"I'm a sophomore in high school and I feel like my life is fucked up. My problems are I'm in love with my teacher (i'll know it will never work which makes me sad), I'm not motivated for school anymore. I feel like i'm in a toxic relationship with my friends, and I feel so lonely. My ""friends"" use the word gay and faggot a lot and I told them I was gay a week ago and now their making fun of my like telling me to sit because i'm a minority. This is how they joke around and I used to not care but now that I've fallen in love with my teacher my feelings are starting to fuck me up. I'm to embarrassed to tell my mom about this because she doesn't know i'm gay. The only reason I still hang out with these guys is because I hate being lonely and their the only people I know at my school (im not being sarcastic. I only know like 20 other peoples NAMES besides for these guy).

I think that I'm having a life crisis since my life has completely changed from how it was a year ago.  I'm forcing myself out of bed in the mornings, goes to a job that I don't really enjoy atm, get home to make dinner and then I just sit by my computer until (very) late before I hit bed. It feels like I'm stuck in a treadmill and I no longer enjoy life. NOTE I'm not having suicidal thoughts, I just feel there is something missing.

I find it hard to express myself about this and don't really have any friends I can talk to. It's been like this for quite a while now and I miss the person I was before this year started.

472,"It’s even seen as acceptable at my high school, the “popular” guys at my school especially harass this one girl in our grade. They call her names to her face everyday, make tweets about her calling her ugly, take unflattering pics without her consent posting them saying she looks forty, and start rumors that she’s involved in gang bangs and has sex with lots of guys at once. Literally she could walk to another class and they would make comments about her being a slut and ugly .




Why do they harass her so much? it’s group of fifteen senior boys and the girl is not ugly she’s actually pretty attractive. Why is this seen as cool? Why do these guys want to harass this girl?



She was new to our school in 10th grade. I remember seniors making sexual comments about her but nothing super mean. Also the girls that hang out with the “popular “ guys legit look 12 so they always tell this girl( who’s well developed) that she looks old and wrinkly. 




The girl also has ABSOLUTELY NO SOCIAL MEDIA and she used to dress cuter and now wears sweatshirts everyday. She also used to have GORGEOUS THICK blonde hair all the way down her back. She cut it to medium length and dyed it brown this year. Also she isn’t poor and drives a nice car to school . She kinda looks like Rosamund pike.

473,"**TL;DR: Due to work/school, will be spending three days a week without boyfriend, who is main emotional supporter. Scared of adulthood and carpentry course.**

Hi! I [21 F] am starting an eighteen month carpentry course at a local college. I'm pretty nervous, because even though it's always been something I've wanted to do, I never had the chance to explore it much. But, I know I'll do fine! I think. 

What I mostly need advice on, though, is how to find a balance between college, my job (I work in the breakfast area of a local hotel, so I'm typically done my day around 11 AM), and my lovely live in boyfriend [34 M].

He works night shift, which has the awful effect of him leaving for work before I come home from class, and coming home from work after I leave for work. There will be a solid three days a week that we don't see each other. Our pets will be fine, because there will only be about two hours a day that someone isn't home. But, still. It sucks for us.

Do you have any advice on how to handle it? I'm pretty scared. I have a good support system, but he's a big part of it. I'm FAR better mentally than I used to be, but this is going to be a lot of stress without the person who makes everything okay just by existing.

Any advice would be great. Thank you!!!

475,"I had a very rough childhood compared to many people that I know and I mentally blocked most of my experiences out of my memories. Most of it came down to having very controlling parents who were unsuccessful in their own lives and took out their problems on my siblings and I. Basically my parents did not let me form my own sense of identity and tried to force their own flawed ideals upon me without letting me form my own opinions on anything. This was not helped by my older brother emotionally and physically abusing me constantly from a young age and my parents not doing anything to help about it. Due to these reasons as well as some others I developed many phobias and anxieties that still linger to this day. 

Since I had no idea who I was out of high school, I had no idea what I wanted to do for a career and was not passionate about my college education. I dropped out after 2 weeks because of anxiety/depression and not being able to cope with the changes from high school and not knowing anybody. I became severely depressed over the next few years and had to move back in with my parents to pay off my debts. They did not take any of my problems seriously and just mocked my mental problems and called me lazy. This just fed my anxieties even more and I began to smoke marijuana daily to cope with these anxieties. I also used binge eating, videogames, TV shows, basically any form of escapism to avoid feeling these awful feelings. 

Physical health problems also run in my family and I have developed many back problems. My upper back has been in constant pain for years. I am already exhibiting signs of degenerative disc disease and arthritis in my thoracic and cervical vertebrae. My spine is curved in strange shapes and I cannot get into correct postural alignment. The entire right side of my upper back is in constant pain and I believe that the nerves/blood vessels (particularly the brachial plexus) are being constricted. This flares up from time to time and whenever I try to find a stretching/weight lifting routine to help it just makes things worse.

I have tried every thing I can think of to help with the depression, anxiety, and physical pain. I was also diagnosed with ADHD and other mental problems that I still haven't figured out. I've tried many SSRI medications for depression/anxiety which just made things worse. I've tried benzodiazipines for anxiety which just made me more tired. I've tried NSAID's for my physical pain which did not help at all. I have tried weight lifting, cardio, yoga, meditation, foam rolling, eating healthy, and many other things but none of them helped me long term and I still find myself with the same problems.

I recently was prescribed Adderall XR 25mg which has helped me tremendously with my ability to focus and organize my thoughts which gives me some hope. The problem is I cannot deal with all of these problems stacking up against me. I NEED TO GET AWAY FROM MY FAMILY FOR MY SANITY BUT I CANNOT AFFORD TO MOVE OUT. I've tried moving out for a year before and my mental health improved greatly. The problem was that I could not afford all of my bills as well as car repairs for my shitty car as well as all of my medical bills and food and everything.

I'm currently 5000 dollars in debt for my car, chiropractor bills, and credit card debt. Whenever I get money to deposit in my bank account it is just snatched up by the loan company that sued me for not being able to make my car payments. I never know if I'll have enough money to pay my cell phone bill or car insurance or have enough money for food or anything because of that and that instability does not help me form a budget for myself. I know I need to fix my mental and physical health issues before I can grow as a person but I also need to get away from my family and I can't do everything at once and my parents are just detrimental to my health in all aspects. I can't even eat in front of my family and spend all of my time avoiding them because my father is a fucking asshole and this makes it so I often only eat one meal a day and have no energy.

I have gotten into things like coding, writing, and electronic music production over the past year for fun and to hopefully make a career out of coding but my physical, financial and mental issues often distract me and prevent me from being able to focus and think clearly on top of working a full time job 40 hours a week. I can't afford to go back to school and I worry about being able to get a career without going to school. I only make about 20,000 dollars a year right now and it fucking sucks.

I really don't need much to be happy. All that I want is to be able to afford to live on my own without relying on other people and to be able to pay for food and my medical issues. Other than that, I would be happy just working a decent job and focusing on my mental and physical health. 

I have been looking to move from the midwest to either the pacific northwest or kansas city. I want to live somewhere where I don't need a car to survive because car problems have been a major cause of stress on my life and the winters in the midwest fuck with my entire sense of well-being every single year. I just can't take it here anymore and I need to get away from all of the stress of my current life in order to grow but I can't afford to and it just feels shitty. I have contemplated suicide many times. I know other people have it worse than me but I just hate myself and my life. 

I know that the first thing I need to focus on is paying off my debt but I only make around $1500 a month after taxes working 40 hours a week and although I work a very easy job right now, I literally have no energy at the end of the day and can't do anything else. I 'm sick of this and I can't make consistent progress without falling back into my bad habits and I'm sick of it. Sorry for the rambling at the end here but I'm losing my concentration please give me some advice if you can relate because I literally have nobody else in my life who understands what I'm going through.
