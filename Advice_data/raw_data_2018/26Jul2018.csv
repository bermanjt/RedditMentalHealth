0,"(Not sure where to post this)

I recently commented [my brother’s story](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/91twmc/comment/e31esio?st=JK1SGKPV&amp;sh=2fbf67d1) with schizophrenia on a post and it really got me feeling hopeless, and I now I feel like I want to do something with my life to help people with mental illnesses.

The only issue is, I’m really *only* good with fields like programming and biology, not necessarily therapy, or psychology. So I’m curious if there are applications for the fields I am good with to help with mental illness.

Does anyone know how these skills could steer me to a field that would be working to help with mental illness? ",26Jul2018,1
1,"I was extremely excited to go to this artist as I’ve been searching everywhere for the particular style I want (blackwork geometric with dot work) and everyone has bookings closed in Arizona. I’m traveling to Denver to see this guy and we’ve been talking and I’m super stoked and then I ask “the deposit goes towards the tattoo, right?” And he says no - it is only for securing the appointment and the art. I have no problem paying for the art but $500 and none of it going towards the tattoo seems like very much and I have never run into this with all my other tattoos. Is this a normal amount for a tattoo artist? ",26Jul2018,1
2,"Long story short I recently graduated college and moved back ""home"" to start a great new job. Turns out I now know very little people who live here/ppl I still want to talk to. Its a bit hard to meet new ppl outside of school particularly women. Wondering how other ppl do it? Bars are in reality a fucking terrible place to meet anyone.

PS: Work is at a big company so that seems promising for meeting ppl in general. Workplace relationships seem like a bad idea to me though.",26Jul2018,1
4,"## I think my dad is a pedophile?

I'm adopted and live with parents who are considerably older than most parents who have kids my age. Both are very strange and rather unlikable people, my mum being an awkward, over-sensitive self involved woman with no social etiquette and my dad being creepy and loves to talk about himself.

First red flag about my dad is how he engaged my mum after two months of even knowing her.

Second is how as I grew up if I wore shorts or a piece of clothing that showed skin he'd feel the need to comment on it. I thought most fathers did it so I'd overlook it. I started wearing crop tops and shorts when I was around 14, and I grew boobs suddenly when I was around 13 so it's hard to find a shirt that doesn't bring attention to them. I'd find him staring sometimes and telling me that my clothes didn't suit me. Again, I'd ignore these comments. I wore fishnets once and he said 'I don't like fishnets too much' which was weird but I laughed it off . Then one time, I wore knee-high stocks and he wouldn't stop staring and my mum commented 'your dad likes knee highs'. Super strange.

When I got to college (which in britain is age 16-18) he'd pick me up and drop me off. Of course there are many different styles and personalities, and there was this group of emo girls who wore mesh tops, garters with their shorts and knee highs. Like me they were 16 and whenever my dad would pick me up he'd just stare at them instead of the road. His head would turn as he'd drive past them so obviously. I'd ignore it.

It was only recently when I went on holiday with him that it got even creepier. I'm 18 but small for my age so when I wanted to go out drinking on holiday I purposely wore clothes which make me look older, aka show a bit of boob, compliment my figure etc, to save myself the embarrassment of being asked for ID. Of course, my dad would stare but he acted super awkward around me and stammered a lot . Modest swimsuits are hard for me to find, so the one I had showed nearly my whole chest but I figured I'm on vacation so what harm could it do? You can guess how my dad reacted. Staring at me was one thing but staring at young teens and even kids in their swimsuits took it to a whole new level of creepy. My dad has this habit of when he's in deep thought he breathes through his mouth while licking his lips in a circular motion, and he'd do that while staring at the kids at the resort. Their mothers would pick up on this and I actually brought up the courage to yell at my dad to stop it. My dad just told me to not be silly in an embarrassed way but the mothers thanked me when I apologised to them, which says something doesn't it?

Recently I peeked at his search history and I was horrified to see 'bad little girls'.

Can someone like give me advice on what to do or how to handle this? I don't have any solid proof of anything and every day I'm finding out things which make me even more uncomfortable about my dad.

The other day I caught him jerking off with the door open to some old photos (which I didn't see) in the family dining room. He knew I was there too.

Like what does someone do in this situation?",26Jul2018,7
5,I was trying to shoplift at Walmart and they had someone checking receipts. But I clearly wouldn’t have a receipt with everything. So I tried to distract the person by talking to them but I said I don’t know where I put my receipt but I could leave the cart there and go to my car to get my phone and show my card purchases. But I left so clearly they could tell I was planning to shoplift the items because I didn’t come back. Should I be worried that they’ll check cameras for license plates or put my picture on the news or anything like that or should I not worry about it and move on. I’ve never shoplifted before but I wanted to be rebellious. I regret it and I’m not doing it again. But should I be worried anyone is coming after me? Because if I get caught or anything gets put on my record my life aspirations and goals are over and I would have nothing left to live for. I know that I would commit suicide I tried once before but that was a while ago. But now that I’m about to enter grad school if I screw that up I puke have literally nothing to live for since I only have a few friends and no family left. Help me out guys. ,26Jul2018,1

8,"Hello everyone
I was talking to a friend about normal things, what we were doing in the holydays etc... We then start talking about “love” (more like just attraction). After maybe 1h30 talking (through mesages) he tells me that I have no idea what he has gone through this year. He tells me his best friend died (he did not lived in our current country and I did not meet him) last year and that he was going through a lot of psycological pain. I told him that i was here if he needed anything and that i love him. 
Now I feel really bad because I did not notice what he was going through even though I talked to him almosy every single day. I feel like a terrible friend and I dont know how to speak to him again. I dont know how to help him and the simple idea of thinking about losing a friend absolutely shreded my heart. Please help.

9,"My dog, female west highland terrier, is 15 now and the past few months my mom and I have found random spots in the house where she just drops a load. Of course this just could be age getting to her as she loves to start barking for no reason and also can’t hear well anymore.

10,"I’ll be clear; I’m not in a relationship right now. 

However, I know for a fact I am naturally a jealous boyfriend. And I hate it. But I don’t know how not to be. 

Unfortunately my first few relationships all ended in infidelity on the part of my girlfriends. I know 2 of them couldn’t cope with long distance, and 1 of them was severely depressed. But it doesn’t help me come to terms with it.

I also suffered the traumatising experience of being in the room when my father confessed to my mother (via text, because he’s a coward) he was having an affair and leaving her.

All in all, my trust in people when it comes to romantic relationships is pretty much 0. 

So now, when I like a girl and I find out she’s talking to another guy, it hurts. I know she had every right to, I know it’s normal, but it feels like all the times I found out I wasn’t the only guy in the life of the only girl I called about.

So anyway, how do I stop being jealous? I never want to be the boyfriend that checks his gfs phone or constantly texts her when she goes out with friends. I firmly believe trust is a huuuuge part of a relationship, which I know is hugely hypocritical when I’m so suspicious. I want to be chilled and just have an awesome time with a girl I like, in the knowledge she’ll be cool with me doing my thing and I’m cool with her doing her thing and at the end of the day we both come back home and love each other.

Any advice much appreciated.  ",26Jul2018,7

13,"Hey everyone,

Last year, my stepdad had a traumatic brain injury. At present, he's a totally functional human being, but he's a completely different person. Completely different in the way that he's now insanely emotionally overbearing and my mom couldn't handle it. During this time, she was laid off from her full time job because she took so much time off to take care of my stepdad, so now she's working a part time job. They very recently separated and he's living with his friend while my mom is at the house. Due to the separation, there's a huge need for help watching my younger siblings.

The current situation is this -

* My mom is working part time, so there has to be someone to them while my mom is working
* I live about 40 minutes away from her and my stepdad is about 30 minutes away
* A babysitter isn't realistic because there's not enough income
* I can't move back to the house because I'm working on lining a job up near my current home and my school is super far away
* The neighbors won't talk to my mom because my stepdad went with the ""woe-is-me"" route and told everyone she separated with him because of the injury

So what can we do here? Is there any realistic way for my mom to make sure they're being watched without both of us having to drive to and from each other?",26Jul2018,1
14,"I \[35/F\] was dating a guy \[36/M\] for a few months, but it was intense as we saw each other daily and felt like nothing I'd experienced before, we connected on many levels and were vulnerable with each other in ways we'd not been before, although it was early he said he loved me and he introduced me to some of his family.   


We agreed it had the potential to be something special, it felt like he was just as serious about us as I was.  


We stated having arguments - small misunderstandings that anyone else would shrug off, he'd be so unwilling to accept my perspective he'd act like I couldn't have misunderstood or had no reason to be upset so I must be causing drama. Arguments would escalate as he'd not listen to anything I'd try to explain to him, instead no matter how careful my wording I couldn't say a word without him pulling it apart or claiming I was personally attacking him.  


I'd tried to stop these arguments - I came here for advice, I tried changing my language so to be more sensitive, introduced time-outs, even when very frustrated I wasn't mad at him as I understood he struggled with arguments - I gave him the benefit of the doubt, while every time they happened he'd threaten to break-up.  


During the arguments he'd accuse me of personal attacks - his claims weren't extreme but simply weren't true. It seemed sometimes like he just misunderstood what I'd said and was being overly-sensitive, but as he wouldn't listen to me there was no explaining this to him. Other accusations just came out of nowhere. Then he started trying to convince me I was losing my memory...that I was saying things I didn't even think, then just forgot.  


The last time we argued I told him this was starting to feel like gaslighting.  


He broke up with me for this.  


We stayed civil; he made sure to thank me for making him feel so loved and wanted, he wanted us to stay friends, he arranged to drop off my stuff at my place for me, and he was looking for any excuse to message me.  


He sent an email explaining why he broke-up with me - it showed how badly he was misunderstanding me, he still tried to convince me I had been accusing him of things and been unfairly getting upset with him when he'd defended himself, also he still tried to convince me I had suffered memory loss and even tried to use my disability against me to discredit me. He also stressed he broke-up with me over the word 'gaslighting' as his ex wife had accused him of emotional abuse which had hurt him, it's like he thought I was being flippant. I replied, keeping things civil I pointed out his claims were wrong and concluded we clearly had communication problems.  


I felt I was letting him off too easily - he was blaming me for the break-up and not taking any responsibility for anything, not the gaslighting or just the arguments. I don't think he was intentionally gaslighting, I think he's just really messed-up emotionally, but I decided for my own sanity and out of concern for him (there's a pattern and if he doesn't address it he'll end-up alone) I decided to raise the issue. I stayed civil and avoided saying 'gaslighting', I stressed the beak-up wasn't just due to communication issues, that it's not healthy to respond this way when a loved one points out you're hurting them, and asked him to consider these patterns in his relationships.  


He reacted very badly - he called it a 'character assignation' and emphasized it was good we broke-up, he also cut contact and told me to collect my things (he dumped them in a garbage bag in his yard). It was venomous.  


We met via a social group - we both have problems making friends and it's a great group, but he has integrated himself fully while I'm still an outsider - now it feels like I've no choice but to give-up this social group, *very* difficult as I've no friends and I'm extremely socially isolated. I don't think they'd totally reject me but I'm not one of them while my ex is, also I've no idea what he's told them - it stands to reason they've asked him and I doubt he told the truth. From their perceptive I was 'out of his league' but we looked sickeningly happy together, so for him to explain the total 180 I'd guess he'd have to claim I was a horrible bitch.   


We broke-up on the 1st of this month.  


I've just found out he's on a dating app, I was shown photos that include one taken since we broke-up so I know he's been using it recently, also there's a photo of him with people from the above mentioned social group that looks like he's asked them to pose (not sure if this was a dig at me, as he knows it's an app I'd possibly use, but it hurts either way).  


I'm hurt and confused because....

* I've no longer got a social group, I just don't really know how to feel about that other than numb...they may not have been my friends but they were all I had, it feels like a big loss in general as I have no one now, but especially so that I've lost them to my ex. He was wrong for how he treat me, as childish as it is to say: this feels unfair.  

* I thought what we had was real, for him to break-up with me so easily and cut me out of his life like this has me seriously doubting myself: did he ever love me? Is it just he's so fucked-up he actually believes I was accusing him of the things he claimed and he did love me but now sees me  the enemy? That he's looking for new dates so soon after our breakup makes me doubt his feeling towards me too. I just don't understand how we could have gone from something that seemed so great, when he seemed so genuinely into me, to a point where he hates me this much - also I'm struggling to get my head around the idea he's a bad guy.   


**TL;DR** \- Very intense relationship that felt like we had something very special, but arguments would spiral out from small misunderstandings and he started gaslighting, when I confronted him on gaslighting he broke-up with me. Now very confused as to whether he ever actually cared about me, also thanks to this I've lost our social group.",26Jul2018,1
15,"Context: I just finished a temporary job in a junior management position. My first at this level. It was stressful and I put in countless unpaid hours, I am not paid after 6 or on weekends.

I stayed late on a Friday to do some work for a colleague (not my boss, but de facto senior). I considered it a favour. It was simple and mundane, but dude either could not or would not figure out how to do it. There were a few corrections to be done, which would best be done by people in the office. He told people I'd promised to come in on the Saturday to do the corrections (a lie or misunderstanding) and rang me several times until I, very irritated, agreed to do it. I borrowed a friend's laptop to complete the work. He then sent me a long email calling me childish and unprofessional, how he regrets requesting so politely in the first place, how he's glad the other staff were so much more professional to help him (they are paid to work weekends), how everyone else pulled together to get the work done. It doesn't sound that bad in summary but was very rude, upsetting and unprofessional considering I'd done him a lot of favours with a lot on my own plate.

This man has made several weird jokes that make people uncomfortable (paedophile and porn jokes, apropos of nothing, when we work with kids), spent 2 hours shouting at another 2 female colleagues who disagreed with him, and otherwise been a massive pain to deal with.

It's 3 days later and so far I have ignored his email as I couldn't think of anything appropriate to say: I am pissed off but feel like any further dealings with him will just cause more stress, and I don't know how to approach this professionally. Should I reply? If so, what's appropriate? Should I mention to head office how difficult he has made things? Or, should I just completely move on and leave him behind? How can I avoid this sort of thing in the future? Sorry for all the questions!",26Jul2018,0

It feels like the universe is trying to kill that dream, and maybe I shouldn't go to LA. I could move downtown in my current city and live with a friend. I could move to the bay and live with my other best friend while he finishes up his last semester of college. I could move overseas and just work at a hostel too.

It's been a bit tough, the long distance, but it's almost over, and she's moving to the states nearby for grad school. Close enough that I can visit at least once a month, which is great! 

There's another month till she comes here. However, as time has passed, our messaging and phone calls have decreased. Our messages, however little, seem more friend like than anything else. And while I like that, it seems that there is no affection or anything through that. She's stopped saying goodnight. Sometimes when I'm having a bad day, I'd expect her to at least tell me I'm going to be fine , but that doesn't happen. 

She says she doesn't feel too good about using the phone to talk, and  she promises that she will be affectionate I person. And I believe her. But lately it's been feeling hurtful that she doesn't do that. I know I'm overthinking and I'm clingy (I've definitely been told that before).

A few weeks passed and my AVP title was in place but not the pay grade increase or job title change. I asked my manager about this and she said she felt horrible. Apparently the other two changes were not actually submitted to HR and they were unable to do an off cycle promotion (not sure if true). She stated that my work is being recognized and that at my mid year they would be able to move forward with this. On top of that she mentioned that they would probably be able to to more financially on the mid year since it apparently rare for someone to receive all 3 changes at one time and see a meaningful increase.

I sent her a snap back with a thumbs up cos I was chilling with jack in the box at 2am in my apartment and that was too much to process in the moment and I haven’t thought about it much since tbh.

38,"I'm 19 and and feel Jaded, stressed and tired of life at an age I should be at my happiest. I have this feeling of chronic boredom and sadness that seems to lie with me almost 24/7, I no longer find pleasure in the things/hobbies I enjoyed most and I am aware I self medicate a lot with alcohol and other substances. My physical attraction towards my girlfriend has dwindled to the point I no longer want to be intimate but I am too scared to end the relationship as she suffers from bpd and I fear for her wellbeing or even her life. I can't figure out a way to pull myself out of the place I'm in. I have an abundance of friends and plenty of things to keep me busy so I'm not suffering socially, I just don't know how much longer I can fighting before I lose my mind.

41,"Lots of kids in my school have started vaping recently so I decided to buy one to fit in and I thought it would taste good, when it came I wasn't at the door to get it but my dad was, saw the company name and accused me of ordering it, I said it must've been a friend which was a lie. The vape juice was sitting on his desk and I decided to swap the contents for water and put it back so that I could at least use my vape. Today the vape juice went missing from his desk after a month of being there. The vape juice has no nicotine and isn't harmful to my knowledge but I know he'll still get very mad about 1. Hiding it and lying and 2. Vaping in the first place. How do I proceed? Should I  find it and swap the water with clear oil or something? Should I come clean? Any ideas are appreciated. ",26Jul2018,1

All because they're atheist and make darker jokes than she approves of.

Todays I went to my grandparents to get something and I saw that my two cousins (both boys 10-12) are laying in the bed with nothing but underwear on. Then they started kissing each other. I didn’t really think anything of it because I know that they have autism and I dont know a lot about that topic so I blew it off. 

A few minutes later the older one comes out with an *erection*. He sits on the couch between me and my grandma then starts touching my leg and arm. Im not good around children let alone ones with special needs so needless to say I was really uncomfortable. He then tells me to “pretend like im snoring” and my grandpa goes “no he doesn’t want to play that game”. So my grandma says she’ll play and she closes her eyes and starts snoring. Then my cousin starts kissing her on the lips. 

Thats a sweet sight between grandson and grandma but if I would have played along I would have freaked the fuck out.

47,"Tried posting on breakups but nothing so far so I’m asking here now. 

Okay, so i just got out of a 2 year relationship and I’ve tried to go no contact. I wished him well and told him I do not want to contact each other and sent him a pair of pants I had of his and a spare phone through the mail. 

Every gift he had gotten me I had given back when we decided to go on a “break” a month ago, even though we continued to see each other just as much. 

He had originally told me to keep the gifts he gave me and that they were mine, but in that moment I was frustrated and gave everything back. During that month I went over to his house many times and I saw a tablet he had given me and asked if I could take it since he had originally told me to keep it. He said “oh no I’m using it right now” and didn’t wanna give it back and told me he would later. 

Now we broke up for real this Monday through text and he’s asking me today what we should do about a bong we had bought together for $500. 

He kept every gift I gave him including a $250 watch and over $100 in stuff for his car. I don’t have anything he bought me and he’s asking about the bong. I originally paid for it with a credit card and he gave me random payments but I never fully kept count and he didn’t end up giving me the full half I believe. 

Should I just tell him I’m keeping it and that it’s mine? 

I don’t know what to do. I’m still trying to process the whole breakup and him just even contacting me is making me feel really shitty. I wanna be left alone. Sorry if I’m rambling or don’t make perfect sense I’m just really distraught. ",26Jul2018,1

51,"So I've been friends with this person for awhile now but we stopped talking as much as we did because they went back to some people who we met through and I no longer want to associate with the people they went back to for some kinda obvious reasons.   


But I have no problem with them talking to these people cause it doesn't concern me who they associate with and I just had a hunch that they'd go back to that considering even tho they kept telling me they never would but they kept giving this one person a chance after they told me they don't want to talk to them anymore.   


Anyways I'd talk to them through discord and what not but not to long ago they added me to this group chat with two people who I honestly don't want to and never want to talk to along with someone who just harasses people for the ""fun"" of it , even if I have them both blocked I can still read what they say and after reading the stuff where they are trying to ""taunt"" me just makes me realize that I want them to just go find someone else to bother , I want them to just die off by realizing that I don't want to deal with them or their crap and I feel like they just think I'll type something to them but I honestly don't see the point in typing to two people who just are ignorant along with some weirdo.

This is basically how they are behaving since I am not responding to them.

One of them is basically saying things about my sense of style ,my relationship , what I do for a living , threatening self harm , saying I have nothing of importance going on because I'm apparently ""unemployed"" because I told someone they are friends with a long time ago that I wasn't working at the time.

\*The reason why I don't want to talk to them the most is because they don't think for themselves and just take in info that they hear and believe all of it.\*  


The other is bringing up how I won't confront them when it's like I tried and what do they put up a troll act or try to change the convo , they get really heated when you bring up somethings that are valid against them. 

\*basically this one is the one spreading lies by misinterpreting behavior and basically they get passive aggressive with me and won't take a situation seriously.\*

I don't know what I should do , I mean I had a feeling that the person I called a ""friend"" just threw me in there and hasn't said anything because they don't want to change our ""friendship"" but  still added me to the chat to make the other people happy.

I was arrested with marijuana possession which was taken down to a littering charge, which I plead guilty to. I think it may show on the background check that it was originally a drug charge that was dropped and I'm worried that they will just see that I have a conviction and immediately decide not to hire me. Would it be better if I'm upfront about it at the interview or should I just wait? I'm really worried and really want this job. Any advice? Thanks in advance!

59,"I’ve been at my current job for almost a year. I’m a manager at a web company. Since I started, I’ve been focused on keeping the gears churning while at the same time keeping my team happy. I manage 7 people all together.

It’s been a rollercoaster. Fast paced, and a demanding job. I don’t expect my team to work long hours, and I make sure that whatever we commit to, we can complete on time or push back. I’ve gotten reviews before, some good, some feedback with “needs improvement”. Today my boss pulls me in and gives me the latest review. All good, all improved, working hard, getting stuff done, almost all my team gives me props. Almost all.

Since the beginning, there’s this one person that reports to me. She’s never trusted me, never liked me very much, and no matter what I do, no matter what I say, she always seems to hear what she wants and always interprets things badly, and always, I mean ALWAYS, goes complaining to my boss. My boss knows her behavior, he knows she’s difficult, he knows she’s not happy ever. And the last few times she has taken stupid complaints to him, he has kinda brushed her off and told her that “There’s nothing wrong with what your manager’s doing”. So apparently she was not too happy about that, and she stopped complaining about me to him, and she went way above my head and my boss straight to the VP. And that’s when shit hit the fan.

Besides a great review, having the rest of my team happy with me, now my boss is getting shit from his  boss and his boss’ boss about me. He told me that I better fix this or get terminated, because she’s too valuable an asset to lose.

No matter what I do, I don’t think I can make it work with this person. She can be super happy, super appreciative of whatever I do, and 5 minutes later she’s coming up with something wrong about me to complain. Should I just say fuck it and start looking for another job? What’s the best course of action?

I really like this job.

TL;DR 
There’s a member of my team that seems to be out to get me fired. It’s working, and it doesn’t matter how well I do in 99% of the rest of my job. Should I just quit? I really like this job though.",26Jul2018,5
60,"Sooo, I'm new to Reddit and I am posting from my phone. Howdy everyone. Let's dig right in. 

I'm with this guy who I love to pieces. He is funny, good to have a conversation with, we share some interests. We get along more times than not, and he really helps me overcome some of my own issues, like anxiety and depression. We mutually acknowledge that each of us has issues, and we have been working hard lately to find ways to cope and communicate. BUT

When we DO fight, it's over stupid stuff, like me wanting his input on a decision, and him getting mad because he feels like he ""has no say"" and that when he DOES contribute, I ignore him. (To my knowledge he has only really weighed in on anything serious once, citing usually that he doesn't contribute money to the household, so he shouldn't have a say, which infuriates me. It is true that he did contribute a list of things to do/places to go in Kansas City, and I never looked at it. I don't know why, I just haven't.) Or he will say something to me that seems incredibly rude, but he means the ""denotation, not the connotation"", and says it's a problem with my perception and not what he said. We also don't have the same energy levels--he calls me ""spontaneous"" and even ""bipolar"" or ""impulsive"", whereas in contrast, he seems just LAZY (which I have never said to him) and never wants to do anything unless it involves alcohol, or I shove it on him. Additionally, sex life: virtually non-existent. He just doesn't like intimacy and even sometimes gets upset if I touch him at the wrong time. 

Now, this is all stuff that would normally be reconcilable and maybe fixed over time. I use ""I"" statements, I express my feelings in a non-aggressive way (or try to), and try to be responsive when he expresses displeasure. I'm not always a successful communicator, but I really do my best. The problem comes with the fact that he just doesn't seem to ""get it"". He won't approach me with the same respect, and says he has to be very careful what he says around me. He makes me feel like I'm insane, and that I am just blowing up on him all the time and not noticing it. He accused me the other day of ""gaslighting"" because I was so exasperated with his constantly believing I am cheating on him, or that I am being rude to him, but it has gotten to the point that when we fight I will review the conversation step-by-step to ENSURE I'm not acting crazy. IN FACT, usually I find that, at least in my mind, it is HIM that is constantly shifting his words or his argument, and who doesn't remember what he said 3-5 minutes before.

Now, he does drink a lot. Like, 8-12 beers a day without breaking a sweat. But he swears that isn't part of it, and I have done my best to just accept that drinking is how he copes with his own anxiety, which is what he says it is for. 

Things have REALLY heated up now because we've been basically camping in Kansas City all week while I try to snag a job, provide employment verification to an apartment I have been working with, and be frugal enough to feed us both, all so we can move out of our podunk town and into a place where there is growth to be had and money to be made. Today, I accomplished ALL of those goals. I came back SO EXCITED and told him all about it, and he just couldn't muster up any energy. After laying in bed all day, doing nothing. Which, he does not have a job, IS apparently looking for one, but has not had one for at least 3 of the 6 months we have been together. Which I could cope with, if he'd just give me some emotional support when I need it. 

But no, I just made all our dreams (or maybe just mine, but he does swear he is in love with KC and is excited to be moving) come true, and he is like, ""Okay, cool."" I tried to express that I was looking for more pride and excitement, and he just got mad and said, ""What, you want me to dance? I'm just in a bad mood, and I am getting all this negative energy from you."" 

Negative energy? I'm stoked! I'm just mad because at this point, I'm about to MOVE HIM WITH ME across the country to a life that I BUILT FOR US, and he can't even manage a smile or a ""good job, hon"". Is he always going to be this negative? I've been so dismissive of his drinking, unemployment, rudeness, calling me crazy, lack of intimacy, accusing me of cheating, having to GIVE UP FRIENDS so he can be comfortable, AND I have basically put together this move ON MY OWN, WITHOUT HIS HELP, BUT DAMMIT. 

He can't even just be excited with me. Just this once. 

Is it worth putting any more effort into this relationship? I feel like it would be wrong to break up with him this close to such a major life event, and he doesn't have a job or money to live on. I want to be told that things are just hard right now because I am stressed, and that they'll get better when there is more money to go around and the move is over. But I don't think that's true.

66,"I guess I’ll start with some background. Sorry about how it’s written, I’m using mobile.

So about 2 years ago I found this girl in the internet. I didn’t think much of her we talked. I later found out a guy was threatening her with suicide so he could get nudes. He did that for however long. I don’t know how long it was. But when I found out I told the guy off. He tried coming back but ultimately he had left.

We talked like everyday through text nothing special. I found out she had a pretty shitty life. She has depression and schizophrenia. Her dad killed her mom when she was very young. She was living with a step-Mom of the same dad. They lived apart. Her mom didn’t give a shit about her and she mostly used her to do work around the house.

A few months pass and her friend dies because he commuted suicide. She though about doing that same and I talked her out of it. Another few months pass and she confessed that she loves me. I was shocked but I realized I felt the same way. We talked a lot more we started video calling and such. But the video calling was limited because of her mom. A few months pass and we stop video calling and I start to realize that I’m getting kinda bored with talking to her through text but I we either couldn’t call because of her mom or because of me not making a effort.

She propose that we break up and I agreed . We stop talking for a few months and I start to realize how much I miss talking to her. I miss her. But I leave it alone. One night I contacted her over the summer and we talked again. I though maybe we could try again at it. But I was told that she was in another long distance relationship with another guy. I talked to her for a week or two.

After a while I realized I couldn’t keep talking to her because my heart aches every time I thought about her or talked to her. I decided to wish her luck and thank her that she let me in and let me talk her out of suicide and I told her I needed to leave because I couldn’t stand it.

Then I disappear. A few months later I asked her boyfriend how she was. He said she got her phone taken way by her dad. And he said that one of her few friends at school contacted him and told her she would be fine. He said he missed her and I said thanks for helping her out and I left. 

I didn’t talk to him till this summer. I said hello and he never responded. So I tried to talk to her. She didn’t respond for a few weeks. But she did mid June though. We start talking I though she broke it off with her boyfriend. She said she didn’t know if she could love someone until she is happy with herself. I kinda got hope that we could try again. But of course I respected her opinion and i though we could maybe try again in the future so we kept talking.

They never really did break it off. I found that out a few days ago. I was crushed. I’ve been anxious and sad whenever I think about her. I have been thinking that she is better off with him. They have a plan when she is older to get away from her parents. They have been together for a year. It’s kinda crushing to want someone but know they are better off with someone else.

I don’t know what to do. She is really happy to have me around. Before I knew she was still with him I promised I wouldn’t leave again. If I left it would make her sad. The heart ache is back and I’m anxious talking to her.

I honestly have no idea what to do. I really hope you guys can help me. Because I’m really stuck. Sorry for the long post and I’m sorry it’s kinda rambling.",26Jul2018,2

When i got the windows measured i told them specifically which ones i wanted replaced but the people who measured were different than the ones who replaced.

Do i have a valid complaint or were they okay to assume that those random panes of glass were among the windows i wanted replaced? ",26Jul2018,1
73,So um I’m 17 and this summer I guess you could say I made some immature decisions and now I’m freaking out because I think the situation may come up publicly (ok I know this sounds really confusing but I’m trying not to explicitly state it) I just want someone to talk to and explain what’s happening and some comfort because I’m too scared to tell my friends ,26Jul2018,1
74," I'm 15. I have been horseback riding since I was 7. The only thing I wanted since I was 4 was a horse. About 2 and a half years ago my mother passed away from cancer when I was 12. my mother was a pretty wealthy women and would take me to horseback riding, but never even let me question why I couldn't get a horse. Once she passed away my father (who is in the army) moved all of us to upstate NY and my family wanted to get me a farm so I could get a horse. Not soon after I received the horse. He was undertrained, and my parents knew nothing about horses. He was spooky and I had little horse training and ownership experience, what I knew I had learned on Youtube. Long story short I became fearful of the one thing I was supposed to love. I would ride to cope, to relieve the weight of the world from myself, and now I was scared of it. I was foolish to change from english to western without even knowing how to tie down a saddle properly, and was stupid to get a 2 and a half year old that had been gelded only 2 months previous to getting him, but I didn't know better, I had been waiting my whole life for a horse so I jumped. About six months later I had to give him away for free. I miss horses so much. My parents tell me I should be ashamed of the missed opportunity, that I should never speak of it again. To be fair, I became lazy and unattentive to him, because most of our interactions were negative. The more this summer goes by the harder it is to cope with the fact that I can't be the horse girl I want to be, it is so hard not to ooze horse facts, I feel like I am going crazy. Every time I need to cry I feel like I should go riding, but I can't. I'm miserable taking care of goats and chickens, and if I don't I get blamed for being here. My family says it's my fault that we moved to nowhere, it's my fault that my little brothers won't have a million friends and karate classes, that it's my fault that we can't take a 2 minute drive to the grocery store. I just want another horse, another chance. ",26Jul2018,1

What happened was my father needed my help as the WiFi was down and I fixed it all up on his laptop to have the new WiFi name (we recently changed it) and added the new password. As I was doing that I noticed an ad for a porn website popped up and I essentially said Woah there wtf you must have some sort of virus and he was appalled and told me to remove that from his laptop right now and I did. Then I had lied and told him that the password didn't work and that I had to go upstairs and get it. When I did I logged into his browser history and noticed there were multiple histories of porn websites among other normal things like banking and lottery numbers etc.
I ended up showing my mother who was very shocked to say the least. She went downstairs and asked and as far as I can tell they had a quiet, non angry conversation but he whole heartedly denies it.
My mother seems extremely upset, and honestly I think she cares more that my dad doesn't feel upset or embarrassed for being ""found out"" if it ends up being true.

76,"This started a couple of days ago, he was drinking with a friend and was being super loud and since my room is in the unfinished basement I can hear everything.

He comes down at some point and asks me if I want a drink and I say no thanks dude, I'm going to sleep, plus I already brushed my teeth. 

Later on after his friend had left, I hear him sneaking around in the basement, which is weird because all the lights are off outside my room. I call out and he doesn't answer me until I literally about his name and when I ask what the fuck he's doing he says ""going to bed"". I was like, ok maybe he's just wasted and got turned around. 

Then tonight my family and I were all shooting the shit, having a couple drinks, I tell them I'm going to go play some video games with a friend and that I'll be back later. 

After playing for a bit I go to the washroom. 

As I'm taking a piss I hear the door knock so I flush and get ready to leave. But before I even have my dick back in my pants he just starts opening the door. 

He doesn't stop opening it once he still sees me in there, but actually tried to step in and stand behind me.... Like dude, get the fuck outa here, what are you doing? And he responds with what's your problem?

My home life isn’t awful by any means, but it is pretty bad. My stepfather antagonizes my whole family pretty relentlessly, and hates me especially because I am the only non biological child to him. Because of this, I can’t be out of my room without him harassing me in some way. I’m very sick of living like this.

Sadly, I wish to stay somewhat close to home because of my wonderful boyfriend, and my close relationship with my mother. I will go further away if it becomes my only option, but it’s not like I’m giving up my dream school by staying somewhat close at all. My two options are the university in my town, or the one about 2 hours away. Going the 2 hours will mean paying for residence, as well as a meal plan.

90,"I have a lot of problems and I don't really know how to form a post that will get noticed. So big whoop.

Here is a kind of list and brief description of each:  
I'm paranoid, to a very debilitating degree, I can't relax unless in a room by myself with one entrance that I can see.           I won't trust anyone who's just genuinely nice to me. I can't get any doubts out of my head and I feel unsafe all the time.  
I feel like I'm lonely. Plain and simple, I can't believe that anyone could enjoy being with me and it drives me nuts. I can't stop fantasizing about meeting someone who just thinks I'm a nice person and wants to be friends/romantic (at this point I couldn't care) To the point where my dreams are becoming just self inserting into worlds with characters that I like who think I'm a neat person. It's eating me up.  
I have a powerful reliance on my video games and books. If I can't trust people I can always trust a program that can't betray me right? I've been playing World of Warcraft since I can remember and have ended up using that as my backbone for everything in my life. My justification so far not to kill myself has been this fucking game, I just love the world and characters and everything in it. Same with Tolkien's works, I have read and watched The Lord of the Rings countless times and everything else he's had a part in. I think the heavy dependent on these things to keep me happy and entertained. It might be a problem but I'm unsure, I know it could turn into a problem however.  
People don't like me. I can tell very well when someone dislikes me (not the other way around however) and I'm not popular at all, never have been. I can't tell why people dislike me usually, I've tried to emulate behaviours of people I meet and see doing well socially but even then I'm disliked. I don't understand whyyyyy.  


With these 4 powers combined, I call upon the power of a depressing spiral into sadness.  


But in all seriousness, I have a hard time functioning and getting up to drink water feels like I'm prolonging a life I don't want to live. I lost my first boyfriend to a car accident and I moved on and lived as well as I could. I had someone kick me when I was down at that point so hard that I attempted suicide twice. I ended up being led on for a year by my at the time ""best"" friend because she wanted to just cheat on her boyfriend. 

I could talk about so much more; but it would be useless. I've moved on from all these things and forget about them.  But these emotional issues I talked about above have me scrabbling for any feeling of joy I can experience. I hate it all and I want it to stop  


TL:DR Paranoia + Social ineptitude = Feelings of severe depression and a slowly dying will to sustain myself.

Thanks for reading if you did, this is like my first post on reddit where I actually think and be serious. So if it's a mess of writing, you deserve a reddit silver for sitting through it.

Then one day, I just... stopped. I gave vague answers to her questions just didn't really feel like talking to her. It continued through out the year and during the class we had together, I was content with not talking to her and keeping minimal contact. Gosh, just writing it out like this makes me feel disgusting for thinking like that. 

She asked me a couple times throughout the year about it and I just didn't know how to explain. It was like a mix of awkwardness, resentment, and something else. We still occasionally text and stuff but it always feels too serious and kind of uncomfortable.

I decided to write about this because the same thing is happening again. There's a guy I've been playing video games with but i recently started feeling the same stirrups as before. Im pretty sure it's because I've been spending a lot of time talking to him but I feel like time just isn't the answer.

I can't wake up on time. I make sure I'm sleep around 12 AM, I don't have trouble going to sleep. 

Then I try to wake up at 7:00 AM. My alarms are set for 6:55, 7:00, etc.

I gain conscious, slightly drowsy but ***almost*** fully awake.  

1. **I daydream about ladies when I wake up. I close my eyes, then, I create this weird dialogue/story in my head and try to get back into a dream.**
2. **My sleepy mind in the morning messes up my judgement and I keep repeating this same mistake of daydreaming and I often go back to sleep and waste many hours.** 

These daydreams mostly aren't sexual.  Sometimes, I just want to think of being with my crush. etc.  Now, approaching my crush isn't currently an option, and I can't forget about her either. 

We **used to be** very close friends, than her boyfriend got jealous and it all ended, either way I was friend-zoned. 

It's been 2 years since, and I had the opportunity text each-other last time. 

Pretty sure it was fun for both of us, we really get along. After that, I texted her another time but she was sending all the \*not interested\* signals. So I decided to stop. She still has that same jealous boyfriend. On and off kind of relation ship that they have.  They have broken up and got together at-least 20 times by now. But, even though her attitude of text's are completely uninterested with me, I'm not too sure at the same time. It might be her boyfriend telling her not to text me... I think this because, she does shit like, put me on Instagram story with a screenshot of my twitter feed, saying how funny I am. I don't think it's sarcastic either.

99,"I don't like having it in the house.  It's surveillance.  It listens in on conversations, recording 60 second snippets.  

Recently Alexa's been useless.

She usually turns on the light and fan, but when I was asking her to turn them off last night, she said they weren't connected, so I had to turn them off myself.

Today, the fan was supposed to go on at 4 (my dad timed it on his phone) but it didn't because I left the fan off from the past night.  With the internet, the lamp can also be turned on by my dad's phone.

The only time I use Alexa is as a Bluetooth speaker, but my dad has other speakers like that, I just have to ask to borrow them, and they don't listen on conversations.

I had to unplug it today so I could listen to my grandpa tell me about his past gov't job that I had to convince him to tell me about, as he's retired, and off the contract, and he should trust his granddaughter, I'm not going to tell anyone the details.

There have been times where my mom &amp; I are talking, and Alexa's blue ring goes off randomly when we didn't even mention her.

And there were times when she randomly butted into conversations of my mom &amp; I.

And when I asked her last night to turn off the fan, she decided to loudly play the biggest pop songs of 2017 when my parents were asleep.

And back when she'd turn on the fan, she'd say it wasn't connected, which made no sense.

Others have reported her creepily laughing at serious times.

There are videos online about things you shouldn't say to Alexa.  I don't want to be on a tightrope, worried about slipping up and something scary happening.

My mom has a coworker who is suspicious of that thing.  Just the past weekend when we were walking in a parking lot without my dad, I was talking to my mom about how I don't like Alexa.

And when my dad was going to ask Alexa to turn on something, I told him I unplugged it because she was being useless the other night, and I didn't want surveillance in our house.

He got all mad and said that it's not all about me, and that he paid for it, put one in my room at some point (I used to ask it to play songs, although usually she'd play a different remix, a different song, or said no altogether) just for me to say no.  I knew he couldn't be as easily swayed as my mom.  He's the man of the house for Pete's sake. And I'm powerless to stop him.

So he got pissed today, and I don't know what to do, as even though he said he paid for the stuff, he got what he paid for, and he paid for surveillance.

It still remains unplugged in the dining room on the upper floor of the house (my room is downstairs, and doesn't have Alexa because our house flooded, and we didn't completely unpack yet).

Even if I show him the video that mainly convinced me that she shouldn't be in my house, I don't think my dad will believe it.

And the thing is, we don't even need Alexa.

I can borrow my dad's bluetooth speaker.

My dad's phone can turn on the light and fan.

My dad can get weather reports from his phone, and can listen to the radio for news, otherwise, or scroll through CNN as he eats dinner.

She's an unnecessary surveillance thing that I'm uncomfortable with, but I may as well live with this discomfort for 3 more years at least, because heck it, I'm not the man of the house, am I?

And there are more reasons and details I could go into, but this was long enough as it is.  Thanks to anyone who offers advice btw.",26Jul2018,0
100,"I mean, seriously how do you?

I’m 18m and I’ve never really got into a relationship and I never really feel attached to anyone that much and never really tried to get a gf and start a serious relationship, however 3 years ago I met this girl and we became really good friends.

We were best friends for about 1 year and then started dating for the next 2 years. And pretty much i built this belief that she was the one and that it would last forever. Even my own friends said it that “you two are great together” and stuff like that.

I’ve never really had many friends and normally don’t ever express myself to them unless I feel like about to blow up. She was always the one I’d go to when I felt bad or good or anything really and vice-versa. As I said we were best friends and we trusted each other 100%. I was already planning the next few years with her in mind.

But suddenly out of nowhere she started to feel more distant and every time I asked she always denied anything and said everything was fine and that I was exaggerating and stressing out for nothing.

Fast forward 2-3weeks and it was almost Valentine’s Day, I invited her to hang out as anyone would do (I think) and she just rejected it, said she told her friends she was going to hang out with them. This really felt like a punch in the gut, I started feeling a little bit suspicious of something but taking in account what we had already been through I kind of just brushed it off and accepted it.

Then, at like 1am in Valentine’s Day, she said she  “couldn’t lie to me anymore” and that “she doesn’t really know how to love someone properly” and “you’ll find someone better than me”. It wasn’t anything “bitchy” I tried my best to be understanding but still trying to sort things out but she kept insisting that I should just let go and to not make it any more difficult. So we broke up

And it’s been 6 months now, I still can’t stop thinking about her or about what I did or didn’t do wrong or if she cheated on me and felt guilty about it, or just spending the night thinking about how good times were and how alive I felt these last 3 years. And I really am confused as to how do I forget the person I trusted the most for the such a long time?

I can’t seem to forget her even after completely cutting ties with her, we don’t talk ever since we broke up.

How does one get over it? How do you stop thinking about someone that was pretty much a part of your daily routine?

102,"At risk of sounding like a total bitch, here’s my problem:
My husband has 4 siblings, and he is the youngest. They range in age from 26-31 and they are all married. We are 24. At Christmas, we do a Secret Santa and each buy a gift for one person. They get mailed across the country so they’re usually gift cards or small things. That’s all good. It’s a great system. Inexpensive, and that way we don’t end up with a ton of trinkets that we will give away anyway. 
The problem is that throughout the year, two of the women of the group buy us gifts for our birthdays and sometimes our anniversary. The gifts aren’t personal. They’re gift cards and random things (that honestly feel like re-gifts). And they send cards that are clearly hastily scrawled with generic messages. Now, if you haven’t gathered, I’m not a gift person. To me, a non-personal gift and crappy card just says “I’m doing this for the sake of doing it” and not actually because they care. I’d appreciate a long, thoughtful text, even, rather than something that just checks the “I sent them a gift” box. My problem lies in that I feel we are pressured to reciprocate. We, as a couple, don’t really celebrate our occasions. We acknowledge the day, say “I love you” a few extra times, and move on. Occasionally we’ll see a funny card for the other person and buy it, or something small that we know they’d like, but most often we don’t do anything. I don’t even care if anyone acknowledges it; in fact, I avoid telling people when it is, if I can. I have no idea when the majority of the siblings and partners’ birthdays are, and definitely don’t know any of their anniversaries. (I sort of feel that it’s my husband’s family, so if he’s interested in giving gifts and writing cards, then I’ll follow suit. He isn’t interested.)
Now, my husband’s brother has contacted my husband to say his brother’s wife is upset that we didn’t acknowledge her birthday. (They sent me a very bland gift with a generic card for my birthday.) This set of in-laws are VERY public about every little celebration in their lives. Clearly they expect us to feel the same way about these occasions as they do.  I feel that it is very petty of his brother to make us feel bad for not acknowledging a birthday, and receiving these gifts makes us feel like we’re obligated to return the favour. 
So where do I stand? Am I a bitch for not acknowledging SIL’s birthday and/or not sending a gift? Is birthday acknowledgement required? Am I right to think that just because they celebrate/mark occasions one way, that doesn’t mean we have to do the same? Am I allowed to ask that people stop sending us gifts, if I suggest other ways of letting us know they care?

TL;DR: BIL guilting us for not acknowledging his wife’s birthday. They are big on gifts and cards. We are not. We don’t feel we should have to acknowledge their occasions or send gifts, as we’re all adults with our own lives. At the very least, if we forget an occasion, we don’t think we should be made to feel bad about that. Who’s in the right?",26Jul2018,1
103,"For some context I'm 23. My partner and I have been together for almost 4 years. We live together and have a dog together. I also recently got in a car accident so he is who takes me to and from work. Please keep this all in mind while I go into detail. 

My boyfriend is extremely emotionally abusive. He yells,  he screams and he tears me down. He can be set off over literally anything. Just a few minutes ago he told me off because I was crying over being frustrated over insurance issues from my car accident. He told me I'm ""too damned depressed"" and told me not to touch him and now I have to sleep on the couch. This is just an example

The problem is, I know he isnt a bad person. Right after he treats me terrible he apologizes and says he knows he has anger problems and that he will try harder. But nothing every changes. 

Logically, I know I should leave. The problem is that I'm in nursing school &amp; I cant afford to live alone. That's means I will have to move an hour and a half away from my job and school and live with my mom. Except it wouldn't only be my mom, it would be my brother his fiance and their child. I dont know if I would be happier in this situation. My dog would also be forced to stay in my room as my mom isnt a huge fan of him &amp; he would be very restricted. I dont know if it's fair to do that to him. I've been trying to balance the pros and cons for months now and I just dont know what to do. I feel like if I left I would be just as unhappy the only difference would be that my dog would be unhappy now too. I know that may seem silly to some of you but that plays a huge role in my decision. Any advice on either how to leave or how to fix this would be appreciated ",26Jul2018,2
104,"I (25M) signed a one year lease with my long time friend (27F). We had been planning this moment for a long time (&gt;2 years) and always thought this arrangement would work out no problem. For context, I'm a gay male and she is a straight female... I am single, and she is in a 3 year on/off relationship... with her most recent ""on"" status being 2 months. We are both young professionals in the early stages of our careers. 

It's been 3 weeks since we've moved into the 2 bed/ 1 bath apartment, and I automatically took an L since moving in since I got the smaller bedroom. I compromised, so it's fine... I get the ""losing"" end of this deal, and still pay the same...but am okay with it.

BEFORE moving in together she and I discussed cleaning duties, as well as having people over rules. We agreed to set a cleaning schedule for the bathroom, dishes, as well as vacuuming carpets and mopping the kitchen. Thus far, she has cleaned the bathroom 0 times, and does dishes 2 days later.... meaning if I ever want to cook something for myself I can expect having to wash a pan beforehand, as she uses every single item in the kitchen to make her meals.

I keep getting onto her about the dishes, and also expressed the urgency of having a cleaning schedule for the bathroom as I am gonna get tired of cleaning up after her (on top of myself) all the time. 

This bothers me, but not as much as how often her boyfriend spends the night. 

We had discussed this situation before moving in. I had told her I didn't mind who she had over... as long as it wasn't too frequent, or having her company overstaying their stay. She agreed the same rules applied to me. Now, I know people have their needs, and she is very in love with her boyfriend, BUT he keeps spending the night every other night... sometimes consecutively. 

I had a talk with her about this, and told her I felt uncomfortable having him spend the night as often as he's been. I like walking around in underwear, and obviously don't feel at home in my place when he stays over. Another thing that happened with her and her bf was the very first night we moved into this place. I had never met this guy previously... and now all of a sudden a stranger (to me) was staying over... on my very first night, of moving into my own place. Mind you, in the 2 years my friend has been with her bf, I had never once met him. 

I asked her why she didn't move in with her bf instead since it feels like he lives with us too, and she stated that she is not ready for that commitment. That's totally fine, I get it... but I feel like she used me as a stepping stone to get her own place and have this fantasy life with her bf. 

I know there may come a time when I enter a relationship myself, and will probably want the same thing (having bf spend the night)... but I know better than to overstep someone's boundaries the way she has with me. And will definitely make sure my friend knows the guy before I hit her with the ""he's spending the night"" line. I have had countless arguments with her about my boundaries. She still crosses them all the time. 

I've offered to exit this situation, so her bf could move in with her and essentially ""replace"" me as her roommate... but she obviously doesn't want that either, as she'd be f\*\*\*\*d if their relationship fails. 

I'm not too frustrated about this now (we're all adults here), just disappointed, but I'd like some advice on this. Has anyone been in this situation? How did you solve it? 

I did have to set my boundaries again with her, and told her to please limit his nights spent to once or twice a week. We are going 50/50 on everything, and I've already compromised by getting the smaller room, so I don't feel like I'm asking for a lot. 

TL;DR: Moved in with long time friend. She's crossing my boundaries by not cleaning, and having her bf spend the night too often. I reassessed my boundaries and told her to limit his stays to once or twice a month. ",26Jul2018,1
106,"To start, I am the children’s sister in law (I am married to their eldest brother). This is in CA, so CA law applies. My husbands parents have a long history of drug use (heroin, meth, etc.), and are currently living in Sacramento hotel hopping. Both the parents are felons for stealing my husbands identity, and their father was just arrested for a bench warrant for violating probation last night. 

This is concerning two young boys (12 &amp; 14 years old), who have been in Sacramento county since January. They have been hotel hopping since May after being evicted from their grandparents’ 2 bedroom apartment (as there were 9 people living in said apartment.) 

After the father was arrested last night, the mother of the boys got involved with some shady drug addicts and what we know is the boys’ belongings were all stolen, and they were dropped off at 3 am in a bad area in the Bay Area. They stayed the night at someone reliables home, were able to eat, etc. tonight, they are apparently staying in another hotel room. 

My husband and I helped them three days ago get a hotel room, and they completely cleared our bank account by overstaying, and that is how we are so invested at this point. We’ve been trying to get the boys out of the situation for a long time now, but now that their father is in jail in LA county, and their mother is a heroin addict, we don’t know what will happen to the boys. 

My husband and I just want to get them back home with family who won’t put them in danger. Their grandparents have legal guardianship of the children, and would like to see them back home too. My husband and I are willing to drive 6+ hours to pick them up and bring them home, but their mother is mad at us, and is saying that there is no way anyone will take her boys. We have also contacted CPS, and local law enforcement, I don’t know if that makes a difference. They don’t have phones, so there’s no way of knowing where they will end up, and no way for us to keep contact. 

We’re very worried and we’re wondering what we could do to make sure they’re no longer in harms way and they get the care they deserve, without us being accused of kidnapping or something crazy. Is it out of our hands, or is there hope that we can do something? ",26Jul2018,0
107,"My father wreaks havoc on our family. He's a lazy pos, recently lost his job, treats me and my mom like shit, very blatantly favors my brother over anyone else, and the list goes on for days. The most recent issue is that he and my brother are trying to force me to go to college for half my life so I can support *them*. My mom has been wanting to either kick them out or move me to be with a relative for a while now. She just can't find the motivation. I don't think it's a financial issue, I think it's more of a mindset issue. She takes a lot of her stress out on me, unfortunately. But she still tries to be motherly with me.

117,"I'm 18 and my gf is 16. We've been dating for almost a year now. I trust her a lot and the love between us is pretty genuine (as far as one can tell in a relationship). My gf lives with her grandparents. This is because she had been physically abused as a child by her step dad. She had also been sexually abused, but, apart from me, she hasn't told anyone else. Her mom knew about the physical abuse.

So just over a month ago, my gf and her older (married) sister visited their mom for a girl's night. She'd been talking to her mom more recently and trying to improve their relationship. So anyways, they all get drunk. My gf doesn't usually drink so it hit her pretty hard. She eventually threw up, cleaned up, layed in bed and passed out. In the middle of the night, she woke up to get water and someone with her mom in the other room. She assumed it was her older sister.

When she woke up in the morning, she noticed her bra was off. There was also a big bruise on her breast. She saw her sister was asleep on the couch. When she went to her mom, her mom looked worried. Her mom started apologising and told her that she had accidentally given her Xanax bars. Apparently, my gf had asked her mom for painkillers (for cramps) the previous night. Her mom said she gave two Xanax bars by accident since she was drunk.

My gf asked her who she'd been sleeping with. Her mom was hesitant on answering. My gf then heard her ex-step dad's voice and saw him in front of the house (driveway). She was angry so she went towards her car. Her ex-step dad made some disgusting and sarcastic comments (referring to wishing him a happy Father's Day) and toucher lower back. She got in her car and drove home. Her mom drove after her. When she got to her house (grandparents' house), her mom arrived soon after and cried and apologised to her.

When I found out about all this, I asked her to firstly get a rape kit test done. She went to a hospital and she said it would cost $270. Since she barely has any money (&lt;$100 savings), I told her I would pay for her but she insisted she will pay me back. She got all the tests and also scans for her chest. I gave her another $300 or so for consultations etc, since we found out she had a broken sternum. In total, we spent around $630.

The results of the rape test came back as positive. This really hurt her because she felt bad that she lost her virginity to him. However, I kept telling her she hadn't and I was generally supporting her. There were a few nights she cried to me and had panic attacks. It was a difficult time for both of us.

I wanted her to press charges but she wouldn't. She still feels scared of him and doesn't want the pity or shame that she thinks will come with telling others. Many times I was close to just doing it myself but she made it clear she wouldn't talk to me again if I did.

Fast forward 5 weeks. I'm currently away (on holiday with my family). She messaged me that the hospital called her and said the results were ""inconclusive"". They said they wanted to redo the test because apparently the original examiner was new. They asked for $25. I told my gf to call them and say she will not be paying as they owe it to her. She said she tried but they were saying it's the cost of the time it takes them. I eventually said ok, I'll give you the money. However, she messaged me just a little while after. She said that she told them off and they apologised and offered to do it for free.

She went to the hospital and then came back and messaged me that they told her she actually hadn't been raped. I asked her how did they manage to know that, she said that they drew blood. I asked her more questions on how it was possible to tell from blood. She said that she thinks they just compared the new blood sample to the old one. She told me she watched over them to make sure the results were correct this time.

I was sceptical of all this because this method of using blood a month after the incident wouldn't work. She got a little angry when I asked her if she was sure etc and asked me why I wasn't happy. Of course I am happy to know it didn't happen. However, after posting on reddit and being told I was probably being lied to, I'm just confused and lost right now.

Furthermore, my gf told me that she wants to see her mom. I've told her she can't see her for a while because I don't feel comfortable. I've made it clear to her that I don't trust her mom. She was invited by her mom but she told her mom to get rid of her ex-step dad if she wants my gf in her life. Her mom has said that she will. My gf wants to visit her this weekend. I don't want her to.

Sorry for the really long post. I want to know exactly what has happened in the last 5 weeks. However, I'm not sure how to even ask my gf. I do not doubt she was hurt - I've seen the bruise myself. However, others in my previous legaladvice post have pointed out many inconsistencies with her story.

How should I go about approaching/asking her about all this, without sounding like I'm against her or I don't believe her. I'm one of the few people she trusts and I don't want to mess that up for her.

I really don't know what to make of what happened today. A part of me tells me that she may have just told me that she hadn't been raped to make me move past it. She had been telling me recently that she wanted to forget it and move on. I told her that it was difficult for me to just forget it. This also relates to me not letting her visit her mom. I don't know, but maybe she just told me this to ""help"" me move on?

Any advice is appreciated.",26Jul2018,4
118,"Here's my story. I'm 15, and everyone in my family is Christian. Two years ago during the summer, I dated a guy. He wasn't interesting and I didn't really care for him, but I wanted to experience something new. We were friends before we dated, and we more or less stayed friends while we did. He and I were sitting on a bridge (for bikes to cross the road) looking at cars go by when I first felt it. An urge. I wanted to kiss him. I didn't, mostly because I was spineless. I just stared at him. It was the first time in my life that I felt something like that, and for a boy! I turned away from religion, and stayed with him. He didn't really like me unfortunately, and from what I could see, was just using me to show people that he wasn't straight. I broke up with him two months later at (ironically) a Bible camp. I came back to Christianity, and thankfully I hadn't told anyone in my family my feelings except for my twin, who I share everything with. I told him that it was just a phase, and I told everyone else the same thing. Including myself. I left that behind. Even today, I hate who I was that year with a passion. But over the course the last couple of months, I've been thinking. You see, most of the comedians that I listen to are athiest (by coincidence) and listening to them, I started to agree with what they said. I started to poke fun at religion, and I started to fantasize about having sex with guys. But I couldn't bring myself to jack off to gay porn. I could do it to straight porn easily. I've watched gay porn, and I get turned on by it, but I just couldn't do it. Ive been thinking more and more about it involuntary, and it's driving me insane. I currently have a crush on a friend of mine, and he's wonderful. Just thinking of him makes me so filled with joy that I can't control myself. I get giddy and I want to be around him all of the time. Back to the comedians, I was listening to George Carlin earlier today, and he said something that struck a cord in me. He sakd ""I tried to believe that there is a God, who created each of us in His own image and likeness, loves us very much, and keeps a close eye on things. I really tried to believe that, but I gotta tell you, the longer you live, the more you look around, the more you realize, something is fucked up."" I just stopped. I just couldn't lie to myself anymore. I wanted to believe in God. O wanted to die and I wanted to go to heaven to live and worship my creator for eternity while evil incarnate suffers in it's own demise. I wanted to be a Christian. But I just can't anymore.

122,"For the record, I’m 15 and my parents divorced when I was about 6 years old. 

Also, my post might be a bit scattered as it’s 1am and I’m basically thinking through my whole life and trying to condense it into several paragraphs. Apologies 

My parents are *far* from perfect. Ever since their divorce, they’ve proved unable to raise me properly without another person assisting them mentally and financially. Most of my morals and personality were taught to myself by myself, except for my great grandpa who was like a secondary parent throughout my life. 

My mother has had her own issues, but within the past two years or so, she’s improved her faults and I can bear living with her now. I think her finding another long term partner helped. 

My father is the polar opposite. He’s the same and I cannot stand it. I could go on and on, but in short he’s narcissistic, self pitying, invasive, petty... you get the picture I’m trying to say. Really, he hasn’t changed much from being a teenager. 

I honestly only visit him to make him happy. I don’t do it for myself. The only thing I gain is seeing my dog, and I have games and what not over there. My dad basically has tried to raise me likes it’s still 1950 or 1960. You always have to “respect your parents” and never complain and whatever. He treats me more like an object than a human with rational thoughts and desires. I’ve had to bottle up so much throughout the years, it got to the point I had to vent *daily* to some online friends who were understanding enough to listen. He’s pretty rude to other people to, which is relevant later. He’s morbidly obese and is self conscious about it. Sometimes he’ll flip out at people if they accidentally bump into them. He’s also the “let me see your manager” type of person. He’s a polar opposite to me and I can’t stand it. 

A lot of the times we have arguments. It’s toxic as hell. Usually what ends up happening is, is that I say something that doesn’t align with he wants me to think or say, flips out at me, I get mad at him, and this repeats until he says sorry and then basically forces/guilts me into saying sorry. It’s never a heart-filled sorry from me, because I usually don’t think I’m in the wrong. But this shit happens like every month because of how narcissistic he is, and this story is another one of those arguments that escalated more than usual.

We were out at a garage sale a couple weeks ago. I was looking at some used Xbox 360 games which were $5 each. A steep price if you ask me. I didn’t plan on buying them. Then my dad decides to ask how much they are to the guy. “5 bucks”. My dad overreacts and says “Oh wow, that’s way too overpriced” to the guy’s *face*. I can’t put it into words, but the way he said it was pretty rude. And he said it *3 fucking times* to the guy! I was so damn embarrassed that i just gave up and went to the car. My dad starts complaining about the price in the car and I *calmly* tell him, “Dad, I think that was a little bit rude” in the middle of his rant. He looks at me, and starts scolding me about “omfg, you’re not so perfect either” and basically yelled at me for 3 minutes about I wasn’t perfect and shouldn’t judge him. I said *nothing* the entire time. When he stopped I decided that I had it with him, and said “this is why I spend so much time at mom’s” god damn silence the rest of the car ride. We get to his house and he basically says “You are such a disrespectful little shit. I’m not fucking tolerating this. Pack your shit up and I’m taking you home.” I obliged, and went on my way after saying bye to my dog and grandma. 

It’s been weeks and I haven’t talked to him since. My mom claims he demands an apology from me. She’s tried reasoning with him, because even she agrees that he was rude, and I was already aggravated by stuff that happened *that morning*. But my dad’s narcissistic ass won’t listen and demands I call and apologize. He’s not getting a damn apology. I said the truth and shouldn’t be ashamed of that. 

To be honest, if I didn’t have my child hood dog over there *and* all of my video games. I’d consider not doing anything. But I want to see my dog in his last 5 years or so of life and I have way too many games to just let go of.

I’m 17 and a boy I met through a mutual friend started talking to me about a month and a half ago now. I’m not the type of girl to be flirtatious and I don’t see why he would be attracted to me (Wow, that sounded depressing.) so I don’t think I did anything to lead him on. He asked if I wanted to go to the movies with a group of friends and I agreed, but at the last second he said the others flaked out. I didn’t think anything of it at the time but now I’m almost certain it was just a set up so that the two of us could be alone. Anyways, the day after the movie he texted PARAGRAPHS about how he felt about me. It was quite uncomfortable because we only started to talk to each other one on one a couple of weeks prior and he hardly knows anything about me. I was honest with him right after and told him that I’m not in the right place for a relationship, especially with a person who goes to a different school. 

I told him I only wanted to be friends but he can’t seem to take a hint at all. He keeps on trying to find time that we can “hang out” again but I really don’t want to go anywhere with him, especially if it’s alone again.

125,"Hey Reddit, what’s up, this is quite important to me however I'll try to keep this short. My question is towards the end.

On an online dating app, this woman of Malaysian heritage (who is on a student visa) contacted me, and I thought she was pretty, and after some usual chit chat she was happy to meet up, so we met up for lunch and had a nice meal and chat. The date ended well wherein I asked her if she was happy to go on another (she was happy to) and I hugged her as we parted ways, which was the first real bit of physical contact considering I didn’t hug her at the beginning. We're in our 30's a few years apart.

I sent a message afterwards saying nice to see you blahblah lets catch up again soon and she said sure let me know when you're not busy 😊.

Literally a couple of days later I said that I was going to be near her area so we should meet up in the evening, and we did and had a nice night where we got closer physically (not sex, but cuddling in a secluded area).

We get on really good, our personalities fit, and I'm definitely attracted to her. I asked her when I could see her next and she said Sunday (it was Tuesday at the time). A friend of mine was criticizing that part about asking her when next, saying that the ‘players’ don’t do that stuff they just have a good night and say bye and someone contacts the other soon. But I’m thinking, well, at least I know what’s coming up, as she works a lot

Here's my question- even though she contacted me first on the app, the power relations have obviously switched- in that I've since been the one who has taken initiative/charge by asking if we could go out again and asking when she is free next. So now until Sunday… there’s no contact… it would just feel weird and stagnated… and then I guess bang we see each other sunday… I mean, obviously I could message her more. I get the feeling she won’t message me as like I’ve taken control lol. We never made phone calls before we met.

I tried to call this other girl, this other time, before we met for a date and she was like ‘nooooo awkward lol lets just meet up’. So what I’m saying is not everyone loves the phone calls.

I don’t want it to just go until Sunday with no contact (like I said obviously I can text her, which I will do eventually) but what’s the best thing to do?",26Jul2018,1
126,So I was on my usual commute home tonight and I saw a car hit a dog doing about 40 the dog got up and the car drove away like nothing happened. I stopped and tried to see if the dog was okay but it ran through some pretty thick underbrush and I lost it. Is there any way that you guys can think of to report the car who hit the dog? I wasn’t really sure what to do I didn’t eat the license plate but I did get a pretty good description because the vehicle had been rear ended recently. I’m really not sure what to do but I plan on going back to the neighborhood tomorrow to see if I can locate the dog or it’s owners. ,26Jul2018,2

This is not the first time I've had this issue and the complex reimbursed me for the faulty unit.   The bedroom is always substantially cooler than the living room / kitchen.  This time it was determined that the unit had no Freon.  I cannot get the complex to communicate with me via email.  They never gave me a work order when they came in and determined the lack of Freon and my apartment is still hot and uncomfortable.

135,"So my roommate (Wifey) just got married in May the day after she turned 20 years old to this 25 year old guy (Hubby). Everyone thought and still thinks that they are going to get divorced, they even placed bets on it (I know... it's mean and sad... but you don't know the whole story...) Long story short, they got married in less than a year because Wifey told Hubby that they would have to get married soon if they started dating. His response to that ultimatum was ""is it possible to love two girls at once?"" that's right... He loved two girls at the same time... :| ANYWAY, less than a year later, they got married and what do you know? They decided to live with me and my other roommate! (There is much more to the story but it's too much right now.)

So my other roommate, (her name is going to be Roomie), and me were like ""okay, cool... cheap apartment rent for school! We are down!"" We had already lived with Wifey for a year and it was fun! So we agreed to live with Wifey and her new husband... Poor mistake. Today we discussed upping the married couples rent because Hubby got his first full time job. We have a three bedroom apartment totaling to $1260 a month. Before Hubby got a job, Roomie, Wifey, and I all decided on $400-$400-$460. Wifey and Hubby would get the master bedroom and bathroom for $460 and Roomie and I would get our own rooms for $400. Well TODAY I requested Hubby and Wifey to pay a measly $25 more on rent ($485 total for them combined) because Hubby had a job now and technically Hubby and Wifey would only have to pay $242.50 each a month considering they had two incomes. They freaked their shit out and even threatened to move out. Roomie got upset because she thought that they were being obnoxious about a small $25 and so was I. We all finally were able to agree on the new price but now half of the apartment is really upset. The problem is, Hubby and Wifey are too poor to go anywhere else because there is no fucking one bedroom apartment where we live that is $485 or less....

145,"We had to put one of the cats down on Tuesday. The cat had kidney failure and congestive heart disease for the past two months. The heart medication made the kidneys worse and vice versa. It was a no win situation. We have him an IV drip twice a day and two meds but he was slowly deteriorating. Last week he didn't sleep with us anymore, soiled himself, didn't eat or drink and lost a lot of weight. He stayed in his safe space and didn't move all day. 

We took him to the vet and was told he was dying  and could have heart attacks and seizures so we made a decision to let him go the next day.

We tried to make his last hours enjoyable. We let him. Outside in the garden, we spent hours with him. The whole procedure was done at our home.

But in the final moments, my girlfriend said he was in fear when the vet came over and injected the anaesthesia. It took five minutes for it to kick in but the cat knew what was happening. He was panting and looking to my girlfriend for help. Stretching his paw out like he usually does when he's struggling to breath. 

I don't know what to do or how to comfort her. I try to tell her it was the right decision. But she says it doesn't feel like it. He was in so much fear.  She could see it in his face and it's haunting her. Like she betrayed her best friend. Like the cat trusted her so much but she killed him and broke his trust and caused so much fear in his final moments. 

We were told it would be a peaceful final moments and euthanasia would be the appropriate thing to do. But it doesn't seem like it.

147,"Around 2 weeks ago, early in the morning, I let my dogs out to go to the bathroom out in our front yard, and my over energetic puppy dashed right across the street immediately, unfortunately at the same time a car was driving past us. I rushed over to help her, my body in full shock, and she bit me on both of my hands because she was so scared, which after the entire situation gave me a visit to the ER. I keep reliving this entire situation, I can't stop thinking about it, whether I'm out socializing with friends, or I'm alone in my room trying to sleep. It blocks my thought process and it keeps me from being happy. I thought I had coped with it after suffering and moping around with two useless hands for a week, trying to comfort my other dogs and family members about it, but the thought never goes away that what if I did something different that could have saved her? I have another past traumatic experience with the death of another one of my dogs, but this is lengthy enough so I won't go on any further.

157,"So I've read this article about twins (including the comments) [https://christinabaglivitinglof.com/five-reasons-your-twins-dislike-each-othe/](https://christinabaglivitinglof.com/five-reasons-your-twins-dislike-each-othe/) and it completely speaks my mind. 

I'm a 23 M with a twin brother. We have been going to the same school all the way to college. I've always tried to convince my family (including him) to go to another high school, college, but they never wanted to listen. They would just blame me for being a bad brother. I've always hated that. I always wanted to make my own path, I've always wanted people to refer to me as me, not as us, I've always hated when everyone assumed I liked what he liked, I hated when people called me out and if I showed up without him, they would be surprised. I hated that I had no individuality, no personality of my own in the eyes of others. He would never make friends of his own, he would always invade my group of friends. He would follow me around everywhere, if I wanted to skip class, he would come along, if I wanted to hang out with somebody, he would come along, if I approached girls at parties, he would just follow me around as well. The thing with the girls was the most frustrating of all. He was always the most awkward person I've known, and every time I talked to girls around him, I felt him listening, because he was always around. And I've always felt awkward around him because of that. The only times that I had ever gotten close to a few girls was when they were out of his groups (and he would invade every group of my friends that he could). Also, when I tried to have a good time, like go out drinking and having fun, whenever he was around, he would never drink and just follow me around and watch me, all the time, making it impossible for me to have a good time (like a little brother hanging out with you all the time). In high school or college, he would always want to sit next to me in class, he would never skip class without me.

I've always been ""the big brother"", even though we were twins, and I was always blamed if I ever wanted to do something without inviting him, if I wanted to go out without him. Everybody expected me to do everything, and if I did it without my brother, I would be blamed.

Because of that, it was hard for me to even get a girlfriend (yea, I blew it a few times with some girls out of our groups, but I know that I could have done better and I could have had way more chances if I had a little privacy). I feel so frustrated because I absolutely know that my life would have been so much better if he gave me a break, if he gave me some space. I never asked for much from my parents or my brother, I never did. I just wanted this. I've been asking for this privacy, for us to go to different schools, high schools, colleges ever since I was in middle school. I always told them this, but also bottled my feelings when they turned me down, blamed me and so on. Now I'm at the end of my patience, I've been feeling so frustrated for so long now, I sometimes hate even talking to him. ",26Jul2018,1
158,"Hi, I will cut right to the chase.

For about 6 months I was in an online relationship with a girl I really, really loved. She really loved me too, for a while. Eventually it fizzled out. I will not color it nicely for either of us- she was really awful, manipulative, and abusive to me emotionally and verbally. I was abusive to her as well, emotionally. I became very dependent on her and very, very needy to the point where I would sometimes threaten to hurt myself if she blocked me or left me. I will not make any excuses or explain my situation or anything because I want to be 100% honest and truly own up to this behavior. I have read recently that mental illness and issues are not your fault, but they are your responsibility, and I really want to take that responsibility and not blame any of it on her. 

All this ended with me going to a mental hospital for treatment and when I got out, I spoke to her one last time. She was very cruel, but she had been for almost our entire relationship, so I should have expected it. I blocked her then, in a moment of rare clarity, and have not had any contact with her since. I have thought recently about sending her an email to apologize for my part in the relationship, explicitly telling her not to respond and then I'll be blocking the email address but that I am truly sorry for any duress I put her under and I hope she is doing well. However, knowing her, I think she would hate to hear from me again even if it was an email like that just to make peace. She was most definitely not a touchy feely type, at least not after I got to know her. 

Without contacting her and making that peace however, I don't know how to make things right. I truly feel awful for ever being like that with someone, embarrassed and ashamed of my behavior. I want to forgive myself and move on, but I don't really know how. I have definitely moved on from her and have no romantic feelings at all for her, it's been nearly 2 years. I just want to move on from my own bad behavior. I have been in a romantic relationship since then and was not the same way at all, but I still can't seem to let go of what stress I must have put her under. She was not an angel, but that doesn't make the things I did okay no matter my situation or hers.

I'm sorry for my scattered thoughts. It's a hard matter for me to deal with or talk about. I should add I have been in therapy for a long while since.",26Jul2018,1

At this point I told the officer I only have a Hungarian ID as I moved to Hungary for my studies and was visiting the US to see my old friends.  After 5 minutes he steps out of his vehicle and gives me a public urination ticket.

The officer had my old address from a previous incident (where I didn’t get in trouble, but they did record my personal details) but my entire family and I sold our home with that old address and we all moved to Hungary.

The dog is kept in a crate \*even when she is home\*. I've tried letting the dog out of the cage multiple times but I was literally yelled at, they basically told me it's not my dog, and to leave her alone. And back into the cage she goes. She's only a pup, she got her roughly 5 months ago.

Also, this isn't even the first time it happened. They had another dog that they left in the cage all day. She eventually got a horrible abscess on her neck and died because my roommate didn't want to take her to the vet. She even lied about bringing her to the vet, she said she brought her and that the vet said it was cancer and there was nothing they could do, which is absolute bullshit 100%. Also whenever the dog is out, her kid just beats on the dog and drags her around, and they don't do anything about it. I can't just sit here and watch it happen again. My living situation is complicated, basically I'm dependent on these roommates for a place to live.

I plan on gathering evidence of neglect through short videos and/or pictures of the dog locked in the cage at pretty much any given time of day, and presenting them to an authority.

161,"Hey gents, I've got a question about a girl I'm seeing. Not to be picky, all help is appreciated, but I would prefer advice from men (or women) who are familiar with Corey Wayne and his work and views on dating as I have found in my personal life for his methods of attracting and dating women to be the hands down best advice out there for men seeking to catch the women they want.

That being said here is my situation: I'm currently seeing this girl that I messed up with in the past (Texting constantly, approval seeking, being needy etc etc all the stuff you shouldn't do) things have been going okay now that I'm following Corey's work, however, ive asked her out on a date twice now and she's rejected both advances and so, I've stopped asking her and initiating contact with her. (Though she has always even in the past been the one to initiate contact first usually) She keeps contacting me though and blowing up my phone. Per Corey Wayne's advice I keep the conversation short and end it with something along the lines of ""It was really great hearing from you, Ive gotta run, but keep in touch"" this however doesn't go well and she gets upset and says I'm playing games with her.

Corey has talked about this in his book and has done videos on this but he assumes that you're in a relationship with the girl in both the videos and text. However, like I said, she and I are not dating(as she has rejected me twice when I asked her out) or exclusive so I can't heed his advice which is to make more dates with her. What should I do?

Questioning why I work in a company which just exists to sell meaningless stuff to a lot of people, to make more money to build more stores to sell more stuff to make more money... You get the idea.

Or questioning if my current relationship is my final one. Having doubts, although I love my girlfriend to death and I could not stand the thought of ever hurting her, physically or mentally. 

It's just my brain asking ""is this really it?"" or ""is that all there is?"". Instead of just letting me be happy with all that I am fortunate enough to have, my brain doesn't let me laugh anymore, doesn't let me simply enjoy things the way they are.

I probably should and probably will see a psychologist about this, since I don't seem to be able to solve it myself, but I am just curious who found themselves in a similar mindset and how they got out of it.

Thanks in advance, guys.",26Jul2018,2

I know sometimes we hold onto regrets about another person whereas that person has literally not thought of us for one second, and that often this type of thing is more about closure for yourself than for the other person. Sometimes it's more selfish than helpful to them.

185,"I did freelance work for a guy with a start up company that constantly took advantage of my kindness for six months. He made it clear he wanted me to become a full time employee of his once he got the investment he needed.

He is the type that made a bunch of false promises to get what he needed from people. He's gone random weeks of not wanting to pay me so he'd tell me to take a vacation on Monday when I'm irritated to work and then return two weeks later even though he promised consistent work. He also ended up offering me much less than promised as a full time job with a small amount of unpaid vacation, 3 sick days a year, and made up ridiculous policies. And it's not like he had an HR department or established benefits yet so if I had an issue I'd have to deal with him directly.

Luckily I got an offer with my current employer and happily let him know I would no longer be able to do with for him and I would not be accepting his (crappy) offer.

He was rude leading up to my final days. For example, my dad knows him personally and he invited us to lunch together as a sort of ""thank you"" to this guy. He showed up and instead of eating lunch with us, he started yelling at my dad in the parking lot for encouraging me to take this other job and that no one will understand me and put up with me the way he did (which makes no sense to me). 

Also he's a narcissist but I don't even want to get into how he constantly comments from his business account on Instagram to his personal account about how much he literally loves himself.

Anyway I haven't spoken to him for a month until he randomly texted me about something I have no way of knowing about so I assumed it was meant for someone else and didn't answer.

He ended up emailing me saying how I offended him by not answering him but he wants me to do work for him this weekend (no mention of cost) and is expecting an answer this time.

I really want nothing to do with him. I don't see how someone untrustworthy can be a benefit to me in the future when I only did work for him for several months. I don't want him as a reference.

189,"I'm new to this subreddit, but I feel like I should get as much input as possible.

To start, I've been training for the military and went (and currently still am) on a huge weight loss streak. I am currently down 65~pounds, but I'm still 30~away from my goal. I've lost focus, and I often plateau after large periods of significant weight loss. But lately I've made no weight improvements in over a month.

I am 19 as of last June. I do not work any jobs, and I live with my parents. My days consist of waking up in the afternoon, eating, going on a morning bike ride, baths, reading, video games and the gym towards the end of the night. My friends like to play long sessions of video games almost every night, and they're in similar positions to me. I feel like I haven't truly improved my self over the last year. I do not have a drivers license, and I'm hoping to get one soon.

My parents are great, and I love them to death. But I can't help but feel ashamed for essentially doing nothing but lose weight for a year, and I haven't been giving the weight loss my best effort either, there is always the temptation to lose it later, and not worry about now.

I am very thankful for everything my parents have done, but I feel like I'm just wasting time, where as people I know are going to college and moving up in life. I feel like I am wasting my youth, but I also don't want to make any commitments to a job or an SO. I guess to sum it up, is that I feel like I'm on standby mode every day, days in which I feel like I'm not doing anything to stimulate my growth.

My dad (a veteran) is quick to remind me that the military is only one option of many. I've told him multiple times that I want to join, and I really do, but to turn it down now after a year of doing practically nothing to improve myself except lose weight feels terrible.

In short, I've been dieting for about a year (with a recent stint), and in that year I feel like I have done nothing to improve my self, whereas my peers are off doing things worthwhile (I feel like I can barely do high school math anymore). I want to join the military, but time is dragging on and being on standby is putting me off.

190,"Hello there, I'm at a loss for what to do or where to go from here but here's some background information.

About 6 years ago I started experiencing some random symptoms that lasted only moments and only occurred once every few months. However about 4 years ago, those symptoms started occurring more and more frequently and with greater intensity. I didn't know it at the time but I was having anxiety related panic attacks. 

I spent almost a year trying to figure out if there was something physically wrong (because I was in denial), if I had a rare illness that the doctors just hadn't been able to identify yet. But test result after test result came back clean. 

Early 2015 the attacks had become so intense and frequent (happening daily) that I was unable to work (among other  regular daily activities) and have not yet been able to return, although I am receiving professional help for social anxiety, depression and ocd now but the progress seems minimal at best.

I feel as though I've lost my identity along with my career and friends, etc. And starting new might help and get me back to a normal life. So that I can feel like I'm contributing in some way.
And obviously financially I'm not in a great place either. 

My home life includes my wife and two kids. I exercise somewhat regularly and have recently lost 70lbs in an effort to get healthier. 

My current symptoms are what's holding me back. I struggle with public places and interactions. I have daily energy crashes where I could possibly pass out for an hour or more. I have other anxiety symptoms that will randomly present themselves including feeling like passing out, disorientation, confusion, etc. 

So I'm here now, looking for suggestions for jobs that might have flexibility, or do not require a typical 40 hour work week with normal stresses or limited human interaction and the ability to walk away for periods of time and return. I only have a high school diploma and part of a degree in psychology, I dropped out of university, unknowingly to me at the time, due to anxiety and stress. My work background is in sales and management but that's what I was doing when this all started.

I've been working in the same place for a couple of years now.

I am a quite organized person, independant, but a good team mate as well.

I am lucky to be surrounded by co workers who are willing to do way more than they are meant to do, as I do, in our workplace.

The fact that we all do more ( paid or not ) was triggered by the fact that our boss is a very unorganized person.

Often, we would face backlash from customers as meetings were booked with the boss but he's not here ( for personal reasons), or several are booked for the same time slot, or there is no room available. 

He ends up often sending back customers home because of that, or doing the meetings in unconventionnal places like a parc or a cafe.

We also face backlash because he never hired a cleaning person, but doesn't do the cleaning himself ( none of us are meant to do it ) or tidying up, so the premises can be very filthy and untidy.

For years, we tried many times to talk to him about it, he would be very apologetic but then he won't change his habits.

In the last few weeks, I really went out of my comfort zone and really trying to talk to him as a friend to make him understand that for the best of all, we cannot continue this way. He agreed, let me take some decisions, but then wouldn't change anything about him and would be very aggressive if anybody tried to confront him about it.

This left me with a strong dislike of physical contact, and a total lack of desire for participating in any kind of touch or intimacy. Never dated or anything for that reason.

I've lived this way for decades now, but one of the recent changes I've had in therapy is that I am starting to be able to see those events as having been something separate from sex as a whole. That what I have rejected and what I haven't been able to approach should be something different from what had happened.

This feels like a big step in perspective being able to separate the two. But the problem is I don't know how to tell my therapist, or if I should tell them.

We haven't really discussed much about sex because I'm not comfortable discussing it. It's mainly been about what happened and how it's affected me.

The problem is, when I used to think I'm a guy, I really did think so (I wouldn't call it a phase, I just wouldn't be so radical anymore). So, I changed my name to a guy's name. And what is the problem? I absolutely despise both my original name and my new name now. 100%. Both of them have negative connotations in my life (original name reminds me of childhood neglect and my parents forcing feminine roles on me, new name is generally just shitty and doesn't fit me as a person + reminds me of me being cringy and edgy as a teen).

What do I do? :( I want to change my name, but it feels dumb because it's been done once already. I also don't know what name I should be. I honestly feel like I don't have a name, and it feels like there's a hole in my identity. Anytime I get called by any other name than my nicknames, I cringe.

Even if I did end up changing my name again, how would I explain it to people who know I am doing it again? How do I explain that I regret changing my name when I don't want to talk about it?

I've talked about this with my boyfriend and he says that I should just simply change my name and ignore people who react negatively, but it's not so easy. And well, I also have no name in mind to change it to. Fml.

Like wtf? Cinema 4DX 3D is not your average cinema you go to, it is a 4D experience with 3D effects and much better than normal cinemas, and also the most expensive one per person which i would be paying.

what do girls actually want? i dont understand. going to a drink is boring and lame and cheap, everyone does that. going to the dinner is the same thing. everyone have done that a million times. i wanted to do something fun instead.

why is going to the movies bad for a first date? what do girls want?",26Jul2018,0

212,"My dad passed away 6 months ago. He was a heavy alcoholic drinking an average of 6 beers a night (probably more too that we couldn't see) which I think ultimately led to his death. My mom would drink before he died, maybe one or two glasses a night. Ever since my dad died however, that has escalated to a bottle of wine a night. This kind of drinking is not only a burden on me (19F) and my younger sister (14F), but it's starting to affect my mom's sleep. I see her every morning before work. She is supposed to work at 7:30, but I haven't seen her leave the house before 8 for I don't even know how many days in a row now. It has gotten to the point where I know she is going to get in trouble at work or even possibly lose her job.

I confronted my mom this morning asking her why she keeps going in late, and she says it's because of her insomnia. She ignores the fact that it is her heavy drinking that keeps her awake. But like all alcoholics, if I confront her about her drinking, she will get defensive and turn the argument against me. I don't know how to handle this situation. If I just stand on the side watching I'll just be watching her drink her life to ruins.",26Jul2018,39

We were discussing new ideas , I didnt have much to offer at that moment and he mentioned one idea and I went on my phone to see if it has been done before. So he then says “Stacy, you cant just hide in the corner and not say anything, do you have any ideas?”, I think he was upset I was on my phone. I didn’t have any at the moment and I said “ No but when I think of something I will let you know”.  Everyone kind of giggled but I found it extremely rude and embarrassing, everyone was looking at me.

214,"For backstory: we both currently work in the same city, with schedules that line right up with each other. It means we’re out the door by 7:45 every morning and back home by 5:15 or so. It’s a great schedule. The problem is that his job is literally killing him. His boss is a major believer in gaslighting, so my husband is basically always in fear that he’s about to be fired. 

Enter the job interview he had yesterday. It’s at a national company, the interview went great, and everyone genuinely seemed ready to take him on board. Unfortunately, the job is 45 minutes (if there’s no traffic, which there almost always is) away, and I would have to make that trip there and back twice a day, 5 days a week. I would have to stop going to the gym in the mornings, and I would have to cut down my own work hours from 43+ hours a week to likely fewer than 30. My husband is disabled, and can drive if he has hand controls which of course our car does not. There’s no way around me having to drive. 

To top it all off, we’re trying to move in about a year. To another state completely, halfway across the country. I know getting him out of his current job is a huge priority because his health has started suffering for it. I just have so many mixed feelings about making that many huge changes. Right now I’m of the mind that if the job pays enough to justify me working part time, we should just try to make it work. But I don’t know. ",26Jul2018,1
215,"My mum was a sweet woman, before she figured out I had anorexia nervosa, she used to try and make me feel proud about how I looked and even though it never helped, it was kind and well meant.

When I told my family and friends I had anorexia, my life turned bad really quick. I got yelled at, mocked, forced to eat, manipulated and hurt, great hurt. I lost my parents trust and love, my friends watch me eat, my SO got a burn out (I was the cherry on his pie of misery) and acute anxiety and I was left with anorexia and eventually my depression got worsened (to the point I wanted to die).

Like I usually do, I snapped out of the mindset after hitting rock bottom. I'm eating more and distracting myself, but every time my parents make a comment regarding my body (saggy deflated boobs, small butt, tiny thighs, big stomach, disproportionate) I end up in my room crying, like right now.

I'm sick of them triggering me and causing me to hate myself more. My body is my biggest insecurity, I'll never not hate it. Them adding to it is far from helpful. I told them this in a rather rude way and all they said was ""maybe this will make you eat more"".

222,"Hi all- so, I am 41F and I just found out I am 4 weeks pregnant of a fella (28M), and we are not together (and yes, this was a bit of a shock because we did make effort to be safe, so wow).   I honestly NEVER thought I'd ever be in this position.

About me, I am finally getting my life on track after finishing my doctorate and getting a job.  I have been taking care of my mother for the last year, she's going through some medical stuff, my sister is in and out of rehab, and generally my family is not very stable.   I am okay money-wise, but certainly not where I thought I'd be and under crippling student loan debt.  I don't have great insurance, and am currently in a specialized contract scientific position, that while is likely, is not guaranteed to go beyond a year.   I do not have a lot of support from my family, and well, basically I'm alone.   Additionally, I have always prioritized finding a partner over children, and I worry a baby is gonna make that difficult.  I also am okay with the possibility of step children, adopting later, or even fostering when I get into the position.  But also, this may be my last chance.... (but IS that really fair to fella and baby???)

He's got a good job, say she'd back me up whatever I would do (although it's clear he is not ready)-- and honestly, if he wanted to be involved I'm not sure what that would look like, since we're not together. So any ideas on this would be good.  Can these things work? What does it look like?  I really don't wanna ruin his life.  But....

So of my many concerns, I worry about actually being pregnant without support of a partner--- or with a co-parent who doesn't love me.  I'm not sure what that would look like except trying to visualize it as being on my own, and wondering how feasible that is.  Given I'm 41, there are a number of complications-- which make me nervous.  But, overall, the risk is not much higher after 10 weeks than a regular pregnancy. 

Additionally, in the next few weeks I can take the pill and terminate.  Mostly this is because I worry about having no support and trying to have a baby.  It seems so hard, and it seems like it would be even harder as an older woman.  I'm already tired.  Also, like i said, getting pregnant accidentally through basically a miracle seems to bode well for the future if that comes up, but as I've said, I already became somewhat comfortable with the prospect of not having children and having a different kind of life, one of solitude and scholarship (which would make me happy). 

I also worry, that given my terrible family history, I wouldn't be a good mother on my own.   I'm not sure what that looks like, especially without out the emotional security of a partner. 

So, I guess that's it.  Any non-judgmental input would be helpful, or perspectives from anyone who has experienced this.

He's been working as a roofer (we live in FL) and fell out at his job yesterday due to dehydration and while that could account for some of his weight loss, he would normally not let himself get dehydrated like this unless he was on drugs. When he's not using he's very into health and wellness, eating a balanced diet and taking care of himself. We had a very traumatic childhood and he started using drugs as a teenager but it's never been this bad. 

A few years ago, he was involved in a disaster at work that was on national news and resulted in two friends and coworkers dying and being rescued by a helicopter and he hasn't really been the same since then. He moved in with our parents (he's in his 30s) who are in complete denial about the whole thing and just want to protect him but aren't doing anything to actively help him. 

He also has a hell of a temper with me (I'm the bossy sister, duh) and I am not the person to try and get him help, it will have to be my father or brothers. I sat with my other siblings and my dad a few months ago and we talked about getting him help and we all agreed that our dad is the one that has to have the initial conversation with him, but my dad hasn't done anything.

226,"...down in the dumps despite of it.

Last year was really rough. I should feel confirmed in all my abilities, somehow I don't.

What happened:
My work got outsourced. That made me switch jobs. And as the switch went, within a month I was up to par with the seniors in what is 'a completely different field'. That feels comforting and not that good at the same time as my capabilities are more than what's given in the job.

I have a lot of knowhow; i am studying 8 to 12 hours every week, Microsoft certifications and following a bachelor in computer science at the same time. 

I have plenty of time for hobbies; sewing, running, cycling, going to the gym, tending garden, board games with friends.

I come out of a terrible relationship with a narcissist; emotional burdens, still having $50,000 debt as she made me sell my house with this loss, lost all my stuff. But, I am getting my own place again next month after one year of couchsurfing. And I have everything planned out for next month.

It has been a rough year, and I am coming through. Despite it all, i somehow need approval that i am a good guy. Most recently I am not approving of my physical appearance, i find myself ugly, which is new to me, i have never found myself ugly. 

I have the chronic notion i am not good enough, and this weight pulls me down. It seems impossible to feel good. This is what got me in with the narcissist, i now know.

232,"Fellow coworker (52/f) and I (26/f) have both gotten in arguments at least twice a week since we started two months ago. I’ve started to walk away to get some space / cool my anger, which makes her even more upset. I don’t indulge her anymore. 

For context we are the only two people on the marketing team. She doesn’t know anything about marketing. (My background is in digital marketing and she was a journalist for 18 years.) So, she often says she doesn’t feel valued because I usually take over the marketing related tasks and she does the content writing. I’ve gone out of my way to teach her basics like some SEO tricks, how to create a content strategy, what are KPIs, etc. However, we usually argue because someone disagrees with her. She got upset with me the other day because I didn’t understand something she was saying and asked her to explain it to me. I wish I could go into more detail about how ridiculous she is sometimes, but it would take all day. When she doesn’t get her way, she starts to cry. (This usually happens twice or three times a week. Often multiple times a day.) She’s argued with the COO - our immediate boss - to the point where he just asked her, “Why is everything a conflict with you?” 

We’re the only two people in an open office space with the COO in a closed office, so I don’t have a choice but to deal with her when she’s in a mood. And almost every employee who has dealt with her who works remotely or in the other offices acknowledges she has “moods”.  To clarify, she is sort of “my way or no way.” And when you don’t choose “her way”, she says she doesn’t feel valued. Once, she refused to work unless I gave her a list of stuff to do because she said nothing she does matters. 

I’ve been thinking about quitting if I find another job. It’s just been in the back of my mind because, honestly, I don’t want to be in a toxic work space. The COO has told me if anything is wrong then speak to him, but he is so passive 99% of the time that I don’t trust he will do anything, and now I know he won’t. Both of our job titles are the same. We were hired as SEO Writers / Editors. (I’ve privately asked my boss if I can change my title to Content Strategists because it makes more sense for what I’m doing, and he has approved.) Without getting a whiff of this conversation, my coworker changes her email signature to Chief Content Officer and proceeds to email the entire company, including the COO and CEO. 

While I was alone with the COO - she didn’t come to work one day because of a doctor’s appointment - he told me that her changing her title like that without a word to anyone was a big red flag and he’d talk to her about it as soon as she came in. We were to have a meeting. A week later...nothing. On top of doing 90% of the work and dealing with a coworker who literally yells at me if she is having a bad day, she feels oddly protected by my COO. He told me just yesterday that he thinks her and I can become very good friends, and that’s why he hired us both. That’s laughable. 

Now I’ve been looking almost every day. Most jobs I find pay about $5,000 less though. Advice - should I leave or stuck it up for $5,000 a year more?

233,"I just got notified that my rent is being increased from $900/month to $950/month. I have an opportunity to respond, and was considering asking for the rent to remain the same at $900, or for a less drastic increase. I have not received any promotions or salary increases at work over the past year, so a $50 monthly increase does not really fit into my budget. 

First of all, is it even appropriate for me to make this request? And if so, what is the best way to go about it? 

My landlord is not a single person who I know personally. It is a large, impersonal realty company, who owns a ton of buildings throughout my city. The letter they sent me informing me of the rent increase is signed &lt;Company Name&gt; Realty Group. The phone number they provided directs me to an operating system, and the email address they provided is a generic info@companynamerealty. Everything just seems so impersonal, so I am unsure as to how to proceed. 

The rent has increased by $25-$30/month each year previously, and I have been in the apartment for 5 years. I was thinking about writing an email, explaining how much I enjoy living in the apartment, why I don't want to move, and explaining that my own income has not increased. Maybe I could mention that I have been a good tenant (never late on rent, rarely need maintenance services, etc) over the past 5 years.

I’ve never been so in love but he was my first love. We dated 3 years and it’s been over 5 since we went different ways. He broke up with me by saying he didn’t love me anymore and it wasn’t fair for me. He lives in another country which was hard to deal with but we made it work. We wrote letters and sent creative packages. But we visited each other often and for long periods of time. He constantly surprised me and was the nicest, sweetest man I’ve ever met. I will admit that when we broke up I felt a weight lifted off my shoulders but my heart is still clinging. 

He is the only man I was okay with the idea of marrying. He was also the only many I was okay with having a child. I’ve never wanted either but for him I was okay with the idea. Sharing anything with him warmed me whole heartedly. 

I’m currently in a relationship. Have been for a over 2 years and I really care for him. It’s nothing like the one with my ex but i was having feelings for someone again and I ran with it. The feelings for my ex has been ignored and pushed back for a while. It’s hard not to think about him from time to time. I am always hoping he is doing great and living happy. 

Last night I had a dream I saw him on the street. I ran up to him and gave him a big hug. I was beyond happy to see him even though he was with another girl. I was so excited to see him and touch him again. In my dream it felt amazing. All my feelings came back. My heart was full. Then I woke up. He is still in a different country and I’m wondering if we will ever cross paths again. This morning I feel so sad, like we had just broke up again. I’m crying and want to see him again so bad.

A lot of workers die from heart attacks that work in those buildings it’s very odd)  Not only do I want to prevent any other health issues (I have new onset neurological issues that can be caused by mold but the state denies it has anything to do with the ridiculous amount of mold in the facility even though I live in a new home) I don’t want to be stuck at this job when everyone else has already applied for the new jobs and I’m stuck without one. 

If I apply for a new job will this place find out that I’m looking for a new job and be able to fire me? ",26Jul2018,0
243,"Hey everyone. First of, i'm going to do a TL;DR to clear up any confusion. I'm a 25 year old man who has been having panic attacks from childhood. My father was emotionally abusive, but we are on good terms now. I've been in therapy for almost 10 years now and on every SSRI known to man(or at least just about) as well as beta blockers, but unfortunately none of them have been able to help me, so i'm hoping somebody here can help me. I feel exactly three things. Fear, emptiness, and occasionally i'll feel sadness, but even that is rare. Diagnosis: Depression and panic disorder, though, the depression is only due to my apathy.

I legitimately want to stop living, although i'm not actively suicidal. I feel like a robot. I am very outgoing, and charismatic but it is just a front. I'm truly hollow. I don't enjoy anything anymore, as typical with depression. I used to love drawing, video games, running, and reading. Now I feel like they are all a waste of time. People tell me to just do what I enjoy, but i don't even know what that is anymore.

This is one of my last resorts, if i cant solve this soon I fear for my own sanity. Please help me if you can. Thank you.",26Jul2018,2

Well, after a relatively rough period in my life I dropped back down to 135lbs and now I just don’t know what to do.

251,"Me and my boyfriend have a long history....
Met in middle school, he liked me and not the other way around. Eventually he grew on me, we went to the movies, kissed but I didnt date him right away. He then ended up dating this girl. They dated for a year and she wanted ""a break"". He then invited me to an outing and we danced the night away, we began dating, the ""break""  of them became a ""break up"". She then felt as though she wanted him back after seeing us happily together. She lied about being pregnant with his child ect. All of our friends were mutual, and so she was around alot! Well..... a year of us dating, and I never lost my virginity to him. He was however whom I always felt my soulmate was. We talked with such a connection, would walk and lie underneath the stars and talk for hours, read books, play video games, every part of our relationship was beautiful, until he moved in and noticed how ugly/unhealthy my relationship with my mom was. I ended up spending less time at home, to the point I left him alone too often. Made him feel unwanted. He ended up asking to go to his friends house where his ex that he lost his virginity the year before was hanging out at. I found out way later that they ended up hooking up and he had cheated on me. Eventually my ""not caring enough"" led to him leaving me for her. (And no we had never had sex because of my fear of it at the time) we were young.... I was young only 14-15. I did however feel a whole lot of regret. I missed him for years. Dated other guys. They stayed together for 4-5 years. They ended up breaking up, and a year after their break up he messaged me. We saw each other inbetween a few times and always held a sadness in our eyes. But for the first time in seeing one another both single, we ended up immediately connecting all over again. Made love, cried, got back together and things have been beautiful ever since. We've been together for 4 years now. I'm pregnant with his baby, and well his ex girlfriends mom just passed away. She was a mess in the matter of having a drug problem but she also helped raise him. He lived with her for years growing up, even claims shes the reason he graduated. I dont want to feel the toxic emotion of jealousy and I know he would like to go. But I'm having a hard time knowing the ex will be there. I DO trust him. But it's her that I do not trust. She spent every moment while me and him were together as teens trying to get back with him, and finally got him when he was most vulnerable. The funeral will even be held in a different city. I live in alaska, the funeral will be held in kenai. (A long drive from here). I dont wish to attend myself, I only met the mom a few times, I dont wish to see his ex and am pregnant. (8 months) I know he loves me, I know hes sorry for what he did when we were young, but I cant deny the entire situation would make me nervous. Especially considering it might be a over the night type of ordeal. I know he was close to the mom though and THATS All THAT TRULY MATTERS....Still it just brings me back to all the feelings of what happend in the past.

252,"Despite a degree in psychology and a generally happy-go-lucky demeanor, I put up a humongous fight when it comes to adopting common ways of working on myself and my happiness. There's a recurring theme that emerges focusing on me seeing ""positive thinking"" as pure fluffy bullshit.

I read things like, ""say nice things to yourself every day until you believe them"" and immediately respond with well then you're just lying and deluding yourself. Saying them doesn't make them true, saying them makes you think you're better than you really are. Just typing this I'm getting angry. I don't understand my incessant need to fight positive progressive things. I'm not sure if I'm so not happy deep down that I can't accept the fact that other people could be, or somewhere inside I think I'm not deserving of happiness and confidence, so I fight any chance to be.

I recently completed a (academically) successful year in a masters program and then left because I felt called to a whole new field. I 100% know it was the right decision yet I still feel like a failure. I shit on all my accomplishments that I have achieved because of the ones I haven't. And I'm sitting here predicting what positive inspiring advice a lovely redditor will try to say to that and already thinking of a way to negate what you might say!! How fucking crazy is that!!!! Haha I am very overwhelmed.

I don't know how I've gotten to this point where I want to fight everyone on the supportive and encouraging things they say. I'm not where I want to be in life, or who I want to be, so I have these negative glasses on through which I view everything.

260,"Not sure the best place to begin. I was dating a guy LDR for a few months, but we planned that I would move to his city after I finished grad school because there were plenty of job opportunities for me there. Even though it was only a few months, we were both serious about the relationship and in it for the long haul. Then one day everything just kind of broke down and we realized that our long term goals were too different and one of us would always be sacrificing and neither of us would be getting what we wanted at the same time (religion, location, how to raise kids, big stuff like that). There were definitely small arguments that led up to the break down so it wasn’t completely out of the blue, but finally realizing that we wouldn’t be able to make it work as much as we wanted to was a hard and heavy realization.

So, now we remain friends. We had still been talking fairly often and I asked for a respite for a couple of weeks because it’s hard to get over a breakup when you go from talking every day as a couple to talking almost every day as friends. The break from talking has definitely been helping for moving on. I *know* that we aren’t the people for each other, but I’m not to the point yet where I can stop wishing that we could somehow make it work. 

On top of moving past the break up, I’m still job hunting. I kind of started from scratch once we broke up and figured I would just move closer to family instead. But, the jobs I’m most interested in are in the northeast and a job that I’m making some progress with is located in his city. A few weeks after the breakup I got an interview offer for a job I applied to in his city before the breakup and I told him about it, and he freaked at the idea of me still moving there. He didn’t think it was fair for me to end things and then still end up in his city and that it would make things murky between us, and I definitely understand where he’s coming from. I didn’t take the interview, but he relented that he can’t prevent me from moving there, though I know he’s still not keen on the idea. Honestly, I’m not thrilled about it either. I wish the job was located elsewhere, but it is where it is and it is exactly what I’ve been working toward.

If I was offered this job, I would accept in a heartbeat. But, I don’t know anyone in the city besides him and his friends. Obviously, it’s a big place so there would be plenty of ways to fill my time, but it’s easy to be lonely in a crowded room and I don’t do well with being lonely. I’m excited about this job, but scared about everything else. I have anxiety so anything unknown to me is scary. I’m afraid that I won’t make friends and that the winter will be longer and more severe than what I’m used to and that my seasonal depression will be more than what I can handle.

I guess I'm asking what other people see in this situation that I'm missing, things that I should consider that I haven't thought of yet.

**TL;DR - Ended an LDR on good terms, but I’m still job hunting which might land me in his city anyway. He understandably isn’t thrilled about having his ex in the same city, and I’m not thrilled about the idea of it either, but the job opportunities there are too great to pass up. I’m afraid of feeling lonely in such a big place. And on top of it all, I’m not to the point where I feel completely ""over"" the relationship.**",26Jul2018,1

267,"Hello everyone. I am struggling to come to terms with what has happened in my childhood continuing into my adulthood, it is now also effecting my child. I have tried to talk to my family but they make me feel like I am crazy. I am a 27 year old female. 

My dad has always had a violent streak. As children, we were subjected to verbal abuse (shouting aggressively) and physical abuse on occasion. My mum and dads relationship was also very poor at times, we would hear him shouting and swearing at her, as well as throwing things. This would happen maybe once a fortnight. The physical abuse only happened to me a couple of times a year. I remember one time when I was three and I kept crayoning on the wall despite my parents repeatedly telling me not to, and one day my dad just lost it and threw me up the stairs. 

When I was nine my dad had an affair and introduced me to the other woman. I would go for days out with her and her daughter, although I didn't know that they were having an affair at the time. Later, my mum told me about the affair and threw him out. A couple of months later he moved back in with us and my behaviour worsened and our relationship strained even more.

I was a very difficult teenager, I would truant from school, generally not care about anything. I was also very disrespectful at times. I think this was partially down to what I experienced when I was younger and my personality type. There were a few occasions I can remember as a teenager where my dad would push me, another when I refused to go to school and he threw me down the stairs. More commonly he would shout and swear at me. I want to stress that the physical 'abuse' only happened a couple of times a year which is why I am so confused as to what to classify it.

My dad also has an issue with when accidents happen, for example if someone accidentally hurts him he will lash out. A few months ago I opened to door, not realising he was behind it, and he slammed the door in my face and swore at me. Very recently, my 3 year old child accidentally hit him with a plastic watering can, and he says he 'saw red and may or may not have struck my child with the can as he snatched it off him'. This story changes depending on who he is speaking to and I will probably never get to the bottom of it. My child maintains that grandad hit him. 

When I spoke to my mum about it she said that most men have a violent streak and nobody is perfect. A lot of people have flaws and he could have had other negative traits like being tight with money. She said that I was a very difficult teenager and that most parents would have been beside themselves. She said most children have experienced being hit at least once growing up and people have much worse childhoods. My brother also says I was a very difficult teenager and most parents would have wanted to throttle me. I am so torn because on the one hand I am being told by my family that this is normal or deserved for the way I behaved. In another I know deep down that being physically hurt in an aggressive manner is abusive and I was constantly treading on eggshells as a child. I also don't accept the lashing out because of being accidentally hurt excuse either. I am worried about the influence that my family will have on my child.

I am going to start counselling but I am so confused by everything and what to classify it as. I don't know what to do, I have had headaches for weeks trying to sort this out in my mind.",26Jul2018,2

273,"I had an ED for about two years. And really only knew about it for 6 months to a year of it. I was in the modeling industry and somewhat successful so that’s where the root of my issue developed.

I use to LOVE working out (pre Ed) and ran almost everyday, had a healthy relationship with food. But then it became very excessive to the point where if I ate something I would think about how much I would have to work it off, and either work it off or just spit it out.

At my lowest I was around 110 pounds (I’m 5’9.5). Now I gained 25 pounds, and can see the differences in my body (can’t see ribs, hip bones don’t stick out anymore, gained inches on waist, hips). 

The only issue now is I’m severely weak. I can barely open doors, have issues with walking in heels (leg muscles are not there). I was in physical therapy because I was so weak my hips were not aligning right and it affects my walking and joint pain. 

So I’m definitely ready to work out. But it’s like pulling teeth. I’m scared of working out so therefore I don’t do it. But I know I need to gain some lean muscle of my life quality will go down.

I feel like I’m losing my mind. I see a therapist already and am prescribed medications but I still feel like my anxiety is taking over my life, I have no reign on it. 

I guess I’m just looking for advice on how to cope and deal with my mental health so I stop ruining my life.

277,"Hello, 

I have been moved out of my parent's house for some time now. I'm living with my boyfriend. Our lease is going up in September.

I have been trying to finish my degree part time while working full-time. I'm not really making progress. I have one semester of classes left and I should have my degree in hand after that. 

When I lived with my mom we fought constantly and the environment was some-what detrimental to my mental health. She has offered  to have me move back in to let me finish my degree. 

Should I do it? I'm concerned as I know my boyfriend would hate it, and I know I would hate it. I don't want to take a step backwards, I know he wouldn't be happy with this news. And I know I was miserable living with my parents. 

On the plus side? Degree and more job opportunities so I don't have to be stuck in this mediocre job for life. I'm already 24

1. She’s a friend of mines ex girl friend and he would most certainly hate me for doing it
2. She’s pretty crazy, she gets into a relationship and starts talking about marriage the next day and how many kids she expects you to have

Now this is why I want to have sex with her
1. She’s hot as fuck, like easily a 9/10 
2. I haven’t had sex in a while so I’m not sure when the next opportunity will come

For the last 18 months I've been training trying to get accepted for Marines OCS and become a pilot. This is always been my passion. My girlfriend has been entirely unsupportive of the endevour, though, and has stated that she wont follow.

Well... two days ago I found out I was accepted and am leaving in January. I was ecstatic and told everyone... *except for my girlfriend*. This obviously won't go well. Am informing her today. 

SOOO. That's life. Shit happens. People grow apart. I've accepted it. My immediate problem is this:

These next 4 months are going to SUCK. I'm losing her, I've lost all my old friends because they became meth heads, and my current ""friends"" are just people I know through my girlfriend. I was going to sign a new lease, but can't because I'm leaving soon. 

I'll be moving home with my parents, no friends, and working a boring finance job until January. It's going to be super depressing, I think.

What should I do? How do I make this easier? Am thinking about quitting in November or early December and giving myself a month to drive around the country and ""vacation"" alone.

So she has been gone about a month and the cat had a reoccurring wound I would treat every day. It would get better and worse... Yesterday I cleaned the wound. About five mins later I heard the cat making crazy noises like a sneeze which she does from time to time. But then I saw her stuggle to climb on the couch where she thrashed for a few second and stopped moving. I freaked out screaming her name.. she didn't move, she was slightly breathing but foaming and her eyes looked so creepy. I was scared, scared to look scared to touch but I somehow got her in the carrier called the vet and took off. She was passed when I got there. I have been hysterical ever since, one bc I saw the cat die I have never seen that before, two because I'm convinced I stressed her into a stroke and killed her and three because when the vet asked me if I wanted to go back and see her after she passed I said no.

I want to believe her, but she is noticeably drunk every day and has not gone through any 'drying up' period in the past couple years.  I know that my mom will likely die young (via drinking, heart problems, unhealthy eating, more drinking) and so I want to be with her while she is still alive, but it hurts so much to spend time with her.

I have tried communicating with her, being civil, trying to smooth things out and put these issues I cant change or fix behind us. But she constantly is petty and hateful with me and finds every excuse to single me out and harass me, its gotten so bad that everyone around me in the workplace is aware of it and joke about it frequently. 

She has actively done things to make my job more difficult like directly giving me orders not to do something, and then when i attempt to fix days later she comes down on me for taking to long or something similar when days worth of work has to be completed in a shift.

Our relationship was and still is very confusing, and the thing that remains through all of that is that we’re very good friends. 

The issue is that the guy that I used to hook up with , was someone I hooked up with for almost two years and we both lost our virginity to each other. 

I’m okay with him dating, and doing whatever else, it’s strange but I am. The thing is though, that last time we were about to hook up he said that  he had just hooked up with someone else, a day before. 

This whole time that we’ve done this, he’s never hooked up with anyone else, and never slept with anyone else. He hasn’t slept with anyone yet, but the idea of it happening makes me feel so strange. And btw, I did realize that things would change and we wouldn’t always be only with each other, I just wasn’t I guess, prepared to hear about it. 

I just have this feeling of jealousy that I can’t seem to get over. And when I talk about guys that I would hook up with or whatever, he shares that same reaction that I have to it. It’s just very weird for either of us to talk about that.

How should I get over this feeling? Should I hook up with other guys just so that I can stop feeling as tho this certain hookup had such an importance, as it was my only one so far. 

Has anyone else dealt with this and found a way of getting over it?

312,"I’m not sure if this is the right sub, but I had to get an outside opinion on my batshit mom. 

My mom used to be a really lovely, normal woman. Mental illness runs in her side of the family and over the years it has become apparent that it is what eventually caused her divorce with my father. She claims he abused her, but I witnessed their relationship devolve into her screaming at him while he stood quietly and attempted to pacify her and apologize, exactly how “arguments” (her deciding to pick a deluded fight) went with me.

My mom has a great education with multiple college degrees, but at some point she decided to get into energy healing. It began with her interest in “Empaths,” which was a bit funny to me considering her constant aggression. From that she got interested in crystals, reiki therapy, etc. Any kind of alternative healing you could imagine. She was looking to find ease for her fibromyalgia, which during the divorce needed to be confirmed by multiple doctors however the diagnosis was denied by many. Despite that she still claims to have it. Then she became interested in something called “Core Energetics.” 

She’s fully sucked in, she’s now almost finished her training I believe she has a year more to go. I met a friend of hers from Core and they joked about the cult status of Core Energetics, I was horrified and they just laughed. She’s dropped almost all her money on this bullshit, over 10k a year just for the training plus more for their required therapy which is only allowed to be done by other Core practitioners.

She’s now looking to find a studio to teach clients this garbage that she’s paid so much for and fully believes it will help people, so much so that she refuses to assist or support me in getting traditional therapy for my depression and chronic panic attacks. Her mental state is declining, she believes she has “spirit animal/energy” dragons that surround her, and she can send them off to send good/bad energy to people near her. The latest development is her starting a NEW training for a NEW weird energy healing thing “Trauma Release Therapy” aka TRE where you lay on the floor and “shake” the trauma off.

This is already so long and not even close to all the issues. She’s wasting all this money on this and distancing herself from her whole family. I’ve tried to talk to her about it, but I fear the screaming fit that will result if I tell her how I really feel. How am I supposed to bring this woman back down to reality?

I am finding a wealth of articles to use and cite, but a lack of primary sources and older studies from the era on my topic.

Aside from the minor barrier of paywalls for a few articles, I am able to access most of what I need. Some articles, such as initial papers by Fritz Hauschild (who first synthesized meth in Germany) are in German.

I do not speak German and do not have hundreds of dollars to shell out for professional translation. I have considered putting a couple of sentences at a time through Google Translate and interpreting the paper off the rough translation to English.

I was wondering if anyone has any other suggestions on how to overcome this obstacle? I suppose I do not NEED to cite the original article, as I can simply cite English language articles that have translated that article and mention its content. However, most academic papers do examine the primary article and this is a paper I hope to present at a conference.

I was so excited for this job and now I’m nearly having a panic attack at my desk because I’m so stressed. 

Long story short, my cubicle is directly behind this girl who I will call P. We’re the same age (21) but very different people. She wants to party, get drunk, talk about the dudes she meets on tinder, etc. you know the type. She’s obnoxious and I wish I had known that on the first day. I’m very quiet, I just want to be left alone to do my job and go home to my pets and guy. I don’t want friends, I don’t want to hang out with anyone. I’m polite to an extreme though and that’s what got me into this mess. 

First time I talked to P she seemed normal enough and I thought since we were the same age she might be alright to chat with sometimes at work. Except she INSTANTLY went into clingy best friend mode. She corners me at my desk and talks about her boyfriend in jail who apparently beats her and cheats on her who she loves soooo much, but then turns around and asks my opinion on every boy she swipes on on tinder. We have different taste in men and when I say that I don’t think someone is that good looking she gets wildly offended. 

She messages me constantly on the work chat and yells at me from her desk if I ignore her (even going so far as to call me a bitch at one point! ITS BEEN LESS THAN A WEEK!!) to the point where I can’t get anything done. 

She tries to get me to hang out with her on every break, today on lunch I had to drive away and sit somewhere so she would believe I was out running errands and couldn’t sit with her. She smokes and I don’t and don’t want to be around it, which I know would make her angry if I said. 

She invites herself to every thing in my life. She asked what i was doing this weekend, I told her I was going on a charity motorcycle ride with my boyfriend where we will make stops at several bars and such and she instantly said “I want to go!” which confused me greatly... normally I’d take that as a joke and brush it off but she’s brought it up numerous times since then. Then I made the mistake of mentioning that my boyfriend has a pool at his house (context was that we had to clean it tonight) and first thing out of her mouth was “I’m so coming to your house!” 

Firstly, it’s not “my” house. I just live there. Secondly, I never invited her! Never even insinuated i wanted her there!! 

She’s just so overbearing and rude and loud and pushy and I hate her guts and my heart stops every time I see her. I’ve been sneaking around the office in the hopes she won’t see me going somewhere and try to talk to me, but I can’t really avoid her since we sit right by each other. 

How can I subtly get rid of her? I’ve tried being boring and keeping to short answers but she doesn’t take the hint and just...talks more to fill the gaps. I wish I could complain to the manager about it and maybe get my desk moved but then I’ll forever be known as the girl who complained in the first week and can’t get along with her coworkers, which is not me and not what I want to be known for. We’re temps to hire, should I wait for the contract period and hope she quits or gets fired soon? Please help me escape this girl. I’ve learned my lesson about being polite, I just want this to stop. I want to be excited about my job again. ",26Jul2018,1
317,"As the title states, I overheard the accountant the company I work at talking to someone on the phone. Told them my age, pay rate, hours worked, and some other things.

My step-Grandma is trying to get me to go to college by telling me if I take two years of Japanese and the Asian culture class she'll pay for me to study abroad for a month, while my uncle told me to go to college and get a bachelor's degree in something. I didn't really say anything to either of them because i never really thought about college. I told my Parents I wanted to act, because it's been a dream of mine. But my stepmom said it doesn't ""Fit or seem like me"" because I'm an introvert and have anxiety, while my dad simply said he doesn't think I'd make it, because he never made it in his music career and told me he just didn't like the idea of me moving away from him.

324,"I am 20, male, and i am highly infuriated right now. Today is the day I discovered my unconscious sexual desire for my mother (Oedipus complex). I wasn't aware of this until my SO brought it up a few hours ago. I was mad at first, I lied to her and myself and I made her suffer a lot, but it's true. I am attracted to my mother.

My mother is very obsessed with me and throughout my entire life, from my childhood to my adolescence and until now, she made several attempts at becoming intimate with me, but I always denied and suppressed the idea that she might display genuine sexual interest in me.

I find it utterly disgusting, I am sick to the bones and I am going to do WHATEVER it takes to get rid of this.

So, my question would be if and how I can erase this stain from my personality. I need to know what kind of therapist to seek out, what kinds of therapy/medication to expect. I heard that hypnosis is a nice way of reprogramming the subconscious.

So I applied the no-contact rule and I was doing very well, until the moment that my damn phone betrayed me. I don't know if she already saw the call (I turned off my phone's Wi-Fi at the moment I noticed the call).

He can't imagine how things he does or says can hurt other people. He's not communicative and I feel like I can't do this anymore. I'm the type of person who wants to talk about stuff, serious issues, politics or just stuff that's been bothering me. He's also really insecure about himself and doesn't have the guts to talk to strange people and when he does, he gets all awkward and weird. This has been getting on my nerves lately.

330,"Tw:Sexual Harassment

This is a cut down version of an email I sent to my old boss 6 months ago. However since these events took place I've been struggling with wheter or not they would consitute sexual harrasment as I am considering filling a complaint.

I currently work in the same building but in a different department so I occasionally will run into this man, T from my old job. Whenever I see him I become terrfied, scared of some kind of confrontation with him. This fear is so bad I'm considering leaving the company I'm working for all together. I am angry that even after complaining to management he was never repreimanded. I know of at least one other person who also quit because of T's behavior, and it honestly makes me furious and sad, and hopeless.

Anyway here's the excerpt from the email I sent to a supervisor.
:
:
 I noticed it about a month ago. It was the end of the night, and I’d just finished the dishes. Trying to finishes the dishes quickly I’d splashed some water on my apron, which had soaked through to my shirt underneath, leaving the fabric on my stomach visibly damp. I didn’t mind because I was so close to clocking out. On my way back into the kitchen I ran into T, between the ice machine and the shelves with unopened boxes, and cups. He immediately looked down at my stomach.


    “Your shirts wet,” He said, all the while looking at my stomach. Since his gaze was so transfixed on my stomach I looked down at my stomach too. This is when I began to feel uncomfortable, so I laughed and responded as if it was no big deal, telling him about how I’d just done the dishes and how water had splashed on me while I worked. A few seconds later I moved past him and went home.


    The week of Thanksgiving I stopped by the kitchen searching for the skimmer needed to clean the oil at the fry station. Not being able to find the skimmer I headed back to the kitchen. As I passed T and the dishwasher he slipped his finger down the space between my wrist and my glove, dripping water into my glove and tugging the glove halfway off my hand. I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed but hid it by complaining that he’d ruined my glove. He responded by saying I needed to change my glove anyways since I’d left the kitchen, however, he did not need to touch me to remind me of this.


Later that same Tuesday before Thanksgiving T was walking through the kitchen towards the front of the restaurant. I was at the warmers, putting chicken on to buns. As he passed me he poked me on the outer part of my shoulder. I remember that his hands had again been wet, and his finger wet my shirt where he poked me. I also remember standing, stunned as I focused on the buzzing in my arm. He’d pressed so firmly that for several minutes it felt like he was still there, touching my shoulder. Again, I was distracted and uncomfortable for the remainder of my shift.


    Last Saturday creates in my mind a great anxiety around returning to work. I don’t remember when exactly it happened, only that I still had about four hours left in my shift. T came into the kitchen to change the soda boxes in the corner. Instead of walking on the side near the fridges, salad and cooking area where there is plenty of space he chose to walk through the narrow space by the window. As he walked past he stopped, placed his hand on the small of my back and looked into my eyes and said “Hi”. 


He stayed there for a minute, his hand on my back, looking at me. I expected someone to say something like there was no reason for him to touch me, but no one did. I stepped away from him and walked across the kitchen. He remained standing in front of the fry station, talking to the other cooking staff. Because of where he was standing I couldn’t continue to work, which irritated me as I’d been struggling to keep up with the demand that day. I felt extremely irritated and I paced back in forth for the thirty seconds it took him to move, trying to think of something useful to do. 
:

Again, I know longer work in the position but want to know once and for all if my feelings are justfied and if this would be considered harassment.

I've tried to move on, but am struggling. Advice is appreciated.

332,"A friend of mine is mad that I didn’t accept her apology, the problem started when I started dating this guy, that we were both talking too. She considered him “just a friend”, and me and this guy hit it off well. 

We eventually started dating, and my friend got jealous to the point that she kept telling people that my boyfriend is “too cute” to be with me, but she sent it to a group chat that I was in... 

I sent her some angry texts to tell her that this was not ok, and that she only thought of him as a friend. I also told her that what she said was not ok, and that she needs to learn about being kind towards others. 

She blew me off for a couple days, and she called me to let me know that she’s sorry, and I didn’t think I was ready to accept the apology, after all I’m not obligated to accept apologies, so I rejected the apology. 

I called back a couple days later, and admittedly at this point I was fishing for her apology, so I called her. She answers the phone saying “what do you want?”, which contrasts from her usual “hey!”. I asked if she was alright, and she just tells me that she wanted to take a break with me. I asked why, and she just tells me she has nothing more to say, and hangs up on me. 

I tried one more time to fish for an apology, and tried buying tickets to a concert, and I visited her house. She answers the door, and for a second she seemed interested in what I had to say, I told her that I’m accepting of her apology a while back. She dramatically closed the door slowly and before it closed she told me that she was “took back” the apology she made. I heard the door lock too, which is also uncharacteristic of her.  

Am I to blame at all for this? Because I was going to accept her redo at apologizing, I only brought up the fact that I now accept her apology just to bait her into making another. ",26Jul2018,1
333,"Figured it was time to ask for some advice on this. For the past year or so, I've been hooking up with quite a few women but havent ever been able to cum (without condoms I've come closeish but with condoms i never come close), whether they give me head (i seem to feel very little sensation / arousal during head) or we have sex (I just keep going for a good while and then I tell them I finished).

I keep it casual with these girls, so none of them have been girlfriends - my friend told me its the lack of emotional connection.

Things to note:

* I'm uncircumcised
* I am definitely attracted to girls
* Never had a long term relationship
* Stopped watching porn (6 months ago), I masturbate maybe once a month / every 2 months.
* I have found the girls attractive (pretty/cute) - never hot. Some of the girls I havent really found attractive but I just carry on anyways in a sort of emotionless fashion.
* I have only ever ejaculated once with a girl (a handjob) - wasn't attracted to her.

334,"I quit my job this morning. There are a lot of reasons, and I guess I let it all boil over, and here we are. But now I’m conflicted, and I really need advice.

I’ve worked for this particular company for over two years now. When I first started, my job was “Research Technician,” which is a fancy term for “HVAC Processor.” Basically, just data entry for rebate applications.

The company itself is a stressful, high-turnover location. New agents get a day of training, temporary employees get cancelled at the drop of a hat, and current workers suffer the blows to manpower by an increased demand for overtime. They do not offer holiday pay, and even major holidays are only given off if we aren’t behind in our programs, AND if we make up the eight hours within the same pay period. 

When I started the job, I was processing one program. They started me off on one of the most difficult programs, but I’m intelligent and pay attention to detail, so I quickly excelled. I was at the top of every production chart (the company stresses speed over accuracy, and keeps a chart daily to show everyone who is churning out the highest number of applications). It’s a small town, and data entry jobs that don’t involve telemarketing are rare. I was making $9.50 an hour. 

Fast forward to the present. In the past year alone, my job duties have tripled. I went from one program to EIGHT. Three of those programs, I handle entirely on my own. As in, I enter them into the system and approve the checks with no middle-man doing quality control. I send flaw notifications to the contractors and customers. I escalate higher system issues to program management. I handle the program mailbox. I complete monthly error reports. I train new agents—sit with them, go through every facet of the manual, and attempt to teach them everything they need to know in their one single day of training. Management is absolutely terrible at responding to questions, even to new agents, so these agents send me a constant barrage of questions and issues all day (as I’m the only one who ever responds). I also train agents remotely using Skype Business (a difficult process when desktop sharing is slow and laggy, mind you). 

A few months ago, I finally got a raise. They sat me down, gave me an assessment, applauded and commended my efforts and success. Gave me a 19 cent raise.

I make 9.69 an hour. I make less than the new hire agents that come in through temp agencies who I TRAIN. I’m an introvert, to be honest. I work very hard and I don’t have the audacity to demand what I deserve, and this company has absolutely taken advantage of that. Striving to be the best here has resulted in nothing but more and more pressure on me, more of a workload to handle each day, and a blow to my morale. Recently, I’ve lost the will to keep trying. I feel that this place doesn’t deserve me. They KNOW how much I do, yet don’t choose to recognize it. 

So this morning, I called in with every intention of quitting. I’m the only person trained to do at least four of the programs I do. I know it was a blow to the company. But I was fed up. The call-out line is a recording, but this morning it was down. I couldn’t leave a message—it just kept hanging up. So I just didn’t show up.

I got a text from my manager. I explained the deal. [This](https://imgur.com/a/bC8se2f) is what I said. And her response. I included a screenshot of the phone call as well (just to prove that I did in fact try several times to call and leave a message). 

Now I’m conflicted. I’m not a brave person. I don’t know how to demand more. I don’t know what to say when I speak to her. I don’t know whether going back is a good idea. I don’t know how to say “I need more money” and I don’t know how much to say, either. I’m confused. Please help. ",26Jul2018,1
335,"I'm a 20 year old male. I live in the United States.

I don't know why people always ignore me when I'm out. When I go out with friends or my family, employees or other people never make eye contact with me, smile at me, or speak to me. However, they do it with whom I'm with. Like when I go out to eat with a friend, the waiter/waitress only greets and acknowledges my friend as if I'm not there.

I was at the grocery store recently with my brother, and when I got to the checkout line the cashier was very cold towards me. However, when my brother made his purchases she was much more open and friendly with him. This happens a lot. When I make purchases with a cashier, the cashier almost always chooses to acknowledge the person I'm with over me, even if I'm the one purchasing.

Whenever I'm hanging out with friends or family, people only choose to acknowledge them over me. When I go out for walks people only smile and say hello to the person I'm walking with.
This doesn't happen to me literally all the time, but it happens most of the time. It's like I'm invisible to people.

I don't know why people don't like to talk to me, smile at me, or approach me. I don't think I'm ugly (Many people have told me I'm an attractive guy). I'm a nice person, I'm not mean or evil.

The only thing I can think of is that I'm really shy and introverted. I'm not the most confident guy. I can be a little awkward.

Annoying curfews and constant nagging/being interrogated when going out makes me feel like a child. Granted, my family all loves each other and whatnot but we bicker constantly and being around each other is often miserable or unpleasant. My older brother, who is a drug addict, is coming back to live at home. Whenever he is home all hell breaks lose. Mom coddles his every need and dad is irate with his manipulation. The household becomes toxic and my parents tend to lash their anger and frustrations with me. I am a university student, and don’t want to be around a hostile environment when I should be focusing on me &amp; my life. I used to drop everything to help my brother or family but it has gone unappreciated. I also crave a sense of freedom away from my parents who constantly fear of my whereabouts bc they worry I will follow my older brother’s life style. Not only is that impossible, but it’s insulting they don’t trust me. They are so closed minded that even a guy friend of mine can’t step foot upstairs to my room because “what if she’s up there having sex with her so called friend??!” All the while my older brother has had his girlfriend sleep over too many times to count.

341,"I’m a woman in my mid-20s. My whole life has been mired in PTSD from childhood abuse, rape, and several abusive relationships including a marriage that only officially ended last October. At this time last year, I had nearly died of sepsis and I was homeless. I was taken in my my now-ex and his family because I had quite literally no one else. 

Right now, I’m nearly 6 months pregnant with my ex-boyfriend’s baby. I kicked him out after finding out he’d been cheating on me for most of our relationship. I had to move into an apartment across town with a coworker/roommate who I know is deeply in love with me, though I feel like his love is a product of his own significant traumas. I’m probably the only person in his life who’s ever been kind to him.

This roommate and I had to stick together because neither of us have anyone or anywhere else to go. I lost my job due to my pregnancy and he quit his thinking he’d been accepted somewhere else for a new one, but not quite getting it. We’ve had to live off of credit for a few months to try and get by, but money is running out. I recently got a job that pays daily, but I don’t get many customers and I haven’t been hired as a “full” employee yet. I’ve put out 126 job applications within the past 30 days and this is the only opportunity for work that’s come up. As it stands right now, I’m the only one working (or trying to). I don’t say that as a dig at my friend, but as a statement of fact. We’re counting on my college financial aid coming in so we can pay September’s bills.

My roommate is also going through a lot in his life, most of which I feel the need to tiptoe around here due to the nature of it. Basically he’s going through a divorce and is embroiled in a bitter custody battle for their children. He’s been experiencing mental health problems for quite some time and has attempted suicide something like 8 times now. I was the one that stopped him every single time, even when the stress was a threat to my pregnancy. He’s admitted that he wouldn’t be here without me.

I know he’s trying to receive help, but with very little progress to speak of thanks to the medical system. He and I both agree that his symptoms most closely align with Borderline Personality Disorder and we hope that his psychiatrist will take this into account and give him the help he so desperately needs. In the meantime, his mental health problems create a great deal of problems for me. I feel like I’m barely able to leave the house or do the things I want without it becoming a huge issue. He and I have gotten into fights that last for HOURS over things like a Facebook comment from one of my friends, me updating my profile picture, me wanting to hang out with friends alone, or my phone usage habits. He fluctuates all the time on how he sees me. Sometimes I’m his best and dearest friend in all the world and he loves me so much and can’t imagine me not being in his life, then a few hours later he’ll turn on me and accuse me of manipulating him and lying to him, using him as a resource, and trying to fuck him over like his wife.

He especially doesn’t like how I’m handling the situation with my ex-boyfriend. He’s convinced that my ex and his entire family are horrible, awful, manipulative people that are trying to trap me into marriage so that my ex has someone to take care of him because he’s lazy and entitled. He doesn’t like that I still talk to my ex, that I still visit with him and his family, and he’s completely appalled by the thought that I might go back to him. My roommate says if that happens, then it just proves that I was using him as a resource and a buffer so I wouldn’t have to feel the consequences of my stupid actions, so that I could live in this little “teenage fantasy” (his words) of having “the hot guy with the big dick” and no responsibilities. He thinks I’m trying to play both sides of the fence and that I’m not actually thinking about my child’s wellbeing at all.

Meanwhile, my ex is pushing for reunification NOW. He wants me to move back in with him and his family immediately so he can start taking care of me and we can raise the baby together and be a happy little family in a tiny little house with 3 other people. My ex doesn’t understand why I still live with my roommate and is extremely upset by it. Explaining that my roommate has no one else or has significant problems of his own has no effect. It’s getting in the way of what my ex wants and he can’t handle it. Somehow it’s acceptable to throw me under the bus so he can help his “friends,” but the reverse isn’t (long story).

Ultimately, I don’t know what the hell to do. I feel like I’m being torn apart. I don’t know how to get out of this situation or who to trust.",26Jul2018,8

377," My parent asked me to make a video playlist. I said sure, assuming that this was another work related project. They then informed me that this playlist was to be shown at a family gathering.

I immediately cringe. My gut tells me these weren't going to be silly animal videos.

Sure enough, the links are ""truther"" videos about the Illuminati, end of times, etc.

...I feel so defeated and saddened at the same time...

My parent has a diagnose-able psychosis in addition to their narcissism. Their family history of psychosis further supports this. Moreover, there is evidence that my parent's family had avoided addressing these issues even in the earliest years of their childhood. I am extremely saddened by all of this. I have continuously urged my parent and their spouse to get counseling/treatment/help for their auditory and visual hallucinations. However, they refuse for a multitude of reasons which can be summed up as ""government control"".

What is most frustrating for me is the self-aware psychosis.

The best two examples I can think of: my parent feels empowered when they make others uncomfortable/uneasy during group gatherings. To them, squirming is a sign of the devil being effected and God is pleased with them sharing the ""truth"". And then, they brag about how they went to a random holy place (church, temple, etc) and purposefully made comments that they knew would upset regular members/believers. They KNOW that their behavior is wrong but they laugh when they describe the look of fear and discomfort on our family members' or strangers' faces.

Now, take that info and combine it with the fact that they ""receive"" visual and auditory ""instructions"" from God. This playlist happens to be one of those instructions.

So far, as I am aware, none of these instructions have been physically harmful. The playlist itself is not physically harmful. However, the videos are mentally malicious. Malicious in that the purpose is meant to cause discomfort, verbal altercations, and validation of my parent's psychosis. It is not a playlist to stir actual discussion.

And so, I've made the decision to make the playlist.

Why? Because whether I make the playlist or not, they will somehow push their ""truth"" at the family gathering - they've done it time and time again. Holidays and family gatherings are prime time.

They are aware. They understand what they are doing. They seek a certain reaction or enjoyment from the discomfort of others and frankly, they are going to get it - playlist or not.

Would you make the playlist? If not, what would you do differently?",26Jul2018,1

When my girlfriend got hers, I was out of town, and seeing pictures made my heart race (with a strange mix of feelings) and I couldn't stop thinking about tattoos for the next week until I could get back to town. I couldn't believe that, knowing her, she just... DID it. Every time for the next week that I thought about her tattoo I felt a strange mix of titillation, admiration of her boldness, and maybe fear, and I could feel a shot of adrenaline being injected into me, making my heart rate increase from the mere thought. The mix of feelings was entirely new to me, and I could think of nothing else to do but engage with it. So, I did what any confused 20-year-old would do and I binge watched tattoo channels on YouTube, I researched my own design, I researched the process and cost of tattoos and laser removal, and after a week, I finally got back to town, determined to go to my consultation and join my girlfriend in The Tattooed World as soon as possible.


When it came to actually going, though, I had a huge anxiety attack. Which is NOT normal for me. I don't struggle with any mental health issues that I know of, and I've certainly never experienced anything like that. I just spent hours laying on my bed thinking about how big the decision was. I realized that if a tattoo would last 1-5 years, I would have no problem with it. I'm not afraid of the price, of needles, discrimination (mine would be hidden), or even of a bad tattoo (my design is pretty simple). It's entirely the permanence that scares me. 


My worries attacked me at many angles, which I can now logically debunk. Here are a few:


•	I asked myself, what right do I have, as a 20-year-old, to make a decision that will affect me for my entire life? And then I remembered that because of a little thing called linear time, I do that constantly. 


•	I saw a close-up video of a tattoo gun, and I thought “jeez, how could I ever do that to my poor skin?”, before realizing that I regularly abuse my liver, a much more important organ, by drinking alcohol. 


•	I kept thinking that having tattoos would make me a sort of different person, before realizing that that was just a holdover from my religious upbringing. 


•	I know that I won’t face judgement because any situation in which my shoulders are out is a situation in which tattoos are acceptable, even cool. In academia, my future workplace, no one ever has to know.


•	Tattoos aren’t even permanent now if you have money to remove them, which in the future I hope to have.


•	I don’t need that shoulder to be bare for any purpose. Apart from hating the design, which I don’t think is an issue knowing it, myself, and my planned future, there’s no reason I would ever need it removed. Even if I need a bare shoulder for a day (can’t imagine I ever would specifically, but just devil’s advocate--) I could cover it with makeup. In the meantime, that shoulder could house a design that I love and that I feel expresses me and what I love.


•	The one reason I can’t dismiss, however, is that my parents and extended family will eventually find out, and they will not like it. 


Eventually my girlfriend was able to talk to me about it and we discussed all of these reasons, and why they weren’t valid. Still, the permanence of tattooing did not stop scaring me. 


It's been about a week since then and I did go in for the consultation, and I had a good experience in the shop. It wasn't enough for me to shake this feeling, though. And now that some of the novelty of my girlfriend's tattoo has worn off for me, I find myself feeling differently. When I catch a glimpse of it in a snapchat or when I just remember that she has it now, that stab of mixed emotions comes back, and it feels overall negative now. Like I'm scared for her because it's visible, even though I know that 1. (the most important), she likes it, and 2. she can cover it up. And in the end, my feelings about hers don’t really matter. It’s her arm and she can do what she wants with it, obviously. I think seeing hers just reminds me of my own fear. I don’t want to make her regret her decision or make her think I don’t like it. Because I do, it’s pretty, and it makes her happy. So I’m reluctant to tell her this side of my feelings. I don’t want to respond to a snapchat of her saying “feelin cute today” with “that gave me anxiety”. Obviously. 


She told me that she got it so spontaneously because “I wanted it for a long time, I realized nothing was stopping me anymore, and so I just did it”. That kind of boldness also scares me a little, I have to admit. I think some of my anxiety may be worry for her on that front, what some part of me may see as a rash decision. But I know she doesn’t think of it like that; her family has always been more accepting of almost everything, and she wasn’t raised to think of tattoos as something for deviants and criminals like I was. I have to ask myself if all of these reasons my brain is coming up with are really just the ghost of my highly religious grandma’s voice telling me as a child that if I ever got a tattoo I’d be disowned. (Although that’s not something that I’m remotely worried about, she was exaggerating).


I thought through a lot of this yesterday, imagining myself actually going in and getting the tattoo. Picturing the ink entering my body was not pleasant. I realized something huge. I don’t even think of it as a good thing.
Here I am, having planned and wanted this tattoo for two years, visualizing the ink as some sort of evil outside agent grabbing hold and festering inside the body, thinking when the needle first would hit me “too late now, you’ll never get it out now “. In real life, watching my girlfriend’s tattoo heal I find myself thinking “oof that’s just getting more and more stuck in there”. Shouldn’t I be thinking “yes, finally the design I/she want/s to be there?  Self-expression yay!” I don’t know why I’m thinking about it like some life sentence disease!


But it’s not as simple as “I don’t want tattoos”. Because I really do. Since I was 16 I have wanted something or other, and this continent design has been on my mind for two of those years. Now the thought of walking away and not getting it isn’t any more satisfying than the idea of getting it. 


So I decided on a trial run. I bought a temporary tattoo from Inkbox and I’ll use it to test drive the tattooed life. Really, since I’m planning on making my shoulder piece possible to hide with a t-shirt sleeve, I shouldn’t notice this thing except when I take my shirt off, which isn’t really frequent. This may help me get over one part of the fear, the knowledge that this thing will be with me forever, just chilling on my skin, whether I want it there or not.


I’m sure a lot of this sounds odd to any seasoned professionals, I know most people don’t go through this thought process. And I guess that’s what I’m looking for by posting this. I know I’m overthinking it compared to a normal person, and I’ve shown how I know my fear is irrational. I just want to hear your thoughts; on the emotional side, dealing with permanence and anxiety, on the logical side, why it would or wouldn’t be a negative thing.  Maybe you’ve felt something similar to me, or you can see a major hole in my logic. In any case, I’d welcome your thoughts. Thanks.

385,Hi guys. This is a bit of a strange situation. I'm on some pills which shot my sexual drive up a lot and getting laid would be nice however my parents are bordering on psychotic. I'm 20 (Female) and not allowed to exit the house without them or take my car to places without them knowing (they installed GPS on it). A  good solution is going to a guest house about 3 minutes from my house (not walking distance. long lonely road) and my fwb will meet me there. I have only been allowed to drive by myself to work which was 10 minutes away. Any ideas of a good excuse to get out the house by myself? because i am stumped. ,26Jul2018,1
386,"27 yo male here.

Some backstory:

My mom, I and her husband (not my dad) have been living in the same house since I was a kid. They drank every weekend and fought pretty much constantly. Anything and everything would suddenly lead to a +2 hour shouting match. I quickly became resentful of them, hated living with them. WHen I was 10, I decided that I would stop viewing them as familiy and only ""people I live with"". That´s how bad it was.

At the age of 20, my father died and my then GF left in the same week. I was devastated, dropped out of school. Felt completely lost. My mom and her husband were fighting as usual. An important detail to note is that I live in a country/city where it is currently VERY hard to get an appartment. You basically need to wait in que for atleast +8 years (different city = different que) to have the slightest shot of getting one. Renting 2nd hand is VERY expensive, so is buying an appartmen (if you are lucky to even get a loan). Moving out as a young person is therefor very difficult.

I managed to get a crappy fast food job and decided to just work my ass of for as long as possible while still living relatively ""cheap"" with my mom + her husband. I saw it as my final revenge for the years of torment they let me suffer through. The years went by, and I spent almost all of my time working so I didn´t have to put up with their BS. The money piled up. As they got older, the drinking lessened and their fighting started to become less frequent. I started, for the first time in my life, actually WANTING to get to know them on a personal level. I actually wanted to spend some time with them when they weren´t in their normal alcohol-fueled argument mode.

So, fast forward 6 years after my dad died. I have now saved aprox 200k. Still no education, but I managed to get a decent-paying job a few years ago. Sadly, the company is closing down so I will be out of a job within 6-12 months. 

My mom and her husband have been talking lately about selling the house and moving somewhere else. If they do, I obviously won´t move with them. But on the other hand, I won´t have any place to stay or a steady job here for much longer.

The only thing I have is my saved money. I have NO CLUE what to do. Move abroad? And do what? Move to another town? What if I can´t find  another job? Start studying? Studying what?

I have no real frendships or relationships in general that are keeping me here. 

These past years I´ve been living one foot out of the door. Just saving as much as possible so that I can GTFO when the day finally comes. Now, the day is more or less here and I have no idea where to go next and I feel completely lost. I know just getting the F out would probably be the best option, but taking that step is scaring me to death. If I leave, I never, EVER want to come crawling back again.

I´ve been thinking about traveling for maybe a year, but then I still have to come back eventually and try to get a stable job + apartment (which will probably be even harder then).

Any advice is much appreciated. My life have sucked these past years and mostly consisted of working,

 but it´s the only thing I know. I´ve adapted to this mess, in some weird way.

Anyone that has been in the same situation. How the F do I take the step?",26Jul2018,2

390,"Hi everyone,

So I am unfortunately lucky enough that my driver license expires the day of my 21st birthday. I bought/ordered a new one online a little over 4 weeks ago (on June 26th). I was told it would arrive between 2 and 3 weeks, so it was supposed to be at my home on July 17th at the latest. I called the CA DMV this Tuesday (July 24) to see where it was. What happened was that it shipped out July 11th and it made it to my local post office, and for whatever reason the post office just mailed it back to the Sacramento DMV office. The Sacramento DMV office put in a new order for a new license, and they've told me that it will come in 30 days. They also told me to call my post office to see what the issue was bc there was no issue of the address (at least on their end) (I did, and rather than actually looking anything up or doing anything, the man just yelled at me for 20 minutes about how it is not his fault). I called the DMV again and my license order has been put in, and it is currently in manufacturing. I checked to make sure the address was correct, and it was. Once again, I was told it should come within 30 days.

What I am worried about is that, once again, my license isn't going to come in the mail on time or that the post office is going to send it back again with no explanation. My birthday is in 19 days and I am 8 hours away from home for school, so my mom has to overnight my license to me. I have plans to go to San Fransisco 2-5 days after my birthday (so 2-5 days after my license expires). My boyfriend already bought us tickets to do a 21+ museum night, and he was planning on taking me with him to bars and stuff. I don't want my license issues to ruin this trip for us. 

Do you think that bars and the museum would care too much about my license being expired for a few days?

To add support, I have my debit card with my name on it and my student id with my name and picture id on me at all times since I keep it in my cell phone case wallet. So I have other cards that show I am who I am.

I also understand why bars usually don't let people in with an expired ID (they could have given their old one to their younger siblings). I'm an only child so that doesn't really apply to me, but there is no way to prove that really.

I also read online that you can get an id card and it would work fine. From what I read, it seemed like the DMV just handed it to you when you went, but I'm not sure if that is true. Is there away to go to my local DMV to get a document or an ID card that I can use when I go to San Fransisco? 

Thank you",26Jul2018,1
391,"To make a long story short, I needed a job and here I am. I majored in Communications with an emphasis in Journalism. When I was interviewed for a position at an office for a marketing coordinator/administrator position I didn't take it seriously. But they won me over with talks of running the company newsletter. As it turns out they like me as well. 

Fast forward a few weeks to now and I am way in over my head. I have done ZERO tasks related to marketing or journalistic writing. This mainly seems odd because I am the ONLY person in marketing at this branch. The first two weeks all I was tasked will was learning how the company operated, which was easy. I hardly did anything or was asked to do anything. But today I'm starting to lose my mind. 

I've been continuously reminded that I'll be overseeing everything that involves the ISO (International Organization for Standardization). They asked me once in the interview if I knew anything about the ISO and I said no. I've poured over work documents in the ISO folders but I'm lost. When I'd ask the administrative manager or vice president or anyone what my specific role will be in relation to it I get long winded answers that don't answer the question or I'm simply told I'll be overseeing it. I've even told them I'm trying to make sense of everything. The president of the branch came back from a business trip today and now I've got more responsibilities with all these forms and processes I don't understand. I'm too nervous to even turn in my latest project. This stuff seems to go over my a lot. 

It also doesn't help that I can't really understand my direct manager too well due to her accent. It's awesome that she learned a second language, that's one more than I did, but it just adds to my confusion on some things.

What do you think I should do/say? Should I just suck it up and power through this stuff? Is this stuff is very easy to understand and I'm just a fucking dumbass?",26Jul2018,1

394,"Some background so you guys better understand the situation. My dad is college educated with a Masters. He had been working the same stable job for almost 2 decades, until the company got sold and consequently he was laid off at the ripe age of 52. 

This happened almost a year and a half ago. Immediately after he was laid off he started interviewing at other companies. With his background and skills it would seem that he'd find another job in no time. However for one reason or another he kept getting turned down. He even started applying to low paying hourly jobs and they'd still turn him down. Eventually he landed a contract position, working in customer service, getting paid less than half what he's used to making. While all this was happening he was pursuing his dream of real estate. Along with applying to jobs he'd study real estate, state laws, etc. on the side and got his license. Even though money wise the family is going down hill, I still had faith in him because he was very driven and was always optimistic. 

Fast forward one year and the contract position that helped the family scrape by (along with my mother's income) was terminated. They didn't keep him on board because the company hires mainly contract workers to fill their positions and as soon as a year approaches on the employees' contract they terminate them and ask them to apply a few months later (kinda scummy if you ask me). However, he started applying to jobs again and still keeps getting rejected and if anyone bites it's a job with over an hour commute for $15-18 hourly. 

I've started to worry because the spark he had 4 months ago isn't there anymore. He's been completely unemployed for 3 months now and it's very sad to see him in this state. He doesn't do anything and seems to have given up for the most part. My mom tells me that he just naps for most the day and listens to music really loudly at night... As if he's just regressing in age. The only income he brings in is the occasional house he sells.

For some reason, he can't seem to get in to any company with pay that is even 70% of what he used to make. 

His last bit of hope was working for this large corporation doing a job similar to his old work for very good money. After his interview it seemed positive and he had been banking on getting that position. He felt so good about it that he pretty much stopped applying everywhere else, until as of two weeks ago. 

Whenever I talk to him now it's very depressing. He seems very broken and has zero confidence when he speaks anymore. Whenever we speak I always try and motivate him, but it does almost nothing. He just seems to have given up all hope and is just praying that he get's this job with the large company.

I just got a text message from him a few minutes ago and he said he didn't get the job. I'm not sure what to even say. I'm worried he's going to go even deeper into this depression he's been in to the point where it's going to affect the family both financially and psychologically. 

I'm in my early 20's just graduated college with a Software degree a year ago. I'm working my first job that doesn't pay well, but I'm in a good position with good people and importantly I'm learning a LOT. But now I'm considering quitting that job to work at a larger company so i can make more money and support my parents financially if need be. I don't want to do this because like i mentioned I feel I'm in a really good company right now, but if that's what needs to be done then I'm for it. 

However, on my dad's side, how can I help him psychologically? I don't want him to be this depressing, low confident shell of a man he once was. I fee l that he can still bounce back because his self esteem wasn't this low even a year ago. Please any advice would be appreciated. ",26Jul2018,1
395,"I am 14 years old and I guess this can just be me being edgy, but I feel that my mother is being a attention hog and kind of a bitch. It isn’t serious and I am very glad to be living the life I am, but my mom has recently been getting mad over silly things and acting like her opinion is the only one that exists and any other answer is wrong. Me and my brother have a list of chores to get done during the day, and they are fairly easy.(things like vacuuming and cleaning windows and such). She is in good health and is a generally happy person, but any conversation where I want to express my thoughts she seems to get mad and it confuses me why. I am aware it can just be my teenage “hormones” but she gets mad at my father when he does simple things like running the dishwasher.

In the last couple of days, he got angry with me when I tried to address an issue with him and started yelling. The issue was around the help I am always providing with little to no benefit for myself. He kind of made me feel guilty for even bringing it up in the conversation.

I am at a point now where I am loosing interest in maintaining this social group, however, there is still a high chance to cross paths. Typically, I don’t have a lot of friends and I’m unsure if it is worth the time or effort. 

Lastly, I am fearful of how he will respond to me cutting ties and I know he could do a lot of damage to my life. Honestly, I am sick of feeling like a fear slave and want to move on without repercussions.

402,"I've been best friends with these 2 guys since we met in 4th grade (I'm almost 18 now) and we've always got along pretty well.  However, within the past year or so they've been keeping secrets from me and they even talk about them in front of me like ""Should we tell him?"" ""No let's not tell him"". 

I'm a pretty self conscious guy.  I find I look more like 13 years old than 17 and I'm not the most outgoing either.  I have not had a girlfriend yet which doesn't really help my self confidence either.  Anyways, my friends know this, they are completely aware of it.   

About 5-6 days ago I received a DM on instagram from a friend of one of my best friends whom I've never met before.  She said ""Hey want to talk? I want to get to know you better"" so naturally I went and checked out who it was and she just wasn't my type.  I was still pumped that somebody was actually interested enough in me to send me a message.  I had never faced a situation where I had to reject someone and I was stressed over coming up with how to do it nicely without hurting her feelings.  I was actually on my last day of a vacation when I got the message and I spent the whole day trying to figure out a nice way to let her down.  I even asked my 2 friends for help and they didn't know what to say either.  It was over a day and a half before I actually responded to her message and I was satisfied with how I did it.

Skip to today.  My 2 friends and I were hanging out.  We spoke about the DM a bit and I even told them how stressed out I was trying to come up with a response.  A bit later one turns to the other and says ""Should we tell him?"" and I'm sitting there clueless.  One turns to me and says with a smile on his face ""It was a prank!"" and I still confused say ""what was?"" And he goes ""Someone who you thought liked you didn't really like you"".  And I'm just sat there not knowing how to react.  Then he continues and says something like ""Jake (me) thinks he's hot and gets all the girls"".  

Like a prank is supposed to be funny right?  How is this in any way funny?  I don't even know what to tell them.  I don't know what to do.  I think it was extremely childish.  There's no joke in it like ""Haha! You thought that somebody would actually be interested in you?"" How is that a prank?

B,

I had no fucking idea that someone could try drugs literally just once and then go on a bender from that point on and  just totally nope out of their lives. Sounds like some bullshit Penguin Publications bullshit to me, but here we are. 

I used to be there for you. It was something that I loved so much about you. You were honest, real and raw about everything. I have always admired that about you. If you were going through something, you would be so upfront about it to the ones you love. You would clearly state your problem or concern in real time. You would allow your tribe to rally around you and shit would get done and fixed,from breakups and fights with your sisters to your dad’s death,  we always figured it out together and you always landed on your feet. We made a great team. We kept shit together. 

I wish I knew what started all of this and why you are so fucking adamant on keeping it going. I know you see what you are doing, and how it is hurting your true friends and family. You are pushing everyone away.. I don’t know how to help at this point or if it is even worth it. Do we get into another argument where you deny what is going on, do I pretend like I don’t care, do I just try to forget about you and hope that you will eventually get your shit together, or do I just ignore all of this and pretend like none of it is happening, like nothing has changed? Like it is normal to see your car at the fucking drug house while I am on my way to work each morning... 

I get it, you don’t want to be around me, and you feel guilty about it because you don’t want me to see you like this. If I don’t see that you have a problem, the problem doesn’t exist. 

We have been best friends for so long. Then one day I realized that we aren’t. You are hiding things from me, dodging my calls, texting back days later with a bullshit excuse as to why you didn’t see the text in the first place…. You can’t bullshit a bullshitter. I do the whole bit where you don’t open the text but you read the banner, they don’t see that you opened it and then you buy some time to come up with an excuse as to why you didn’t see it- dead phone, lost phone, no reception, phone has been acting funny for a few days now… I’m a pro at it. It helps though that you don’t upload Instagram stories when you are trying to ghost someone.

Your mom told me not to give up on you, but I really don’t know how to not give up at this point. Should I keep trying to make plans with you, fully expecting you to come up with an epic excuse as to why we must reschedule? Your mom owes me 20 bucks BTW, I bet her that you wouldn't show last night.  

110%-real talk, our little theater date that is supposed to happen this Sunday, it is a pretty shitty date for me. I am supposed to be camping, but if  I try to reschedule with you it just wont happen… because that is how it is now with you. If you don’t have any other options whatsofuckingever, you might follow through with something, but you will bring your shitty new friends of course, just to make sure you don’t have an actual meaningful interaction with the people who love you. Keep everything as shallow as possible… 

You will probably have some insane reason as to why the universe is stopping you from getting to the play anyway, an excuse that has absolutely NOTHING to do with you… You will tell yourself that seeing in on closing night is better anyway… then closing night will come around and you won’t be there… I shouldn't honestly even expect you to show...

I worry that you will have a freak out from staying up for so many days and get in a car accident and kill someone. I worry that you all will run out of money and move on to the cheaper, harder shit. I worry that instead of this being the end of a phase, it is only the beginning of you following in your father’s footsteps and end up 6 feet under. I’m terrified to be honest. 

$$$ called me this morning around 7:30 and I honestly expected him to tell me that you were in an accident or OD’ed or something. 

I am never going to send this letter because I am afraid that you will read it and tell me exactly what I want to hear and then you will just cut me out completely because you don’t want to make a change (like our last little baby conversation we had about this), or that you will freak the fuck out and think that I am being dramatic because you aren’t willing to admit that you have a problem, and never speak to me again. I do not see you taking any of this for what it is because you are in denial.

Your druggy friends are even telling me that you are spiraling out of control. It may be projection on their part, i don't know what the fuck to believe but the fact that your druggy friends are coming to me in the first place is a situation that I never thought that I would be in. 

Either way it won’t end well. These last few months I feel like I have been trying to break down the Berlin Wall all by myself with just my bare hands. 

Maybe you will snap out of this, or maybe things will get worse and then you will see how you are fucking your life up. Not that I want things to get worse for you, but I can not see that they could get any better the way things stand right now. ",26Jul2018,2

Mid 20's
Typically Data Analyst
Well rounded resume
Typical salary ~31k

I've recently started at this, *very* family owned business at a very low wage (30 day probation), without any form of benefits. It's *supposed* to be a good opportunity to get into the medical industry however it's just shaping out to be a dead end. And now on top of that I'm also not to keen on what a supervisor of mine asked me today.

The supervisor of mine asked if I could take out the trash from our office because, ""If there is a male working here, I refuse to take out my trash"". And this just struck me as the most bs logic I've ever heard of. 
Now to be fair she later noted that because I'm the last to leave, and since I already lock the place up (1 week in I was given the pass code), I could due it twice a problem, no problem. And I agree, I'm totally fine with it but if she wouldn't have notated whats swinging between my legs I probably wouldn't be so ticked. As in to a fact put my ability to due something has anything to do with my gender it, and that if I don't she it just plays into a typical gender role responsibility.
And again it's just a few bins, she didnt note the bathroom room though and that's where I would say it crosses the lines. But just seemed like a purely awful way of requesting something that was never to be understood as ""my job duty"". I did tell her no problem/I'd do it.

So overall should I be looking for a better opportunity somewhere else? Should I have reacted differently to my supervisor's remarks? Am I overreacting?

I'm ashamed and extremely embarrassed to admit that I've photoshopped pictures of myself online in the past. I was younger (in my teens) when I did so and I photoshopped and edited my body to look better and more curvy. I'm not internet famous or anything, but I did have a decent amount of followers on my account (more than the average person, around two to three thousand). I'm embarrassed my friends and family seem it, and I don't want to face or see them anymore because of it. The fact that anyone could've screenshotted and uploaded my embarrassing pictures somewhere online under #photoshopfail is really getting to me. I'm afraid someone I know in real life will see them on a photoshop fail account someday, or possibly a future employer. What if I can't get a job in the future because of this? The shame and embarrassment I feel is indescribable. 

All I've been doing for the past few weeks is staying in bed and sleeping all day because of how stressed out this is making me. I can't leave my room or house, I'm having panic and anxiety attacks and I can't eat. I know I can't go back in time and un-post the photos I've posted, and I really don't know what to do.

411,"I can't fulfill my sexual or emotional desires which are very strong. I want to be intimate just once, I want to just know what it feels like just once. That's all. I'm not asking for a relationship or marriage, I just want to be one on one with someone that I'm happy to be around (and my standards have dropped extremely low at this point). Even just once. I've never had sex just normally, one on one. Never been on a real date before.

And that's the goal but it doesn't come easy. It won't happen for a really long time for a loooot of personal reasons; yeah I have to work on myself blah blah blah, etc. And maybe someday it'll happen just not NOW. That's what's driving me crazy especially because societies romanticize ""love"". Sex, relationships, women (who are uninterested or not single); it's everywhere. At school, at work. In movies, video games, music, art. When I hang out with friends or with family. Everything, everywhere.

I'm constantly reminded that I'm unable to have that. I'm unable to concentrate on my life and I get angry every day. I just want to scratch that itch even just a little and then be able to live for a while after having experienced it just once in my life but no matter how hard I try I can't even get anything at all, even just once. 

Nothing works. When I do meet women in real life they're never single or they're uninterested. And yeah I've met women who were in a relationship that I've had great chemistry with. Damn good chemistry but they're not single, so I stay away.

I've tried dating or sex websites (legit ones, just trust me on that), I've politely messaged women of any age, height, weight, race, etc and there are zero takers and I've noticed the male to female ratio is a complete joke. I think the male to female ratio statistics of r/r4r also seem to parallel real life and that's especially how I feel how difficult and frustrating all of this is. ",26Jul2018,0
412,"So I have this friend I’ve known since high school. Let’s say her name is Jenny. Jenny was always a bit weird—talked a little too much, didn’t really pick up on social queues, never did her homework, stuff like that. But she was very nice and I like her. We were reasonably close in high school—neither of us were very popular and we were both kind of of “lost”. We’d hang out a lot during school hours but didn’t really make an effort to see each other on weekends or whatever and after graduation we slowly stopped talking.

Now fast forward four years and around this past November I randomly reached out to her, curious about how she’s doing. She clearly wasn’t doing well and still isn’t. She’s struggling financially, has dropped out of college, and is in a very unhealthy relationship among other things. I knew I couldn’t save or anything but I figured that she needed a friend and just being there would help her out.

Except over the past few months she has gotten exceedingly attached to me in a way that stresses me out. She constantly tells me that I’m her best and only friend, wants to get matching tattoos, asks me to come to her place multiple times a week (even though she lives 2 hours away), and even has brought up the idea of me not just having a threesome but BEING IN A THROUPLE with her and her BF. I’ll sometimes wake up to upwards of 7 consecutive texts, all from her. Sometime these texts are her talking about the emotional abuse her boyfriend puts her through/ talking about how hopeless she is in life. It’s scary and exhausting and is starting to take a toll on my own mental health. I’ve told her to try seeing a therapist but she dismisses that idea. 

And here’s the kicker—I don’t even particularly enjoy her company now a days. In the 2 or 3 times we have hung out since reconnecting she talked nonstop about herself, barely allowing me to speak and not even asking me how I am. We don’t really have anything in common anymore. I’ve thought about phasing her out but feel like she needs me and like that would be incredibly selfish and horrible. Idk.

TL;DR- An old friend of mine is a mess and extremely attached to me. This attachment is stressing me out and negatively impacting my life.  ",26Jul2018,1

415,"So I became friends with my neighbor. She lives 2 doors down from me. We started to hang out at each other’s house a few times and would bring over whatever we were cooking sometimes. This lasted about 3 weeks.  

She’s 40, lives alone and her parents bought her the house and she works for them but only maybe 2 days a week so she’s always home.

One day she invites me to go have lunch at a some what fancy restaurant.  After we start eating she tells me she lost her wallet yesterday. So I say no problem, I’ll pay for lunch.  Then she said she only has $30 for the whole week and her parents won’t be back from vacation til next week. So I offer to lend her $100 and she can pay me back when her parents get back.  She doesn’t text me or anything for a month. One day she replies to my text and says she owes me money. I tell her I’ll be home by 4pm.  I text her when I get home. No reply for another 3 weeks.  When she does text me she asked me what I was up to and said her and her friend are super hungry and don’t even have a dollar.  I reminded her she still owed me $100 and she said she was gonna ask her mom for the money but forgot. I told her to go pick some fruit around the neighborhood. Then maybe 2 weeks later she texted me happy Mother’s Day and I said thanks. That’s the last time I talked to her.

I don’t expect to get my $100 back but I want to feel comfortable going for a walk with my son.  I live on the dead end so I have to walk past her house to go anywhere.

Hi r/Advice,
I’m seriously considering reporting the people who bullied me to my school. While I won’t say what state I’m from, the consequences for bullying are extremely severe, so I doubting whether or not I should do it. 

Some important points to consider:
-The events outlined in my last post caused me a lot of depression, self-confidence issues, and some, tendencies, which are very hard on my mental health.

-By the time school starts back up again, it will be nearly a year since I broke contact with this group.

-As of currently, I have broken completely away from this group and any tendencies I had.

-I have records of written messages that showcases some of the bullying that took place.

-I live in the USA.

-Some of the bullying did include my religion and sexuality.

-I have not recieved any therapy besides talking to some very close friends who I trust with my life.

So r/Advice, what do you think?

427,"So I (26F) met him (29M) about two years ago on tinder. We instantly hit it off and became close. I suffer from social anxiety and it’s hard for me to talk to new people, but it seemed so natural with him. Being with him made me so happy. Soon I realised I was in love with him, and although he never said it, i was pretty sure he loved me too, considering his actions at the time. 

For two months, everything was great, we used to see each other often. But then one day he suddenly stopped texting, and disappeared for a week without telling me anything. I kept calling him, and after one week he finally got back to me and told me that he sometimes goes into a shell and doesn’t want to talk to anyone, and that he still wants to see me. I was extremely happy that he was back, and to me it was all that mattered. I tried to give him all the space he needed. He said he’ll try his best to make things work between us. 

Soon after, he disappeared again. This time, I waited, but he didn’t come back. A month later he told me that although he wants to be with me, he can’t make it work, and since he doesn’t want to hurt me in the future when things get serious, it’s better to end things now. I tried to make him stay but it didn’t work. 

A year passed, and I felt I was over him. We weren’t connected on any social media, and had zero contact, so we were like complete strangers. However, he messaged me again. And just seeing his name in my phone brought all the feelings back. We started talking again, and then started seeing each other, in the beginning as friends, but then became physically intimate. 

It’s been six months now, and we’re better friends than we’ve ever been before. However, he doesn’t talk about his feelings at all, and doesn’t like it when I talk about mine. I have to keep everything in. I have no idea what he thinks, or what he wants from this, or why he came back after all this time. And I think that even if I try to ask him, he’ll go away again. And I don’t want that. 

At the same time, I want to tell him how I feel. It’s extremely difficult for me to keep these feelings inside, especially when we get intimate. It takes up all my willpower to not tell him anything and appear emotionally detached, just like he is. I don’t want to scare him away, but I want to show how much I love him.

432,"Title: Stuck in a career I don’t enjoy


This is my first actual word post so bare with and thank you for the read and or comment if you leave one. 

Wow, where to start. So the issue I have here is that when I graduated high school I had a career in mind that I wanted to go to which was gaming art since I have a talent in art and somewhat passion for art. But unfortunately I couldn’t afford to go to the school I desired and the employment rate for game art is only 8 - 10%. Let alone the salary for an average artist is significantly low and not a very livable wage. I was devastated and it still hurts that I couldn’t till this day.

It came crunch time to go to college and I had to make a decision on what I wanted to do for as a career. Yet.....art was the only thing I wanted. I thought planes were neat so I thought I’d try out flying them. Was too expensive, so i decided to fix them and become a mechanic. It was neat at first while I started but realized midway I didn’t like it but I had no choice but to follow through with it. 

I finally graduated and eventually snagged a decent job with the degree and license I have. Again, it was cool at first but...I’m not enjoying it. Most days I dread going to work and doze off to what could’ve been while I’m working. Yet I can’t afford to quit or change my career at the moment either. I have bills to pay and I need food on the table. Heck, sometimes scraping buying just with my paycheck alone. 

I don’t know what to do and I don’t want my life to go to waste working at job tirelessly that I don’t enjoy. 

I have many interests including my talent but I’ve been second guessing it a lot worrying I’ll have the same result as my current career issue. I’ve even thought about asking places of interest if I could intern once in a while if they would allow me to see if I enjoy it but I don’t think I’d have the time to due to work.

Now it has gone back to a little closer to normal than before in terms of texture, but it's so much less even about my head. It looks like I'm balding because it's fairly thin on the crown and on my temples and thicker on the sides. Under normal circumstances, I'd accept the fact that I was balding and take the steps to getting rid of all of my hair. However, given what I've gone through, I don't want to be bald again just yet. I also don't want to have to go through yet another physical change and have people comment on my appearance again and ask if I have cancer again (I shaved my head before chemo last year) only to realize I'm just balding 😔. What should I do? Should I just shave my head or just deal with it?",26Jul2018,1
436,"So my girlfriend and I have been dating for almost 3 years. We’ve had our ups and downs but we have been in a good place for a long time and she has remained faithful and honest to me. I’ve had my issues with drinking that has affected the relationship in the past but I’ve been sober for almost a year now and she constantly tells me how I have been so good to her and the best thing to happen to her. Anyway she went to a music festival this weekend with her best friend that I have never liked in the first place. She treats her like shit and makes her take care of her while she gets drunk all the time while finding guys to sleep with while my girlfriend does all the heavy lifting. This time my she got blackout drunk with her friend whilst, of course, her friend was trying to find a guy she met online. This guy had a friend who my girl said kept trying to dance with her while she kept pushing him away repeating that she has a boyfriend but he kept grabbing saying he didn’t care. After all of this she says she barely remembers flashes of the night but remembers waking up in this guy’s house feeling disgusting that she cheated and wishing she was with me the whole time. She said she couldn’t bring herself to go to the second day of the festival and just came home. She’s positive they had sex and she doesn’t know if she eventually consented or not or what the guys name was or what he looked like. She told me a few days later saying that she feels sexually assaulted and that she needs my support but i was so mad and still am at her for succumbing to her friend yet again and this time being irresponsible enough to let a guy sleep with her even if she didn’t cheat deliberately. I told her that she needs to leave and stay at her parents house for a few days and have zero contact with me. I feel guilty for being so mad at her and not being there for her but I’m also hurt and I can’t get the image of what she described out of my head. I can’t look at her body without thinking of somebody else inside her. My anxiety and emotions make me think that she isn’t my girl anymore because she let someone else take her. This is also the final straw for her friend having anything to do with my life and I know that as long as she is in hers bad things will keep happening but she isn’t willing to break ties with her to this day which makes me feel like I’m always below her. She said she will take what I said into consideration and try to put some distance between them but I’ve heard that before. I can’t ever forgive her best friend for letting a guy take advantage of my drunk girlfriend just so she could get some from the guy she just met. Am I wrong to take this break from her and shut her out when she said she feels alone, gross and that I’m the only thing that makes her feel safe? Should I give her 1 more chance even if I don’t know if I’ll be able to look at her the same? I need help with this.

PS regardless of me being pissed at her I know very well that that piece of shit took advantage of her and might have technically raped her but I do blame her for being irresponsible and getting into the situation in the first place.",26Jul2018,1

438,"Hi all! First post on Reddit here and looking for some advice. One of my best friends (28) is going through her first pregnancy and things are starting to get complicated. She’s about to enter her third trimester and will be hospitalized until she is ready to give birth. 

I am looking for gift ideas (books, activities, etc) to keep her spirits up and keep her occupied while in the hospital! 

I’m looking for both things she can do alone as well as when her friends and family spend time with her (also anything for her husband!).
TIA! ",26Jul2018,1
439,"He is usually a great guy but the past couple years he’s been taking testosterone to be more manly or whatever. Problem is that it makes him have a super short temper and he throws a fit about pretty much everything.

My whole family is against him taking it but when we try to talk to him about it he just yells and then leaves, we don’t know what to do and just want our old relaxed dad back.",26Jul2018,0
440,"Hello all, I am trying to find an application that sends me alerts based on my previous days actions. Here is my situation: On Day 1, I want to choose between two options. Option 1 is reading for 60 minutes; Option 2 is reading for 30 minutes. Then on Day 2, I want to receive one of three alerts based on what I chose the previous day. If I chose Option 1 on Day 1, then I do not want an alert on Day 2. If I chose Option 2 on Day 1, then I want the alert to read for 30 minutes on Day 2. If I chose neither option on Day 1, then I want the alert to read for 60 minutes on Day 2.

Does anyone know of an app for a Mac or iPhone that will let me input this process and send me reminders? Thanks",26Jul2018,1

What can i do to ease my fear?",26Jul2018,1
